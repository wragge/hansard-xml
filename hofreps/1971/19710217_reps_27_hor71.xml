            <para>- The statement made last night was necessarily brief since it was confined to a statement which had been foreshadowed as one relating to cuts in Commonwealth Government expenditure. I believe it covered that quite satisfactorily. The answer to the second part of the honourable member&#39;s question is that we do not propose to introduce a supplementary Budget. </para>

Will the Government give complete backing for the ANL&#39;s efforts to secure arrangements which will give the Line, as our national flag line, a more equitable share of the trade and at the same time lessen the virtual subsidy which the Line is paying to less efficient overseas operators? </para>

            <para>- 1  am not sure of the amount that the ANL is &#39;paying back&#39; to the Conference with which it is engaged in the Eastern Searoad Service, but certainly it is true to say that the ANL is able to carry more than the share which is allotted to it under the agreement of the Service. The  Chairman  of the ANL is proceeding to Japan to have discussions with other members of the Conference to see what can be done about the inclusion in the service of another ship also so that the ANL can obtain a better share of the trade. That is about all I can say at this point of time. I have no doubt that when the ANL has put its case to the Conference I will get a report in due course. </para>

In view of the fact that television has only recently been approved for many rural areas in Australia, particularly for the electorate of Kennedy where  13  of the  38  stations are to be provided, and because urban and provincial areas where so many other amenities are readily available have enjoyed this facility for many years, will the PostmasterGeneral assure the House that the installation of these stations will take place without delay and that there will be no question of colour television being installed at the expense of our areas? </para>

            <para>- I have made statements on a number of occasions in relation to the seventh Stage of the introduction of television which provides for  38  additional stations, mainly in the lesser settled areas of Australia. A number of these, as the honourable member has said, will be in his electorate. Recently the honourable member took part in the opening of the Mount lsa station. 1 understand that the Cloncurry station will be opened within the next  3  months and  I  believe ail the stations planned for the line between Townsville and Mount Isa will be in operation by the end of this calendar year.  I  have also noted that the Norseman station is expected to be opened around about April this year. This is an indication that the Australian Broadcasting Control Board and those responsible for the erection of the additional stations are hard at it trying to bring about the result we all hope for. As for colour television,  I  announced some short time ago that the Government at this point of time had not made a decision as to when colour television would be adopted and  I  indicated that at least  3  years notice would be given of it. The honourable member may be sure that the introduction of colour television whenever it does come will not interfere with the plans adopted in relation to black and white television. </para>

            <para>- In the current year the additions to revenue will be, 1 think, approximately $83m, but, of course, this has a progressive effect. First of all, it is not possible, except for a fairly short period, to estimate precisely the amount of extra revenue because there are a great many repercussions outside the 6 per cent increase in wages. But it will add substantially to Commonwealth revenue and also, almost offsetting that revenue, to the Commonwealth&#39;s immediate expenditure. This, of course, provides no extra resources whatsoever, lt is just a monetary phenomenon which, in the present circumstances, is most-, unfortunate.. </para>

              <para>- J think we have all learned with distress of the devastation in the Hunter River Valley, which is, of course, in the honourable member&#39;s electorate and also farther in the north west of New South Wales. Following these occurrences the Prime Minister indicated to the Premier of New South Wales that in 1970-71, this year, the Commonwealth would meet any expenditure in excess of $5m by the State which resulted from abnormal seasonal conditions and other factors beyond its control affecting State finances. This, of course, will include carry-on loans for farmers and the restoration of certain public assets, particularly roads and things of that nature, which are beyond the capacity of local authorities to meet. In addition to meeting these payments the Commonwealth Government also will provide for the relief of personal hardship on a SI for $1 basis with the State Government. I think that these arrangements are considered reasonably generous by the New South Wales Government and I only express my personal distress at the circumstances which have necessitated this action. </para>

            <para>- I was just saying to my colleague that I have no idea. T am sure that the honourable member will bear with me when he realises that 1 have held this portfolio for about a week and I do not know all the details of it. However, I am able to say, in respect of the design rules, that whatever, the situation put forward by the honourable member the facts are that we are receiving the greatest co-operation from the motor companies themselves in implementing the design, rules. One factor that affects this matter is that it seems that Australian people, who should be very conscious of the problems of road safety considering that we have- one of the worst accident records per capita in the world, are not keen to pay more for a car because it is safer. The necessity for this must be brought home to them. </para>

            <para>- The principal factor is that most of the evidence from countries which have banned television advertising makes it perfectly clear that this has had no effect on the consumption of cigarettes in those countries. I should like to add that the Government&#39;s efforts have been directed towards achieving control of television advertising so that such advertising does not take place at times during which young children are watching television programmes. To that end my departmental officers have been conducting discussions with the tobacco companies, the Broadcasting Control Board and others affected towards revising the voluntary code for cigarette advertising on television, both in relation to its style and its content. This includes the hours during which television cigarette commercials are broadcast. They are looking also at the question of extending this code from television to radio. The discussions are almost concluded and I expect to be able to make an announcement on the subject soon. </para>

            <para>- I am sorry to disappoint the honourable member who interjected but a great deal of progress has been made in the subject raised by the honourable member who asked the question. The House will recall that the Prime Minister announced in a policy speech last year that the Government would set up the Bureau of Transport Economics. Already <inline font-weight="bold">Mr R.</inline> W. Cole, an economist, has been appointed director of that organisation. At present <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cole</inline> is interviewing people with a view to filling his establishment which will consist of engineers, people skilled in transport operations, statisticians and the like. These people will act in the way the honourable member expects. They will study the coordination, rationalisation and efficiency of transport throughout Australia. One has to recognise that a body of this nature, able to look at the whole scene of transport across Australia, has not existed previously, although there have been many separate State and Commonwealth bodies which have made a part-time study in this field. I am sure that after the Bureau has been operating for a time it will become a nationally respected body which will add a lot to transport efficiency and will help in reducing the cost of transport throughout Australia. </para>

This will mean that a family with an income of up to $46.50 a week will receive a full subsidy from the Government for its health insurance; those with an income of between $46.50 and $49.50 will receive a two-thirds subsidy; and those with an income of between $49.50 and $52.50 will receive a one-third subsidy. These arrangements will apply from 1st March. </para>

Is he aware that some large Victorian private hospitals have substantially increased their charges for intermediate and private wards in recent weeks, in some cases by more than 25 per cent?

It is the practice of my Department to deal speedily with applications by the funds for new hospital tables to cover increased hospital charges. I say advisedly that the Department deals wilh such matters as speedily as possible because, under the National Health Act, statutory obligations are placed on the Department and on the Registration Committee to examine the viability of any proposals that are made by a fund. I will under take to find out whether the funds have made proposals in respect of these new charges and do what I can to hasten the process of having them approved. </para>

            <para>- Every country has a right to its own immigration policy and a duty and responsibility to ensure that that policy is administered in the best interests of its own people. Our own policies and programmes have emerged from our history and in response to our country&#39;s needs. Indeed, as the Prime Minister indicated during the last sittings of the House in 1970, we do not wish to see repeated in Australia the tensions and hostilities which do characterise some other parts of the world. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The overriding objective of Australia&#39;s immigration policy is to ensure the continuing development of a cohesive and homogeneous community, well integrated and harmonious, without persisting divisions or disunity. If 1 may put that in the negative sense our objective is to avoid the creation within our community of permanent minority groups and self -perpetuating enclaves which may be resistant to integration even in the long term. </para>
          <para>Sometimes it is believed that this objective entails a policy which excludes persons of other than European descent. It certainly does not, although it does mean an attitude of prudent caution, taking account not only of our own experience but also of the experience of other countries in accepting for permanent settlement large numbers of peoples with extremely different racial origins, backgrounds and attitudes. </para>
          <para>So far as the question of settlement of non-European persons and persons of mixed descent is concerned the annual rate of .settlement of non-European persons coming to Australia is some 3,500 and the annual rale of settlement of persons of mixed descent is approximately 6,000, a total of 9,500 persons, lt may be felt by some within the Australian community, or outside of it. that our evolutionary policy is overcautious. But the Government believes that we have a duty to learn patiently because the effects of this policy have a very far reaching application on the whole of the Australian community in its life, work and general attitudes. </para>

            <para>- In view of the Prime Minister&#39;s answer to the honourable member for Macquarie in which he implied that there would be no increase in pensions m least until the presentation of the next Budget, does the right honourable gentleman agree that the purchasing power of the pension has been reduced since the pension was increased by the miserable sum of 50c following the Budget presented last August? If this is so, how can the Prime Minister justify his refusal to grant a further increase in pensions when so many people are finding it so difficult to maintain a decent standard of living on so small a pension? </para>

            <para>- A rise in the consumer price index, which is the bench mark which has always been taken in these matters, does indicate, as it has indicated in past years, that there has been a reduction in the buying power of pensions since the last rise. The last rise in the last Budget was sufficient to bring the buying power of the pension back into line with what it was the year before that, this taking place after 2 Budgets in which the buying power of the pension had been considerably raised in a period of time by, I believe, more than it has ever been raised before in a similar period of time. </para>

It will not mean that the standard of treatment available through the Department will be in any way affected. Lastly, no hardship will be caused to any of the clients of the Department who receive payments from the Department or to those who have claims that will be processed during the next 4 months. </para>

            <para>- I ask a question of the Minister for Primary Industry. In respect of the SI 00m rural reconstruction scheme, is it a fact that a farmer must have 40 petcent equity in his property before he is eligible for assistance? If this is so, is the scheme designed for the elite, thus denying any assistance to a large proportion of soldier settlers besides thousands of other primary producers who could not be classed as uneconomic? Will there be an upper limit to the assistance? </para>

            <para>- The basis of the operation of the scheme in each of the States is to be determined by the State administering authorities. In Tasmania, as in each of the other States, the State Government will prescribe the conditions of assistance and determine who will be eligible for assistance. But it is not intended that assistance should be provided only to those whom the honourable member describes as the elite. Indeed, the basic aim of the scheme is to help those who can be re-established in operating profitably and to the benefit of the community. It is for that reason that the scheme is being tied in with a scheme aimed at extending land holding sizes, so that persons who are to be given assistance might have some prospect, if their area is too small or if they are otherwise in a position of disadvantage perhaps because they are soldier settlers or for some other reason, and so they might have a larger and more profitable enterprise. But the details of the workings of the scheme in each State are to be determined by the respective State governments but, as I explained, it is certainly not intended that assistance should be available only to those who have a certain equity in a property. </para>

            <para>- The Government, against the context of the  Budget introduced in August 1970, indicated that the migrant inflow target for the present financial year would be 180,000. The objective is based on 3 major indices: Firstly, our appreciation of Australia&#39;s national needs and objectives; secondly, the availability of suitable settlers and thirdly, our capacity to integrate effectively those who come here. Immigration programmes must, of course, always be responsive to changing circumstances, and against the circumstances recently outlined to this House by the Prime Minister the immigration programme has in fact been modified. So that at the present time the revised objective for migrants coming to Australia in this financial year is some 170,000 persons. </para>

          <para>I might indicate in passing that the assisted migration programme has been flowing strongly from almost every part of the world with the exception of Great Britain where our operation has been greatly inhibited because of the postal strike in that country. But during the course of the past 6 months there has been a down-turn in the unassisted component of the total programme so if the total figure were to have been achieved it would have required the supplementary estimates consistent with the practice of recent years. Supplementaries will not be sought on that basis and therefore, for the reasons I have mentioned, in responding to the need for public sector restraint and the circumstances iti which the country now finds itself, the programme for this year will be some-1 70.000 persons. </para>

            <para>- .1 am aware of the tragic road accidents that have taken place on the Eyre Highway but I am also aware that, under the last Commonwealth Aid Roads Agreement, South Australia was given specific grants - in one case $13. 67m - for rural arterial roads. A supplementary grant of $9m was made on top of that. The South Australian Government has within its power and jurisdiction the right to take the decision to seal the 300 miles of the Eyre Highway or to commence sealing it. I notice that on the Western Australian side of the border the Western Australian Government has managed to seal its section of the road, and while it is to be deplored that these road accidents do take place I think that the Commonwealth Government has been fairly generous to the South Australian Government and it ought to be up to the South Australian Government to upgrade the priority of the sealing of that road against other demands. </para>

I know there are a good many trade commissioners over there. We do sponsor and support trade missions to various parts of the world, including Europe, to foster the export of Australian goods. I am conscious of the letter which the honourable member wrote to me in relation to the possibilities of exporting fat lamb to France and I have brought this request to the attention of the  Chairman  of the Australian Meat Board and asked him to look at it. But there are trading difficulties with the European countries. We are trying to minimise these in the course of negotiations but they are awkward ones to overcome. </para>

              <para>- I may say that the interjection is not part of the answer. I waited to hear what it was to see whether it would fit in, but it does not. The position is that this matter is still under examination. In relation to Sydney (KingsfordSmith) Airport the honourable member has no doubt seen the report on aircraft noise which was recently released by the Minister and no doubt the honourable member is relatively pleased with the findings in that report. However, I will see that the attention of the Minister is drawn to the remarks of the member. </para>

            <para>-I direct my question to the Prime Minister. At the recent Premiers&#39; Conference was it indicated that there may be a necessity to restrict State works programmes because of inflationary pressure? Was it further indicated that this may well lead to a reduction in the building of schools and hospitals? In view of the decision of State electors at a recent State election will the Prime Minister now give an assurance that there will be no such restriction? </para>

            <para>- Definitely not. I will give no such assurance whatsoever. When we met at the Premiers&#39; Conference before we sat around in a situation where it was perfectly clear that one of the causes of pressure in the economy was the demand by governments for building construction. It is quite clear, and I believe it has been made clear by me to the nation, that one of the matters that needs to be done is for governments not to engage so heavily io building construction in an endeavour to be sure that the price of building construction does not rise to a point where it would be half as much again as it is now. Of course there is a necessity for governments when they are not going to have all the money they want - and no government ever does - in circumstances such as ours to endeavour to see that the public demand for construction particularly is not increased. This I believe to be in the interests of Australia. So I repeat what I said at the beginning: I will give no such assurance whatever. </para>

              <para>- lt will be of benefit to the House for the- information to be made available in answer to the question so that the House may know the answer and the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition may know it at the earliest possible moment. The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition referred to a question which had earlier been asked in another place by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> concerning the alleged blackmarketing of Australian military equipment in Vietnam. I had answered that question by indicating that the normal procedures of the Services were designed to make sure that this did not happen and that 1 had been advised of no evidence that indicated that a problem existed. The  Deputy  Leader then referred to some charges laid against Australian soldiers some time ago who had been summarily punished and dealt with by the Army. The characteristics of the charges against the soldiers concerned were substantially different, because they were dealing in luxury goods and not military equipment. Therefore the question was not connected to the earlier question asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe.</inline></para>

          <para>I think that the action taken by the Army at the time indicates that the Army, as do the other Services, not only frowns upon these activities but also takes quite stringent action if there is any evidence of this sort of thing occurring in the Australian Forces. If the Deputy Leader of the Opposition or anyone else had any evidence of trading of a kind that ought not to take place and which they believed should be investigated it would certainly be investigated. </para>

            <para>- The matter of pre-embarkation instruction in English for migrants was raised in this debate last night and I would like to state just what the Government is doing in this regard. In Europe the Inter-governmental Committee for European Migration arranges classes and correspondence instruction in countries where ICEM operates from funds allocated by the Australian Government. In 2 countries, Belgium and the Netherlands, the immigration authorities conduct a limited programme with technical assistance from ICEM. In countries where ICEM is not operating the Department of Immigration is responsible for preembarkation language instruction. This is provided in the following countries: Turkey, Greece, Italy, Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, Finland and Yugoslavia. Consideration is also being given to the appointment of departmental language training supervisors to Paris with responsibility for Spain and, in due course, Portugal, and to Stockholm with responsibility for Norway, Finland and Iceland. Of course, instruction is given on ships and intensive instruction courses are provided once the migrant arrives in this country. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I want to mention something closer to my electorate. For many years many teachers at Government and Catholic schools have had a problem teaching English to non-English speaking migrant children. In the main this has been usually at primary level and to a lesser degree in secondary schools in areas where there are large migrant populations. I have a number of these in the Holt electorate. It is not uncommon for 60 or more non-English speaking migrant children to commence a school year at primary school with little knowledge of the English language. Naturally this presents many problems for the teaching staff and this matter was raised with me as a former member of State Parliament on a number of occasions. What the schools wanted mainly were trained teachers for teaching English. It is only in the last year or so that State Government authorities have accepted, in principle anyway, that there has been a problem in some schools. However, State authorities with their limited finances have not been able to come to grips with this problem. It is for this reason that the migrant education programme is welcomed as it will enable schools with large migrant intakes better to provide intensive instruction in English by teachers with special skills. </para>
          <para>The special provisions in this Bill - I again emphasise the payment of salaries of these special teachers in addition to teaching aids and so on, is a very progressive step forward by the Department of Immigration and will be a big factor in enabling migrant children to settle more quickly into their new environment. 1 carried out a survey of a number of government and independent schools in my electorate and all welcomed these new proposals in the Immigration (Education) Bill 1970. From my survey I was able to obtain some interesting statistics from a number of schools which have large migrant intakes. </para>
          <para>Speaking generally, approximately onethird of the children attending schools within, the electorate of Holt are children of migrant parents, and approximately one-half of these are from the United Kingdom. I want to refer to a few of the statistics which I received from the schools. The first one is the Dandenong technical school. In many cases children attending this school come from homes in which English is not the commonly used language. In some cases the children&#39;s own mastery of English is so weak that the teachers feel that this handicaps them in their subjects, and I do not think there is any doubt about that. It is noteworthy that these are all in the lower forms either because they have mastered English by the time they reach the higher forms or because they give up the struggle, leave school early and enter unskilled occupations because of lack of qualifications. lt is worth noting that the percentage of migrant children is higher in the upper forms. This may be because the migrant who is dissatisfied with life in his own country and has the initiative to travel halfway round the world to a new country has the drive and intelligence to appreciate the need for higher education. The figures at this school to which I am referring now are based on a total enrolment of 630 students. Out of a total enrolment of 630 children there are 246 children of migrant parents, which represents over 40 per cent of the total enrolment. Children of migrant parents whose native language was not English represent approximately 24 per cent of the total enrolment; children from homes where English is not the commonly used language represent approximately 20 per cent; children whose parents could not speak English fluently or write it represented 9 per cent; and children whose lack of English posed a handicap to their learn ing represented 3 per cent, which is a quite high figure. </para>
          <para>One of the biggest difficulties which teachers at the Dandenong technical school experienced was communicating with the parents of these migrant children, both from the simplest level of understanding why a child was absent from school to the matter of giving educational or vocational advice or counselling. The teachers suggested that one way the Government could assist was to provide trained teachers, and again I want to emphasise this point. I want to refer to another secondary school - the Springvale high school. Of a total enrolment of 835 students. 230 are children of migrant parents, and of those 230 students. 55 are having difficulty with English at their particular form level. Twenty-four of these students are in constant need of assistance, and some recent arrivals have no knowledge of English at all. The remaining 31 students are also in need of instruction. Speaking generally, the teachers at this school said that children of migrant parents measure up quite well academically with the Australian born child, but that many find their task made much harder by their struggle with English, particularly in some cases because of the habit, or insistence, of parents in speaking their native tongue in the home. This imposes quite a handicap on these children as they have to cope with 2 languages - English at school and their native tongue at home. Again, what the Springvale high school urgently needs is a trained teacher in. English. i could go on and refer quickly to other schools. At the Noble Park high school there are 300 migrant children out of a total enrolment of 1,000. Mainly they are the southern European children who are having the most difficulty with English at this school. I want to refer to St John&#39;s Regional College in Dandenong, which is an independent school. Of a total enrolment of 450, approximately 130 are children of migrant parents. The migrant children at this school do not encounter difficulties with English to any marked degree, although naturally there are exceptions. Those of Italian extraction&#34; generally seem to have more difficulty than the other migrant children.I have referred to secondary schools. 1 want to refer quickly to a few statistics regarding primary schools because these schools, in the main, encounter greater difficulties with migrant children speaking the English language than do the secondary schools. </para>
          <para>At the Dandenong South school there are 280 migrant children out of a total enrolment of 506, and of these 280, 105 are White Russian children. The principal of this school said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>New arrivals at this school have to be given an intensive course in English language skills until they can understand what the grade teacher is talking about. Obviously, these children cannot progress very far until a knowledge of basic English is gained. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>He went on to say: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Generally, no English is spoken at home. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Again this presents a great problem for these children because, as I have mentioned, they have to cope with 2 languages. I also refer to the Noble Park primary school. Out. of a total enrolment of 650, 200 are children of migrant parents. The principal of this school, in a letter, stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Once the English language is mastered migrant children can manage at an average level. This period varies with the age - the younger children assimilate fairly readily - the older children find the language barrier the cause of loneliness. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">She also stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It is difficult to help slow learners within the migrant group - I have taken Italian children who have been with us for 3 years who still have difficulty in coping at grade level. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The last school that I want to mention is the Dandenong West Primary School. Approximately 150 children from migrant parents are attending this school which has an enrolment of 600. At present 20 of these children have little or no English. Migrant children participate very eagerly in all sporting activities. They measure up well academically once the language difficulties are overcome. This seems to be the main problem. They cannot cope very well until they master the English language. </para>
          <para>I want quickly to summarise my remarks. In practically all of the schools that I have mentioned one of the most pressing problems with non-English speaking migrant children is that there is a complete lack of contact with their parents. Children returning home from school have to communicate in their native tongue and this imposes great stress on a young child who has to cope with 2 languages. Statistics obtained from the Dandenong Technical School show that only 30 per cent of parents from non-English speaking countries can speak English. Other schools show similar results. Many of the non-English speaking migrant children are at a distinct disadvantage with their parents conversing only in their native tongues. I am sure that one of the reasons for this is that they have never had an opportunity of readily mastering English. This is particularly so with women who do not have the same opportunities as men. 1 know that crash courses in English operate in most of the States. I have attended such a course in Canberra. Another is conducted at Enterprise, the migrant hostel in my electorate, butI am thinking mainly of the non-English speaking migrant women. </para>
          <para>To me there appears to be no reason why small classes could not be conducted in the home, local church hall or even infant welfare centre. If we want happy contented migrants it is essential that they have a good command of English. I should like the Minister to give further consideration to the provision of English lessons for migrants in such places as homes and church halls, I will explain quickly what I mean. Migrant women who are having difficulty with English are not anxious to attend large classes in public for various reasons, including embarrassment. They realise that they would have difficulty in coping in a large class and they have home commitments. Such women, however, are more inclined to attend a small private class for numbers between 5 and 10. Such a class was established last year in Doveton in my electorate at the local infant welfare centre where women could attend and leave their babies under the care of the infant welfare teacher. If we could foster more of these small classes this would be a good way of enabling the housebound wife to obtain a better understanding of the English language. This proposal, of course, could be implemented to some extent under the grant in aid scheme which is operating in some centres. </para>
          <para>Finally I want to list the main points which I trust will receive consideration. From my observations many Greeks, Italians, Yugoslavs and Turks are in need of intensive courses in English because, in the main, their children have to cope with 2 languages as little English is spoken in the home. Many of these migrants have no desire to learn English and they forbid the use of it in the home. One of the greatest difficulties is to communicate with the parents from the simple level of understanding why the child was absent from school to the matter of giving educational and vocational advice or counselling. </para>
          <para>Children who have migrated at secondary level sometimes have acute difficulties, particularly where parents do not speak English at home. These parents should be contacted by interpreters and given intensive training in the English language. This would ease considerably the burden on the children. It was interesting to note from the survey carried out among children in the Holt electorate that few retained their cultural talents. Perhaps greater opportunity should be given to schools to encourage children to retain their native culture. </para>

            <para>- I should like to make a number of points. Firstly I shall make some general points on the subject and, secondly, 1 shall deal with some of the questions that I would ask the Minister for Immigration <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> arising out of the Bill and the comments he made during his second reading speech. In some ways 1 suppose that I am unique in that I am probably the only member in this House who arrived in this country young enough to go straight into school and I was unable to speak English at the time. I do not think that the general problems which now face many migrant children faced me and therefore I would not claim any special expertise on the basis of my own antecedents. The only point I make here is that for that reason I probably have more contact with the migrant groups in the area I represent and in the area of Sydney generally and 1 know most of the problems with which they are faced. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I think that immigration too often is viewed on a statistical basis rather than on a human and sociological basis. Often the native borne Australian views it on a statistical basis and not from the migrants&#39; point of view. I should like to raise that point of view on a few issues. 1 am sure that the proposition which I should like to put forward is not novel, but basically there are 4 causes of difficulty for migrant children: Firstly, the question of education in a foreign language; secondly, the question of education in an alien culture; thirdly, the low income of the parents in many cases; and, fourthly, the concentration of migrants in relatively depressed urban areas with their depressed schools. </para>
          <para>In passing I should like to make the point to the Minister that when we speak about migrant education we are trying to deal with the special problems arising out of migrant education and we must not forget that about half of the migrant children are, in fact, English-speaking children, but they still put a terrific amount of pressure on our Stale education systems and on our private education systems. Even though they are English-speaking, nonetheless they make up large numbers, and from that point of view I should hope that now that the Minister has shown that money can be given by the Commonwealth Government to the education systems for specific purposes he will continue to do so and supply extra money. </para>
          <para>I do not think that there is any need to go into details on the question of the special problems facing these children because of their parents&#39; incomes when they first arrive in Australia. We are all aware of these. Basically we are dealing with students who come from another culture. They are faced with a different set of values and customs and often a new language. To refer to them as a &#39;problem&#39; is to do them an injustice. What we must do is to realise the problems that they are facing. They themselves are not the problem; they themselves are facing certain problems. lt is essential for us as human beings to realise the problems that they are facing. We have to assist these students to solve their problems. We have to assist them to gain an education and to understand though not necessarily believe Australian values and customs. I think it is important to press this. We do not necessarily need to make them believe in Australian values and customs, or what are generally pushed forward as Austraiian values and customs. We have to give them assistance in learning the English language. This is a fairly complex task. What we have to do is to explain to migrants what allegedly the average Australian considers to be Australian values and customs. Let us be quite clear on this. There is no more obvious place than this House in which to see that there are vast differences of opinion as to what are Australian values and customs on many issues. </para>
          <para>We have to understand and meet the needs of migrant children. This requires an understanding by us and by the education departments of their traditions, beliefs, values, attitudes and expectations. We have to understand that a migrant pupil often lives in a home that is quite different from that of an Australian pupil. This is the case anyway when a migrant child arrives here. We have to understand that the home of a migrant child is different in many significant respects from that of his fellow students or teachers. This by itself faces a migrant pupil with certain conflicts. I do not think it is necessary for me to go into the general argument as to the special tensions which arise in migrant homes between the parents and the children because of 2 different sets of values, 2 languages, and so on. &#91; think that we have all seen this problem: in any case those honourable members who have not can imagine the sort of problems that arise. I think it is an error to assume that all migrant children wanted to come here. Often their families had little choice because of economic pressure or political pressure in their homeland. Other families have come to Australia because of Australian publicity either from the Government or relatives already here. </para>
          <para>I think there is a generally accepted fallacy that things in Australia necessarily are better or more pleasant than in the country from which migrant families come. We may think so and a large proportion of them may think so  -  we hope they all think so. But it ain&#39;t necessarily so. 1 think that the Minister realises this. He has expressed implied criticism, for example, of our system of social services, when explaining the difficulties that we have in these days in obtaining migrants from many parts of Europe. Therefore it is quite clear that not every migrant is necessarily thankful for having been brought to this country. New students often have different ideas as to what is better or more pleasant. They do not necessarily agree with the majority in Australia as to what is better and more pleasant. </para>
          <para>I would now like to refer to the specific propositions that were put to us by the Minister when making his second reading speech. The first part of his speech with which I wish to deal is as follows:   . . with the growing emphasis upon air travel we will consider providing educational facilities in aircraft as circumstances permit. </para>
          <para class="block">I think this is just a gimmick. Surely this ls not likely to make any significant difference. What will the Department be able to teach these people during the course of a 1-day or 2-day trip in an aircraft? </para>

            <para>The short title - Immigration (Education) Act 1970 - indicates that the source of power for the Bill derives from the immigration provision in the Constitution. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I am pleased that the Minister raised this question because 1 think it shows quite clearly that this Government should also introduce similar types of legislation dealing with immigration (hospitals), immigration (mental hospitals), immigration (councils) and immigration (all kinds of issues). Apparently he believes - and 1 hope he is right - that under the immigration provisions of the Constitution money could be fed to areas such as the States and local government where extra money is needed. Let us be quite clear on this. The fact that we have increased our population bv immigration by a huge number of people has put terrific pressure on other areas of government and not just on education. </para>
          <para>The Minister for Immigration recently attended a summer school organised by the Institute of Political Science al which a number of people were critical of Australia&#39;s immigration programme. I could accept some of the criticisms but I was not prepared to accept others. The point I would like to make is that immigration after 21 3&#39;ears of extensive operation is coming into disrepute. A certain amount of anti-foreigner feeling is again developing in this country and is being used by certain people because of the extra pressure that is put on all kinds of facilities and services which have to be provided by State and local government authorities. These bodies cannot provide facilities because they have no money. The Commonwealth Government refuses to be involved in the question of mental hospitals; it refuses to be involved in the question of local government and says that it cannot supply money. Surely if the Minister really believes that the immigration programme ought to be continued, from the point of view of public relations, if from no other aspect, it should be possible to show that a certain amount of money is being given to the States and local government on the basis that it is money to reimburse them for extra costs due to the immigration programme. </para>
          <para>In paragraph (b) of sub-clause (I.) of clause 4 reference is made to citizenship education. 1 think this is an important point although we have to be very careful that we do not finish up with indoctrination. Earlier in this session the question of so-called citizenship education was raised by one of my colleagues - I cannot recall who it was - with reference to the Army. I hope we do not finish up with the type of citizenship education whereby only one point of view is put to people. I am not suggesting that this will happen because 1 assume thai the people who will be in charge of this education will be people who are normally attached to our education departments rather than Army officers who are selected to put forward the point of view of this Government rather than the point of view of many of its critics. When we are talking about citizenship education in the context of migrant education one of the points that should be considered at least is the question of instructing Australian children in the same schools and certainly in schools in areas where a large proportion of the migrant children come from one country, be it Italy, Greece or Turkey. Australian children in these schools should be instructed in the culture and history of the country from which the migrant children have come. This should have a twofold effect  -  I hope it would have thai effect.. On the one hand it would make it possible for Australian kids to understand some of the attitudes of the other children. Secondly - and I think that this is probably just as important - it would make the migrant child feel reason ably proud of his origin; it would not make him feel that he had a non-existent background. He would not feel that from the time he arrived in this country the only history would be British history and Australian history. He would feel that there was still history concerning his country of origin. I think that the question of morale is an important point to raise. </para>
          <para>I am one of those who oppose the proposition which is often put up by many migrant groups that they should be organised into migrant communities and given nationalistic fervour by, for instance, the teaching of the language of their home country. We would counteract such drives among certain groups in our migrant population if in the schools that the children of these migrants attended, Italian history, Turkish history, German history, or whatever it may be, were taught. This would make these people feel reasonably happy about what was happening. </para>
          <para>I come to another question that 1 wish to raise, in his second reading speech, the Minister refers to allowances and so on which are at present under review. 1 ask whether these allowances in fact have been altered now because of the inflationary spiral which some Ministers have accepted does exist? Another point that has been raised with me by school teachers with whom I have discussed these general issues is that it is important that we - by &#39;we&#39;. I mean the Commonwealth Parliament which will pass this legislation - provide funds for additional teachers to work as special teachers to deal with these migrants. What should happen is not that an ordinary teacher in an education department should be classed as a special teacher for this purpose but that an extra teacher should be provided for these migrants. It is necessary to have that extra teacher on the staff. I will be interested to hear whether in fact this happens at the present time. </para>
          <para>I turn now to the question of establishing the abilities of children early in life-. I think this sorting out process is wrong even from the point of view of the Australian child but certainly it is very wrong from the point of view of the migrant child. It is wrong to sort the migrant child into some stream which will determine his or her later educational expectation on the basis of some test which is given soon after the arrival of that child in this country.IQ tests, aptitude tests and so on will give completely wrong readings in the case of the child who has arrived in Australia only recently. The position of this child is completely different from that of an Australian child. Two points of difference to be considered are the language barrier and the whole cultural background of the immigrant child. Therefore, it is extremely difficult for the migrant child to obtain adequate marks in the first test of this type that he or she faces. I hope that the Department of Immigration will strive to discourage State education departments from screening children with a migrant background too soon after their arrival in Australia. </para>
          <para>The final point that I wish to make - this is a general point - is that, basically, 1 am in agreement with the aims of the Minister. I think that he is sympathetic to the general immigration proposition and the problems surrounding it.I think that a danger exists these days because many people who support the views expressed by the Government and Opposition Parties in this House are starting to talk about the quality of migrants. I am extremely disappointed when people make value judgments to the effect that, somehow or other, a migrant who comes from Germany or Holland is preferable in some absolute way to a migrant who comes from Italy, Greece or Turkey. I think that this sort of judgment should not be made. I was disappointed that at the conference to which I referred earlier there were people who talked about racial equality, who opposed our so-called white Australia policy and who encouraged immigration on a non racial basis. One of the arguments that they put forward is: Why should we discourage a Chinese doctor who can speak English coming to Australia from Hong Kong while we accept a peasant from Southern Italy? These people are making value judgments in the same way as those who oppose the immigration of Chinese are making value judgments. I am strongly opposed to that type of judgment. </para>
          <para>In considering the subject of immigration, I believe that to some extent we must look at it from the point of view of the migrant. We just do not want only well off or potentially well off migrants. We must take a humane point of view. We want people, to some extent I would hope, who will benefit most by coming to Australia. They may benefit most from an economic or a political point ofview. They may be trying to escape economic or political pressures. 1 hope that the Minister, when he is dealing with people who criticise our immigration policy by using statistics as many people do. will remember an old saying in the medical profession which is: Statistics are like psychiatrists; they will testify for either side. I hope that the Minister will keep that in mind when dealing with these matter. </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline>immigration is one of the few subjects on which Government and Opposition members agree pretty much on all aspects. I know from listening to the speech by the honourable member for Prospect <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Klugman),</inline> who has just resumed his seat and to the speech delivered by the honourable member who preceded him, that this view has been confirmed in respect of this legislation. One could continue by saying in respect of this measure: &#39;We support it. We support it. We should have had this proposal years ago. We support it.&#39; But it is necessary to say a little more than that, particularly because of the amendment which has been moved by the Opposition. To say the least, I think that the amendment is a trifle unfair, particularly the part which states:   . . this House condemns the Government for the delay in providing a comprehensive programme of migration education, adequate finance facilities and capital equipment, including buildings. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">I think that it is reasonable to defend the Government and to say that, after all, this whole question of education is and has been traditionally and constitutionally a State responsibility as is the sponsorship of migrants. The responsibility of the Commonwealth virtually has been in the recruitment of migrants. Let me set out some of the questions that we should be asking ourselves. I hope that, in the cost/ benefit analysis which the Minister for Immigration <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> has arranged - for which I congratulate him - these questions which I would like to have dealt with will be answered. For example, one question that I would ask is: Just how large should our population be? I do not know, who knows what it ought to be? Should it be 13 million, 30 million or 130 million? It seems to me that this is a most important questionthat we should be asking ourselves. Some optimum figure must be established somewhere. 1 am not one of those who believe any longer that we must populate or perish. </para>
          <para>Going back over the history of immigration. I remember very well, without referring to the quality of life, the quality of the migrants who came to us after World War II. The quality of these migrants was absolutely superlative. We would like to see migrants of this type continue to be attractedto Australia. </para>

              <para>- I am referring to the migrants who came to Australia after the Second World War. They were displaced people from Europe who had very strong motives for coming to this country. These people have proved to be excellent migrants. But I believe the motives for immigration have changed since those years. One of the problems is that we cannot control the flow of immigration by, as it were, turning the tap on and turning the tap off. What we can do though, 1 think, is perhaps to have a gentle easing of the flow from the tap to look at the quality of the material that iscoming out of it. I was interested to hear the Minister during question time today announce that our migrant intake for this year will be about 10,000 fewer than the original target of 180,000. I think that we should, if nothing else, be self critical on some of these subjects. 1 believe that our migration programme has been totally successful, although it has created areas of underprivilege in the community. It has been a compassionate policy and, in my view, it is the best migration policy in the world. It is selective, it is true: but it is selective because we wish to preserve a homogeneous population and because we have deliberately set out not to create a multi-racial society. But I think we must agree that along the line we have set up some pockets of underprivilege. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>We hear at odd times, when we can sort out the sense, criticism by some people of the pensioner arrangements and, in particular, criticism of the recent pension increases. Without going over the previous debates, 1 would like to reiterate my view that one of the most serious areas of underprivilege in addition to the single pensioner group is amongst migrants. The migrant pensioner is in an even worse situation. I had a classic case brought to my attention only last week. It related to a migrant pensioner who had died and left a widow with 5 children. Even when that migrant was alive and employed, he, like a million other people in this country, was receiving a wage of approximately only $50 a week. I believe that that is the most serious area of underprivilege or poverty, if we can put it that way. Of course, the reason for it is the one we are trying to eliminate today. This man had the serious disadvantage of not being able to speak our language. There would be another million people like him confined largely to working in road gangs or in an unskilled capacity. </para>
          <para>I compare the situation of migrant families and migrant children with that of the mentally handicapped. I think they are equally handicapped. They do not have the same sort of support as the mentally handicapped. In the last session of Parliament we passed legislation for the assistance of mentally handicapped children. There is a community acceptance of and compassion for these people. I have been for years a member ofan association concerned with mentally handicapped children. Members of these associations have parents and friends who can apply pressures on the Government, but migrants are not in that position. </para>
          <para>There is also a tendency for people to compare our system with the system in other countries. In particular, there has been comparison with the Canadian system. Under that system. Canada seeks to attract only those migrants with skills. It employs what is called a points system. In general terms, someone achieving over 40 points out of a maximum of 100 is admitted as a migrant. It is interesting to note that 30 points are alloted to a migrant who has an education and that another 10 are allotted to someone who is fluent in French and English. It is also interesting that 27 per cent of the population of Canada is of neither French nor English origin. There is significant racial discontent in that country, which is what I am sure we jointly seek to avoid in this country. </para>
          <para>Like other speakers, I find that migrant children suffer a serious disability in some of the schools in my electorate. I find that the problem varies from school to school. In those schools in the inner suburbs and in the older established areas there is a very high percentage of migrant children in all the classes. The number becomes fewer as we get through into the secondary classes. I understand that there are fewer migrants in country schools. But in at least one school in my electorate and in at least one class in this school every child is a migrant and none of them has a proper command of the English language. I understand that 5 per cent of the school population are migrant children, but of course this percentage must be very much higher in many of the schools. I may be making a mild criticism, but I think it is most important for us to organise teaching of English to intending migrants in their own country. If we could pay a subsidy or spend time and effort, and therefore money, to introduce the teaching of English into schools in Greece, Turkey or any of the other European countries, that would be money very well spent. Notes which refer to what is done in these countries have been circulated, and somewhere or other they mention preembarkation language instruction in Turkey and Greece in particular. But 1 would make the point that Greece, for example, is a country of dozens and dozens of islands, and very few of the Greek migrants can possibly have any pre-embarkation language instruction. Even then, many of those coming to this country  -  1 do not know what the figure is now but I believe it is about 40 per cent - travel by air, so there is no opportunity for them to have lessons in the language while they are travelling to Australia. </para>
          <para>I have heard a considerable amount of criticism of recent arrivals, particularly those from the United Kingdom. I think it is permissible to refer to quality in that way. I have spoken to welfare officers and chaplains who have in the last few months come to Australia on vessels carrying migrants, and there seems to be no doubt that a large number  -  10 per cent is a large number - of persons coming to Australia at the moment from the United Kingdom are really coming here for a holiday. I would like to see the Minister and the Department have a look at that matter. I am also concerned about the problems which are arising within the&#39; Yugoslav community in Australia because, as I recollect, when this legislation was foreshadowed and the immigration agreement with Yugoslavia was entered into a year or so ago the arrangement was that we were to receive a very large number of skilled tradesmen migrants. I do not believe that this is what is happening. I believe that we are receiving large numbers of unskilled Yugoslavs and people who cannot speak our language. There is a considerable amount of discontent in the Yugoslav community in Australia. I would (ike to mention briefly the Tregillis report on the training of skilled workers in Europe. </para>

              <para>-  1 made the point earlier that, if we approve of this Bill, all we can keep on saying is: &#39;I approve of the Bill&#39;. I think there are some things in the Bill and some attitudes about our immigration policy that can be altered. In any case, I think that the amendment moved by the Opposition is to be deplored, so I am attempting to resist it. I will now deal briefly with the Tregillis report. I hope that we will have the opportunity at some time in the future to debate this report in some detail. It refers to the report of the Vernon Committee of Economic Inquiry in 1965 and draws attention to the matter of education. It states: </para>

          <para class="block">Threaded all through this report are references to the need for a better understanding of our language and a better understanding of tradesmen&#39;s skills among migrants. I think that we can find evidence there to support what we have to say. I want to mention briefly a couple of points raised by the honourable member for Prospect <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Klugman).</inline> He had some sort of odd constitutional theory in respect of migration and he felt that we could in some way or other get around the Constitution and feed money into hospitals, health services, mental institutions and local government. I would like to say that that is precisely what we are not seeking to do. The whole purpose of encouraging migrants to learn English is to try to integrate them into our own community and not allow them to become separate. We surely do not want a situation where we have separate hospitals and separate local authorities. The honourable member also opposed the ethnic groupings in the community and in this I would disagree with him quite strongly and put in a word in support of ethnic groupings. I believe that they are of considerable benefit to migrants and I am thinking in particular of the Greek community and how much it has done to help Greek migrants in counselling, securing employment and general social welfare work. </para>
          <para>As a final comment in this debate I would like to refer to some remarks made by the honourable member for Riverina <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Grassby)</inline> outside the House at the eighteenth Australian Citizenship Convention which I think expressed a quite asinine point of view. He said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>One group of migrants now coming in who have no ethnic group or particular affiliations in Australia are Asians.  I  have helped in settling some Asian migrants and generally the Department of Immigration has been helpful, effective and speei.lv.

              <para>- We will deal with that in a moment. The honourable member said further:  lt is desirable to overcome this, and a very simple way would be to have a special office in an Asian capital, perhaps Manila, where a team of skilled people could clear the confusion. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para class="block">I would suggest that the only confusion that exists is in the honourable member&#39;s mind because the Philippines is one country with which we do not have any arrangement. Although we take some Filipino migrants it does not accept any from Australia. Our policy on non-European migration is very well known and if it is not well known and understood it is entirely the fault of persons like the honourable member for Riverina and the honourable member for Sturt <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Foster).</inline> It is up to us to understand our policy and to go out and sell it. </para>
          <para>This is an area of migration which we should examine much more closely. I am sure we all have cases of people who have come to Australia and spent many years here and become more Australian than Asian and wish to stay on that basis. This is, I think, unfortunate because they come to this country to learn a skill and take the skill back to their own country. I wonder whether the Government, and perhaps both parties, could give consideration to the suggestion of training Asian people in their own countries. I understand that at any one time in this country 12 per cent of students who wish to attend university are excluded from courses because of the number of Asians in the faculties. That is fair enough, but when large percentages of those students come back here this seems to me to be unfair to the Australian born student. I wonder if we and the Asians would not get better value for our money if we set up a university for example in Singapore and sent our own staff - lecturers and academics - to train Singaporeans, Malaysians. Indians and any other people one cares to suggest. I think the Bill is an excellent move. It is a shame it did not happen years ago but we have to remember that previous Ministers have had to make agreements with all the States and to make an agreement at that level on any subject is. 1 think, an achievement. I support the Bill and strongly oppose the amendment. </para>

            <para>- I am glad that the honourable member for Boothby <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McLeay)</inline> advised us that he supports the Bill because I listened to him patiently for 20 minutes and frankly I found him talking about things other than matters that are contained in the Bill. But this is not unusual. The honourable member&#39;s views on immigration and matters of this nature are very well known. He has made them very clear and he did nothing today to dispel that clarity. He said that the Australian Government&#39;s immigration policy is well known. That is true, but 1 am wondering if it is known well. He also spoke of ethnic groups in the community. I am wondering if he has not used this expression to connote ghettos. It seems to me that when the question of immigration is mentioned not only the honourable member for Boothby but also a number of other honourable members on the other side of the House seem to be very condescending in their attitude towards the whole question. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">People from overseas seem to become something different. Those honourable members seem to forget that Australian history is one of immigration and that the honourable member for Boothby is a descendant of immigrants, as 1 am and as is every other member who sits in this House. The only difference might be that some of our forebears came out here under their own steam. </para>
          <para>This whole question of the education of the children of migrants is a very important one and it is very interesting to note the number of honourable members who have offered to speak on the subject because it takes their attention. In my own electorate of Burke is situated the Broadmeadows Migrant Hostel which creates a peculiar problem for the East Meadows State School. This school is not very far from the migrant hostel and as a result all the children of school age who reside in the hostel attend this school. It has become a fact of life that migrants stay at hostels for approximately  3  months. This is the case in Broadmeadows. After this  3-month  period they move out of the hostel and go to live with compatriots. What sort of situation that createsI would not like to hazard a guess. It solves one problem for the Commonwealth Government in that it does not have to provide so much hostel accommodation because the turnover is so high but this in turn creates a problem for the local State school. The high turnover of migrants in the hostels means that the students are at the school for approximately  3  months. The number of migrant children at the school is always about  100  but they are not the same children. They change every  3  months. I am now speaking in favour of the amendment. </para>
          <para>Some accommodation at the school is used to teach the children of migrants living in the hostel. As a result of this the children of the residents of the area - shall we call them the permanent students of the school - do not have the advantage of a library or an arts and crafts room because the 2 rooms that would be used for those purposes are used to accommodate migrant children. The Minister for Immigration <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> is well aware of the matter about which I speak because I wrote to him about it in the middle of last year. I appreciate the fact that he cannot answer my letter because this matter has not yet been resolved by the Parliament. I am fully cognisant of that but we should be looking at the problems that arise with the accommodation that is available. My colleague the honourable member for Grayndler <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Daly)</inline> in moving his amendment is endeavouring to draw the attention of the Government to a very real problem. </para>
          <para>It has already been pointed out that there will be some sort of a problem in providing the number of trained teachers required.  1  suppose the teaching aids - the tape recorders and all the rest of it - can be purchased readily but accommodation for the students is a very real problem. There are many problems which arise in these schools and one is the lack of accommodation due to the fact that the rooms are occupied by migrant children. For the  3  months they are there, the children of migrants sit blankly and stare into space because they cannot comprehend what is taking place around them. The teachers who are available endeavour to give those children as much attention as they can but of course this is to the detriment of the students who are already at the school. Frankly this problem goes a lot deeper than the teaching of English to the children of migrants. Having spoken to the principals and teachers of schools in my electorate my experience is that the percentage of native born children in Australia who are receiving a very good education in the English language is not very high. We have to delve a lot deeper into this matter. </para>
          <para>Today we arc dealing with the question of teaching the English language to migrants. The problem of understanding the English language and the ability to communicate with one another is probably much deeper than is appreciated by a large section of the community. We heard speeches today about ethnic groupings in the community. As a contradiction we have also had honourable members speaking in this place about integration. It is true that in Melbourne there is a newspaper called &#39;Times of Malta&#39; which is printed entirely in the Maltese language. There are 2 newspapers entitled &#39;La Fiamma&#39; and &#39;Il Globo&#39; which are printed entirely in the Italian language. There is also the &#39;Kosmos&#39; newspaper which is printed in the Greek language. There are probably others but they are the only ones I know of. One newspaper which is circulated in my own electorate - a free newspaper supported by the local merchants in the town through their advertising - prints on 1 page in the Italian language the news reported elsewhere in the newspaper in the English language. 1 suppose it is the old story of too little too late. This is a criticism which the Government must be used to hearing. 1 wonder how deep this problem is within the community when we have a need for newspapers to be printed in other than the English language so that people can find out what is going on around the place. 1 will not be so parochial as to pretend that if I were to go to Italy. Malta, Greece, Spain or anywhere else I would not gravitate towards someone who spoke English, or that I would reject the chance of reading an English newspaper. But at the same time if we are to talk about, to use the words of our esteemed Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Gorton),</inline> a multiracial society- </para>

              <para>- Perhaps my English is not as good as it ought to be. The problem of these migrant people living in ghettos and reading newspapers in their native language has to be solved. I thought that the honourable member for Denison <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Solomon)</inline> made quite a sound contribution to the debate on this Bill last night when he said that the hows, whys and the wherefores have to bc obtained. In other words, what sort of incentive will be offered these people to learn the English language? At present there is precious little incentive. I would not know 1 migrant .&#39;who is disadvantaged through nol knowing the English language. He can make purchases in a shop which has a shopkeeper of his own nationality. He can read newspapers printed in his own language. He is not seriously disadvantaged by not knowing the English language. He works in a factory where the foreman is probably of the same nationality. We should nol fall for the trap of believing that all foremen or shopkeepers are necessarily Anglo-Saxon or that they all have a very fine command of the English language and no knowledge of any other language. The incentive has to be found to encour age migrant women, migrant men and their children to learn the English language. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Although this Bill goes part of the way towards achieving this objective it just does not go far enough. This is a criticism which the Opposition constantly levels at this Government and I think the Government has come to expect it. The Bill does not get to the root cause of the problem. This is a situation which has grown up not over the last 3 or 5 years but over the last 20 years. No attempt whatsoever has been made to recognise the problem, nor has any step been taken to prevent it from becoming the serious problem that it is now recognised to be. As I have already said the Government expects the criticism of doing too little too late. It is a legitimate criticism and the Government knows that. The honourable member for Denison, whom I complimented for the contribution he made to this debate, raised only the issue of incentive. However, I do not expect him or any other member of this House to have the answer to this question. The very weak attitude which he took towards the amendment - this was his only opposition to it- was that the Commonwealth Government should not make provision for buildings because the buildings, would be used only part of the day. The honourable member also said that schools are used in the same way but that is not a very strong argument to put forward against the amendment moved by the Opposition. </para>
          <para>I listened very carefully to what the honourable member said and as far as I could understand that was his reason for opposing the amendment. But I wonder how valid his criticism is. Those of us who live in the capital cities know that there is no shortage of development of real estate in the inner city areas. In my view the priorities of our latter day society - our contemporary society - are very cockeyed. There seems to be no shortage of men, money or materials for the erector of large multi-storey office blocks in prime locations in prime business sectors, but these things never seem to be available for the construction of a hospital or another classroom for a school. The argument that these things can be made available in one quarter but not in another does not hold water. If they are available to build office blocks they are available to build schools and hospitals. </para>
          <para>Because the argument cannot hold water any more the old cliches start to rise and we start saying: &#39;You can cut only so many slices from a cake.&#39; However, if all the ingredients are used the cake would become larger and many more slices could be cut from it. To my mind the whole argument revolves around a double barrelled question. Firstly: Are all of the resources of the nation being used in the best interests of the community? Secondly: Are all the available resources equitably tapped? We on this side of the House see a Government that I regard as being the marionette of the cold hard hand of capitalism and it always says no. If there were a government in this country which was capable, able and willing to plan it would provide an affirmative answer to those questions. If this country, notwithstanding all the turmoil in which it now finds itself, can survive long enough the Australian Labor Parly will provide such a government next year. Then no doubt the country will once again find itself on the road to prosperity. </para>
          <para>The honourable member for Denison recited a story to illustrate a migrant&#39;s lack of the English language. That story reminded me of the time when I was a trade union official and I asked a small chap who camefrom central Europe to join my union. He was not very happy about the whole thing and we had quite a lengthy discussion. Finally he got down almost on his knees, looked up into my face and said:&#39;You know what you don&#39;t know?&#39; That confused me but I thought the answer must he no and I said &#39;No&#39;. He said &#39;Well, you don&#39;t know nothin&#39; about nothin&#39;: that&#39;s what you don&#39;t know.&#39; That man had trouble in communication. I am afraid 1 did not know what he meant. </para>

            <para>- One cannot help but have the greatest admiration for a migrant family who uproot themselves from the country of their birth and travel halfway around the world in search of a new and better life. Some years ago 1 stood on the wharf at Portree in the Isle of Skye and thought of how, some 100 years before, my grandmother who was only a girl at the time set sail to come to Australia. In those days the voyage took 6 months. It took a lot of determination and courage to make such a voyage. . I believe that it is due to the characteristics of people such as these that Australia is the nation which it is today. It is far less difficult for a British migrant to be assimilated into the Australian way of life than it is for a non-British migrant. Our cultures are the same. Many of our laws are the same. Most important of all, we speak the same language. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>There is no problem of communication. But how much more difficult it is for the Greek, the Yugoslav, the Italian and people of other nationalities who, with their various differing backgrounds, find themselves unable to speak the language of the new country of their choice. Three sections of the migrant family are affected by this communication barrier: The breadwinner, the housewife and the children. The breadwinner, who is immediately thrown out into the work force, soon picks up a smattering of English. He, of necessity, is probably the first in the family to understand and speak the English language. The problem of the housewife is more difficult. She is at home all day, running the household and has less need to learn English quickly. Then, of course, there are the children who at school, through mixing with Australian kiddies, have a much better chance of picking up English than their mother has. </para>
          <para>The unfortunate thing is that when the family comes home to the mother at night probably they all take the easy course of conversing in their own tongue. The influx into schools of migrant children with a language disability in English has created great problems not only for the children but also for the schools. Although these children will gradually pick up meaningful words and phrases they are at a grave disadvantage in following normal lessons given in English. Not only do we have a duty and a responsibility to the people whom we have brought to Australia but also it is in our own interests that these people be assimilated and integrated as early as possible. The Bill before the House tackles this problem. It provides for an adult programme, a child education programme and an intensive course programme. </para>
          <para>The course in assimilation starts with pre-embarkation instruction. It gives instruction which is continued during the voyage. After arrival in Australia a further course is made available. During the recess last year the Government members immigration committee flew to Perth and joined the migrant vessel &#39;Australis&#39; on its trip to Melbourne. We sat in on a number of classes whilst on board. We were most impressed not only with the type of instruction given but also with the interest of the migrants in the lessons. Approximately 50 per cent of migrants still come to Australia by sea, and the 3 weeks sea voyage is a wonderful opportunity for the 40,000 non-English speaking migrants who arrive here annually by this means to receive tuition in English and the Australian way of life. It provides a useful link between the pre-embarkation instruction and the courses available in Australia. </para>
          <para>On arrival in Melbourne the committee visited the new Enterprise Hostel in Victoria. At this hostel special classes have been set up to prepare non-English speaking migrant children of primary and secondary school age to enter Australian schools. There are also day and evening classes available for adults. Both the State and independent schools have to cope with the problem of educating migrant children. I am pleased that the Bill provides assistance for both types of school. The assistance to be given in both teacher training and capital equipment such as language laboratories should help greatly in the education and assimilation of migrant children. Last night in this House the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Gorton)</inline> announced what cuts would be made in Government expenditure as part of the fight against inflation. Last year Australia absorbed about 185,000 migrants. I was sorry to hear the Minister for Immigration <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> announce at question time today that our migrant intake this year will be cut back to about 170,000. I understand that the Department of Immigration aims to save S2.6m in salaries, administration expenses, capital works and services, and migrant embarkation costs. </para>
          <para>My colleague, the honourable member for Boothby <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McLeay),</inline> said earlier in this debate that we cannot turn migration on and off like a tap. I believe that it is a retrograde step in Australia&#39;s development to cut back our intake of migrants. I am pleased, however, to !earn that migrant education and welfare will not be restricted for financial reasons. Recently the Melbourne &#39;Herald&#39; invited readers to send in letters to the editor on how the Government could save money. I would like to read to the House one of the letters which. I think, illustrates how ill-informed some members of the public are. The writer of this letter is a lady from Montmorency, which used to be in the electorate of Deakin but now is in the electorate of Diamond Valley. She said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Cut out all migration on assisted passages and all migrants must have a knowledge of English, cutting out time and money spent with special classes. All migrants to be naturalised after 10 years in Australia. </para>
            <para>Much money is spent bringing migrants out on cheap fares, more is spent teaching them and their children English, and a lot of them return home after making money. Migrants not becoming Australian citizens by or before .10 years to return to their own countries. </para>

              <para>- I  was glad she went.  I  hope that the Government will not be influenced by this type of thinking. We have heard it from a number of quarters - from industry and manufacturers - that migrants are creating a strain on the economy and that the programme should be cut back.  1  believe that it is not in the long term interests of Australia that this should occur.In his policy speech before the  1969  election the Prime Minister announced the Government&#39;s intention to take the initiative in promoting and accepting responsibility for expanding the existing facilities for the instruction of adult migrants, to provide intensive full time English courses and to provide special courses in existing schools for migrant children. The Bill fulfils that promise. It will do a great deal to help migrants to become assimilated. It will do much for the migrant and for Australia. It is worthy of the support of all honourable members. The amendment moved by the honourable member for Grayndler <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Daly)</inline> means nothing. It is a criticism which serves no purpose at all. I cannot for the life of me see how the honourable member for Burke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Keith Johnson)</inline> could have made the statement that the amendment adds to the Bill. I believe that it should be treated with the contempt it deserves and be rejected outright. </para>

            <para>-In  my electorate there is a large number of new settlers. Quite obviously there has been a problem for them in learning the English language because they could not obtain adequate instruction. It is somewhat of an indictment of any government, irrespective of its political character, that so many people who could not speak English have been encouraged to come to this country and no opportunity has been given to them to learn the language. That in itself creates a great discrimination against many of them. If one looks at the figures showing arrivals of settlers one will see that in the  1970  period the number was as high as  185,000.  A large number of them would be very young - under  14 -  and perhaps there were some  40,000  under the age of  19.  It is that category to which we might address our minds for a start. In the main these would be children who are immediately put into the school system. They are unable to understand the teacher and immediately there is discrimination. At the annual prize-giving at any primary school it will be found that the child, who may be termed a new settler, of parents who obviously cannot speak English is at a disadvantage because he certainly never scores prizes in English. Often he is regarded as being in the slow learner class, not because of any intellectual disability but because he is unable to keep up with the other children, particularly if he is at the age of  8, 9  or  10  years. He is put into that category and finds it very difficult to survive against his counterpart. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Whilst the Bill allocates a sum of money, it seems that we are just allocating a sum of money. Would it not be far better to look at the number who need help? The number who have gone we cannot help. The Minister for Immigration <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> would know from the statistics available the age groups that have arrived in the country. There would have been a large number of people in the past who should have had the opportunity to learn English quickly. The Government says: We will do something about it. We will allocate a sum of money&#39;. It may be something of a progressive nature; that is commendable. But how many children or adults will still not be able to have the advantage of English instruction because there is insufficient money available for materials, equipment and teachers or, <inline font-style="italic">as</inline> my colleague the honourable member for Grayndler <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Daly)</inline> says, suitable buildings? Would it not be more appropriate to say. &#39;We have  40,000  people arriving this year who have no opportunity to understand the English language. How much money do they need over all age groups to give them the opportunity to understand English within a period of  3  to  6  months?&#39; It can happen. </para>
          <para>Let us look at the problems that we have. There are the primary school children whom I have mentioned. We have the secondary school child who has even more difficulties because he comes into a higher category of education, where there is far more competition, with a basic defect of not being able to understand the English language. He is in difficulty. Then we have the adult who is in one of 2 categories. He might have had a tertiary education in his home land; he might be a tradesman or professional type. Again he is definitely under difficulties since he cannot get the right sort of job here because he cannot speak the language. He needs help. Or he might be a person who might not have had the great benefit of a higher education in his home land but nevertheless needs the essential opportunity of learning to speak English here. So we have those various categories all under difficulties. The common factor, of course, is that they arrive now by aeroplane, mainly. They arrive quickly and usually they are put into hostels. It is an obvious solution, therefore, to provide within that hostel the very facilities which are known to be the best media for giving English instruction. </para>
          <para>In my electorate is the University of New South Wales which has a School of Foreign Languages controlled by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Garrick,</inline> a splendid tutor. He has there all the most modern equipment. He is now able to say - and has evidence to prove it - that by the use of this equipment he can teach people English within 8 weeks. He has now had 2 graduations of people who have passed through that course. In 8 weeks they progress from people who know nothing about English to people who are able to converse with us because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Garrick</inline> saturates them with English full time for 8 weeks. The Government might say it helps and that it pays these people a sustenance allowance. If it can do that for this group which avails itself of this opportunity, what about the others getting the same opportunity? The Minister can say:&#39;I cannot do that because I have not enough money to provide the equipment that is available at the University of New South Wales.&#39; But it is essential that it be provided in the hostel because by the provision of the same tutors and the same equipment the people there will be able to converse in English also. </para>
          <para>I attended the most recent graduation ceremony. Some 40 to 50 people of 22 different nationalities, none of whom could speak English 8 or 10 weeks before, were able to converse with each other in English. It immediately broke down any racial problems or prejudice because they were able to talk in the common language of their new country. They found great delight in this fact. They did not feel isolated or that they were relegated back to their own ethnic groups because they could converse with any Australian and with each other on the common basis that they were all recent arrivals. These people were joyous at the fact that they were at last accepted in this community and had the opportunity to understand the language. The sad thing is that this would have been the second or third group to have had that opportunity. How many thousands in the past have been denied it? I have been talking about adults but what have been the difficulties of the schoolchildren? </para>
          <para>These people were able to go out and get jobs as salesmen or in some professional capacity or some highly skilled trade. They always had that ability but they would not have had those jobs if they had not had the opportunity to learn to communicate in English. Thatin itself was successful. I spoke to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Garrick</inline> about this problem and he clearly illustrates the advantage of using this equipment. He mentions that there are some objections to just using the human being as a tutor. He mentioned the recent experiences with Aboriginal children. He is able to show by the use of this equipment, by the use of sound and earphones - in other words, a stimulation of the human being - this rapid progress where there was none before. He says that if we were to apply the same methods to children in primary or secondary schools we could get a rapid result with those children who may be somewhat vague as to what a person is trying to tell them in English or when asked to repeat by rote some English word. That in itself does not indicate clearly that they are absorbing it. There is evidence to prove that by using this equipment and the method of listening to records, of speaking English individually and listening to their own voices, in a period of 8 weeks they can come up to a very high standard. This opportunity should be available to every child. It should be available in the schools. If there are no schools which are adequate they should be provided. </para>
          <para>In my electorate there is a tremendous number of Greek immigrants who are splendid people. The local public school has had to build 2 new classrooms in the primary sector to provide for the influx of the new Greek children. One can imagine how many immediately suffer a penalty because there is no opportunity at this school for them to learn English. They immediately suffer the penalty I mentioned earlier and this shows up when the examinations are held and they are shown to he not altogether shining in subjects in which they could well have succeeded. Here we have a problem. The Government has said there is a problem. In his second reading speech the Minister said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Full-scale production of material designed specifically for child migrants will possibly take 2 to 3 years. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Again there is a further delay. How many children will suffer because of that? It is obvious from the experiments undertaken by people such as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Garrick</inline> that the human being can be taught readily by a number of novel methods to quickly understand the English language. </para>
          <para>Why should we do this apart from the reasonsI have mentioned? There are a number of other matters. The 8 weeks course at the moment is sufficient for what might be termed an elementary course in English. It is not altogether complete. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Garrick</inline> and others say it is essential to have a further follow-up period of some 4 to 6 weeks part time which may be continued on after the 8 weeks period. The most desirable thing to do would be to have at least one 3-hour session a week with people who might be interested in one particular part of trade or industry - say the automobile industry - and gather them together with leaders in the automobile industry so that they can talk in English about that industry and the terms that are used. If we could get them to bring along their relatives and friends that in itself would give a great social backing to the advantage of being part of this community. It is vital that we remain in communication with them and we should encourage them to meet and talk in English. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Garrick</inline> says the alternative could well be disastrous because if they drop back into the factory where they are not able to continue to converse in English they are prone to get together in their own groups and talk again in their own language. They slip back into that position and this is fatal to any advantages that they would have enjoyed. So the great advantages in the use of proper equipment are already obvious. </para>
          <para>Obviously there would be limitations on any scheme if there were no buildings. This seems to be what might be termed a defect in the drafting of the Bill, because the Bill does not provide for any allocation of moneys for buildings. I think that all my colleague is doing is saying: &#39;This problem ought to be overcome&#39;. You cannot have this fatal flaw, because equipment cannot be put in a building if there is no building. If we look at the areas where migrants have settled in great numbers we see that the provision of such a building would be well worth while. </para>
          <para>Of course we should use hostels if they are already there and put the equipment into them. By all means we should use our resources to the best advantage. But it is rather dismal to think that there has been what might be termed a mere allocation of money and that is as far as we can go in dealing with the question of need, because there are other problems and they are social problems. In my electorate there is a large number of Yugoslavs who have had no real opportunity to learn the English language. Invariably they stay in a hostel for less than 3 months and they quickly go out to work. They work mainly in what might be termed the trades. Many of them are bricklayers. They are splendid types of citizens who have not had a higher or secondary school education in the country from which they have come. They suffer injustices because they are put into the community in Australia and they have to compete with Australian citizens. </para>
          <para>Recently 2 Yugoslavs came to my office. They had been in Australia for 10 months. They could not converse with me in English. They had an interpreter with them. This is a clear indication of what can happen. These Yugoslavs had to get out of the hostel and seek other accommodation. They did not know much about rents, leases or contracts of sale because they were not able to communicate in English. So what happened? Somebody encouraged them to look at a broken down old piece of real estate and sold it to them. Within 1 hour they had signed a paper, which was all in English, which stated that they would buy the house, that they would pay $1,000 deposit and that they would repay the balance at $50 a week with an interest rate of 10&#189; per cent reducible. They knew nothing of what they were doing. They said they thought the man said that they could repay the balance at $30 a month and that they would have  a  period much longer than 3 years in which to pay it. </para>
          <para>I believe them because they would not know what he had said and they would be trying to get a vague indication of what was wanted. This man took them to the bank and he withdrew their money from the bank. He said to them: &#39;There is no need to go to any legal adviser. This is quite all right.&#39; When they returned to their own countrymen 48 hours later and said what they had done, some of their countrymen who could speak English told them in their own language: &#39;That was a crazy thing to do. Do you know what you have done?&#39; They said: &#39;No.&#39; The law in Australia, both State and Federal, states that a person is supposed to know what he has signed and he is bound by it. It is not an excuse to say that you did not understand. This is the problem. As I have mentioned, this is a clear indication of what can happen. </para>
          <para>How many other migrants have been the victims of this sort of injustice, because our law is based on the statute of frauds which says that any dealing in property has to be in writing and has to be signed. If it is a hire purchase transaction it has to be in writing and signed. In the main these migrant people are looking at the goods which they are anxious to buy and they would not understand the terms that are used. Let us think of the injustices which this could create and of the difficulty which must arise for us as an Australian nation. These people could return to their countrymen and tell them what has happened and their countrymen in turn could tell other people: &#39;There are a lot of problems down in Australia. You want to be careful if you sign any document because people can cheat you.&#39; This problem applies in the main to Asian migrants. </para>
          <para>While our immigration programme has had very good intentions, because of the interpretation placed on it people in other countries say that we are &#39;anti them&#39;. This is quite crazy. The real intentions of our programme have not been adequately explained or perhaps people do not understand the programme because English is not their forte. So let us have a look at the whole problem and place emphasis on migrant education. Certainly new settlers who can speak English need help as well, but they do not need basic assistance in the first 3 months of their stay in Australia in order to help them to understand the English language. They know it and they can overcome these difficulties. But there are many new settlers who cannot speak English. </para>
          <para>If we are dealing with, say, 40,000 people and we allocate a paltry sum of $250,000 to help teach them the English language, not many of them will get an opportunity to learn English. So they will be penalised. We are now dealing with what is to happen in the next 18 months, so there is every reason why we should accept the amendment moved by the honourable member for Grayndler. If we do we will provide opportunities for these people to learn English. This proposition should not be put on the basis: &#39;We have a sum of money and we will allocate that. We know it is nowhere near what is necessary, but that is the best we can do because the defects are too great.&#39; </para>
          <para>If we look at the number of departures of migrants returning (o their countries of origin we find that in 1970 the figure was as high as 35,000 or 36,000. That may be the normal rate of departure, but we would find that one-half of those departures were people under the age of 20 years. It could well be that a parent has said: T am dissatisfied. I do not understand the language, and I have had no opportunity to learn it. My child al school has not gol on at all or is not making any progress because he or she is unhappy or because he or she cannot understand the teacher. Why should we not go back to our country of origin where we are able to understand the language? Despite the fact that we do not want to go gack, we know that we will be accepted there. We understand the education system and our children at least will have the same opportunity as any other child and nol be put in a secondary position where there is no opportunity. The people in our new country have accepted us as human beings, but they have penalised us on the basis that we are not equal. We cannot compete with them, whether it be at school or in the commercial world.&#39; These factors ought to be considered. </para>
          <para>So why should not an analysis be made of how many people each year - whether they be from Yugoslavia, Turkey, Greece or some other country - need English instruction? These migrants are coming out by plane so there is no opportunity to instruct them in the English language before they arrive here. Perhaps they immediately want to go to work when they arrive here. They need evening instruction at the hostel. This can be arranged. Let us tackle this problem. As I have already said, we could get a result within 8 weeks, and you could not get anything faster than that. These migrants would be delighted if this were done, and I would say that in the main they would continue to live in Australia and we would reduce the number of departures. We would ensure that the migrant child at school was not a dropout and had an opportunity to compete with other children.  His  parents would feel that they were accepted and they could obtain better jobs because of the training they had received in their country of origin. These are vital factors. </para>
          <para>We should notlook at this matter on the basis of sheer economics. We should look at it on the basis of the need of the migrants who arrive here. If this had been done in the past our immigration programme would have been much more successful and many more migrants would have stayed in Australia. If this programme were implemented on the basis of need, more money would be required and also there would be a need for more buildings, as has been mentioned by my colleague the honourable member for Grayndler. Accordingly, while I support the proposition in the Bill I think that much more money should be allocated to the programme on the basis of need, as is indicated in the Opposition&#39;s amendment. </para>

I was amazed to find that the honourable member for Burke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Keith Johnson)</inline> said that a migrant who does not speak English is not seriously disadvantaged.

              <para>- Let him try. too, but he is a trade union official so he would have no trouble. But lack of English is a basic disadvantage to migrants coming into this country when they are looking for jobs. I find it difficult to believe that any honourable member, including the honourable member for Wills or the honourable member for Sturt <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Foster)</inline> who is calling out on my right hand side, could say that lack of English can prove to be of no disadvantage when one is looking for a job. However, it is not that about which I wish to speak. I believe that the honourable member for Prospect <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Klugman)</inline> gave one of the finest speeches we have heard on this subject when he spoke on the need for humanity when looking at the problem of migration. While not having suffered from the problem of lack of English, being a migrant myself I must say that the problem for people coming here is to be treated as a matter of people and not just of statistics. I should like to commend the honourable member for Prospect for saying that. But as I said.I rose to say only a couple of things. One was to comment upon the fact that I do not quite agree with the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lionel Bowen)</inline> who referred to the use of machines for teaching though, of course, this is a very important aspect of teaching English. </para>

          <para>I think that over the  past 20  years a great strain has been placed on teachers in our State schools because children do absorb and children do learn English very quickly. But one of the great strains we have had has been with the teachers. Certainly in New South Wales teachers have had a great strain placed on them in trying to prepare children for their school lives. At this stageI should like to pay a tribute to the Sutherland District Parents and Citizens Association and the Sutherland Teachers Federation with whom I do not always see eye to eye. </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">The programme designed to teach migrants to speak English has failed dismally. There is no doubt of that, for in his pamphlet, Education for Adult Migrants&#39;, Professor W. F. Connel says that it appears that the language programme is steadily slipping backwards. He went on to say that a recent survey conducted by the Department of Immigration indicates that about one-third of foreign born migrants cannot speak English, and the Department&#39;s classes cater for only a small proportion of these. It appears that many past arrivals have remained largely ignorant of the English language and that, so far as catching up with this backlog of students is concerned, present classes are not matching the numbers of present arrivals. The classes seem, in fact, to be falling short of current arrivals. The survey, of which Professor Connell speaks, was conducted as recently as 1969. </para>
          <para>From October 1968 to October 1969 there were 19,915 students enrolled in evening classes for migrants in New South Wales. I think we must all agree that this enrolment of nearly 20,000 migrants in English language classes in 1 year in 1 State is very encouraging in that it indicates that our new arrivals are willing to learn the English language if given the opportunity. But no fewer than 17,959 of these ambitious and hopeful enrolees abandoned their courses, many of them after only 1 or 2 lessons. We should ask ourselves why so many gave up their studies in a tongue which would improve their job opportunities and enhance their integration into the Australian community. Did they abandon the classes because they considered English to be of no advantage? Did they abandon the classes because of the methods of teaching, or were their reasons, as some non-migrants have said, economic? </para>
          <para>It is my opinion that if the migrant language training programmes failure - a programme that has been in operation for many years - can be attributed to any single cause, it is the exclusive use of the situation method of language instruction. I am sure that the Minister for Immigration <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> does not agree with me on this matter, for obviously if he did the Bill would be substantially different. For example, the Federal Department of Education and Science, which is administering Commonwealth grants for the Department of Immigration, is insisting that teaching follow the situational method which is taught to adult migrants in its classes for children. While it may not be disturbing that the situation method should be used to instruct adults who are already well educated before coming here, that the Department should think highly enough of this method to thrust it on migrants of little education is frightening. My misgivings about the exclusive use of the situation method of instruction of adult migrants arise because there are 2 general groups of migrants for whom this Bill does not make reasonable provision. Firstly, there are the young migrants, just out of school, not well educated and thrust immediately on their arrival here into the grinding and mindshackling mills of unskilled employment; and, secondly, there are the older migrants, also not well educated but long out of school and confined to the home and thereby effectively isolated from the community in which they will live out their lives and isolated from the community which is supposed to give meaning to their lives. </para>
          <para>These 2 groups have 1 thing in common - a lack of education. Some people might say that they have 2 things in common - a lack of education and a lack of opportunity. But since I have hopes that this latter unfortunate circumstance will soon be remedied I will not carp on whether they have 1 or 2 things in common. In lacking education they suffer a lack of knowledge and understanding of their own cultural heritage and in the long run this particular lack is more unfortunate for them than their inability to speak our tongue, for implicit in a lack of understanding of their own culture is a lack of facility in their own tongue, and this is disastrous, because, as everybody knows, language is more than words. But despite this, the Department is insisting that instruction, not only for adolescents and older migrants, including those who will hardly be involved in the. wider spheres of community life because their activities are confined to the home, but also for children should be by the situation method, as though the study of language or the proper use of words can be divorced from the study of the history and literature which produced those words. </para>
          <para>Does a parrot, which not only can utter - or is it &#39;screech&#39; - words but also can demonstrate a use of phrases understand the quality of the words it uses? Does the bird, or the person of limited education who is taught words by the situation method, grasp the differences of meaning that depend upon particular contexts? Consider, for example, the difference between a bay of the sea, a bay mare, the bay of a hound, a stag at bay, or a bay leaf. It may be said that this is a trivial example, but to get proper results contexts must be considered, not single words, as does the situation method of instruction. Situations and not translations are used to teach the meaning of new structures. The use made of any situation at any one time is limited to the use or teaching of one grammatical form or group sentence patterns. No attempt is made to teach other structures which also could arise from the particular situations. Language cannot be separated from culture. Words are meaningless without an accompanying concept. For instance, in a lesson relating to pets a teacher found that pets were outside the reference of some migrant students. They could not imagine a pet, nor could they imagine feeding an animal which did not provide its owners with food, shelter or protection. </para>
          <para>It is clear that migrants cannot be fitted into, for whatever purposes, an homogeneous group. Rather do migrants comprise a number of sub-groups extensively diverse in terms of age, innate ability, achievement and desire for learning the English language. These facts are commonplace. Is it not then too much to expect that a single method of language instruction could possibly satisfy the various and diverse needs of our new arrivals? Should we not therefore adopt teaching programmes designed to cater for the specific needs of the major sub-groups which have entered our community? Such programmes might not only depart from the situational method of language instruction but also would demand the use of bi-lingual teachers, for there is no doubt that students would be more at home with teachers who spoke their own language and who could understand their fears and misgivings in a new environment. Such teachers would cushion both the language and cultural transition through which every migrant painfully, and with trepidation, inevitably passes. </para>
          <para>It is difficult to escape the conclusion that the Government has no real interest in spreading the use of English among migrants who need English instruction hut that the Government is merely interested in turning out human capital, that is, people who will serve the economic machine. Somewhere in his writings Galbraith tells us that despite the vanity of educators it is not they but industry that shapes the lines of development of an education system. As Professor Daniel Bell of Columbia University points out: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The raising of human capital is a much more complex process than the raising of financial capital. It is the limits to human capital rather than to financial capital which have become the fundamental element limiting the growth of society. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The imperatives of industry demand that unskilled and semi-skilled process workers have some knowledge of English, but nothing more than a rudimentary knowledge - just enough to enable people from a variety of countries to bid each other good morning&#39; on the factory floora nd thus give the impression that on the factory floor unity in diversity is to be found. We now know that few southern Europeans need to learn English in order to establish themselves. A survey in Victoria showed that southern Europeans communicate almost entirely in their own language. According to the sample, over  75  per cent worked with fellow nationals,  66  per cent did not. need English for their work, more than  80  per cent had no social contact outside their national group, about  90  per cent lived with relatives, 94 per cent used their native tongue exclusively at home and most patronised shops where their own language was spoken. </para>
          <para>The reasons for abandonment of English instruction courses by these groups are important when viewed in the context of the proposal to expand and upgrade the services provided by these classes. The most common reason for abandoning the course was dissatisfaction with the classes, particularly with the mixing together of advanced and less advanced students. Economic considerations were also important, such as working overtime, shift work and having two jobs which conflict with the set times of the courses. Language is a too! of some potency and the chief vehicle of centuries of culture. Any programme for the instruction of migrants in the English language should begin by instructing the foreign speaking migrant in his own language. The migrant should be instructed to a stage of fluency and facility in his native tongue, and at the same time he should be instructed in his own history and literature. </para>
          <para>Let us return again to Professor W. F. Connell. Speaking of social understanding he says: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I he present adult migrant education programme concentrates on language teaching. Incidentally, and on occasions, deliberately, it introduces materIs I lo acquaint the student with various aspects of the Australian way of life. </para>
            <para>Language teaming is obviously <inline font-style="italic">of</inline> great importance in an integration programme, but it is not necessarily the central feature of it. Tan, in analysing the assimilation process, has interestingly pointed out that &#39;the popular belief is not correct that knowledge of English is a prerequisite for the satisfaction and identification of non-British immigrants. Much more frequently it is the satisfaction and identification of the immigrant that leads to any substantial progress in English. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">It is important to realise that the disadvantaged migrant family in Australia has a distrust of schools and a lack of knowledge about the aims and methods of teaching employed by teachers at schools which their children attend. Unless this ignorance and hostility is dispelled, the chances of the schools achieving good results with migrant children will be limited. These parents are unable to join school committees, mainly because of their own lack of English, and meeting procedures are too difficult with this extra disadvantage. There is an urgent need for &#39;contact&#39; social workers to provide links between migrant families and schools. &#39;Contact&#39; schemes have worked well in Canada and the United States of America. The cost of 100 contact social workers if employed by the Department of Education and Science would be approximately $500,000 annually. </para>
          <para>If an expanded programme for English instruction for larger numbers of migrants is to be put into operation, a large increase in expenditure will be necessary, An appropriation of $990,000 was made for the education of migrants in the 1969-70 financial year. This figure has proved totally inadequate, and an additional expenditure above this figure of $1m would need to be considered for an effective education programme. Professor Connell strongly recommended the introduction of day classes for mothers, the expansion of pre-embarkation and on-ship courses and semi-intensive part time courses for all migrants wishing to help themselves integrate into their new country. Already professional men receive allowances while undertaking courses. It is hard to imagine a more elitist approach than this. The average migrant who will be placed at a disadvantage, as will his children, receives no such special assistance. Australia should not be party to discriminatory treatment in favour of those who have already received a better education in their home country. </para>
          <para>In the policy speech of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Gorton)</inline> delivered in October a promise of $4m was made for the removal of difficulties of migrant children. This was to be the total grant spread over 3 years and took no account of the educational assistance required by adult migrants. Any worthwhile programme qf migrant education would cost in the vicinity of $4m annually. Clause 4 (1.) provides </para>
          <para>The courses of instruction to which this section relates are - </para>
          <list type="loweralpha">
            <item label="(a)">
              <para>courses in the English language: and </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(b)">
              <para>courses designed to impart an understanding of the rights and duties of an Australian citizen and of the way of living of the Australian people. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">Therefore the provisions of this Bill do not go far enough, even if we concede that paragraph (b) has some merit. So let us ensure thai our migrants have a proper understanding of their own language, or their own culture, and of our tongue, by the situation method if you like, but let us instruct them in all three concurrently. </para>
          <para>In addition to the subjects to be taught, let us end the practice of gathering together for language instruction people of various nationalities. While we talk much of integration, it seems to me that in practice we pursue assimilation. Whether we do this intentionally because we prefer assimilation to integration, or whether the determining factor is blind economic necessity, I have not yet determined, but the essential need of any integration programme is to keep together people who have an affinity of race or nationality, in order that they might strengthen each other during the period of integration, during that period of their lives in which they suffer greatly the inevitable tensions produced by cultural conflict and the material poverty which Professor Henderson tells us so many southern European migrants suffer. 1 am certain that such a practice alone would do much to reduce the numbers of students who abandon language instruction classes. Everyone knows the great binding power of small groups. Even S; Paul had a word to say about this. In Romans, chapter 1, verses 1 1 and 12, he said: </para>

            <para>For  i  long to see yon . . . that  1  may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith of both you and me. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">In conclusion, if we are to make provision in this Bill for the 2 groups of people to whom I have referred, namely the poorly educated adolescent and the poorly educated new arrival who is confined to the smaller community of the home, we must not only teach them our tongue but also we must relate it to their own language, their own culture and in classes of their own people and, more importantly, their teachers must speak and understand the language of the students. </para>

            <para>- The matter before the House is one on which I think members on both sides of the House have expressed concern over a considerable period of time; it is one which needs total and comprehensive treatment. There are provisions in the Bill before us which were presented to this House last year and which, had the Bill been proceeded with at that time, would have become law on the first day of July 1970. It is significant in the present circumstances that the proposed amendment which has been circulated to honourable members does not specify a date of application but in fact specifies the day on- which the Bill shall receive royal assent. I think that this is significant in view of the present economic policies which the Government is pursuing in order to cut down on expenditure. </para>

              <para>- I have read the second reading speech. I want to make one or two points and 1 want them to be quite clear. The Bill provides for expenditure on migrant education in both State and private schools. Also, it provides for adult education. However, the second reading speech does not indicate that the facilities for the leaching of children should also be used wherever practicable for the teaching of adults. This would seem to be a fairly reason-able usage of materials provided for a special purpose. The Bill also makes no mention that 1 can find - the Minister may be able to correct this - of the provision of additional facilities in State schools to provide this teaching capacity. I know of no school in my electorate, which has a high density of migrants, where additional classroom facilities exist for the provision of a special English class for migrants. It may be that by cramming children into other rooms, by using rooms for a purpose for which they were not intended, or by using school library facilities, accommodation can be made available. But, in the definitions contained in the Bill, capital equipment specifically excludes buildings. </para>

          <para>In the most densely migrant populated section of my electorate, Bell Park, a State technical school has existed for the last 4 years and, at this stage, it has no permanent structure whatsoever. This is an area where the children are more in need of this type of instruction and this type of basic English training than in other areas where better facilities are provided. The State education departments have been directed already to cut down their programmes for the next financial year. They have been told already that they should cut down on teacher training. If. in 4 years, an education department cannot construct even one permanent technical school building in an area of great need. I hardly think that it is likely to be able to provide classroom facilities to give effect to the provisions of this Bill. </para>
          <para>A  number of Bills which have been passed by this Parliament in recent years depend on the co-operation of and the expenditure of money by Slate governments to operate successfully. Victoria, which has a Government of the same political complexion as the Federal Government, has refused to co-operate with respect to many of these Bills because it claims, rightly or wrongly, that it cannot afford the expenditure required to implement the proposals contained in those Bills. Thus, any benefit which may exist in the Bills just does not apply. The success or Otherwise of this Bill will depend on the level to which State education departments are prepared and are able to co-operate. 1 am quite sure that the departments will wish to co-operate and will do everything possible to enable the Bill to succeed. T am not sure whether the State treasuries will do likewise. Their priorities may or may not be different. Rightly or wrongly the State governments feel that a far greater expenditure should have been forthcoming from the Commonwealth Government over an extended period on education, housing and other social activites connected with the establishment of migrants here. </para>
          <para>Now, the migrant child of school age quite obviously is at a very distinct disadvantage on arrival in Australia and any new facilities that will give that child a better chance to proceed at a normal rate in the early periods of its education after arrival here will be welcome. The migrant child of secondary school age has an almost impossible task because that child lacks the cultural and historical background to cope with our education system. As that child has not passed through our primary school system he or she is in a very serious situation. These children need help. They need help quickly. </para>
          <para>J wish to deal now with another area covered in the Bill, adult migrant education. It is obvious to any member who has a large migrant population in his electorate that the female adult is very slow normally to learn the language. The cause for this largely is that whilst the husband goes to work and is forced to learn the language, the wife is able to converse with those around her in the language <inline font-style="italic">rf</inline> the country of her birth. Unless there are very young children who in many cases do not learn their native tongue, the need for high pressure involvement to learn a new language is not nearly as urgent for the female as it is for the male who must go to work and therefore has to have some smattering of English. Migrants mainly find unskilled jobs and if they are prepared to work under conditions which most trade unions would not accept they can earn high incomes. But they are seriously disadvantaged. </para>
          <para>The honourable member for Boothby <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McLeay)</inline> said that he was disappointed with an immigration agreement that we had wilh Yugoslavia because of the small number of skilled people who were coming to Australia from that country. He said that, under that agreement, Australia was promised higher numbers of skilled people. My understanding is that the authorities in Yugoslavia also are rather upset about our failure to recognise the trade qualifications of migrants. They claim that they can send to Germany people whose trade qualifications will be recognised in that country and that those people will be able to work there at their trades. Germany is far closer to their homeland than Australia. Yet, the skills of Yugoslavs sent to Australia are not recognised and migrants cannot practise their trades here. They leave their homeland as tradesmen and arrive in Australia as unskilled workers. This is not something which can be altered by the provisions of this Bill, but I think that it is something which should be clarified. Countries will not send skilled people to Australia or advise them to come to Australia if, on arrival in Australia, they are classified as unskilled. I do not believe that any country can be expected to do this especially if an alternative is available, and apparently it is available in Western Europe. </para>
          <para>I wish to deal with one or two other aspects of the Bill which concern me.  1  hope that the Minister, if he has not done so already, will clarify these points.  1  mentioned one a moment ago. This is the use of school buildings. The Bill provides that equipment, etc., will be provided in State or independent schools as the Department sees necessary. The Bill provides also - apparently separately - for adult education. With respect to laboratory type equipment especially, I believe that this equipment should be supplied to independent or state schools on the basis that it will be made available for use in adult education courses outside normal school hours. This would seem to be a reasonably economic use of a facility. I would think that in most of the larger towns outside the metropolitan area high schools or primary schools - in the case of adults most likely it would be high schools - would be as central and as useful as anywhere else in a community as places at which to provide adult education courses.  1  hope that we will not see taking place in the expenditure of this money a duplication of facilities which may or may not help but which would be less likely to help. </para>
          <para>In some areas, notably in the inner city suburbs and in some specific areas of the larger provincial cities, there are very heavy concentrations of migrants. In these areas normally there are also very heavy concentrations of young children, ft would be of great help if pre-school children could be given the facilities to provide them with basic teaching in English to bring them at least up to the level of Australian children in their community. In the inner metropolitan areas where high rise flats and such like are developing, I hope that the educational standard of migrant children will be raised to a level where opportunities to obtain Commonwealth scholarships, etc., later in their education will be available. </para>
          <para>A child which gets to primary school without a basic knowledge of English and without a fairly good understanding ot our culture does not obtain a Commonwealth scholarship later in life. That is one of the statistical facts which can be seen by examining to whom and where Commonwealth scholarships are granted. These are 2 matters that I raise. It could be very effective at the pre-school level if English training of a primary nature could be given to children, <inline font-style="italic">f</inline> well remember the case of a young German child who lived near us. His grandmother came to Australia. He spoke about 4 words of German and about  3  words of English in each sentence. Until he went to kindergarten where practically all children spoke English, his English language, to say the least, was somewhat mixed up. But he will go to school because his brothers have gone to ? choo I and he will progress in the normal fashion through our schools. In areas where there are large concentrations of migrants - there are areas where  70  per cent,  80  per cent and up to  90  per cent of the population are migrants - the ability to mix or the value of mixing with children who talk English does not exist, and therefore the migrant children are severely handicapped when they begin school. If they arrive at the preparatory stage of schooling without a background knowledge of English, they do not catch up in later life. There is one other matter in the Bill which I have not heard anyone mention, and that is citizenship training. I am not exactly sure what is meant by this phraseology. </para>

Those functions were mainly paid for by other political parties, and I suppose it was their right to say that. But the point is that citizenship is a very controversial subject. Migrants arriving in Australia will not get a vote for  5  years after their arrival unless they are English migrants, who usually can speak English. </para>

              <para>- We can go to some parts of the British Isles - I will not specify which parts - and when we start talking to the population we are not sure whether we can talk English or whether they can talk English, but certainly we do not talk the same language. There is provision in the Bill for citizenship training. Migrants other than British migrants will not have a vote in Australia for 5 years after their arrival. So 1 would hope that citizenship training deals largely with conditions which exist in Australia. The type of social struct rues and prejudices which exist in Australia should be part of the programme in which migrants are given instruction. </para>

          <para>I find, as I think most honourable members would, that migrants, especially newly arrived migrants, have very exaggerated ideas of what they can expect from our social welfare structure. They do not appreciate fully the type of health scheme we have. Many of them come here expecting the type of health scheme they had in their own countries. These are matters on which I think migrants should receive some pre-education or preinstruction. I do not envisage a booklet which is written in English or their own language and which most likely is couched in terms that they cannot understand anyway. Some pre-instruction in these areas would be of great benefit to the migrant and would help to make him happy on arrival in Australia and make him want to stay. I am of the opinion that most migrants who want to leave Australia decide before they even arrive here or in their first few weeks in Australia that they are not going to stay. Tt is in these areas that I think there is great scope for improvement in our public relations with migrants coming to Australia. </para>
          <para>The Minister may correct me if I am wrong, birt my understanding is that persons who have left Australia and returned to their own country cannot be used on ships as instructors for migrants unless they have been out of Australia for at least 2 years. </para>

              <para>- 1 have letters to that effect, but it does not matter. I think that the Department wherever possible should avail itself of qualified people who have returned to their homeland and who are coming back to Australia and should use their knowledge of the country for the instruction of other migrants. For instance. English migrants especially who are returning to Australia are better able to explain the benefits that migrants wilt receive in Australia or what goes on in Australia as compared with the position in their own countries. They have a better knowledge of the circumstances from which a migrant comes than do even qualified Australians. These are only minor things but I think they are important to migrants. My experience, as 1 said before, is that most disillusioned migrants are disillusioned before they get here. The less time there is between a person leaving Australia and being used as an instructor the more comprehensive and contemporary will be the advice that he gives. Anyone who left Australia more than 2 years ago and who is coming back today would obviously be giving wrong advice because the situation has changed so greatly. He may even think that the Government still has a majority of 42 in the House of Representatives. </para>

But the Bill does go some way towards providing the types of facilities which are and which have been for a number of years needed not only by the migrant population but by many hundreds of thousands of culturally underprivileged Australians, especially those in the centres of our great cities and those who will be crowded into the 1975 slums which are being built with Commonwealth money today. </para>

            <para>- This is one of the few occasions on which we are able to have a fairly close debate upon the migration system. We face the Minister for Immigration <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> across the House. He. of course, has one of Australia&#39;s largest social adventures on his hands. I am one of those who spend a lot of their time trying to prevent him deporting people. I suppose his most abysmal failure is that he did not deport the English cricket team at about 1 1 o&#39;clock this morning. On the other hand, he has at his disposal a very effective Department. \ believe that the general approach we have made to immigration has been fairly effective but that our most miserable failure has been in the way we have approached particularly :he children who have arrived here as a result of the migration scheme. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>How tough can life be for a person who arrives here from Greece, Turkey, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Yugoslavia or any part of southern Europe? They are perhaps a little more disadvantaged than those from northern Europe. When they arrive here the parents will almost certainly be employed in occupations in which salaries and wages are at a low level. Secondly, they will probably start their life here in a very crowded suburban street where life will be not tough but certainly not gentle and not very pleasant. When the children turn up at the school they will find that all the odds are against their learning English. In school they will not be associating with people who speak very good English. In the school grounds of many of the inner suburban areas it is not English that one hears; it is strine of the roughest sort. So the child starts miles behind. I believe that the tone of our amendment is correct in that it deplores the fact that it has taken all these years for the Government to do something about migration education. </para>
          <para>I want to challenge for a moment the remarks that the honourable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Dobie)</inline> made in reply to my colleague, the honourable member for Burke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Keith Johnson).</inline> The honourable member for Burke remarked that it was not a serious disadvantage to many adults not to be able to speak English. 1 believe that that is true. The honourable member for Cook took him to task about that. It is possible to live in Brunswick or Coburg and never use a word of English. All the facilities there are available to a migrant.  His  neighbours probably speak the same language as himself. At his work place he can get along with his native language, as he can in the shops. Of course, this is a serious disadvantage to those who want to learn English. This is a problem of some magnitude. 1 believe the approach to it here this afternoon by the Minister and by the Department is still very perfunctory indeed. </para>
          <para>While I am on my feet I want to pay a tribute to the Australian community. 1 believe it is a remarkable social achievement that so many hundreds of thousands of people from other countries have been able to move into our community in the way they have without creating great social tensions. I represent one of the most heavily concentrated areas of new Australians or migrants, call them what we will. I sense that there is very little social tension. The Australian community has adopted an attitude of great maturity and has received the migrants to its bosom in a very hospitable way, and not often enough does the community get this tribute paid to it. </para>
          <para>I want to concentrate on the question of school children and what should be done in the schools and for the schools. This problem is contemporaneous with the migration system. It has existed since the inception of the migration scheme. From the day the first ship arrived with perhaps 1,200 or 1,500 migrants on it, of which perhaps 300 or 400 were of school age, the problem started to expand, and it has been aggrevated by every shipload and every aeroplane load that has arrived since. Now 22 or 23 years after the beginning of this scheme we are taking up some of the challenge although. I believe, still in a very perfunctory way. There can be no denying that immigration is an absolute Commonwealth responsibility. It is the responsibility of nobody else, lt is not good enough for the Minister to pour literally tens of thousands of migrants into Victoria, let them try to survive under the tender mercies of the Bolte Government and then say that it is a State matter to supply education and hospitals and to build the roads. The Commonwealth ought to have long since accepted a more direct responsibility, particularly as far as education is concerned. </para>
          <para>I want to outline the position in my own electorate. As honourable members may be aware, I represent the suburb&#39;! of Brunswick and Coburg in Melbourne. They are both highly concentrated. They are not slum areas in the strict sense but they are very densely populated. For instance, Brunswick has a population of 52.000 people in about 2,600 acres or about 4 square miles. According to the 1966 census - the figure has increased a good deal since then - in Brunswick there were 10.105 people who were born in Italy and 6,840 people who were born in Greece. That is a total of 16,945 people alone in my electorate who were born in Italy and Greece. As far as I can tell from a run through the 1966 census this is the highest concentration of Italians and Greeks in Australia. This means that of all the people in Australia who were born in ItalY one in  15 lives in my electorate, of all the  people  born in Greece one in 22 lives in my electorate and of those born in Malta, one in 17 lives in my electorate. So to those two communities this is a real social problem and one for which 1 will place before the House this afternoon a plea for special action. There are a few other similar suburbs in Melbourne of which perhaps Prahran, Richmond and Northcote may well be some, but Brunswick is the one that is the most hard pressed as far as education is concerned. </para>
          <para>Honourable members ought to examine this question and really think of the problems when one in 5 of the community in Brunswick 4 or 5 years ago - it is more now - were born in Italy. Many of them are still unable <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> speak English. They all have increasing families although in fact they are probably better off even if they are at the Australian poverty line than they were in Italy. 1 believe that these 3 or 4 suburbs in Melbourne, of which I think Brunswick, ought to be the principal beneficiary - Coburg is another and there are perhaps 2 or 3 in Sydney - ought to have some special Commonwealth effort spent on them in the form of capital works, but I will come to that in a moment. Just to ensure that it would be on the record that we understand the magnitude of the problem as far as the schools themselves are concerned I went round the schools and go! from them the most recent statistics. I do not happen to have them all here, nor would it be appropriate to place them on record if I did. </para>
          <para>Let us take the Princess Hill primary school as an example. One of the interesting facts is that generally speaking the situation is a little less educationally disastrous in the primary schools than it is in the secondary schools. If a boy or girl aged 12, 13 or 14 years turns up in the school and cannot speak a word of English there arc 2 problems. In the secondary school or technical school the position is hopeless. If they turn up in the primary school at grades 1, 2 or 3 the solution seems to come but pretty slowly. They never really catch up unless they are especially bright but the position is not quite as hopeless. Figures given to me last year for the Princess Hill primary school, for instance, showed that 15 children in grade 6 needed remedial English lessons, 10 in grade 5, 22 in grade 4, 14 in grade 3 and 5 in grade 2. It just happens that I have these figures with me. Some other schools are much more hard pressed but in this school with 66 children in need of remedial English lessons there is a need for perhaps 3 special teachers. 1 think they have one coming at some time in the near future. But Princes Hill is not the most hard pressed in that regard. </para>
          <para>Four years ago ray colleague the State member for Brunswick West, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Campbell</inline> Turnbull, who has been pretty assiduous about these matters, had statistics prepared for the schools in the area. 1 will just name one, the Slate school at No. 1213 Brunswick. These are big schools with between 400 and 900 students. Seventy-eight per cent of the pupils in grade 1A were new Australian children, 79 per cent in grade IB, 90 per cent in grade IC, 76 per cent in grade ID, 70 per cent in grade IE, 75 per cent in grade IF, 85 per cent in grade 1G and so on down to 58 per cent in the special rural school which is conducted for the purposes of training. Honourable members should try to imagine the situation of the teacher faced with these classes, lt would be bad enough if they were all people who spoke the same language, but that is not the case. I visited Moreland primary school last year just to see how they were going. The figures there are very similar. 1 walked in one morning as school was starting and said to the Headmaster: &#39;Well, they have got a migrant education Bill on the stocks at our place. What is your position?&#39; He said: &#39;You are one of the leaders of the nation. Solve this for me.&#39; He handed me 3 notes he had received that morning, one in Turkish, one in Greek and one in Italian. </para>
          <para>These are insuperable problems when the parents turn up and cannot speak English. When the teacher faces the class he might even have been taught French at some time - irrelevant as it might be in the Australian education system - but how does he handle the Turks, the Greeks and the Albanians? At that time that school had 16 different language groups as far as we could determine. Therefore we must do something much more dramatic than what is proposed here, lt is a step in the right direction but it is a very small step indeed. I believe that in Brunswick, which, as I said, is only 4 square miles in area  or the size of a decent farm where some honourable members come from, in Coburg and probably in Richmond and Northcote  -  I do not know the geography of Sydney so well - the only solution to the problem seems to be to take a special building and make it a school in which for perhaps 6 months - I am not sure of the time element - one concentrates on getting the children integrated into the English language. Some people will say: You are going to segregate them.&#39; This, of course, is not the issue. They are no more segregated than they would be in the school grounds. Two or 3 Turks, say, who arrive at one of the primary schools and cannot speak a word of any language that anybody else can speak can be just as lonely as if they were segregated somewhere on their own. </para>
          <para>I do not believe there is any solution to this other than a capital works programme by the Commonwealth. That is why it is in our amendment. The States will not do it so we must do it. I am putting this on the record and  1  hope that the Minister for Immigration, Treasury officials and all the other people concerned take notice of it.I know it is probably not the Minister&#39;s fault. In some ways he appears to be humane, and he has even had a progressive idea now and again. The Commonwealth must accept that kind of responsibility in these half dozen Melbourne communities of which I think Brunswick is pre-eminent. None of the people of course, would have to travel more than a mile or two to the school. That is the first element. The second question is. of course, that of teachers. We will not get anywhere with the approach that we have taken so far as is shown by the very meagre number of teachers who have turned up. </para>
          <para>When &#91; raised this matter last week with all the appropriate Ministers, both State and Federal, the Victorian Minister for Education, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Thompson,</inline> let me have some figures which show that Brunswick primary school will have 2, Brunswick East1, Brunswick North 3, Brunswick South 2, Brunswick South West 1, and Brunswick West 1. In the high schools Brunswick will have 2, Brunswick girls 1 and Princess Hill 1. Let us consider for a moment the Brunswick girls school. I know for a fact that of the 500 or so girls at the school about 300 really need special English teaching. Apart from any other consideration it is a very deprived area educationally, anyhow. The school grounds are miserable, the buildings outdated, antiquated and obsolescent and the equipment is poor. This also means that as the community is poor in comparison with the rest of Victoria -I presume this happens in other States - there are no resources available from parent support. One of the results of the migration scheme to many of the schools in this area has been that where 15 or 20 years ago there was a fairly vigorous parent body, although not as vigorous as it ought to be and as it is, say, in Canberra or somewhere else because these people are living at the lowest level of wages and salaries, organisations like mothers&#39; clubs, as we call them in Victoria, and school committees get no parent support at all. Moreland primary school, which one might say was a prosperous looking school 10 or 12 years ago, has become a completely deprived school because there is no parent support to keep up the supply of extras that are needed. I believe that these are special cases and that the Commonwealth must step into the area of migrant education in this way. ThereforeI am putting it on record that until we approach the problem in this way we will not get anywhere. The Minister spoke about special equipment such as mini language laboratories. If we have the money to pour into other areas there should be money for this sort of equipment. </para>

                <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr Speaker,</inline>earlierI was discussing the Immigration (Education) Bill and the Opposition&#39;s proposal that the Government should have made provision for capital works. I was putting the case that at least in my electorate, irrespective of what is done or how much money is made available, unless some new buildings and capital facilities are provided the Government&#39;s intention would be aborted. Brunswick and Coburg, 2 centres in my electorate, have one of the greatest concentrations of migrants in Australia. The 1966 census shows that more than 10,000 Italians and nearly 5,000 Greeks lived in Brunswick and that about 7,000 Italians and 2,000 </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para class="block">Greeks lived in Coburg. Such a concentration of people is of significant social importance. The community which has taken these people into its schools and made available all the other facilities is entitled to the kind of support which we urge should be given. </para>
          <para>The children of migrant families are entitled to this consideration. In my view there is no other way in which we can approach this problem particularly in areas such as those I have mentioned. The Brunswick Girls School is a typical example of the present situation. As I pointed out no matter how many teachers are supplied, there is nothing they can do with the equipment that may be provided because of inadequate accommodation. The inadequacy of the buildings generally and of the grounds makes it impossible for them to cope. That school needs special equipment, including many language laboratories, console laboratories and it also needs teachers trained in the use of these facilities. It also needs special colour facilities for projection. I believe that the error here is that the Government is still relying too much upon State resources. The State resources are meagre in the extreme. </para>
          <para>I approached the Minister of Education in Victoria about this matter to find out what had happened. I visited about half a dozen schools at the beginning of the new school year. Although the Minister said in reply to the honourable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Scholes)</inline> that despite the fact that this legislation had been hanging fire for 12 months, the machinery had been put into operation. A handful of teachers has already started in the schools but according to the Minister of Education in Victoria as far as that State is concerned the Department has purchased equipment costing about $53,000 to be used exclusively for the teaching of English and that no further finance is at present available but a request has been made to the Commonwealth for a supplementary grant for further purchases. I have no doubt that the Government will accede to that request. On the other hand that State is likely to be one of the victims of the kind of phoney financial situation that has been created at the moment. As I have already said a request has been made to the Commonwealth for additional finance to service the equipment needs of other schools.  I  believe that the approach to this matter is still too perfunctory altogether. </para>
          <para>Several questions have been raised in this debate about the position of the Australian people regarding the kind of migrants that come here. The honourable member for Prospect <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Klugman)</inline> said that we cannot pose value judgments - that there are strong humane reasons why anybody should be able to come to Australia. I personally do not hold the views held by a lot of people in this House that to allow a reasonable number of people of a different colour of skin into this country would create difficulties. I do not believe that this is the case but it is a subject which has never been debated rationally in this country even though I admit there are strong differences of opinion. I represent an area in which there are large numbers of people, with almost a total lack of affinity with Australians, who have been admitted to the community reasonably successfully. They have to battle at first. This would apply particularly to Turks. They have no affinity with the Australian community except perhaps the fact that they have the same skin colour. I have seen other people who have come into that community who have total affinity except for their skin colour. 1 would like to be given an adequate explanation from all those people who are terribly worried about this matter - I realise that it creates problems in people&#39;s minds - as to exactly why the almost total affinity of a Pakistani engineer makes him more difficult to assimilate than a Turk with a total lack of affinity except for the colour of his skin which is supposed to make him acceptable I believe the community has to be much more mature in its examination of this problem. I do not know what the answers are. I can only hope that we can engender a public debate in which people can discuss it rationally in. the face of the fact that we do live in a multi-racial world. </para>

            <para>- I am pleased to follow the honourable member for Wills <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bryant).</inline> I agree with him when he says that we are the victims of a great many racial myths. &#91; have always found it a source of amusement when I have had to sign an immigration form for entry to the United States of America, for example. I have always been asked  whether I am a Caucasian. I never quite understood why I should be related to the Caucasus which as everyone knows is part of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. When I have explained to the poor immigration officer who had put the question that I was not really a citizen of the Soviet Union he has said, &#39;No, it does not mean that&#39;. I always asked what in fact it did mean and it was always explained to me that it means that I am more or less white. This would depend on how much  sunbaking  I had done. Let me be quite blunt about this: If this is done on anthropological grounds the poor old United States is a little bit out of date. T have always explained to the immigration officers in great detail - I am happy to be patient with them - that if I am an Aboriginal I can be quite black and I am also a Caucasian anthropologically speaking. When this has happened the immigration officer has looked at me with some horror and has said that apparently Congress had not heard about it. This may be its trouble. It may be some of our trouble too because these are simply movable myths. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>To be more specific in relation to the measure before us, this Bill comes down against a background of widespread questioning of our immigration programme. I want to say at the outset that the new provisions for migrant education are long overdue and most welcome. My distinguished colleague the honourable member for Grayndler <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Daly)</inline> has said that the Opposition will not oppose this Bill. Of course we will not. We on this side commend the Bill. What the honourable member for Grayndler has said by way of the amendment is that what the Bill provides should have been done before. I think it is not a bad idea for us to acknowledge that even collectively as the Commonwealth Parliament, and more specifically the Government, we have been guilty of a sin of omission in this regard and therefore I support the amendment. </para>
          <para>There is no doubt in my mind that there has been pressure for this kind of action for  20  years. In my own constituency of Riverina in 1 class in I school there has on occasions been only  2  children with what might be called an old Australian background. I mean children who were born in Australia and who have grandparents who were born in Australia. This did not create any great tensions for those  2  Australian children but of course this is not the problem. The problem facing us is that the young people who come here have to face up to great difficulties at this critical time in their young life because of an inability to tackle examinations and instruction in the English language. Let us not confuse this difficulty with any of the general problems of integration. I want to make this distinction and I hope the distinction can be made in this debate this evening because there are  2  separate problems involved. </para>
          <para>The honourable member for Boothby <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McLeay)</inline> made some references with which I will deal in passing a little later but one of the things about which he should be assured is that even in a location such as the one I have described with an overwhelming migrant intake which must have come about to give a minority of 2  Australians in the  1  class, where there is a healthy decentralised community the problems of integration can be overcome. This has been done very successfully in the Mumimbidgee irrigation areas. There we have the heaviest concentration of migrants in any inland areas but we also have the highest percentage of citizenship of any major migrant intake area in the nation. This has been demonstrated by the findings and investigations of the Department of Immigration. </para>
          <para>It has been said that the supreme test of integration is marriage. I do not want to defend that proposition.  1  might not even agree with it. But if we accept it as a measure of integration it is interesting to note that I marriage in  3  in the Mumimbidgee Irrigation Area, that central area which I mentioned, is between people of different backgrounds. I think we ought to be quite clear in our minds that when we are talking about the difficulties children have in tackling the language and in preparing themselves for the skills they should have in a modern industrial society we are talking about something a little different from integration. One might think that one follows the other, but there are  2  different approaches to the question. Even with the ramshackle machinery we have had for  20  years to care for the young people who come to this country we have still managed, in a good healthy environment, to be able to obtain the maximum -  1 do not say optimum - degree of integration compared with any area of migrant intake in any country. 1 want to make that point very clear. </para>
          <para>At the same time other factors in the education of children should be taken into account. It is impossible in our country in the 1970s to achieve the degree of education which is necessary for progress in our society unless there is the stimulus to learn at home. That statement brings us to the question of the quality of life. We have to do more than just look at the children&#39;s education in the schools. We have to look at where they are. I want to draw attention again to one of the failures of our own programme. The failure is associated with the fact that we are pouring people into overcrowded, overcentralised capital cities which are becoming increasingly polluted both in the atmosphere and in the spirit. The problem is exemplified in south Sydney where half the people in this most important area have originated from 3 areas 10,000 miles from here. The other half of the population is made up of deserted wives living in high rise dwellings, service wives without their husbands and refugee Aboriginals from the depressed countryside. It is into this incredibly fragmented society that we are putting young migrant children. It is an impossible situation for their learning and their settlement and yet that is where they are. I pay a tribute to the local authorities which struggle valiantly to do their best. The schools with their inadequate structures are unable to cater for the large numbers of young people that come in from outside. They struggle valiantly. Everyone does his best. But there is an inbuilt difficulty in such localities as that. This applies to every major city. It applies to all of the suburbs, which are overtaxed and overcrowded. So the fundamental problem is not going to be solved even by this welcome measure. The fundamental problem is that we are putting migrants and Australians into situations fraught with dangers for the future of our people. This has to be rectified if we are going to overcome the tensions, the pressures and the inequalities that have been suffered by migrant and Australian alike. </para>
          <para>I understand the problem very cleary when it comes to questioning the migration programme. I think we should refer to this because after all we are debating a Bill which provides money at this time of supposed austerity to do some thing in relation to migration when there are voices raised <inline font-style="italic">in,</inline> the community saying: &#39;Stop it. Finish it. We must have no more of it.&#39; They are very dogmatic voices. I spoke to the Minister for Immigration <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> before I rose in this debate. I was going to say something harsh and much more pointed because I understood that the Government had already decided to make a significant cut in the programme while an investigation has just been launched to find out whether it is beneficial or not. That would have been the act of a reckless cowboy riding into a town for an overnight stand. But the Minister said: &#39;No. We are not going to cut it. We have not really made up our minds yet.&#39; I welcome that remark, because there is no point in having an investigation of the facts saying: Whether it is good or bad we are not going to wait for the results. We are going to make a cut.&#39; I accept the Minister&#39;s assurance that the cut has not been made in those terms. I will say in relation to the debate on migration that in Australia we do not have the sort of information- </para>

              <para>- Thank you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker.</inline> I feel that the point has been missed, but if we do have better after dinner attention the honourable member may pick it up. The point 1 was going to make was whether we are going to spend this money on a programme which it has been advocated should be reduced or obviated altogether and set to one side. The Opposition has indicated through the honourable member for Grayndler that when we vote we are going to be quite unanimous about accepting this legislation, with the stricture and with the criticism for its tardiness. Nevertheless, we want it. We have wanted to see it for a long time and we are going to have it. But surely to goodness in this national forum we have to relate the action we are taking to the reality of whether we are <inline font-style="italic">going</inline> to continue this programme. At this stage we have not the information before us to be dogmatic. We are not in a position to say that migration is inflationary or anti-inflationary in our situation. If honourable members wanted me to make out a case tonight I could refer to the experience of Great Britain, France, Canada and many other countries. I submit that we have not reached this stage, so let us pursue the investigations which are under way before we become dogmatic. </para>

          <para>The problems of the children of migrants and the education of migrants are bound up with the demographic distribution of population in our community It is quite incredible that the demographic centre of Australia has not changed since the census of 1911. Modesty almost prohibits me from mentioning that the demographic centre of Australia happens to be in Merriwagga. 1 will not say what electorate that is in. This is a finding of the Bureau of Census and Statistic: which establishes that since the first census in our country in 1911 there has been no significant change at all in the distribution! of population. This is related to the problems of migrants, because in a situation of over-centralisation and overcrowding the problems are multiplied. These are the problems that we face in relation to this measure. 1 suggest that when we have an investigation of what we should be doing with the migrants coming into our country we should also direct attention to the locations where they are settling. I am not saying the locations to which they arc directed, because there is no direction made. There is an inevitability in our present economic and planning situation - or lack of planning situation - that they will end up in an overcrowded location. I wanted to make that point very plain, because when we apply ourselves to this problem we should not limit our considerations for the classrooms and the capital expenditure needed to enable children to be properly educated. The problem is related to the overall disposition of our population and to the declining quality of life of Australians and migrants alike. I wanted to make that point clear. Before I get to the specific questions 1 wish to ask of the Minister on this measure I shall refer in passing to the matters that were directed to me personally by the honourable member for Boothby <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Mclean who described my comments in relation to some migrants in the community as quite asinine. 1 take it as a compliment from the honourable member for Boothby that he should refer to my comments in that way. It is important for the morale of migrant children from wherever they come - and it was indicated that we now have migrant children coming from Asia, Europe and indeed all the continents of the world - that there is no misunderstanding in the minds of those children about the attitude of the Australian people to them. This is why 1 addressed an appeal while I was overseas recently to the Minister for Immigration to reject completely and very bluntly the statements made by the Victorian Immigration Minister, Mr Vance Dickie. Wherever I went - and I followed in your footsteps in some regards, Mr Speaker, and I realise you cannot comment from the Chair - he was a monumental embarrassment to the nation. He caused resentment amongst the most conservative Australians who said that this man did not speak for our people, did not speak even for the Government and, I am sure, did not speak for the Minister for Immigration who sits at the table. T would never insult him by suggesting that he had adopted such an extreme attitude as to talk about 99 per cent of those with dark blood being rejected-</inline></para>

              <para>- Thank you. I appreciate that, for it is important. The other point I wanted to make was in relation to new arrivals. The Minister has indicated there will be facilities for those who are in numbers? The honourable member for Wills <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bryant)</inline> and the honourable member for Grayndler <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Daly)</inline> referred to the fact that wherever there are major numbers there are also individuals. I direct the Minister&#39;s attention to the fact that they are individuals and I will give one quick example. A young man who arrived from Venezuela was proficient to matriculation standard in all subjects, including Spanish and Italian. He reached Australia on the eve of his matriculation examinations but was not able to tackle the examinations in English. This was an isolated case. Where does he stand under this legislation? He came with 2 languages to matriculant standard. He was not able to make it in English immediately. Where does he stand as an individual as against the mass attack in the capital cities? I ask the Minister whether he has directed his attention to the absorption centres in Israel which has taken in more migrants per capita than any other nation in the world, lt has taken people - starting at the top - from rural, professional and urban walks of life. They enter various categories of interest and professionalism and in 12 weeks they are able to go into their callings whether they are doctors, plumbers, dentists or what have you. I ask the Minister whether he has made a study of this and whether he will apply the great knowledge gained there over 21 years. These are some of the questions I wish to pose in relation to this n: measure </para>

          </continue>
          <para>In summation, 1 hope that this measure will go some way after 20 years towards relieving the hardship and disadvantage of many migrant children. It does meet the struggles and desires of people in migration, the Good Neighbour Movement. I am particularly pleased and I know they will be particularly pleased that this measure has come down. Let us admit our mistakes in the past, say we are sorry and will do better in future. I commend to the Minister the thought: Delayed we might have been but let us unite in doing better in the future. </para>

            <para>- The Bill before the House is a particularly vital one and its importance has been well stressed by honourable members on both sides. This legislation is in fact proposed because of the basic importance of education to successful migrant integration. It relates to new initiatives in the area of adult migrant education, to the greater provision of fulltime intensive courses of instruction, and to the area of child migrant education. I have listened with considerable interest to the large number of constructive suggestions which have been put forward by both sides of the House in what has been a very wide ranging debate. It is, of course, quite impossible for me at this time to deal individually with all the points which have been brought forward. My purpose will be to concentrate on some of the more basic issues raised and the questions posed by individual members. Those matters which I am unable to deal with because of the problem of time I will take up in writing with the particular members. I need hardly say at the outset that the amendment moved by the Opposition is totally unacceptable to the Government. </para>

              <para>- The honourable member tor Grayndler <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Daly)</inline> may well be surprised but it certainly will not be a surprise to any honourable member on this side of the House. The Opposition has charged that there has been an inordinate delay by the Government in introducing a comprehensive programme of migrant education. The introduction of any major new initiative by a government can, of course, be subjected to this charge by an opposition I want to make it perfectly clear that the new initiatives which have been the subject of discussion in the debate on this Bill have not waited until this time for their implementation. They have in fact been taking place since the Bill was first brought down in the second reading speech in this House. I also say quite clearly that I am more concerned with the forward development of this programme in future years than to attempt tonight to justify past events to honourable members opposite. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The amendment ignores the substantial measures taken since the early days of post war immigration by this Government and by the government before it to develop a comprehensive programme of migrant education. It was in 1947 when at the initiative of the then Minister for Immigration, the now Right Honourable Arthur Calwell, agreement was reached between the Commonwealth Government and the Preparatory Commission of the International Refugee Organisation on a scheme for the admission of refugees and displaced persons from Europe that the first action was taken to formulate a migration education programme which involved at that time both the teaching of English and an appreciation of Australian life. My first point is that the background of this Bill goes back a very long period of time. It was in 1947 that the first migrant education officers were appointed in overseas countries, a shipboard education programme was introduced and the groundwork was laid for what has since become an extensive programme of continuation classes, radio and correspondence courses to reach the adult migrant community in Australia. Of course, this is a position which has never remained static. It has involved surveys in concert with the States and clearly some time was required in order to marshal essential information before positive action could be taken to isolate those areas of need upon which an effective programme could be well constructed. These surveys related not only to adult migrants but also to migrant children in the schools. </para>
          <para>In February 1960 a special committee of the Commonwealth Immigration Advisory Council submitted a report on the progress and assimilation of migrant children in Australia. This involved a study of both pre-school children and children in primary and secondary schools, a survey of schools in which migrant children were enrolled and consultation with their teachers. The Department of Immigration again took the initiative in 1962 in conducting a survey of &#39;Abandonment from Migrant Education Classes in Victoria&#39;. In late 1967 and early 1968 the Department initiated the planning of a major survey of the educational needs of both adult and child migrants, and this led to the report on the situation of migrant children in schools in New South Wales which has provided such an important basis for the new initiatives for child migrant education. </para>
          <para>Complementary studies were undertaken at the same time by my Department which again studied the abandonment rate from continuation classes and the special needs of migrant women and adolescent migrants. These surveys, together with experience gathered over the years, have led to the current policy of developing accelerated forms of instruction to supplement the long term continuation programme and the need for specialisation through courses of instruction orientated towards the particular needs of individual groups of migrants. Inevitably, however, the Government has been obliged to concentrate its efforts on the adult migrant education programme, it being generally accepted that the responsibility for migrant children in schools was that of the State Education Departments. It is significant to note that it was not until towards the end of the 1960s that the States themselves began to appreciate the need for special and additional measures for migrant children. </para>
          <para>In a large measure this situation had developed as the result of an increase in the intake of non-English speaking migrant families. There was also, as a result of the surveys undertaken, a much better appreciation of the problem which existed. What I am therefore saying to the House is that migrant education in Australia has just not commenced with the inception of the Bill before the House; that there is a long history of development; and that this Bill is in fact the culmination of many efforts which have been made in past years. </para>
          <para>The second major point in the amendment moved by the Opposition concerns the lack of financial assistance for the provision of capital equipment, including buildings, and this was the particular point raised in the House by the honourable member for Grayndler and also, I recall, by the honourable member for Burke(Mr Keith Johnson). Of course, the Opposition always can enjoy the luxury of complaining that services provided by this Government are insufficient without at the same time having the responsibility to provide the funds which are required in order that those expenditures can take place. But I say tonight that, consistent with the funds available, programmes have been developed which include the provision of capital equipment of the language laboratory type to all schools where special teachers are employed. </para>
          <para>Expenditure this year on migrant education represents an increase of 166 per cent over the funds available last financial year and that, I am sure, will be seen on either side of the House as a measure of very considerable progress indeed. The funds available this financial year have  been  sufficient to provide equipment to some 277 schools.  This  does not represent all of  the  schools where special teachers are employed, but it is important that the first need is for special teachers and for essential teaching and learning materials and teaching aids of the less sophisticated type. Laboratory type equipment is also desirable and of course of great advantage, but it is not in fact absolutely essential. </para>
          <para>To this stage the Government has not been able to accept the proposition that buildings and classrooms in particular should be a charge on the migrant education vote, and there are reasons for this which I shall deal with shortly. </para>
          <para>Firstly, let me emphasise the point that immigration is not totally a Commonwealth responsibility. Since the post-war period it has been regarded as a partnership between the Commonwealth and the States; between employers and employees. Whilst the States have had the responsibility for bearing the cost of servicing the social infrastructure required by migrants on their early arrival in Australia, it is fair to report that to this stage no State government in Australia has in fact called for a reduction of the migrant intake in its particular State. The Government maintains that funds for classrooms are not a proper charge to the migrant education vote for a number of reasons. </para>
          <para>In the first place, funds under the programme are of course not without limit and in response to the States&#39; requirements, these funds have already been fully committed in meeting teachers&#39; salaries and in providing schools with laboratory equipment of the type that I have previously mentioned. Secondly, the accommodation requirements of schools cannot be attributable only to newly arriving migrant children, and expenditure on additional classroom space is appropriately, in the view of the Commonwealth, a charge to the States&#39; capital works votes. Thirdly, as a result of decisions taken at the June 1970 Australian Loan Council meeting the States received a substantial increase in 1970-71 in funds available for capital works. Of course, in the particular context of the economic circumstances with which this nation is now dealing, these conditions provide further restraints on Government spending and support the view that immigration funds should not be used to finance capital works in the States. Finally, I might mention that the migrant education programme provides financial assistance in establishing central language laboratories to which children are brought from surrounding schools, thus avoiding the additional classroom demands created by what is called the withdrawal class system. Some States follow this procedure at the present time. </para>
          <para>Having said this, I can nevertheless appreciate what has been brought forward by those honourable members who have raised this point in a specific sense, and I can assure the House that the Government will continue to look closely at any and every aspect of the migrant education programme, particularly those aspects of the programme which may appear to be inhibiting its development, and certainly in any future review of policy the possibility of providing financial assistance in other areas will be kept under close consideration. </para>
          <para>I refer now to some of the points raised in this debate by honourable members. I recall that the honourable member for Grayndler pointed to the acute shortage of teachers in the general community and queried our capacity to provide the number of teachers involved. The rate at which the child migrant education programme has developed since it was announced in April of last year has in fact exceeded expectations. At the end of the 1970 school year a total of 310 teachers were already employed by State Education Departments and by independent schools. Of these, 84 were permanent employees and the remainder, 226, were engaged on a temporary or casual basis. Of the 84 permanent teachers, 69 had already been employed on instructing special groups of migrant children before the introduction of the Commonwealth programme. It is estimated that the peak requirement for special teachers could now be reached in the next financial year and that it should not be greatly in excess of 400. </para>
          <para>One of the conditions under which the child migrant education programme operates is that preferably the special teachers should be additional to the normal teaching establishments so that the drain on normal teaching establishments will be avoided and, in the main, this has certainly been the pattern of developments to date. I might mention that the advertisements of the States for temporary appointment of special teachers have met with a very encouraging response, but it is important to observe that the majority are married women who are accepting appointment only on a part time basis. Of course they would, in this sense, not normally be available to work as teachers in that capacity on a full-time basis. </para>
          <para>The honourable member for Grayndler also queried the extent to which there had been a response from industry in supporting the concept of the migrant education programme. Classes at the work site have been part of the normal continuation programme for migrant education in the Australian community. At present some 70 classes are currently held in factories in Sydney and Melbourne, though in the employees&#39; time.  1  stress this, in passing, because I recall that this matter was the subject of emphasis by the honourable member for Grayndler. For some time, and particularly in recent months, we have been endeavouring to encourage employers to provide classes at work in the employers&#39; time but I must report that so far we have not met with adequate response. Nevertheless useful discussions have been held. Certainly we will continue to promote the concept of employers&#39; participation in a programme which we believe to be in their interest - a programme which we do not believe they ought to stand aside from - and are hopeful that further progress can be reported. I believe that the education of migrant workers in both language and citizenship should be a normal part of the personnelmanagement practice of all major employers of migrant labour and I would certainly hope, andI indicate to the House my own expectation, that it will not be long before this can be referred to as a reality. </para>
          <para>The honourable member for Hughes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Les Johnson)</inline> made some point of the use of television and radio media. He appeared to be under the misapprehension that my Department was not using these facilities to the maximum. Because of the lack of time I have not the opportunity to detail the various diverse measures which are used by the Department through the media of television and radio, but I will be happy to provide the honourable member with the details in writing because the progress which we have made is quite considerable. </para>
          <para>The honourable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Garrick)</inline> referred particularly to the needs of adolescent migrants and the older migrants confined to their homes - both groups lacking formal education - and he indicated that he believed that the situational method of teaching English was ill-suited to the needs of these particular groups. He suggested that we should use a bi-lingual teacher in these cases. He said that migrants should be instructed in their own language, in their own cultures and be taught in classes of their own nationality. I can assure the honourable member that the teaching techniques used by my Department are by no means confined to the situational method, though the basic advantages of this method, which is recognised as of international standing, are such that it does allow migrants of any number of different nationalities to be taught in one class by one teacher who does not necessarily need to know their languages. It therefore has a number of obvious advantages. However I will be happy to provide further details in writing to the honourable member. </para>
          <para>The honourable member for Boothby <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McLeay)</inline> and the honourable member for Riverina <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Grassby)</inline> referred to the need at this time for far more basic and fundamental information upon which to structure better the migrant intake and general programmes in future years. I refer only in passing to the major studies which have been initiated and I assure both honourable members who raised the concept of optimum population levels and the distribution of population throughout Australia that these are two precise but quite complex questions which are part of the population survey being conducted by Professor W. D. Borrie of the Australian National University. The honourable gentlemen will, of course, recognise that Professor Borrie is a demographer of world reputation and I am certain that in commissioning Professor Borrie and a staff of research officers under his control to investigate this matter the Government has acted wisely. </para>
          <para>This major study, along with the cost benefit analysis, will provide in the future that information which we, as a Commonwealth Government, need to structure better future immigration programmes to our objectives in the 1970s. The cost benefit study of immigration is a long overdue attempt to provide an evaluation of the costs and benefits to Australia of immigration. lt is, in fact, intended to break away from the subjectivism which, to some extent, has tended to dominate discussions of this issue during the course of the past 26 years. I emphasise that the study is concerned with a very complex matter indeed. Those who understand the technical implications of a cost benefit analysis dealing as it does with the economy seen on a macro basis will understand the need for the time involved. Those responsible for the research have been directed to complete their studies at the earliest opportunity. The Government quite decisively rejects the amendment before the House and commends the Bill to honourable members. </para>

About 12 months ago the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Snedden),</inline> who was acting for the Minister for Immigration, tabled in this House a piece of legislation to cover migrant education. This evening the Minister for Immigration has told us that there was no need for the legislation because he had proceeded with the granting of money and so on without legislative authority. Now, 11 or 12 months later, we are changing the date to fit the legislation into an Act of the Government.

            <para>- One can easily understand the problem that we face when a fraction more than the majority of honourable members in the chamber do not give a damn about Parliament or its ways and works. The facts are that some 10 or 11 months ago a piece of legislation was introduced to authorise the expenditure of money for a social purpose. There was no debate for almost a year. The Minister told us this afternoon that his Department was able to proceed and get rid of the money in any case. Therefore, what was the use of the operation? What is the use of Parliament? What a way to treat the place. The people on the other side of the chamber are responsible. To have kept this legislation on the stocks for so long was very discourteous both to the people who are supposed to be the beneficiaries of the legislation and the Parliament itself. </para>

          <para>- My understanding was that some of the non State schools in Victoria received their dividends from this legislation faster than schools in the State school system. Is this because there is a more direct line of communication between some of the non State schools and the department administering the legislation at this end? If this is so is the bureaucracy of the Victorian department slowing things down? If there is some reason I would like to know what it is. If this in fact is what happens I think the Minister for Immigration <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> ought to take steps to see that there is no disadvantage placed upon the State system because some of that State&#39;s bureaucracies are slow moving. </para>

In the first place I understand from the honourable member for Riverina <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Grassby)</inline> that he is querying the general procedure whereby grants are allocated against the various educational systems in Australia. If that be the precise meaning of the query which he has raised I respond by saying this: My Department receives submissions from State Ministers for Education in regard to matters concerning State educational systems. That covers the State systems. Those submissions then are subject to judgment and response to the State Ministers concerned. The independent schools also are the subject of submissions from the respective authorities for the independent schools in each of the States. </para>

        <para class="block">State schools submit their representations direct. The independent schools also make their submissions direct to the Department. 1 turn to the query raised by the honourable member for Wills <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bryant).</inline> J really thought that he was being a little political, if I may put it to him that way, although the House will recognise that this is most unlike the honourable member. Apart from the appropriation by Parliament, as I indicated in brief this afternoon legislation is not strictly necessary for the purposes of this Bill as no coercive powers are being sought and the activities of the Department of Immigration in arranging for the expenditure of moneys in fact would be well within the executive powers of the Commonwealth with respect to immigration. But I thought the honourable member might well have responded to the opportunity to discuss this matter and to have it before the Parliament even if its consideration has been somewhat delayed for reasons which, as the honourable member will understand, are outside my direct control. We believe, frankly, in looking at this as an important measure and one well worthy of legislation. The development of the child migration education programme in particular was a new Commonwealth interest involving considerable expenditure of Commonwealth funds and therefore was most properly a matter which ought to be in the form of a Bill to come before the Parliament. Consequently, in introducing the programme, we considered at the time that it was important that in its presentation it should be supported by legislation so that clearly at this time and in future years a series of reports will come before the Parliament indicating what progress has been made. </para>
        <para>There is certainly no desire to deal with this matter by stealth. There never has been such a desire and there will not be in the future. The fact that the Bill is before the Parliament has given honourable members what I believe to be a very useful opportunity to relate constructively to the proposal before us. They have done so from both sides and I have noted the suggestions which have been put forward. I think that those remarks cover the 2 queries that have been raised. </para>

The figures that I quoted in this respect were ones that I obtained from the schools. The letter that I have in my hand is dated 12th June 1970. It commences: &#39;In response to the information you request on May 28th . . . &#39; It is 8 months or 9 months since we on this side of the chamber took an active interest in getting information and ascertaining attitudes. To produce the Bill here after all this delay in my view demonstrates rather a dilatory approach to the matter. The fact is that the Parliament should have discussed this proposal when the whole thing was initiated. It is all right for the Minister to act as if he owns the country and can distribute largesse as he wishes but Parliament should discuss the matter first. </para>

            <para>
              <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr Speaker,</inline>on 5th March of last year, almost 12 months ago, the Minister for National Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Swartz)</inline> presented the Mapping Surveys Bill 1970 and delivered his second reading speech. Today, almost 12 months later, the second reading debate on that Bill is to take place. This gives an indication of the way in which this Government works. So apparently it takes 12 months to bring on for debate a Bill which is of technical importance to Australia in that it makes provision for the mapping of Australia&#39;s resources. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The principal purpose of this Bill is to empower the Minister for National Development to authorise certain action which will accelerate and facilitate the mapping of Australia&#39;s resources. The mapping is done primarily by the Department of National Development through its Division of National Mapping which, I might say, is a Division thought of very highly by the State departments as well as by the other Commonwealth departments which are concerned with the mapping of resources. </para>
          <para>This Bill makes provision for the rights of officers employed by the Department of National Development to enter on to properties, to place survey marks, geodetic pegs or whatever it might be, in relation to survey work. Up to the present time, some doubt has always existed as to the right of a Commonwealth officer to go on to private property in the Commonwealth to carry out his work. What this Bill does is to ensure that officers of the Commonwealth, when carrying out their mapping surveys and ancillary works, will not be molested in any way and in fact will be empowered to go on to properties to carry out this work. </para>
          <para>The Bill also provides for compensation to landholders in respect of any damage which may be done in the course of such surveys. Provision is made in the Bill for landholders to object to unlawful damage to properties. The Bill sets out this provision quite explicitly. As I said before, one of the functions of the Department of National Development is the mapping of Australian resources. Very little is heard about the Division of National Mapping, which might be called a non-policy making body. It has a job to do purely in a technical field, whether it be taking aerial photographs or making land surveys. I would like to pay a tribute to the officers who constitute this Division because, as anybody who has worked in the technical field knows, the maps that the Division prepares and arranges are invaluable in projects concerned with the development of Australia. </para>
          <para>Projects which have been passed by this Parliament I believe have not paid sufficient attention to the work of the Division of National Mapping. These maps are important, for example, in the construction of beef roads. The whole basis of the beef roads scheme is not so much the construction of the roads but the purpose or the objective of the roads. The purpose is to develop Australia&#39;s cattle resources by using the roads for the transport of cattle, which is to the net benefit of the nation. During the compilation of the case for beef roads a great deal of use was made of maps, particularly aerial maps, compiled by the Division of National Mapping in the Department of National Development. These aerial maps showed the classification of the country. Perhaps the best example of legislation that has gone through this Parliament being dependent upon the use of aerial maps showing the classification of country is the legislation relating to the brigalow areas 1, 2 and 3. Something like 10 million acres of this land were classified by aerial maps, and where any problems arose ground traverses were made to check them. </para>
          <para>It has often puzzled and amazed farmers and graziers that one can sit down with a stereoscope and classify land more accurately than can someone who has traversed the ground on foot. In the brigalow area something like 103 land classes alone were classified from the air just by looking through the stereoscope, using aerial maps and then, if any problems arose, for example if there were areas of whipstick brigalow or burnt-out brigalow, going into the area to check. This is one of the practical uses of aerial maps in the development of Australia. Very rarely are these maps wrong. The aerial photographs are particularly accurate. </para>
          <para>It is pleasing to see also that the Bureau of Mineral Resources extensively uses maps prepared by the Division of National Mapping. Almost every survey party in northern Australia, for that matter all of Australia, has been concerned with areas for which the Bureau of Mineral Resources carries the aerial maps or relevant maps. Anybody who has worked or travelled extensively in northern Australia - in the remote areas of Cape York Peninsula, Arnhem Land or the Kimberleys - knows full well the great value of aerial maps to him. The Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wentworth),</inline> who is at the table, has I know travelled in these areas, and I am sure that he for one has used these aerial maps not only to know where he has been going but also to know the type of country that was in close proximity to him. The Land Research Division of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation is one of the greatest users in the Commonwealth of these maps. The land classifications of northern Australia in particular have been carried out with these maps. They could not have been carried out without the maps. Whether we are concerned with soils, botany, hydrology or whatever it might be, we must have access to accurate maps. When we speak about maps we mean principally aerial maps, from which one can read the type of land class as well as the natural resources to be found there. </para>
          <para>I note from the Minister&#39;s second reading speech that the Government is carrying out a 10-year accelerated programme in the mapping field. This will be welcomed, because the aerial maps for a lot of areas of Australia are out of date. Many of them were compiled during World War II. In fact, it was not until, I think, 1968 that for the first time in Australia&#39;s history this continent of almost 3 million square miles was covered by a uniform series of maps. The Minister has informed us of this in his second reading speech. Only 3 years ago we had for the first time at least a uniform set of maps, and now we are refining these maps in more detail, particularly with respect to levels on the ground. The Department of National Development is also procuring sophisticated equipment, and this is to be commended. To give an example of this equipment, as quoted by the Minister in his second reading speech, special air survey cameras will, from a height of 25,000 feet, give a photograph of an area of 140 square miles. As I have said before, we cannot get anything more accurate than a photograph. Distances of up to 200 miles are measured with electronic equipment. </para>
          <para>It is quite obvious that the Opposition supports the Bill. It is one of those Bills which always are welcomed in the Parliament because they provide for technical advance. I want to say something about an area in which I believe there is need for more intensive mapping, and that is the off-shore area, particularly the Great Barrier Reef. The Great Barrier Reef is one of the most complex systems of natural resources in the world. The myriads of islands, rocks and reefs which are covered at high tide but exposed at low tide make the job of mapping the area for the purpose of accurate delineation of, say territorial and international waters, which is of extreme importance to Australia, a very difficult one. The solution which I put to the Parliament is that, first of all, we have to map these areas more accurately. Almost every month there are international incidents in these waters. </para>
          <para>We need not map them for the purposes of showing the limitations of territorial water: and the high seas if we lay claim to the rights of the Barrier Reef waters on behalf of the Commonwealth of Australia, which in effect would be on behalf of the Australian people. As I said before, a Federal Labor Government, in accordance with its policy, would assert ownership of the waters of the Great Barrier Reef and would, if necessary, fight in the International Court of Justice to retain those waters if its actions were challenged. There is plenty of precedent to back such a move, in the opinion of learned international lawyers, not only in Australia but also overseas. The uncertainties under current interpretations of international Jaw relating to the ownership of the seas lying adjacent to the territorial seas which surround the islands, reefs and cays, whether they be submerged or not submerged at high tide, are clearly unsatisfactory to Queensland and to the Commonwealth. There is a need to map these areas more accurately. </para>
          <para>I believe that the mapping of these resources should have been carried out a long time ago. They should have been given a greater priority in the past. But of course one has to look at resources in terms of priorities, and it has been the decision of the Government to concentrate not so much on off-shore areas as areas on-shore If we had full control of these waters, not only would we benefit from mapping, in not having to do so much work, but all foreign vessels that traversed Great Barrier Reef waters, the high seas, would in fact be completely under the control of Australia. One can imagine, for example, what would happen if the Barrier Reef waters lay adjacent to Russia, China, Japan or the United States. There would be no argument then as to who owned the resources lying adjacent to those countries and therefore Australia should not hesitate to claim what most people believe is rightly ours. There is a need, however, to carry out more concentrated work on this complex natural resource and for the Division of National Mapping to work in close consultation wilh the Commonwealth authorities concerned with geological and hydrological research as well as the university and other authorities concerned with the same sciences and marine biology. This is one practical field where the Division of National Mapping can greatly assist in furthering the research carried out in this country. </para>
          <para>The Opposition supports the Bill and, as I said before, it does so in the belief that this accelerated mapping programme will not be cut down in this squeeze which the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Gorton)</inline> has indicated but not proven as far as the Parliament is concerned, because here is a public service which is of vital importance to the productivity of this country. As I have said before, it is of great use to many of the productive Commonwealth departments in terms of development. These include the Bureau of Mineral Resources, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, the Land Research Division, the Bureau of Agricultural Economics, the Northern Division of the Department of National Development and the State departments of agriculture, which are all using these aerial maps and other maps extensively in their work in land classification. The great irrigation schemes that are at present proceeding in Australia or are in the development stage, such a.&#187; the Ord River, the Nogoa scheme, the Bundaberg irrigation scheme and those in New South Wales and Victoria, have all been backed by maps compiled by the Commonwealth authorities and the Department of National Development. Of course, the more remote the area is the more valuable the map is because that is all one really has to go on. If one has not the superficial experience of the person who works the soil or knows the country all one goes on are the maps themselves. The Opposition supports the Bill. </para>

            <para>- I feel I must comment upon the delay that has taken place in bringing this Bill before the House. It is now a year since the second reading speech was made and no doubt the officers who are involved in this authorising legislation will feel some nostalgia when they realise that it appeared on every House of Representatives notice paper issued in 1970. Now it is finally before the House for debate and passing on today, I sincerely hope, to the Senate. One can only anticipate that it will have a somewhat speedier passage in that other place. Such delays in legislation, irrespective of how great a national priority it mayor may not enjoy, cannot be condoned by members of this House. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I ask the Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wentworth),</inline> who is at the table, whether his colleague the Minister for National Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Swartz)</inline> can inform the House why the delay has taken place and what inconvenience has been caused to his Department by the fact that this Bill has lain on the table, seemingly ignored by the House, for such a lengthy period. The House will remember that in his second reading speech, on 5th March 1970, the Minister for National Development indicated that two of the primary purposes of this Bill were to authorise the right of entry by departmental mapping survey parties onto land, and to permit the clearing of trees and vegetation should this be necessary. </para>
          <para>The Minister told us that these authorisations were and are to apply only where these activities were necessary for Commonwealth purposes and only when proper advance notice, which must be given to the landowner, had been given. </para>
          <para>With the delay that has taken place in having such authority enacted, one must be concerned as to whether the rights of the survey parties and the landowners have been protected during this somewhat twilight period for this Bill. 1 sincerely hope these rights have been safeguarded and I would welcome clarification on these points from the Minister about what will happen to departmental officers against whom action may be taken in a court of competent jurisdiction. Are they protected by other Commonwealth Acts? What will happen to a landowner who seeks compensation for damage caused by survey parties since March 1970? </para>
          <para>The Minister mentioned that the survey parties are to do as little damage as possible but where damage must necessarily occur there is provision for compensation of the landowner. Of course, the history of the Department&#39;s survey parties has been satisfactory but 1 would hope that there is some retrospectivity in this legislation to cover both parties, at least for the period the Bill has lain, immovable it would seem, on the table. If not, will the Minister consider amending the Bill to achieve retrospective protection for all parties involved? </para>
          <para>The Bill contains another most important provision, and that is for the preservation of survey marks. The essential task of Commonwealth mapping organisations is to determine the latitude, longitude and height in relation to mean sea level of the natural surface of the Australian continent, of man made features located thereon, of the continental shelf offshore and of the seaward aids to navigation. </para>
          <para>In order to carry out their tasks, J am informed that surveyors establish an approximate grid pattern of very high precision alt over the country which are very well marked on the ground and which enable mapping operations to be started in isolated areas by any governmental or private mapping agency and to eventually merge into a perfectly co-ordinated pattern over the whole of Australia and its adjacent waters. On land I believe it is possible to set up special electronic survey equipment on these marked stations to enable accurate positioning of aircraft and of air photograph from which maps are made. Obviously these maps will  need to <inline font-style="italic">b&#62;:</inline> revised from lime to time, and additional mapping at larger scale and in greater density for particular areas will no doubt follow, but all these activities will fit into one homogeneous pattern because, and only because, of the continued existence of the basic survey marks. It is evident then that it has been necessary for provision to be made for the preservation of survey marks and I am certain most landowners will continue to co-operate in doing what is required of them in this regard for the national good. </para>
          <para>Along the coastline, survey stations are established for special radio equipment which permits the accurate positioning of survey vessels at sea where they would be used in sounding the depths of the sea bed. I am told that the hydrographic service of the Royal Australian Navy is engaged on the accurate survey of navigation route; between the ports situated around the Australian coastline. We all realise that navigation routes are being travelled by ships of rapidly increasing size to transport the great mineral wealth that has been discovered in recent years all over Australia, and we similarly realise how important the accurate surveying of these routes is going to be again for Australia&#39;s develop ment, and can only hope that the delay in this Bill&#39;s passage does not presage any reduction or postponement in this programme. I would welcome the Minister&#39;s assurance on thU point. </para>
          <para>Inquiries have shown that the Royal Australian Navy hopes to bring these surveys completely up to date during this decade and the Minister for National Development has announced that concurrently with these hydrographic surveys his department would engage on a 10-year programme to bathymetrically map the continental shelf. I am told this bathymetric mapping will be on a much broader scope than the detailed hydrographic surveys of navigation routes but will be co-ordinated with them. It will determine the contour and physiography of the continental shelf at a scale of 1 : 250,000 or approximately 4 miles to 1 inch or, in view of the trend to . metrication 2.5 kilometers to 1 centimetre. </para>
          <para>The ships making these surveys will also be accurately guided to their correct latitude and longitude position by special shore based equipment located on surveyed stations, to which I have already mad. reference. The end result will be a series of bathymetric maps which will provide accurate background data for, and enable the proper recording of, all sorts of scientific investigations of the surface of the continental shelf and of the waters above it, and of the resources thereon, therein and thereunder. </para>
          <para>As we know the Department of National Development is currently engaged on geological, magnetic, seismic and gravity surveys of the shelf. The Minister has described much of this in his second reading speech and although I have spoken before on the success of the Government&#39;s mapping division since the end of World War II when, I remind the House, only 5 per cent of Australia had been adequately mapped by Australians, I would repeat to the House that if we had not undertaken such a comprehensive mapping programme and  if  the programme had not achieved the success it has, in providing precise and accurate geological  maps  in sufficient detail, then the magnificent mineral development going on in Australia would not, and could not. have even been contemplated. This discovery was not an accident:  it  was the result of firm Government policy from this side.  1  am pleased to have been informed that the Government is still going ahead with the establishment of a marine sciences institution based in Townsville which will initiate, direct and co-ordinate other forms of scientific research  into  the waters surrounding  our  Australian coastline. In order that the results obtained from these scientific activities be co-ordinated into a perfect co-relation with each other and to permit full and complete environmental and ecological studies  it  is necessary for the ships on which observations are made to be accurately positioned in latitude and longitude. This will necessitate temporary but repeated location at previously marked survey stations of the same sort of radio positioning equipment that is used by the mappers. If these repetitive activities are to move on smoothly and efficiently the originally marked stations must also be preserved intact for continuing use by surveyors who must therefore also have reasonable rights of access to these sites. It is in order to preserve these survey marks that this Bill authorises the establishment of the survey marks in the first instance and provides penalties to discourage those who would damage them.  1  repeat that there is a necessity, not only to establish, but above all to maintain and preserve the survey marks that have been made and are being established by Commonwealth mapping surveyors. Of equal importance is the necessity to authorise reasonable access to these survey marks for the purposes not only of continuing map revision and map intensification, but also for the scientific and resources surveys that from henceforward will no doubt be a continuing pattern to provide the basic statistical information necessary for the complex problems associated with the balanced development and conservation of om great nation. I support the Bill but before  1  conclude my remarks I should like to pay a tribute to those who work in this service which has certainly come of age in the last few years. Our mapping services are indeed second to very few countries and possibly there would be only one or two nations which would have finer government operated mapping services. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- I want to associate myself particularly with the remarks of the honourable member for Dawson <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Patterson)</inline> in the first instance and the honourable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Dobie)</inline> in the second instance in relation to the delay in bringing forward this Bill. There has been a year&#39;s delay. This delay touches on the fundamental development of the nation - the planning for national development. In the year that this measure has been upon the table and we have not been able to get around to dealing with it we have had a wonderful debate on flags of various types that occupied our attention for more than 2 days. We also had a discussion on the conscience of various honourable members of this House. We had a day&#39;s debate on somebody&#39;s passport. There was a tremendous amount of trivia but we did not have this measure before us. I echo the protests entered about this delay. It seems to me to be rather sad that the priority accorded to national development by the Government in relation to the Parliament is that it comes after the greatest and most monumental pieces of trivia we have had before us in the last year.  1  wanted to make that point plain and to support the observations made in that way. I also have every sympathy with the expressions of concern for those who have been waiting for protection and compensation planned in this Bill. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I want to deal with the overall meaning of the delay and the overall attitude to this basic tool of national development. This Bill is designed to produce the raw material of decisions on national development. I realise that the Minister for National Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Swartz)</inline> presented to Cabinet a year ago a document which was designed to be the basis of an overall national plan for development. It has not got very far in 12 months. </para>
          <para>The Opposition joins with the Government to ensure that this Bill will go through. But of course the overall national development plan which is the blueprint for the future has not got very far at all. My questions on the notice paper suggest that there is no great enthusiasm for planning the future of this nation in an orderly and progressive manner. I suppose that I should not be surprised that there has been a year&#39;s delay. However, this is one small step forward. We need this raw data in order to make the decisions which must be made in relation to national planning. </para>
          <para>The Minister referred in his second reading speech to the fact that as maps have become available they have been used in assessing Australia&#39;s resources in minerals, water and forests, for many administrative purposes and for broad planning and general development planning. I have used the Minister&#39;s terminology. lt is true that these resource maps are the raw materia&#93; for decisions in many respects and in many spheres. It is indicated that the data that is collected by the Department of National Development is integrated with the data provided by the Bureau of Mineral Resources and the Water, Power and Geographic Branch. The Minister also referred to the fact that that branch arranges primarily through State authorities for the recording of statistics on surface and underground water. </para>
          <para>In relation to the various resources there is one omission from the Minister&#39;s second reading speech and I would like to direct attention to it. If we are to have a series of resource maps those maps should also cover soils, including their type and recommended utilisation. There are many reasons for this but I do not want to go into all of them at this stage. I think that those of us who are concerned with irrigation development and land development generally will recognise the fundamental importance of soil maps and the data that should be integrated with any set of national maps or charts. There was no reference at all in the Minister&#39;s second reading speech to this very important aspect of data. I agree with all of the other matters that have been referred to including the mineral resource matters and topography. We must know our topography; surely that is basic. </para>
          <para>References were made to geological and geophysical surveys and to the fact that the data from these surveys would be integrated in the maps which are to be produced by the Department of National Development. This is all to the good but I direct attention to the omission in relation to soil maps and I do so deliberately because matters touching on the science of soil involve dramatic developments in understanding the qualities of soil and its uses for many different purposes. I could give examples. I do not think that I should do so. They would be technical matters which perhaps would not be relevant to a second reading speech on a measure of this kind. But I would draw attention to the fact that in the State departments - I cite the New South Wales Department of Agriculture and the Water Conservation and Irrigation Commission - and also in the Division of Soils of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation in recent times - indeed in the 12 months in which no action has been taken on this matter - there has been a considerable addition of data and information which should be related to any basic production of maps of resources of the nation. </para>
          <para>I would like to draw attention to this omission because, irrespective of passing difficulties that might be associated with the rural sector and irrespective of the almost casual criticisms that have been made of irrigation development, the rural sector will continue to develop and expand and irrigation will prove to be the fundamental bastion of primary production in the future of this continent where drought is endemic. So I draw attention particularly to the need to integrate the data contained in the maps which are being produced with the data which is currently being assembled and evaluated by the various State departments. I repeat that the year&#39;s delay in this matter is reprehensible and is a matter for condemnation. When we have been called upon to deal with so much trivia at such great length it disturbs me deeply to find that an important measure of this kind has been put at the end of the queue. </para>
          <para>I would certainly join with my colleague, the honourable member for Dawson, in supporting the measure. I express the hope that the omission to which I have referred will be made the subject of action with the appropriate State agencies to ensure that any issue by the department of basic data is as valid as it can be with the state of knowledge that we have at the present time. I would also express the hope that the data which will be contained in the maps that are being produced and in the reports that are being compiled will provide the raw material for national planning. I look forward to the day when the Minister comes into the chamber and says: &#39;I now have the honour of tabling a national development programme so that Parliament may debate it and come up with its combined opinion, in its wisdom or otherwise&#39;. 1 gather that the Minister has certainly set out to do this. We have not yet got it. The delay in that regard is continuing, but at least we have overcome one of the hurdles in this measure. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- J rise to emphasise the importance of the activity which lies behind this Bill. The Bill refers to very narrow activities indeed. For that reason I cannot help but remark that the honourable member for Dawson <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Patterson),</inline> the honourable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Dobie)</inline> and the honourable member for Riverina <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Grassby)</inline> have fallen into pit into which I am about to follow them, I imagine, of talking more widely than the field covered by the Bill. Nevertheless, because the activities are so important and because I have had more than a peripheral association with some of them over past years I would like to take this opportunity to refer to what 1 believe to be the considerable importance of this form of activity, an importance which I think is not recognised by the man in the street. The very considerable range of uses to which maps of one sort or another are put is not recognised, I think, by most people although they might use one or two of the particular forms of maps into which the base maps that we are talking about here are developed. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The honourable member for Riverina has regretted the apparent lack of rapidity in the production of soil maps, but I think he should do so in the context of the vast array of maps which it is possible to produce. One could run through a list of twenty or thirty in terms of land capability, land utilisation, forest resources, water resources, ground water and so on. Basically speaking, what the honourable member should be thinking of and what I would like to outline is merely this: In those countries, notably the European ones, where there is a long tradition dating back several centuries in one or two cases, of national mapping it is a continuous - not continual - process by which the nation is covered at one scale or another and by which the technology of doing so is constantly improved. The country having been covered by a particular scale of map. it is then covered progressively either on the same scale or by a revised version. So we find countries like the United Kingdom and Switzerland with their seventh, eighth and ninth revised series of I inch to the mile or 1 to 100.000 national maps or productions of that order. </para>
          <para>As the Minister for National Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Swartz)</inline> pointed out in his second reading speech, here we finally covered our considerable area in 1968. I think at the scale of 1 to 250,000. The Minister covered just about everything relating to this issue. He told us that the next part of the programme was to proceed to a 1 to 100,000 scale coverage with 20 metre contour intervals of the national area. As the honourable member for Dawson said, the second half of the National Mapping Division&#39;s major programme concerns the bathymetric maps, the off-shore maps covering water bodies and reefs contained therein. In that regard it is true to say that some of the bathymetric maps - I do not know what proportion of them as 1 am not familiar with this field - date roughly from the 1870s to the 1880s and are in the process of substantial revision now for the first time since then. I do not want to go at length into the question of what we can do in the process of national mapping. I wish to emphasise that it is an extraordinarily important facet of our national development. People have said that before me. Only those who have attempted to deal with things in space - to look at them in their physical sense, to look at their soils or their productivity capacity, or to look at the demographic situation - without having access to a map of the area properly drawn up and totally dependable, or at least very substantially dependable in terms of its accuracy, will realise just how difficult it is to proceed with that sort df work. This has been the case in parts of Australia for quite some time. </para>
          <para>The Division of National Mapping and people such as Trevor Plumb are doing an extraordinarily important piece of work. The land research people in the CSIRO have drawn up considerable surveys of large parts of the Northern Territory in particular and also of some of the other interior areas of Australia and elsewhere. Those reports, in their fairly distinctive orange covers, are worth reading by those who are interested, such as the honourable member for Riverina, in regard to land capacity and the physical accuracy of particular elements in an area under notice. It is true to say that despite the vast advances which have been made in the last few decades in aerial photography and associated technology - notably in photogrammetry - and also in some more complex processes with which I am not familiar in any sense at all, it is still necessary to tie the mapping programme to the earth&#39;s surface. In fact that is the purpose of this Bill to which I shall definitely return. </para>
          <para>The purpose of the Bill is to empower the Minister for National Development to authorise survey parties to enter land, carry out mapping surveys, put survey marks on the ground when necessary and do certain limited clearing and so on. The Bill provides for compensation for loss or damage to property as a result of those incursions and also prohibits the unlawful damage or destruction or removal of the marks put there for the purposes of survey by the Commonwealth teams. Really this is all we are concerned with seeing put into operation. Despite the fact that I have joined with honourable members who have preceded me in this debate in taking note of the importance of this activity in general, I cannot but think in view of the importance of some of the legislation that has been before us in the past year or so their specific attention to the fact that it has taken the better part of a year to get this small Bill through is something like crocodile tears. I think it is highly unlikely that the programme of national mapping has in any significant way been held up as a result of this Bill not being passed. If I am wrong no doubt someone will draw my attention to it in due course. </para>
          <para>It remains only for me to say that despite the fact that the national mapping programme seems really in more than one sense to have got off the ground, this will be something to which the attention of this Parliament will be drawn with increasing frequency because, as I said earlier, any country which is attempting to develop itself in anything like the way in which this country is - the record in national development of others which have gone before us stands clearly - will find itself increasingly with a need to develop its mapping programmes. Once having covered the area of the country it will be found that there is at least as much reason for covering it again on a larger scale and in more detail with advanced symbolism and more precision, so that we get the nearest thing possible to rendering a part of the earth&#39;s surface onto a 2-dimensional piece of paper, thereby enabling us to find our way around and read all sorts of things, if we are expert, about what the area consists of. I too commend this Bill, whether it is belated or otherwise, to the House. </para>

            <para>- I would like to thank honourable members on both sides of the House for the reception they have given this Bill and the constructive comments they have made. There are only one or two fairly brief points I would like to make in reply. Firstly, the delay in regard to this Bill was due to the heavy legislative programme which, as honourable members very well know, has occupied the House during the past 12 months and more. Secondly, the honourable member for Denison <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Solomon)</inline> is absolutely right in saying that there has been no impeding of the mapping programme by reason of the failure to pass this Bill into law. 1 am glad to say there has been cooperation from landowners and Australians generally in this very forward and valuable programme. I am informed there are no possible claims against a survey officer or possible claims by a landowner outstanding. For that reason no question of retrospectivity need be considered although, of course, if there were any such claims undoubtedly it would be considered. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The only other point which was raised was in regard to soil survey. I am sure the comments of the honourable member for Riverina <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Grassby)</inline> were well intentioned but perhaps he had not done his homework as well as he should. The Department of National Development in fact does produce a soils map in its atlas. Clause (h) under the definition &#39;survey&#39; which refers to the survey of the earth&#39;s natural resources does cover this. There is one other practical point andI think on reflection he should realise how important it is. Soil surveys cannot be too generalised because conditions differ from one paddock to another paddock. It is important that not only the surface but the subsurface be delineated. These maps are probably very detailed and relate to relatively small and productive areas such as an irrigation area. Therefore, they do not quite fit into the same general pattern but the Government does realise their importance and it is proceeding with its programme. In point of fact the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, as the honourable member himself mentioned, has some special interest in and facilities for doing this. The Government, I can assure the House, has not underestimated the practical importance of this. May I again thank the House for the constructive and helpful reception which it has given this Bill. </para>

          <para>- On 18th September at Wynyard Park, Sydney, I addressed a large gathering of demonstrators opposing the war in Vietnam. The meeting was in support of the Vietnam Moratorium Campaign. At the cessation of the speeches the moratorium marchers filed out of the park, made their way to George Street, then south towards the Town Hall. The marchers were only permitted to walk on the footpath. They were not permitted to proceed up George Street beyond King Street. Police diverted them off George Street in an easterly direction up the northern side of King Street. I participated in the march and at the corner of King and George Streets I was manhandled and assaulted by a police constable bearing the number 3136. I was not injured physically in any way. That was not what disturbed me most. It was the manner and attitude of the constable. I sought legal advice and was advised there were two types of action I could follow. One was a civil remedy for assault, a claim for an amount of damages to vindicate the situation. This would involve one&#39;s only having to prove the cause on the balance of probabilities. The second was to lay an information of common assault, which is a criminal action. I was advised that the latter was difficult to establish because one has to prove the assault beyond reasonable doubt. Criminal charges, unlike civil cases, have to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. The House will understand my reluctance to follow the first proposal. It is aware of my long struggles in the courts in those types of cases. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>On Monday, 21st September 1970, I took out a summons against Constable 3136. In the court it was interestingto note that the police were not prepared to identify Constable 3136. That was my task but I was able to do so even though he was in plain clothes sitting with about 5 or 6 constables of similar colouring, age and features. The case was heard scattered over 3 days in the Central Court of Petty Sessions before <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lewer,</inline> stipendiary magistrate, and his judgment was given on 5th January 1971. He dismissed the charge of assault and said: </para>
        <list type="lowerroman-dotted">
          <item label=".">
            <para>. The matter is not established beyond reasonable doubt. </para>
          </item>
        </list>
        <para class="block">
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Day</inline>from the New South Wales Crown Solicitor&#39;s Office, representing Constable 3136, who was actually being instructed by a senior police officer, sought that I should pay the costs. The magistrate said to counsel for the police: </para>
        <para>I  wish you  would  not press your  request. </para>
        <para>My counsel, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Staples,</inline> argued the principle against forcing me to pay the costs. Counsel for the police insisted and the magistrate ordered me to pay $80 costs, in default 40 days hard labour. I said in court: &#39;I won&#39;t pay the fine - I&#39;ll do the hard labour.&#39; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> there are certain principles involved. Firstly, I was assaulted by Constable 3136. He knows that he assaulted me even though he denied under oath ever meeting me before the court proceedings. Inspector Beath, the InspectorinCharge of the Petersham Police Station, knows that Constable 3136 assaulted me. It was Inspector Beath who approached a person of some political influence to ask me to pull off. He even advised me how I could conform and not lose face. Inspector Beath&#39;s emissary said that the policeman was only a young probationary constable. He said that the constable would not have pushed me around if he had known who I was. There was other evidence available from a retired railway worker, but he was too fearful to give evidence. He feared that the police may press issues against two of his sons. </para>
        <para>Secondly, I refer to the extent to which a. senior - even a very high - officer within the Police Department will lie or allow the issue to be clouded in order to protect the police system. One of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Day&#39;s</inline> utterances on behalf of the police was that he called demonstrators against the war in Vietnam cowardly dogs&#39;. It would be interesting to know who granted permission to have such an utterance deleted from the court transcript. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Day&#39;s</inline> address makes interesting reading. It clearly identifies the thinking and attitude of a section of the New South </para>
        <para class="block">Wales police. I did not bring this action out of malice against the police. My view was, and still is, that the police should help people, not brutalise them. </para>
        <para>Thirdly, I will not pay the fine. A law which threatens people with punishment if they dare to take their grievances to court is an unjust law. It intimidates people into not making criticism of public officials. The money awarded is called costs but in reality it is a fine. It is not paid to the defendant policeman; it is paid into Consolidated Revenue. The law in this respect reeks of inequality. In our courts of petty sessions, which handle police work, there is no genuine equality. Policeman have more equality than citizens. They have far greater rights than any citizen. If the defendant police officer in my case had charged me with assault and had failed to prove his case he would not have been required to pay my costs; he would not be threatened with a gaol sentence. My case was commenced in the public interest. My refusal to pay the fine is in the public interest. To threaten a man with gaol when he has broken no law is a stupid law, and the sentence of 40 days hard labour for failure to pay a $80 fine is a stupid law. </para>
        <para>Fourthly, my going to gaol is also against the law as it was described by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lewer,</inline> S.M. I am not challenging his version; legal men may do that if need be. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lewer,</inline> in his judgment, had this to say: </para>
        <list type="lowerroman-dotted">
          <item label=".">
            <para>. there is no guaranteed right of either free assembly or free speech in common law countries. This very often surprises people who believe their school history books. Nonetheless that is the legal situation. </para>
          </item>
        </list>
        <para class="block">I hope that my going to gaol might encourage just a few people to get off their tails. I hope it might stir them long enough to challenge the establishment of such laws. I hope that people will examine and think about such restrictive laws in our socalled free society. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lewer,</inline> in his judgment, dealt with the definition of an unlawful assembly, andI shall quote that part of the judgment. It is as follows: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>An unlawful assembly is an assembly of three or more persons with intent either to commit a crime . . . </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">The magistrate decided not to determine whether the Moratorium march on 18th September was &#39;an unlawful assembly&#39;. He was content to say that there were inferences available to suggest that it might properly be held  to  be  an  unlawful assembly. But the magistrate did say: </para>
        <list type="lowerroman-dotted">
          <item label=".">
            <para>. I should think beyond any doubt the police are entitled to put an end to a procession, a meeting, or a gathering if they apprehend, notwithstanding its lawful nature . . . </para>
          </item>
        </list>
        <para class="block">He  went  on to  say: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>They- meaning the police - may take quite severe steps to set an end to an unlawful assembly. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">In  order to indicate that  I  have not mis interpreted <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lewer&#39;s</inline> judgment, with the concurrence  of  honourable members  I  incorporate his judgment in Hansard. </para>
        <para>BENCH. There is no evidence before me that I am prepared to pay any attention to of perjury by anybody, nor can 1 see any suggestion of any criminal conspiracy to pervert the ends of public justice, and if I did I would not need any urging to send the papers to the Attorney-General. </para>
        <para>I have before me an Information exhibited by Thomas Uren against the defendant Constable of Police No. 3136 and this in the event turns out to be a Constable Girardi. The Information, exhibited under the Provisions of Division 2 of Part 4 of the Justices Act, alleges an assault contrary to Section 493 of the Crimes Act on 18th September 1970 at Sydney. </para>
        <para>The first thing to observe 1 should think is this, there are at least two different kinds of remedy for assault. One. a civil remedy for assault, is a tort, and in former times at any event that was the usual means employed when a person who claimed to have been assaulted wished to vindicate his situation, and in the more picturesque language of last century he presented his wounded pride for the salve of damages, but the important thing to notice about that kind of remedy for assault is that the plaintiff may succeed, upon establishing his case, on the balance of the probabilities. The Action here before me is not so simple, the case must be established beyond reasonable doubt, as our criminal lawwisely holds, and before 1 turn to a consideration of the facts, which in my view are very simple, notwithstanding the fairly extravagant addresses with which 1 have been favoured, extravagant and lengthy one might say in one case or another, and I leave them until last. </para>
        <para>Now without going into the matter at any great length it is quite clear that the keeping of public order would not be possible without the exertion from time to time upon the lieges of some degree of physical force, and the most succinct exposition of the situation in relation to this is probably found in Chapter 38 of Wade and Hood-Phillips Constitutional Law&#39;, and because some of what is written in that book is very apt for this case I propose to read. At page 525 the learned authors have pointed out there is no guaranteed right of either free assembly or free speech in common law countries. This very often surprises people who believe their school history books. None the less that is the legal situation. The authors go on to speak of Police powers and I now read: &#39;Nevertheless there remains what has been called the public nuisance aspect which may result from freedom to speak. . . . &#39; Thenthe learned authors go on to deal with some other interesting aspects of that law there. </para>
        <para>Now it is probably that the definition of an unlawful assembly is well known but in case it is not there is no harm in considering it. Halsbury Third Edition, paragraph 89. &#39;An unlawful assembly is an assembly of three or more persons with intent either to commit a crime . . . consequence of it&#39;. I should think it trite learning to go on to say that the dispersal of an unlawful assembly is a duty cast by the common law upon every citizen, a fortiori upon every police constable. </para>
        <para>Now I do not want to go back to the 16th century, but there is a fairly modern illustration of the kind of situation the law has thus far, common law I mean, been able to deal with. 1 refer to Duncan v. Jones which is variously reported and may be found in 1936 1 Kings Bench 218. or as I read from the 1935 Aft England Reprints at 710. Now it was proposed by some well intentioned folk in this case to hold a meeting in 9 Head Street, New Crosse, London near the entrance to an unemployed training centre situated in that street and to that end a notice was supplied which read, and it is an interesting cue, this was July 30th 1934, and it still has a typical ring about it, &#39;Sedition&#39;.&#39;Particulars of the meeting .. . National Unemployment Workers Union&#34;. At the foot of the Notice is defined a right of free speech and public meeting. The Police Inspector told Duncan to desist from holding the meeting. Duncan declined so to do and set about giving an oration to the standers-by and was arrested and charged with obstructing <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> police, convicted, and from that he appealed to a Court which consisted of Lord Hewitt the Chief Justice, his Lordship <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Humphries, and his Lordship <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Singleton, and it may be well known that Chief Justice was a well known champion of liberties, civil and otherwise. The Judgment is interesting, especially because it overrules Beattie v. Gilbanks insofar as Beattie <inline font-style="italic">v.</inline> Gilbanks says the police may not step in to prevent breaches of the peace even if they are required to put an end to otherwise lawful activity, which is something not sufficiently understood. 1 do not want to appear to be school masterish about it, but it ought to be understood and there would be less trouble in the city. </para>
        <para>The case may be thought to establish I should think beyond any doubt the police are entitled to put an end to a procession, a meeting, or a gathering if they apprehend, notwithstanding its lawful nature, if they reasonably apprehend that there will be a breach of the peace in consequence of it, a fortiori I should say, they may take quite severe steps to set an end to an unlawful assembly. 1 am not going to decide whether or not the procession from Wynyard Park to somewhere up King Street was an unlawful assembly or not. I am content to say that there are inferences available in the evidence from which it might properly be held if it were necessary that it was an unlawful assembly. I merely point to one or two matters of which there is evidence and they are the cries of &#39;fascist pigs&#39;, and rather delightfully down with imperialism&#39;, and &#39;stop the war&#39;. Superintendent Wells has said from his observations he apprehended a breach of the peace and I should think the Court might properly hold that he was a person of reasonable courage and firmness. As I am saying they are the legal earmarks of the gathering at the corner of King and George Street of an unlawful assembly. </para>
        <para>Now there are one or two other matters of law which I wish to advert to. In situations of this kind of lawless nature without doubt fears and apprehensions are excited and prejudices and emotions aroused and these are in the times when one may not expect equally clear judgments and calm from any of the participants. So that one is not to bring a milligram weight and a chemical balance when weighing up whether the force used was reasonable or not and indeed it has been held that a very large amount of force is permissible if a very large amount of resistance is met with. That wasn&#39;t the case here in any event. </para>
        <para>Why I have mentioned these things is this, if 1 accept the Informant&#39;s evidence in toto, and 1 do not, but on the other hand it is not to be thought from that that I regard him as a teller of any untruths for I am certain he did his best to tell me the whole truth within the limits of his memory and obviously he would then be making observations, but even if I accept his case in toto rs it fell from him in chief, he has a very considerable legal difficulty ahead of him to establish that what the constable did was an application, by his story, was the application of unreasonable force. Again 1 accept him entirely here. I can safely believe him when he tells me that he was himself proceeding in a most law abiding and untumultous fashion up George Street and through to wherever he went and exhorting those about him to be peaceful and unprovocative. 1 don&#39;t think this helps him knowing, if anything, he was part of a body which apparently did wholey prescribe to the same motives and indications. </para>
        <para>Now the facts as they may be defined from the evidence, and I do not intend to go through the whole lot of them, I am not obliged to do it because the Court does not deal with each tiny bil of fact or law argued before it. This is not to be taken that the Court has paid no attention to it, but in brief the inference is this, that when some distance travelling from west to east on the northern boundary of the King Street/George Street intersection he was pushed with no small degree of force back on to the curb by a man whom he says is the defendant, Constable Girardi When he again set off in the same direction about the middle of George Street he was roughly seized by the Constable and later on he was heavily pushed in the back by the Constable and he says that on each of these occasions he was able to identify his assailant as the defendant Constable and to some extent, some limited extent, he is corroborated by a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anderson.</inline> Concerning him, I reject any suggestion of perjury. 1 have already, I think, pointed out that it is not possible to make detailed observations in crowds in these circumstances, but the gravamen of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anderson&#39;s</inline> corroboration, not really legal corroboration because legal corrobation is defined, as independent evidence of the commission of a crime and that the defendant committed it, and of course <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anderson&#39;s</inline> testimony does not implicate the defendant Constable as such. He says a Constable violently, sufficient to say, collided with the Informant with some force. </para>
        <para>Now the defendant&#39;s case is that he does not know the Informant, he had not seen him before he came to Court, he did not participate in any such incidents, all he was doing was controlling a very large crowd with a considerable number of other police. </para>
        <para>Superintendent Wells says that he had the stream of demonstrators as they have been called in the case who were proceeding alternately with north and south vehicular traffic in George Street in the same direction as the defendant. He had them under close observation. He claims to have seen the Informant writing on something. He says he did not see what the Informant describes and that he would have had it happened, and it is urged upon me that he was very concerned to make sure that no breaches of the peace occurred. </para>
        <para>As well the defendant calls Sergeant McCoy, Constable Marizouk, and Constable Meredith, all who were assigned to the same duty as the defendant Constable, although they did not have the defendant Constable under observation for the whole of the demonstration, rather thai this activity took place. Each of them says that when they did have the defendant Constable under observation he was not doing anything like thai. Inspector Bottles evidence seems to me of faint relevance and I do not propose to trouble myself to explore that particular blind avenue as 1 see it. I am not concerned with the Informant&#39;s conversation with Assistant Commissioner Newman or the content of it, it assists me very little as to credit. Quite clearly there was ample opportunity for all concerned sincerely to be mistaken in what they thought they saw and heard. </para>
        <para>Now there is nothing external in the evidence forthcoming from either side to enable me to say positively either side is not telling the truth. It is true that there is a certain amount of disrelation between the Informant&#39;s account and the account of his witness <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anderson</inline> and this is to be expected. 1 am quite sure had I taken the trouble, I could find discrepancies somewhere or other in the testimonies of the various police. In the circumstances it is clearly to be expected. The short point is this that where each of two accounts conflict, that where there is nothing extraneous that induces me to say with some conviction strictly beyond reasonable doubt which version is correct, then I must clearly say that the matter is not established beyond reasonable doubt and that as I understand in the beginning was the onus the prosecution carried, I reiterate very briefly, put at its highest what the Informant sought to establish or part of what he sought to establish, namely the unlawfulness of the assault upon him would be very difficult to establish in the circumstances, but in any event there being no external indicia as to which version, that is to say the Informant&#39;s or the Defendant&#39;s is correct there must obviously be a reasonable doubt for the Court and the Information is therefore dismissed. </para>

          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr Speaker,</inline>this is a story of the deep south. The Draft Resisters Union wore beards. But many others wore beards too at Anglesea and Aireys Inlet. It has not so far been thought dangerous to wear a beard at Anglesea or Aireys Inlet - in fact, a few of the residents wear beards. But no-one has ever talked in public, at Anglesea or Aireys Inlet, about conscription and the Vietnam war, and when it was found that the Anglesea ranger had given his consent for the draft resisters to put up a screen and show films about demonstrations and the war, it was suddenly realised that Anglesea might never be the same again. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The officer of police spoke to the sergeant, and the sergeant spoke to the ranger and permission was withdrawn, but not until the draft resisters had set up their screen in the Anglesea caravan park. But now 2 carloads of police, apparently not needed to deal with the unbalanced drivers on the roads or with brawls or housebreaking, descended on the quiet audience straining their eyes to see on the screen the faint images of Chicago police behaving like stormtroopers. No inquiry was made. The police just went into action. The screen was pulled down and the power leads were torn out. The thing had to stop. This, in the deep south, was subversion and sin. </para>
        <para>So days later the draft resisters went to Aireys Inlet. The draft resisters were given permission to use the local public hall and they paid their $15 rent. But once more the underground went into action. The police officer spoke to the sergeant and the sergeant spoke to the Barrabool councillor, and the councillor and the police barred the door of the public hall and told the draft resisters that they could not &#39;sing that kind of music&#39; at Aireys Inlet. So several days later the draft resisters went on to Lorne. But the  Chairman  of the Foreshore Committee said: &#39;No, those draft resisters are not coming to Lorne.&#39; He told the </para>
        <para class="block">Melbourne &#39;Herald&#39; reporter: They&#39;re extremists. They stand for peace. They endanger Australia.&#39; So By-law  8  (N and L) was invoked. </para>
        <para>This by-law says that no-one shall speak, sing, pray, play music, assemble or enter into a discussion on the foreshore without the permission of the Foreshore Committee. As the magistrate said in the case of the honourable member for Reid v. Constable Girardi </para>
        <list type="lowerroman-dotted">
          <item label=".">
            <para>. there is no guaranteed right of either free assembly or free speech in common law countries. This very often surprises people who believe their school history books. </para>
          </item>
        </list>
        <para class="block">But on 23rd January the draft resisters arrived and set up their screen and their public address system on the foreshore at Lorne. Soon after a member of parliament began to speak. He said that the by-law seemed to have been designed to prevent unreasonable obstruction, noise or nuisance, but that it was being used to prevent people from speaking their point of view. The police arrived, then the  Chairman  of the Foreshore Committee arrived, but they did nothing. The member of parliament went on speaking, but finally running out of ideas he said it was strange that the police and the Foreshore Committee had taken no action. Then he handed the microphone to Harry Van Moorst of the Students for a Democratic Society. Harry is small. He has a beard and long hair. He is the ideal kind of person to arrest, and although the member of Parliament had spoken for 15 minutes and Harry had spoken no more than 100 words he was suddenly grabbed by 2 athletic policemen and dragged roughly away from the microphone. Having arrested him, the policeman dragged him behind some motor vehicles and asked him to give his name and address which, when he refused to do so, gave the constables the legal right they needed for the arrest that they had, without any right, made some minutes before. </para>
        <para>With the microphone now dangling idly in the evening air, the member for Parliament picked it up and said how strange it was that he could give a public address on it and not be interfered with by the police but Harry could speak only 100 words, be roughly arrested and dragged to the cage van and locked up like a stray ddg. Was it because Harry was a student who had long hair and a beard whereas the member of Parliament had short hair, as I remind honourable members? There was a difference. After the member of Parliament had finished speaking the second time, the senior constable and the  Chairman  of the Foreshore Committee came up to him and the senior constable said: &#39;Very sorry, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, but</inline> you have given a public address contrary to by-law 8 (L and F) and it will be reported to my superior officers.&#39; The member of Parliament said: I should think so after the way you have handled Harry Van Moorst. lt was not long before Harry Van M oorst was before the Lorne Court of Petty Sessions. Here the magistrate agreed wilh the counsel employed by the Crown for this very important case. &#39;The law never discriminates,&#39; said the magistrate. The member of Parliament gave evidence. He said that be had given a public address and no action had been taken against him. He said that the police evidence against Harry Van Moorst was not correct and that Harry had been arrested without any right of the constables to do so. But the magistrate said that the law had to be upheld. So Van Moorst was found guilty and fined $10. And so the police were once more told by the court that the truth does not really matter when evidence is given. They were told by the court: &#39;Bring along before us all these students with long hair and beards and together we will teach them a lesson.&#39; But the police and the magistrate since 23rd January have had 24 days in which to take action against the member of Parliament and against a Leader of the Opposition who also made a public address at Lorne on 23rd January. But no action has been taken. </para>
        <para>The law never discriminates! The deep south had spoken, lt is not only part of our geography; it is part of our common law. This story of the deep south in Australia is only one example of many. What it shows, of course, is that in Australia there is one law for some people and a totally different law for others. There is one law for young, long-haired persons who will have listed against them convictions that will be a disadvantage for them throughout their lives, and another law for so-called important people like members of Parliament and other important people who would not be convicted in similar circumstances or even spoken to if it were known beforehand who they were. </para>
        <para>This story shows also that prosecution is often based on careless inaccuracies and sometimes straight out lies. Lies are often told in courts and in many cases magistrates are incapable even of doubting prosecution evidence no matter how improbable it is. The position is so bad that no-one of radical appearance or demeanour can assume that he will even be treated as a person, let alone get justice, in many Australian courts. It is no wonder that tens of thousands of young people have no confidence in courts or other authorities in Australia today and this situation will not be changed by trying to change them. It can be changed only if those applying the la.w at lower levels can become more truthful and fair minded, because it is they who have understandably lost the confidence of most of those with whom they deal. </para>

          <para>- This evening I want to raise a matter concerning the Prime Minister&#39;s office. Unfortunately the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Gorton)</inline> is not in the chamber. He was here during the course of the day, and last night he made a brief visit to make a ministerial statement. The matter I raise concerns the availability to citizens of Australia, particularly elderly citizens, of means of communicating with members of the Parliament - on this occasion no other than the Prime Minister 1 have not met the elderly person concerned in this incident. My information has been obtained from the South Australian Premiers Department. A letter from the South Australian Premier was directed to the Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wentworth)</inline> who is now sitting at the Table. It concerned social service benefits. However the elderly gentleman saw fit to address a letter to the Prime Minister. He correctly addressed it: &#39;The Right Honourable <inline font-weight="bold">Mr John</inline> Gorton, Prime Minister of Australia, Parliament House, Canberra, ACT 2600&#39;. To ensure that it was delivered and that the Prime Minister received it he registered this article of mail. No doubt if postal workers had been on strike at. that particular time we would have heard the Prime Minister, some of his ministers and members of the Government Parties criticising them, but there was no such occurrence to delay the delivery of this piece of mail, lt arrived in Canberra. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The letter carries about a dozen franking marks, 2 if not 3 of which are the Parliamentary Post Office franking mark, lt indicates also that the Prime Minister&#39;s office was made aware by the Parliamentary Post Office in this building on, I think, 30th November, 15th December and 1 7th December that the letter was here. On Monday last I broke my spectacles and it may be that those dates are not quite correct. However, nobody seems to know the Prime Minister - at least for the purpose of collecting this piece of correspondence. I would be interested later if the Minister for Social Services would inform me whether he received correspondence in his Department about this elderly gentleman&#39;s problem. </para>
        <para>My main reason for rising is to criticise the fact that although a member of the public - in this particular case an elderly person - has taken the opportunity of writing to the Prime Minister, the Prime Minister&#39;s office has not had the decency, honesty or respect to acquire that letter from the Post Office. It lay in this place for about 2 months and was then returned to the elderly gentleman. It had not been opened by the Prime Minister&#39;s office. Although the letter appears as though it could have been opened I doubt whether it has been because the card accompanying the returned letter indicates that it had not been accepted. 1 am prepared to hand this letter to the Prime Minister&#39;s staff tomorrow morning if they are prepared to treat this matter as the citizen intended it should be treated when he posted the letter. In the meantime I will hold the letter in the interests of the person who wrote it. I assure the Prime Minister and anyone on his staff that there is nothing dangerous in it. I am sure that the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation will not be looking over his shoulder if the Prime Minister signs a document authorising the release of the letter to his office so that it can be properly and adequately dealt with. He can rest assured that if he puts his signature to a document to acquire that letter that document will not be misused, misrepresented, or misquoted. </para>
        <para>The crux of the matter is that the Prime Minister or his staff ought not adopt the attitude which they adopted in this case. I know that from time to time the Prime Minister would receive some correspondence that he did not want to receive. However, that goes along with the responsibilities of his office. The Prime Minister, of course, should not be suspicious of the fact that there is a registered letter for him in the parliamentary Post Office. He ought not to brush it off so lightly. </para>

            <para>- Apparently the Prime Minister of the country is not known. So far as this gentleman is concerned he is non-existent. No doubt as a result of the treatment that has been accorded to this person he does not want to know the Prime Minister anyway. 1 am concerned that the Prime Minister&#39;s Department or the Prime Minister&#39;s office will accept this letter on behalf of a citizen of the Commonwealth and will pay some attention to its contents. I hope to goodness that in future there is never another case such as this one drawn to my attention to show that the Prime Minister&#39;s office or Department has dealt with a person in this manner. </para>

            <para>- Yes, certainly I withdraw it. It may well be that they have some kind of desire to break down all con-  stituted authority. Indeed, the honourable member for Lalor has set his name to a proposal saying that authority should not be in the Parliament and, 1 think, in the courts; he has said that it has to be in the streets and so on. This is the kind of disorder which both honourable members are sponsoring. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>I listened with some regret to what I thought was an abuse of parliamentary privilege by the honourable member for Reid. He has parliamentary privilege which isa great privilege and should not be used, I think, for personal advantage and in a personal matter. The honourable member said things in this place under privilege about 2 police officers.I do not know anything about the truth of his allegations or the truth of their evidence. But I think it is improper that in a personal matter like this an honourable member should get up and use -I would almost say abuse - his parliamentary privilege to call people who differ with him outside of the House names of this character in a matter, as I have said, in which he is personally concerned. If he were acting on behalf of someone else perhaps it would be different.I think it is a little mean for the honourable member to use parliamentary privilege for his own advantage and in his own cause against other people in the way that he did in this place tonight. </para>
        <para>At the beginning of my speechI said that there was a parallelism between what the 2 honourable members had done. It is said that parallel lines do not meet. However, sometimes they diverge. In this instance there is a divergence which I think might be brought to the notice of the House. The honourable member for Reid has said - I do not know for what motive or whether he wants to be a public martyr or not - that he would like to serve his sentence rather than pay his fine. He says that he is willing to stand up and be counted. If my facts are wrong I will be corrected but the honourable member for Lalor was one of the people who signed his name to a published document. When he was interrogated as to whether this printed signature was his real signature, as I understand it he sat mute. He refused to take responsibility. He ran out and he allowed his friends to carry the can for him. He ran out on his mates. If these facts are correct they throw a somewhat curious light upon the protestations of the honourable member for Lalor. </para>

The modern methods of treatment for leprosy, which are based on home examination and medication, mean that such examinations can be carried out as part of a wider study, and that the treatment can be carried out by the medical staff in the area. </para>

The success of these boards has been remarkable, and has been reflected in  the  fact that there are only two or three appeals each year from about  a  thousand decisions.

              <para>It appears evident from the honourable member&#39;s questions Nos 2091 to 2116 inclusive that he has been reading the I.L.O. publication Measuring Labour Productivity&#39; published in 1969.

              <para>and (3) I refer the honourable member to the answers given to questions Nos 524 (Hansard, 5th May 1970, page 1644), 1821 (Part 1) (Hansard, 27th October 1970,  pages  2830-1), 1225 (Hansard, 13th October 1970, page 2064) and 2028 (Hansard. 30th October 1970. page 3168). As indicated in the answers to these questions, there are no regularly published official estimates of labour productivity in Australia, but the Commonwealth Statistician is examining the desirability of compiling and publishing such estimates. In its submissions in recent National Wage hearings, the Commonwealth has provided estimates of the change in Gross National Product at constant prices per person at work. </para>

              <para>A serviceman occupying a Government owned house pays either the economic rent based primarily on the capital cost of the house, or 15 per cent of his pay and allowances, whichever is the lesser. In other words, servicemen cannot pay more than the economic rent but may pay less. Nearly half of the servicemen in government houses are paying less than the economic rent. </para>

              <para>The majority of public servants in government houses are required to pay the economic rent without any upper limit based on percentage of salary. However, lower rates based generally on 10 per cent of salary apply to certain premises where the occupant has caretaker or other responsibilities such as resident postmasters, and are also generally applied as a staff attraction in Northern Territory and Papua/New Guinea. However, any apparent difference between the rental charged to servicemen and Commonwealth public servants in Papua/New Guinea is virtually cancelled out by rebates made through Territories Allowance. </para>

            <item label="(1)">
              <para>(a) Servicemen occupying Government houses pay an economic rent based primarily on the capital value of the house occupied, but there is a maximum of 15 per cent of pay and allowances applied. In service accommodation generally, there is an almost equal division between those paying economic rents and those paying rent at 15 per cent of pay and allowances. The general effect of the 15 per cent limitation is to subsidise the cost of Service rents, particularly in the case of lower ranks where the pay percentage tends to be less than the economic rent. </para>
              <list type="loweralpha">
                <item label="(b)">
                  <para>The majority of public servants  are  required to pay the prescribed economic rent without any salary-percentage limitation. They therefore may pay more than a serviceman for a similar house, and would not normally pay less. However, special rent concessions are provided for public servants in Northern Territory mainly as a form of attraction allowance to assist in staffing, and also in Papua-New Guinea although in the latter case any difference between servicemen&#39;s and public servants&#39; rentals is broadly compensated by adjustments in Territory Allowance. The other cases where the 10 per cent of salary limitation applies are mainly where the public servants have incidental obligations requiring them to live on the premises, e.g. postmasters. </para>

            </item>
            <item label="(2)">
              <para>The differences are therefore not entirely one way. The reasons for the differences are largely historical. Service rentals have always had  a  pay percentage limitation, and the constant rotation of servicemen has made a single Australia wide formula desirable. Public service rents, on the other hand, have regard to the normal Treasury requirement for recovery of economic costs, but also to industrial award concessions for caretaker responsibilities and the special circumstances of particular departments. </para>

However, 1 understand that a population projection it has made for the Illawarra Region which comprises the local government areas of Wollongong, Shellharbour.

              <para>These representations &#39;were made before full information on the proposed changes was available and arose from a mistaken notion held by those bodies that the Government&#39;s announced intention to abandon land rent would undermine the leasehold system of land tenure in Canberra. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>Information about the changes and the reasons for them have been given in ray reply to question No. 1923 (Hansard, 21st October 1970, pages 2615-6), in my public statement of 22nd October 1970, as well as in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton&#39;s</inline> speech in the Senate on 26th October in support of the Land Rent (Interim Provisions) Ordinance 1970. </para>
          <para>I made it clear in my statement that the changes would in no way affect the planning and development advantages of the leasehold system, but would remove inequitable distribution of land charges. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton</inline> also made this clear and he emphasised that there was no intention of interfering with the leasehold system of tenure, rather the intention was to retain all the advantages of the leasehold system whilst putting Canberra&#39;s finances on to a basis which both the people of Canberra and the people of Australia can comprehend. </para>

              <para>Formerly, upon a variation of a covenant or condition of lease, the City Area Leases Ordinance provided for the unimproved value of the land to&#39; be reappraised and for land rent to be adjusted accordingly. In this way the Commonwealth received part of the benefit of the increased value given to the lease. The new system ensures that the Commonwealth shares in the additional value given to a lease in these circumstances. </para>

              <para>Due to the small number of A.C.T. motor cycles with an engine capacity in excess of 250 c.c. there was not sufficient A.C.T. insurance experience available for the relativity to be based on A.C.T. insurance experience alone.

              <para>(a) Prior to the 1968 increase in the preium rates, a constant loading for expenses of $1.75 was added to each policy. At the request of the Third Party Insurance Premiums Advisory Committee, the NRMA Insurance Ltd supplied in confidence a statement showing the estimated cost to the company of administering compulsory third party insurance business in the A.C.T. The cost was shown to be of the order of 11% of premium income. The view was taken in 1968 that the proper method of loading the premium to meet expenses of administration was to add a fixed sum to the premium for each policy. The fixed sum equivalent to the percentage referred to above is $3.36. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>The Third Party Insurance Premiums Advisory Committee in its report published in 1968, said that it had been impressed by the arguments put forward by the NRMA Insurance Ltd that it was faced with substantial increases in administrative costs due to recent clerical awards adding as much as 10% per annum to salaries and with rising costs of supplies and services. The new rate of premium in 1968 was intended to be sufficient to provide for levels of expenses in the immediate future, rather than for past levels of expenses, a loading of$3. 75 per policy for expenses was adopted. </para>

              <para>The 7&#189;% of the gross premium for contingencies used prior to 1968 was adopted in 1964 to provide for an anticipated increasing trend in claim costs and to permit the establishment of a small buffer reserve against unforeseeable changes in experience. </para>

The need for a substantial proportion of the 7&#189;% contingency loading therefore disappeared, although the possibility of unforeseeable changes in experience still exist. A 2&#189;% contingency loading was adopted in 1968 as being sufficient for the immediate future. </para>

            <para>- The answer provided by my predecessor <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon)</inline> to the honourable member&#39;s question is as follows: (1), (2) and (3) The most important role for the police at demonstrations is to take steps to prevent breaches of the peace. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>People who organise peaceful demonstrations have no control over elements unknown to them who often intrude and who are prone to create disturbances or may incite others to commit offences and in preparing plans for dealing with possible eventualities, it is important for police to be  able to identify these intruders so that the most effective measures can be taken in the hope that breaches of the peace will be prevented. Photographs taken at demonstrations provide a valuable aid to police in carrying out this function. </para>
          <para>Photographs of scenes at different demonstrations enable the effectiveness of any new procedures introduced with the aim of improving methods of dealing with such occasions to be evaluated. </para>
          <para>Photographic records also enable the effects of demonstrations on traffic flow and the rights of access of other citizens to streets and other public places to be studied. </para>
          <para>Demonstrations are, by their nature, public occasions and are commonly photographed by news photographers or private individuals as well as police. There is a proper distinction between such photographs taken on public occasions and police identification photographs of persons in custody and that distinction is preserved in the police records. </para>
          <para>I am not prepared to give the assurance sought. </para>

            <para>There is consultation between the MinisterinCharge of Aboriginal Affairs and the Minister for the Interior on policy issues affecting Aborigines in the Northern Territory. The training of Aboriginal men and women is the responsibility of the Welfare Division of the Northern Territory Administration within the Department of the Interior. One of the functions of the Welfare Division is to provide for the welfare and advancement of Aborigines in the Northern Territory and to carry out its functions the Division is staffed with experienced and qualified officers. </para>
            <para>The Australian School of Pacific Administration, Teachers&#39; Colleges, departmental courses and Public Service conferences provide specialised staff training and training on the job is given in the field. At the Australian School of Pacific Administration, for example, the courses for teachers and patrol officers give special attention to anthropology and other studies which have a particular relevance to the Aboriginal situation. All training programmes are aimed at developing among officers an understanding of Aboriginal culture and society and the broad policies of Government for the development of the Aboriginal people as well as imparting special skills required. The duties of field officers include the training of Aborigines <inline font-style="italic">so</inline> that they can take advantage of opportunities for economic progress by using the natural resources within Aboriginal reserves. </para>
            <para>A number of Aboriginal business ventures have been assisted with finance from the Aborigines Benefits Trust Fund and the Capital Fund to assist Aboriginal enterprises. Where this is necessary the assistance includes funds to employ people with technical and management skills to assist the Aboriginal owners. Examples of this are the fishing project at Umbakumba, gardening projects at Maningrida and Garden Point, the proposed store at Wave Hill, the prospecting being done by Aborigines at Docker River, and the copper leaching plant at Yuendumu. Other prospecting rights have been granted to Aboriginal groups from Maningrida and Goulburn Island and these groups have received and continue to have available to them technical and other assistance from the Territory Administration. </para>

The true function of the Commission is to settle industrial disputes.

It will not ignore the consequences to be expected from its actions but it will not deliberately create situations which would need rectification by Governmental action.

              <para>In January 1968 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Commissioner</inline> E. J. Clarkson granted male and female workers employed under the Commonwealth Hostels Award wage increases on work value grounds and, in addition, granted female workers an increase equivalent to the differences between the former male and female basic wages and abolished interstate differences in wage rates for male and female workers. The Commissioner also granted to all workers employed under the award two weeks of paid sick leave foc each year of service subsequent to service of seven years. </para>

              <para>Commonwealth Hostels Limited appealed not only against the decision to award female workers a wage increase equivalent to the difference between the former male and female basic wages, but also against the decision to abolish the interstate differences between wage rates for male and female workers.

          <para>The reason for the  President  of the Commission not setting the appeal down for hearing soon after the stay applications had been decided is apparent from the following extract from a decision handed down on 15th July 1968, in which the Commission, inter alia, extended stay orders previously granted: </para>
          <para>I would like to add for myself as  President  that it should bc manifest to the industrial world and also to the representatives of the parties and especially to this particular union that it is impossible for me to set this down for hearing at present. It is not the wish of the organised employers or the organised trade unions that the two issues of equal rates for females and males and the abolition of interstate differentials be tested at this particular point of time. Indeed it will be clear - and I recommend to the union that it look at the transcript of today&#39;s proceedings before <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Senior</inline> Commissioner Taylor in regard to the forthcoming national wage case, where the representatives of the Australian Council of Trade Unions made it clear that the A.C.T.U. did not want the issue of equal pay for men and women or the abolition of interstate differentials decided at or even during the national wage cases which are going to commence on 6th August; they wanted those issues decided separately and later than that. </para>
          <para>It will be seen therefore that it would be impracticable to the point of absurdity if I were to put this appeal down for hearing at the present time.&#39; </para>

Under the consent award female workers eligible for equal pay will receive the full male rate from and after January .1972.

              <para>The Commonwealth intervenes in the public interest only in cases of major economic importance or in cases in which some major principle is to be considered. The appeal referred to by the honourable member was concerned with the question as to whether <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Commissioner</inline> Winter properly observed equal pay principles laid down by the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in its decision in the Equal Pay Case 1969 in which the Commonwealth intervened.

              <para>The only case dealing exclusively with claims for wage increases for female workers in which the Commonwealth intervened in recent years was the Equal Pay Case 1969. In this case the Commonwealth recommended the adoption of the principle of equal pay for equal work. The Public Service Board has never intervened in a case dealing exclusively with claims for increased wage rates for female workers, but appeared in the Equal Pay Case 1969 as a party when it supported the concept of equal pay recommended by the Commonwealth. Neither the Commonwealth nor the Public Service Board has ever appealed against a decision in a case which dealt exclusively with wage claims for female workers. To my knowledge no Commonwealth instrumentality has ever intervened or appealed against a decision in such a case. However the honourable member will be aware that Commonwealth Hostels Limited, a company limited by guarantee, appealed inter alia against a decision handed down by Commissioner Clarkson early in 1968 on wage rales for females employed under the Commonwealth Hostels Award. </para>

            <para>Workers&#39; compensation can be awarded to dependants who live in another State, Territory or country under the laws of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia, Tasmania, the Australian Capital Territory, the Northern Territory and the Commonwealth. Restrictions in the New South Wales and Western Australian legislation on payment of compensation for dependants residing in another country were removed by amendments to the legislation which came into effect on 3rd December 1970 and 8th May 1970, respectively. The position in Queensland is that the Queensland Government has decided that when amendments to the Workers&#39; Compensation Acts are next introduced, they will include provision to remove existing restrictions on the payment of compensation to dependants in a foreign country of workers killed or injured in Queensland and that, pending appropriate amendments to those Acts, compensation will be paid to dependants domiciled in a foreign country of workers killed or injured in Queensland. Thus treatment of dependants of workers killed or injured in Australia is uniform in the sense that compensation benefits extend to those dependants in another country or in a State or Territory other than that where the worker was killed or injured. </para>

            <para>No. In my statement of 12th June last, in which 1 announced that Cabinet after long consideration had been unable to find a civilian alternative to national service which it considers is both equitable and practicable, I set out some of the key criteria which the Government considers an alternative must satisfy in Australia. Among other things 1 said: </para>
            <para>Constitutional difficulties must be avoided and the provisions of international Conventions on forced labour which Australia has ratified not breached. A scheme which would provide civilian service as an alternative for all national service registrants could be construed as &#34;man power&#34; control, in which case there would not be a constitutional basts for it at the present time, and would probably not be acceptable under the ILO Conventions.&#39; </para>

              <para>Until 1967 the awards  to  which the honourable member is referring were made under the scheme known as the Canberra Scholarship Scheme. From the beginning of 1968, coinciding with the entry to university of the first group of students who attempted the Higher School Certificate examination, the awards have been known as University Scholarships in the Australian Capital Territory. The new scheme makes available a smaller number of awards with higher benefits than the Canberra Scholarship Scheme. The number of students who accepted scholarships in the years 1958-1970 is as follows: (In a small number of cases, a few students who accepted awards in the years shown elected to defer their scholarship and to commence studies in the following year.) </para>

            <para>Based on the present number of non-pensioner wives of pensioners, including wives receiving wives&#39; allowances, it is estimated that the proposal would cost some $7. 5m a year. This total cost would remain the same irrespective of whether the adjustments were made immediately or by equal increments over a period of 3 or 6 years. In the. latter event, of course, the cost each year, until the proposal became fully operative, would be higher than that of the preceding year by onethird or one-sixth of the total cost. </para>
            <para>In arriving at the estimate of $7.5m it has been assumed that the proposal would involve reducing the husband&#39;s pension in each case by $1.75 a week, i.e. from the standard rate to the married rate, and cancelling supplementary assistance, where payable. </para>

            <para>Since my answer of. last year, the Commonwealth Statistician has compiled a new Gross National Product series .&#39;at constant prices covering the period 1948-49 to 1969-70. The series is comprised of three overlapping series, one at average prices of 1953-54 (1948-49 to 1959-60), one at average prices of 19.59-60 (1953-54 to 1966-67) and one at average prices of 1966-67 (1959-60 to 1969-70). These series have been linked on the basis of the&#39; earliest possible years (1953-54 and 1959-60) and the continuous series thus obtained is included id the table&#34; below. </para>

              <para>, (3) and (4) The contribution which domestic savings have made to Australia&#39;s capital resources was estimated by deducting from total private and public investment spending, including the change in the value of stocks, the amount of the current account deficit on the balance of payments. (That deficit provides a measure of the extent to which total capital spending has been financed by an increase in Australia&#39;s overseas indebtedness.) The estimated contribution by domestic savings, derived in this way, was expressed as a percentage of total investment. It is not possible to dissect the balance of payments current account deficit amongst different categories of investment spending, and as a consequence it is not possible to provide such a dissection of the derived estimate of the contribution which domestic savings have made to capital resources. The information requested is, therefore, not available. </para>

              <para>From a traffic handling viewpoint alone it is desirable and is the normal practice that aircraft from northern&#39; ports make a righthand base approach when using runway 35. Similarly, military aircraft on training make righthand circuits as the normal practice when this runway .is in use. Aircraft approaching &#39; from the south-west usually make a left base approach but in so doing intercept the runway centre line extension some distance from the airport, after having tracked south of the city. There are occasions, such as when helicopter training is in progress where variations to the foregoing are required in the interest of safe and efficient control of the traffic. Such variations are infrequent. </para>

          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(1)">
              <para>Yes. in October, 1970. I visited Albany, Esperance, Kalgoorlie and Bunbury. </para>

              <para>Yes. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(3)">
              <para>Yes. The main point made by the representatives of the local Council was that they considered adequate provision had been made for aviation in the area and that if the aviation industry wanted something additional then perhaps it should provide those additional facilities from its own resources. It was very much doubted whether there is a real need for a commuter type service in competition with the good road to Perth. Rather it was suggested that irregular charter flights on an &#39;as required&#39; basis should suffice. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(4)">
              <para>Yes. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(5)">
              <para>Not necessarily. I was endeavouring  to  inform myself on the widest possible range of aviation matters within the very limited time available and, as you are probably aware, the visit to Bunbury was the last call towards the end of a quite extensive tour  of  Queensland, Northern Territory and Western Australia.. The actual timing  of  the visit to Bunbury was only confirmed with the Town  Clerk  the day immediately preceding the visit. In these circumstances, I wished to avoid causing anybody any inconvenience by having them make last minute adjustments to their own appointments or other general commitments. </para>
