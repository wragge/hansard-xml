            <para>- My question is directed  to the Minister for the Navy. I preface the question by reminding the Minister that Royal Australian Navy personnel serving in submarines receive additional pay, commonly referred to as hard lying pay, and those serving in small ships receive half that amount. I ask: Will the Minister, in view of Judge Rapke&#39;s report, consider extending this hard lying payment to Navy personnel serving in Has &#39;Sydney&#39; as the circumstances and the conditions would appear to warrant this payment? </para>

            <para>-The Kerr Committee at the present time is examining the whole question of sailors&#39; and officers&#39; pay. It is true that an additional payment is made to submarine personnel in the Navy because of the hard lying conditions and that this payment may be extended to personnel on other vessels. This is one of the terms of reference of that Committee. We expect to have a submission from it which will materially affect all the wages and conditions of men in the Service. I expect that I will be able to make some further announcement on this matter in the next few months. </para>

            <para>- I know of the great interest of the honourable members for Macarthur and Bradfield and many other honourable members in the work that this Government is doing in the field of the environment. In reply to the first part of the question, I have been able to arrange with the State Ministers concerned a meeting to be held in Canberra on 17th September in order to find ways and means of co-ordinating our activities. It is true that a meeting had to be postponed until some States were able to set up their own departments and get them in working order. This has now been done. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Referring to the last part of the question I am certain that as a result of increased activity, not only on the Federal scene but also in the States, a larger number of companies have been taking much greater care to prevent damage which might otherwise have been occasioned to the environment as a result of their activities. </para>

            <para>- I address my question to the Minister for the Environment, Aborigines and the Arts. It relates to the recent substantial increase in the rate of infant mortality among the Aboriginal population in the Alice Springs area. Has the Minister given consideration to a letter which I wrote to him in which I drew to his notice the views expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Kalokerinos</inline> of Collarenebri as to the reasons for this increase? Is he aware of the very great amount of research undertaken by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Kalokerinos</inline> into the causes of the very high rate of Aboriginal infant mortality? Is he aware that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Kalokerinos</inline> believes that an inquiry ought to be held immediately into this very important matter which involves the lives of Australian children? If he is aware of these matters will he say what action he has taken? </para>

            <para>- I agree with the honourable member that if a significant number of independent schools were to close this would immediately constitute a very serious education problem for Australia. It would have one immediate consequence of putting greater stress and strain on the State systems, but quite apart from that practical reason, the Commonwealth has for a long time believed in and actively supported the dual system of education, believing that a system which provides a choice, as the system in Australia does, has particular advantages. For this reason the Commonwealth has in the past introduced policies designed quite specifically to support independent education outside the State systems. At an early date I will be seeking to make contact with the independent education authority and also, of course, with my colleagues, the State Ministers for Education. I know that there has been continuing discussion between the Commonwealth and other education authorities under the auspices of my predecessor. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The only other thing that I think I should say is that it is not only to the </para>
          <para class="block">Commonwealth that independent authorities ought to look for assistance for independent education. The State governments all have policies of supporting independent education, as does the Commonwealth. But it should also be worth noting that the one State that does least for independent education is the State of South Australia, and I would hope that that State might be able to lift its support of independent education in a manner commensurate with other States. </para>

            <para>- It is expected that the opening season of the Sydney Opera House will be one of the greatest cultural activities in Australia&#39;s history. It is expected that this will take place some time in 1973. In order that the season shall be of world standard, the Australian Council for the Arts has asked me to see what can be done to build up the standards of the Australian Opera Company and its associated orchestras. The Government has received this request and has decided that the grant to the Australian Opera Company and the associated orchestras, in this financial year, will rise from $895,000 to $1,295,000, an increase of 45 per cent. </para>

          <para>We expect that this aid will be continually built up so that by 1973 we shall have in Australia an opera company which is of world class. I believe that when the Opera House in Sydney is operating it shall be a mecca for people who wish to see our cultural achievements. I would think that not only will there be an increase in aid from the Government to help in the work of the Australian Opera Company, but also will there be a comparable increase in subscriptions from those other bodies which are well wishers in respect of the work of this Company which has already had such a marked effect on our cultural achievements over the last few years. </para>

            <para>- I did glance this morning at the editorial of the Melbourne &#39;Age&#39; to which the honourable member has referred. I must say frankly that I found it misinformed, mischievous, and misleading. I do not want to take up the time of the House unduly on this issue, except to say that of course the matter to which the Melbourne &#39;Age&#39; editorial refers is not one on which there has been any pronouncement of Government policy. That newspaper would be better advised to keep its powder dry at this stage. I do not canvass the issue, except to refer in brief to the fact that what is put forward and presented in the editorial is very much out of step with public opinion as interpreted by gallup polls with the opinion of the business sector and also with the opinion of a number of prominent trade union officials who have made comment on this issue in recent months. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Because the editorial was lengthy, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> perhaps I could be permitted to make one or two other observations. I said before that the comment was mischievous. I mean just that. Of course, I know what section 45 of the present Act means and what its implications are. It is also mischievous to suggest that the matter that was raised by the honourable member for Bennelong was raised with an desire to take attention of other aspects of Government policy. Apparently Opposition members who are interjecting really do not want to join in an examination of this matter. I said that the editorial was misleading. There was a statement that my gross figures were, in fact, misleading. They are the figures which come direct from the Commonwealth Statistician. They are not my figures. They are imputed to me. Of course, I support the fact that the figures are correct. If one looks back over recent years - not just to 1970  -  one can see a clear increase in strike activity in this country. In 1967 some 700,000 man days were lost; in 1968, 1 million man days were lost; in 1969, 2 million man days were lost and last year, 1970, some 2.4 million man days were lost. I suggest that what is presented in the editorial is misleading. Apart from the fact that it was misleading, it misinterpreted the situation. There was a reference in the editorial, as I recall it, to the fact that some - I emphasise the word &#39;some&#39; - strikes are economically damaging and disruptive. I suppose that the inference that can reasonably be drawn from this is that a large number of strikes, in fact, are not. I put it to the House that we are concerned with the totality of strike action in this country and that totality of strike action is very disruptive indeed. So far as the business world and the leaders of the great industries of this country are concerned, often times a strike lasting- </para>

              <para>- I certainly agree with your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> and I take your point advisedly. I was suggesting to the House that strikes of short duration, if spread over a long period, are more disruptive to many industries than, say, a strike which may last for a period of 1 week. We are concerned with the totality of the strike issue. I put to the House that the editorial comment to which I have made reference is, in fact, a misinterpretation. I only regret that time does not permit a full exposition. </para>

I suggest to the honourable member that he reflect on an answer I gave to the honourable member for Bennelong on Monday of this week. The situation is clear. The Government has indicated that this matter is under examination and consideration. I have indicated, quite properly, that in the light of that context it is not a matter of definitive answer. I suggest that the honourable member contain his interest. </para>

I ask: Will the Minister, during the next 2 weeks, have prepared and present to the House a government audited statement showing (a) the amount of wheat delivered to the licensed receivers in each State in each year of the quota delivery arrangement, such statement to show the quality classification of the wheat and whether it was accepted for delivery as quota wheat, over-quota wheat or non-quota wheat; and (b) the total amount of money drawn against the first advance overdraft and the distribution of this money in its various categories, both interstate and intrastate, and having application to the quantities and classifications set out in (a)? </para>

            <para>- As the honourable member will know, the basis for distribution of wheat after the introduction of wheat quotas was as a result of recommendations by the Australian Wheat Federation. The Federation made recommendations to governments on the total quantum of wheat that should be distributed and on the allocation amongst the States. In addition there was a provision that ready scalable cheats should be acceptable as over-quota in certain circumstances. There has been correspondence between the State Ministers and myself. Within the Australian Agricultural Council there have been discussions as to the distribution of wheat. In the instance to which the honourable gentleman has referred wherein in New South Wales there was received into the Grain Elevators Board as ready scalable wheat a certain quantity which was in excess of quota deliveries, this matter has been subject to discussion within the Australian Agricultural Council. It has been the subject of correspondence between the New South Wales Minister and myself. I believe there is a requirement for audited statements to be produced by the Australian Wheat Board to the Government in certain circumstances. I see no reason to require audited statements other than those which are statutorily required from the Board. However I can assure the honourable member that any question of over quota wheat is closely and critically scrutinised by the Agricultural Council. It will continue to be reviewed in that fashion in the future. </para>

The position as far as the whole of New South Wales is concerned is as I indicated to the Leader of the Opposition just a couple of days ago, and I hope within a matter of a couple of days to be able to let him have some information about the survey that has been undertaken throughout the whole of Australia, including New South Wales. Thu survey which was undertaken separately by the Joint Coal Board in relation to supplies to cover industry in New South Wales indicates that there is no problem regarding the supply to industry in the future, nor is there any problem regarding the production of power in the future. </para>
          <para>The report that I have from the Joint Coal Board indicates that this situation can be covered. In addition to that, as I say, this report that will be available to me shortly covering the survey undertaken by the Bureau of Mineral Resources in conjunction with the Joint Coal Board and the various State departments will clearly indicate that the situation will be fully under control as far as supplies of all types of coal for power production and for industry in Australia are concerned, and will allow very substantial reserves for export. This is a very important industry in Australia today. The situation is being carefully watched, and as I indicated before, we will shortly be in possession of a report regarding the total reserves in Australia. </para>

            <para>-  A considerable amount of work has been undertaken on the proposed legislation for a disciplinary code for the Services. However, there are still a number of major policy decisions which will have to be made. I am hoping fairly shortly - in the next week or so - to meet the Service Ministers and have some preliminary discussions. A number of policy decisions will have to be made and the one on the death penalty, which the honourable member has mentioned, is obviously one decision which will have to be made by the Government. After this decision has been made, of course, the legislation will be introduced into this House and honourable members will be able to debate it and vote upon it. I am hopeful that this will be possible during this sessional period. Perhaps the debate can be postponed until after honourable members have had an opportunity to look closely at the proposed legislation. But this does depend on how successful we are in overcoming a number of policy problems which still lie in this area. </para>

            <para>- The honourable member&#39;s interest in the affairs of his electorate is not concealed, I think, either from this House or from his electorate. I can give him only half an answer to this question. A decision has been made to establish the office which he requests, but I am unable to give him a time for its establishment. Some time ago my officers, together with officers of the Department of Interior, endeavoured to find suitable premises in the area. At that time they were unable to do so. But since that time, as the honourable member knows, there has been a very well appreciated restriction of Government spending, and under present policy it would not be immediately in prospect to provide the facility for which he is asking. Nevertheless, I can assure him that as soon as practicable the decision in principle to establish an office in Swan Hill will be implemented. </para>

          <para class="block">It is time that the opportunity was given to members of this House to correct deliberately false statements which are made by Ministers at question time. These statements cannot be debated because no opportunity is given to debate them. I believe that the only way in which this situation can be overcome is for the House to exert the right of members to raise matters by leave in this place. The Ministry is not the only body in the House which is entitled to participate in the administration of the affairs of Parliament. Parliament must make its own decisions. I move this motion because I believe that by continually using its numbers and its powers to gag debates so that statements can go unchallenged, the Government, and the Ministery especially, are deliberately depriving this nation of a proper democratic process of government through procedures. </para>

            <para>-  Yes, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> I second the motion. This is the second time this week that this procedure has had to be adopted. I take it that you take the attitude that as long as no reference is made to any member of the House, one can say what one likes about the people whom a member represents. Of course, it is true that if a member is mentioned he has the right - he does not have to seek leave - to make a statement to correct the situation. I do not know what the honourable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hurford)</inline> has in mind on this occasion. But earlier this week there was a very clear example in 2 successive question periods. A former Minister for Labour and National Service, one once removed, had asked the present Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> about a particular electorate. The question concerned one electorate alone. There was no dispute about this at all. It could only have reference to one particular area. When the honourable member who had particular knowledge of the matters concerned, as well as being the representative of the area, sought leave to make a statement leave was refused. Accordingly an attempt was made to give him an opportunity to speak by moving the suspension of Standing Orders. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The sheer fairness of our proposal is apparent. If an attack is made on a particular organisation, a particular electorate or the people in a particular electorate at question time, when the proceedings are broadcast and moreover at an hour when it is very easy to report the matter fairness would seem to dictate that the person who knows about it and who might be said to have some responsibility for it should <inline font-style="italic">be</inline> able to counter it. Any honourable member in this chamber can refuse leave in these circumstances. In these cases leave is usually refused by the Leader of the House, not by some irresponsible maverick in the Liberal Party. It is done by the man who, on behalf of the Government parties, conducts the affairs of this House. Surely in these circumstances honourable members will acknowledge that the opportunity for a reply should be given. </para>

            <para>-  I would like to draw the attention of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> and the honourable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Scholes)</inline> to the position regarding the Standing Orders and the normal arrangements of the House. The Standing Orders are designed to give honourable members an opportunity to bring before the House matters of importance to themselves or of public importance. There are procedures which are well known to all honourable members and there are times when these procedures can be used. There is question time and there is the debate on the motion to adjourn the House. There is also the Budget debate and later on the debate on the Estimates when matters of this nature can be discussed. I would like to point out that it has always been the custom of the House to follow the procedures which have been laid down but in addition if any honourable member feels that he desires to take some action after question time in relation to a matter which concerns him personally he can make a personal explanation, and this is done constantly in this House. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>If the procedures are to be changed this is a matter for consideration by the Standing Orders Committee. They cannot be changed on an ad hoc basis. It is my duty to ensure that there is an orderly procedure of business through the House. The procedures are laid down to try to ensure that situation. If outstanding or special circumstances exist which move an honourable member to seek leave to make a statement on some matter which concerns him directly, I have never known leave to be refused. That position still applies. But if suddenly, not following normal procedures, approaches of this kind are made - as have been made twice this week - they cannot be accepted unless there is some change in the normal procedures. Having listened to the honourable member for Corio and the seconder to the motion, and having indicated the position as far as the Government is concerned in relation to the Standing Orders and to the procedures of the House, I move: </para>

            <para>- Yes. I have been misrepresented by a newspaper report purporting to emanate from the honourable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hurford)</inline> appearing in the Northern Territory &#39;News&#39; on 21st August last. The report carries the heading &#39;Hunt name used without approval - MHR&#39;. The report then said that the honourable member for Adelaide all edged that the Administrator, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chaney,</inline> had used my name without my knowledge in a letter to the Legislative Council. The report then credited the honourable member with the claim that a. close look at my reply to a question by him in the House on Thursday last, 19th August, showed this quite clearly. In that reply I refuted the inference that he made that I was not aware of the Administrator&#39;s letter to the Legislative Council requesting the Council to remain in session so that a. Government Bill to increase stamp duties could be introduced and passed. Unless the honourable member claims to have been misreported, he has misrepresented me in a most dishonourable and clearly deliberate manner. </para>

            <para>- I raise a point of order. Your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> seems to put us in the very difficult position that when a statement of this sort is made to the House there is no way in which any honourable member, irrespective of which side of the House he is on, can correct it without appearing to be debating the question. Would it not be correct to say that in this case the honourable member for Adelaide has been misrepresented in the way in which the Minister brought his name into his personal explanation and that the only way the honourable member for Adelaide can reply under the Standing Orders is to speak in the form that he was speaking? </para>

            <para>- No, that is not so. I think the honourable member for Wills has found that the Chair has been fairly lenient in regard to personal explanations. When honourable members making personal explanations start to debate to and fro about what an honourable member said and what a Minister said it is a completely different thing. I think my ruling in these circumstances is correct. </para>

          <para>That the Bill be now read a second time. </para>
          <para>This Bill was introduced in and passed by the Senate last night. Its purpose is to rectify a difficult situation that arose out of the Senate&#39;s own action in disallowing the Evidence Ordinance 1971 of the Australian Capital Territory last Thursday. The disallowance of this ordinance resulted in a serious gap in the law relating to evidence in criminal proceedings in the Australian Capital Territory, to the extent that it has been necessary for criminal trials to be adjourned until the situation can be rectified. The disallowed ordinance had been in operation since 29th March of this year. The Bill passed by the Senate is designed to keep the ordinance in operation until 31st March 1972. The passage of this Bill by the Senate was made necessary in order to get the Senate out of a difficulty of its own making when it disallowed the Evidence Ordinance. The Bill is of a mechanical or machinery nature. This is not the occasion I suggest, to debate the merits of the ordinance because that is to be continued in force by the present Bill. The opportunity for that to be done will arise when substantive legislation is introduced at a later date, and presumably, or hopefully, before 31st March 1972. It is necessary in the interests of the administration of justice in the Australian Capital Territory that this Bill be passed as quickly as possible. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- The Opposition agrees to give this Bill an immediate passage. The reason for the action by the Opposition in this matter were expressed on behalf of the Opposition last night and earlier in the week in the Senate. I wish to take this opportunity to say what I have said on many occasions for the last 10 or 12 years. It is a matter of regret that the Commonwealth does not provide codes within its power and jurisdiction on matters of legal procedure and legal substance. There are a great number of matters in the field of the law where there can be no rational difference between the  6  States and the 2 mainland Territories. It is difficult in our Federal system to enact laws on many matters of substance or procedure. Usually the Commonwealth has taken the attitude that it should wait until there is a unanimity among the States or at least among neighbouring States to the Commonwealth Territories. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>However, the unfortunate fact is that the States have even greater difficulty than the Commonwealth in attracting draftsmen. Draftsmen are becoming increasingly important in the field of law. As a matter of principle, the man who drafts the law should be even more important than the man who interprets it. There are great inducements for people to become judges; there are still not as great inducement for people to become draftsmen. I am well aware of the demands which are made on the Commonwealth&#39;s draftsmen not only by the Government but also by the Opposition. If, however, the Commonwealth persists in the attitude that it must wait for the larger States or the neighbouring States to take the initiative the course of law reform in Australia will be very slow indeed. </para>
          <para>The Commonwealth&#39;s opportunities in law reform are becoming more important. The Australian Capital Territory is one of the most litigious areas in Australia. Not only is it litigious as between individuals but also is it litigious as between companies. For instance, we have found that in the MLC Company case and in the case of Queensland Mines Ltd there are very important commercial corporate matters which fall within Commonwealth jurisdiction. I would hope that an opportunity would be taken during the currency of this Bill, when it becomes an Act, to have a proper code of criminal procedure developed by the Commonwealth for all fields open to it, including the Australian Capital Territory, the Northern Territory, courts martial and all those matters of commercial law which fall to the Commonwealth under the Constitution. I can assure the Minister for Foreign Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr N- H. Bowen),</inline> who represents the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Greenwood)</inline> and who has twice been an Attorney-General himself that the present Opposition is very anxious to have modern laws in these subjects. I feel sure that the Minister would know this. The law should not be confused; it should not be archaic; it should not be expensive to the extent that it is now. The Commonwealth, despite the relatively small number of people who live in its Territories, does have the opportunity because of its draftsmen and &#39;because of its international contacts - and law is becoming more and more international - to take a lead in these matters. </para>
          <para>So, once again I make these general comments as I have done so often before where there has been any matter of criminal law relating to the Territories, overseas forces and aircraft under consideration. I have said this in many cases concerning the Territory laws that have come before this place. It is, I suppose, well over a year now since we were given a draft criminal code for the Territories. It has not yet been enacted and there has been no debate upon it. To my mind it is one of the least imaginative or liberal criminal laws in this country. The Opposition will help to speed the passage of this Bill. It hopes that by the time of the expiry of the provisions of this Bill the present government - if there has not been an election in the meantime - will have done all that it can to bring in a modern, comprehensible and accessible code of criminal procedure for all those persons and Territories falling within its jurisdiction. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr N.</inline>H. BOWEN (Parramatta)- Minister for Foreign Affairs (12.0) - in reply - In the light of what the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> has said about progressive ordinances in the Australian Capital Territory, I think I should say that this ordinance which has been disallowed by the Senate is itself a progressive reform and somewhat ahead of evidence acts in force in the various States. It was disallowed, not on the ground that it was not a good law, although some could debate particular provisions in it, but rather upon the ground that it should be debated in the Parliament. In regard to the date that is set - 31st March - if there should be an election before then the new Liberal-Country Party Coalition Government in power would bring in the Act which would put this back into force. The Bill should be introduced into Parliament before 31st March. </para>
          <para>The second thing I wish to say is that there is a Law Reform Commission now operating in the Australian Capital Territory, so we are able to hope that there will be coming forward progressive and more modernised laws in the Territory as a result of the activities of this Commission. It would slow down probably the progress of law reform in the Territory if everything that was produced had to be put through as an Act of the national Parliament and fitted into a national programme of legislation. In the past, these matters have been put through by ordinance. Certainly, the ordinances can be debated. They have to be tabled, but the requirements of converting each of these into an Act which will take its place with all the surrounding law for example, the Acts Interpretation Act applies to Acts but not to ordinances could slow down very considerably the progress of reform in the Territory </para>

          <para class="block">How many honourable members at present in this House have a copy of that? Has it been distributed? Is there a memorandum with it? I have a copy. It contains 33 pages and has 97 clauses concerning the rights of people before the courts, and the duties of the courts to the 120,000 who <inline font-style="italic">live</inline> in the Australian Capital Territory and to those who pass through it. I will not raise objection when the matter comes to the voting stage this time, but how on earth can we proceed in this way? The Senate in its wisdom passed the Bill. Honourable senators have been debating it for weeks. The Bill has come to this House; we have not considered it in any way; we do not know what is contained in it. I have not the competence to judge from a chance examination whether it is good, bad or indifferent. Do not tell me that legislation cannot pass through this Parliament after fairly close examination and still contain bad law. If this is the procedure this Parliament is to adopt we are departing from everything that Parliament is about. Let me record my protest in the strongest possible way that I do not believe we ought to pass this Bill this day in this manner. The Minister just stood and closed the debate. The other day he was talking about such matters as the civil rights. I do not think he knows what they mean. In the other place the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Greenwood)</inline> said that the Senate had no right to do what it did because it was not the Government of the country. The Parliament is the Government of the country. <inline font-style="italic">A</inline> similar situation developed once before when the prisoners who were in Goulburn gaol had to be let out because the law was inadequate. I, with whatever power I have as a 125th part of this House, will not consent to this kind of procedure at any future time. </para>

            <para>-  in reply - The honourable member for Wills <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bryant)</inline> effects an element of surprise at this, a lack of knowledge of it and insufficient warning. Having regard to the course that this matter took in the Senate, I would be morally certain that the caucus of the honourable member&#39;s Party would have discussed it. I think it is rather surprising to find the honourable member so surprised. This is a mechanical Bill. This is not the place to debate the substance of the Evidence Ordinance. There will be an opportunity for that when the Bill is introduced into the Parliament which, as I said, hopefully should be before 31st March next year. The purpose of this measure is to eliminate the difficulty created by the disallowance by the Senate of the Ordinance which brought about a situation in which no criminal matters can be heard in the courts of the Australian Capital Territory. The sooner that we adopt the machinery to restore the position, the better. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- The right honourable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Calwell)</inline> has asked that I make a statement on the measures for the protection of the United States dollar announced by  President  Nixon on 15th August. As honourable members will be aware, the situation in the international currency markets is changing from day to day and any assessment of the situation has to be treated cautiously at this point of time. However, in the view of the importance of the developments I feel it desirable to give the House a preliminary assessment. As honourable members will know, the present disturbed situation in the international currency markets was sparked off by the announcement of the  President  of the United States last week that convertibility of United States dollars into gold and other reserve assets was to be suspended, and a 10 per cent surcharge on all dutiable imports into the United States, other than those subject to quotas, was to be imposed. Both these decisions were announced by the  President  to be temporary. But it was made clear that the removal of the 10 per cent surcharge, and the resumption of convertibility of United States dollar balances, would be dependent on certain objectives being achieved by the United States as a result of negotiation in the fields of international trade and finance and the sharing of defence burdens. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>As to trade, the  President  claimed that American products were at a disadvantage because of unfair exchange rates. He said that the import tax would be ended when the unfair treatment ended. In the field of finance, the  President  asserted the need for a widespread major realignment of exchange parities, and also for an improved system of international monetary arrangements generally. The  President  also said that the time had come for other economically strong nations to bear their fair share of defending freedom around the world. This latest disturbance on the international currency markets is only the most recent of a long succession of similar disturbances, centring on one major currency after another, and sometimes on groups of currencies. In 1967 we had the disturbances leading up to the devaluation of sterling. In 1969, the pressure was transferred from London to Paris and we had the devaluation of the French franc and the revaluation of the De uts che mark. More recently, the trouble has centred on the United States and has been attributable in large part to the growing balance of payments deficit of that country. This has led to a fall in United States official reserves and a sharp increase in its official short term liabilities. At the same time, there has been a substantial transfer of United States dollars on private account into the international monetary markets of the world. All this has served to weaken confidence in the United States dollar on the foreign exchanges. </para>
          <para>A number of factors has contributed to the United States&#39; external deficit. Prominent among these is the rapid price and cost inflation in the United States over the last 5 years. The United States&#39; position has been exacerbated by the growing competitiveness of some of its trading partners and by restraints on the access of United&#39; States&#39; exports to markets abroad. Superimposed on this has been the heavy defence burdens of the United States. Defence expenditure abroad by the United&#39; States has recently been running at the level of about $US5 billion annually. One way and another, the balance of payments deficit has built up until, in the first half of this year, the deficit has been running at an annual rate of $US23 billion. </para>
          <para>It is not surprising, in these circumstances that the United States dollar is now commonly regarded as being &#39;over valued&#39;. In other words, the existing exchange parity for the United States dollar overrates its international purchasing power. This, of course, is a matter of critical worldwide importance because of the pivotal position in the international monetary system of the United States dollar. </para>
          <para>The United States dollar is the largest of the reserve currencies in the world today and many countries have fixed rates of exchange on the dollar. A great proportion of international trade and financial transactions has been settled through the dollar in the past. And the dollar has been adopted along with gold as one of the two basic units of value in the Brett on Woods monetary system. Other currencies have had their par values expressed in terms of the United States dollar and gold. </para>
          <para>There is no doubt that the Brett on Woods system has made a major contribution to full employment, economic growth, and the orderly development of world trade and financial arrangements in the post-war period. It has achieved this as a result of the adoption of a number of working principles, not least of which has been the system of agreed parities of rates of exchange between participating countries, adjustable only with the consent of the International Monetary Fund in the case of fundamental balance of payments disequilibrium. This system of pegged parities has been of particular value to smaller countries as a protection against the prewar practice of currency manipulation and competitive depreciations. &#39;It has also been of value to rapidly developing countries like Australia who do not have access to the economic dialogues centred on the United States and Europe. </para>
          <para>Nevertheless, no system is proof against the ravages of time and the Brett on Woods system is no exception. The need for further development of the Brett on Woods arrangements has long been recognised, and the most recent innovation has been the establishment of special drawing rights which, in themselves, offer some alternative to the United States dollar and gold as an international reserve asset. </para>
          <para>Another innovation, and this is very germane to the present situation, is that the Executive Board of the Fund has been discussing the case for a greater flexibility in the mechanism of exchange rate adjustments. There is a strong body of opinion which suggests that the present arrangements whereby exchange rates should not vary more than 1 per cent from parity should be changed by extending somewhat the operating limits within which currencies could be exchanged without being held to infringe their par values at the International Monetary Fund. </para>
          <para>The action taken by the United States last week has short-circuited this debate and taken the question of exchange rate adjustments into the field of immediate practical necessity in the foreign exchange markets. The 10 per cent surcharge on dutiable imports would, were it to be continued, strike heavily at the exports of countries like Japan which have had a large and growing market in the United </para>
          <para class="block">States for goods of the kinds subject to the surcharge. Through the effect of this on industries in such centres it would in turn tend to reduce their demand for materials supplied by other countries in the normal course of events. The surcharge is currently under consideration in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. </para>
          <para>The United States has, however, said that it sees this trade action as a means of securing revaluation of the currencies of countries which it considers to have an unwarranted advantage over it in point of trade competition because of their existing parities. If and to the extent that other countries were to revalue their currencies, the United States dollar would be devalued in relation to them. The United States Government has chosen this approach to its problem in preference to seeking a formal devaluation of its currency against all other currencies. </para>
          <para>Amongst other things that course would involve the United States in altering the value of the dollar in terms of gold. The  President  has said that his Government does not intend to alter the present dollar price of gold. We have, as yet, no real idea as to what the final response of other major countries to the United States initiative is going to be. </para>
          <para>Under the rules of the International Monetary Fund, the exchange parity of any country which is a member of the fund can be altered only if the country itself seeks a change. It seems reasonable to suppose that few, if any, major countries are likely to seek such a change unless and until other countries taken steps to do so. As yet there is no firm indication of concerted action amongst major countries to that end. </para>
          <para>On Thursday of last week the Finance Ministers of the European Economic Community, meeting in Brussels, failed to reach agreement on any form of common action in the matter. The foreign exchange markets in Europe were closed last week but have re-opened this week. There have been no formal revaluations on the dollar but the majority of European countries have allowed their buying rates for dollars to exceed the Monetary Fund limits of 1 per cent beyond parity with the dollar. In point of fact, however, the markets so far this week have been fairly steady on the dollar and the dollar has fallen in value in most markets by something in the region of only 2 per cent to 3 per cent below the rates ruling before the markets closed. 1 want to stress that this is likely to be an interim situation since it has done nothing to achieve the more significant realignment of exchange rates which the United States, and the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, consider to be necessary. This fact must be borne in mind in all our thinking and calculations. If, of course, a number of major currencies were to seek and obtain adjustments of their exchange parities under the International Monetary Agreement a question could arise as to whether Australia should seek some such adjustment. If such a. situation were to arise, we would need to make the most careful assessment of it from the standpoint of our own interests both international and domestic. But no such situation has arisen yet. </para>
          <para>We are keeping closely in touch with developments and studying all possibilities. At the same time we are preserving for ourselves the greatest possible scope for independence of action. If it should come to a decision whether or not to seek some alteration of our exchange parity there will be only one proper basis for decision the interests of the Australian economy and the Australian nation as a whole. Meanwhile, in the state of uncertainty which must prevail until the large issues I have mentioned are crystallised and intentions on the part of major countries become clearer, foreign exchange markets are likely to be very unsettled and changeable. We may also see large movements of funds between financial centres. It will be a matter of adjusting our own exchange dealing arrangements to meet changing situations as they arise. </para>
          <para>In this state of uncertainty in the foreign exchange markets it is not possible to settle on a firm exchange rate for the Australian dollar. However, in order to enable overseas transactions to be resumed, it has been decided to continue to fix an exchange rate with the pound sterling on a daily basis. For purposes of the last 3 days trading the existing parity with sterling that is, $A2.1429 for &#163;1 sterling has been maintained. It is true that, as sterling has been traded at a rate about 2 per cent above parity with the United States dollar, this means that at the moment there is, in effect, a similar small appreciation of the Australian dollar in relation to the United States dollar. However, the situation is being reviewed on a day-to-day basis and any short term change in the rate should not, of course, necessarily be taken as an indication as to the long term rate that will eventually be settled for the Australian dollar. </para>
          <para>For the time being, and until further notice, banks have been advised that they may undertake foreign exchange transactions in respect of normal trade transactions, other current account payments contractually due, and the reasonable requirements of travellers. Rates of exchange for these transactions are quoted by the banks under arrangements with the Reserve Bank and are based on developments in the London and other main foreign exchange markets overseas. </para>
          <para>The Reserve Bank is not yet offering facilities to the banks to cover them for forward transactions and, of course, this limits the scope of banks to offer such cover to their customers. I think this is reasonable in view of the present unsettled circumstances on the foreign exchanges. We will be ready to adjust our position as required in accordance with the emerging situation. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- At the beginning of his speech, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McMahon)</inline> said, and I agree with this, that his statement is little more than a preliminary assessment. The Prime Minister went on further to suggest that what has happened up to date is only an interim situation since it has done nothing to achieve the more significant realignment of exchange rates which the United States of America and the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund consider to be necessary. However, I would like to make one or two observations about the situation on behalf of my Party. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I note that the Prime Minister suggests that at all times he will keep in mind the interests of the Australian economy and the Australian nation as a whole. It would seem that in many respects the action which the United States took in this matter was at least an endeavour to set its own house in order. I think there are one or two signs at the moment where the Australian house also needs to be set in order. </para>
          <para>One of the great difficulties in discussions of this type is to separate what might be called the truly trading aspects of international exchange from what sometimes become financial and turn into unhealthy speculative aspects. If one reads between the lines of the Reserve Bank report which was tabled in this House the other day, one can find that there is a great deal about capital inflow into Australia which is not known and which, in my view, ought to be known. Until it is known and catalogued more systematically, the situation as we see it will be made much more dangerous than it is. I think the sort of thinking that is wrong in this matter was also described by the Prime Minister in his speech. The Prime Minister talked of what goes on. He said that we do not have access to the economic dialogues centred in the United States and Europe. What is at stake here is the future of the international monetary arrangements which, as the Prime Minister rightly said, came into operation to assist the smaller countries and the developing countries. The smaller countries and the developing countries are very far removed from either the United States or Europe. It is time that it was realised that more than half of the population of the world lives in developing countries. Australia is a developing country and is a neighbour to the undeveloped part of the world. </para>
          <para>I think what was wrong in the present situation was that the United States acted unilaterally in his matter. It ought to have gone to the International Monetary Fund, like anyone else, to make any variation in its exchange rate. Technically, perhaps, the United States has not done that, but it certainly has not observed the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. As the Prime Minister pointed out, what in essence has been done here in regard to the import charges on trade is in breach of GATT. I hope that in the days ahead of this crisis the Government will stress this point in those councils. I do not know whether we should seek to become one of the Ten. After all, the Ten consists of European countries. What has to be stressed, if we become one of the Ten, is that we are a voice for the developing and undeveloped parts of the world. I think what horrifies people most about crises of this kind is that certain blocks of money measured in billions of dollars can almost seem to be transferred overnight, speculators can have a heyday and the victims are the trade terms of developing parts of the world. If this is the case there is something fundamentally wrong with the existing arrangements. </para>
          <para>I hope that the system is not destroyed. I think that the special drawing rights were an improvement. I still have my own views, which in deference to my colleague the honourable member for Kalgoorlie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Collard)</inline> I will not state, about the future of gold. It seems to me monstrous that in 1971 we still need to have reference to the shibboleth of gold. It seems unfortunate that if we are to have some other currency in the place of gold there will be a certain amount of loss of face on the part of those countries whose currencies cannot be regarded as the paramount one. The fact that there has been only a slight shift of a few points in the last few days indicates that the dollar is still the currency that most people want. It is certainly the currency that most people want to see stay stable. Whether a slight rise in the price of gold would help is not clear. It may be that it will, and this will certainly help the Australian gold industry in the process. Perhaps we could make some slight marginal increase above $35 to, say, $35.50 or $36. I think that these matters are worthy of consideration. </para>
          <para>The Opposition has not attempted to make any capital out of the current circumstance because it is a critical circumstance. In the short term a country like Australia cannot do a great deal to influence the position. But I believe that, as in other fields, Australia could have used its position more than it has done. I hope that Australia will, in the future, raise its voice more than it has done. Australia should emphasise that what is at stake here is the stability of currencies and above all the exchange of trade between countries on terms that are reasonable and just to both sides. It seems to me to be wrong that the United States should insist that, in what is essentially a 2-way process - that is the relationship between one currency and another - it alone should be able to influence. I am afraid that it has the economic strength to be able to do that. But it is the preponderance of strength on the part of those who manipulate currency on the one hand and the unorganised nature of those who want to trade on the other hand that seems to me to be the fundamental problem. </para>
          <para>I hope that the Prime Minister will continue to keep us informed about this matter in the future. As he promised he has given us a statement. As he said, it is preliminary and really not much has happened in the last few days other than that, the situation has not accelerated further into a crisis. I hope that the position will be maintained. I also hope that Australia can have more influence on the situation in the future than perhaps it has had in the past. </para>

          <para>This Bill will give effect to the Government&#39;s decision announced by the Treasurer to continue payment of bounty on phosphate fertilizers until 31st December 1974. The Phosphate Fertilizers Bounty Act 1963-1969 is due to expire on 31st October 1971. It provides for payment of $12 per ton on standard superphosphate and $60 per ton of phosphorus pent oxide content of other superphosphates and ammonium phosphate produced and sold for use as fertilizer in Australia. The bounty has been the major factor in keeping selling prices of phosphate fertilizers stable since its introduction in 1963. Continuation of the bounty is considered essential to maintain this position in view of the cost situation and marketing difficulties facing primary producers. I commend the Bill to honourable members. </para>

          <para class="block">The increase in child endowment will cost about $26.5m per year, and will benefit about 1,020,000 children, comprised in about 610,000 families. The total annual cost of the benefits, that is, of pensions and child endowment, included in the present Bill is thus about $92m. </para>
          <para>The new benefits, of course, will only operate from the date of the passage of this Bill, so that the extra expenditure for 1971-72 will not reach the full annual figure. On the other hand, the present Budget will bear the full weight of last year&#39;s concessions, which similarly did not Operate for all of last year; and there has also been a growth in the number of recipients of social service benefits, as well as the extra age and invalid pension payday this year. In the upshot, our social services outlay, excluding administrative expenses and capital grants for aged persons homes, etc. will be $l,182m for 1971-72, as against $l,035m for 1970-71, an increase of $147m or 14i per cent. </para>

              <para>- Let me now deal with some of these matters in greater detail. Standard rate pensioners, whose means as assessed range up to $10 per week and who thus receive full pensions, will get the full increase of $1.25 per week, bringing their rate up to $17.25 per week, exclusive of any supplementary assistance for which they may be eligible. The full increase of $1.25 per week will also be payable to standard rate pensioners qualifying for part of the interim 50c increase given last April, that is, to those with means as assessed between $10 and $11 per week. Standard rate pensioners with means assessed between $11 and $13.50 per week will receive graduated increases calculated in such a way that the pension and means as assessed together will total $27.25 per week plus, of course, any extra allowances for dependent children. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Similary, married rate pensioners whose means as assessed range up to $8.50 per week, and who thus receive full pensions, will get the full increase of $1 per week, bringing their rate up to $15.25 per week each ($30.50 per week for a married pensioner couple). The full increase of $1 per week will also be payable to married rate pensioners qualifying for any part of the interim 50c increase given last April, that is, to those with means as assessed between $8.50 and $9.50 per week. Married rate pensioners with means as assessed between $9.50 and $11.50 per week will receive graduated increases calculated to ensure that the pension and means as assessed will total $23.75 per week ($47.50 per week for a married couple) plus, of course, any extra allowances for dependent children. </para>
          <para>A somewhat similar position will apply in the case of class B widows who also receive the married rate. Those with means as assessed ranging up to $10 per week or between $10 and $11 per week will receive an increase of $1 per week. Class B widows with means as assessed between $11 and $13 per week will receive graduated increases calculated in such a way that the pension and means as assessed will total $25.25 per week. In this year, when there is a real need to avoid any Budget policy which would add to the tendency of prices to rise, it has been thought desirable to direct the increased rate to those who are wholly or mainly dependent on their pension. </para>

              <para>- It is worth noting that the increases in the base rate are cumulative upon the interim 50c increase given last April. Measured from budget to budget the standard rate pension has been increased by $1.75 a week, and the married rate pension by $1.50 a week. This is by a considerable margin the greatest rise in a similar period in the whole history of Australian pensions. In terms of buying power, the basic pension is now considerably higher than it was at the time of the last Budget, and is in fact higher than it was ever been in the whole history of Australian pensions. With the concurrence of honourable members I incorporate in Hansard the following table which sets out the percentage increase between the 1970 Budget and the 1971 Budget. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para class="block">
            <graphic href="073131197108266_23_1.jpg" />
          </para>
          <para>It will be seen from that table that there has been a 5.4 per cent increase in the consumer price index; an 11.3 per cent increase in the standard pension rate and a 10.9 per cent increase in the married pension rate. Thus, between last Budget and this, pension rates have risen more than twice as fast as prices - that is to say that pensions as provided in this Budget will have an increased purchasing power. In fact, if in this Budget we had adjusted pensions strictly in accordance with prices, the standard rate pension would now be only $16.34 a week and the married rate pension $14.49 a week. </para>
          <para>Ever since 1949, when Labor lost office, the trend has been to increase pension rates faster than prices, so that the real value of the pension continues to rise. If the old Chifley pension had been adjusted strictly in accordance with prices, it would today be only $10.80 a week. The difference between that figure and the rates now proposed is one measure of the increase in the real value of the pension during this period. It does not, of course, measure the whole of the improvement, since in addition we have brought in supplementary assistance and extra allowances for children, besides introducing new fringe benefits whose average value is of the order of $5 a week. Another provision of the Bill is to increase the wife&#39;s allowance which is paid in certain cases to wives of age and invalid pensioners, who are themselves ineligible for the pension, from its present level of $7 a week to $8 a week. This increase will also apply in relation to recipients of unemployment and sickness benefits. </para>
          <para>I now come to the provisions of the Bill which are specifically oriented towards the family and the welfare of children. First let me deal with the child endowment provisions in this Bill. At present child endowment is payable at the rate of 50c a week for the first child under 16 years in a family, $1 a week for the second child, $1.50 for the third child, with cumulative increases of 25c a week for each subsequent child. Endowment in respect of children in institutions is paid at a flat rate of $1.50 a week. Child endowment is now an accepted feature of family income and for some time the Government has been concerned that the larger family has been more adversely affected by wage and price increases than the smaller family with, say, one or two children. Wage increases which have to be spread over a greater number of dependants reduce the relative improvement in the position of the whole family. </para>
          <para>This Government believes that at the present time an effective way of providing real benefits to the larger family is by way of increased child endowment payments. Accordingly, the proposal in the Bill before the House is to increase endowment for the third and each subsequent child in a family by 50c a week. This will mean that the rate of endowment in respect of the third child in a family will become  $2  a week, in respect of the fourth child $2.25 a week and so on, increasing by  25c  for each additional child. With the concurrence of honourable members I incorporate in Hansard the following table which sets out the weekly rates that will be payable for families of different sizes: </para>
          <quote>
            <para class="block">The rate of endowment payable in respect of the 20,000 children under 16 years of age in approved institutions will be increased by 50c to $2 a week. </para>
            <para>
              <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline>the child endowment increases in the Bill will, as I have said, benefit more than one million children, spread in more than 600,000 families. The increases I have just outlined will help ease the financial stress facing many families. It must be remembered also that there are many other benefits and concessions provided by the Commonwealth that tend to offset the cost to parents of maintaining children. The cost to revenue of providing Income tax concessional deductions for children, including deductions in respect of education, exceeds some $250m a year. Through its various scholarship schemes the Commonwealth expends <inline font-style="italic">some</inline> $4Om a year. Assistance is given to families via the National Health Act where the family insurance rates for a family with children - however many children - are pegged at the rate applicable to a married couple without children; special assistance is also provided for handicapped children and children of pensioners, the last a matter which I shall deal with more fully in a moment. All these exemplify the attitude of a responsible government, which is to provide benefits in respect of children in a way which will assist in making them better citizens of tomorrow. </para>
            <para>Now let me come to a most significant part of the Bill - a massive increase in the child&#39;s allowance payable to all pensioners - age, invalid and widows, as well as to the recipients of unemployment and sickness benefits. Many social workers have drawn attention to the special hardship suffered by what are called one parent families and by families where the breadwinner is incapacitated. The Government has examined their representations very carefully, and now proposes to increase the payment for the first child, which at present is $2.50 a week, by $2 a week, making it $4.50 a week. The payment for children other than the first, which is at present $3.50 a week, will be increased to the same uniform level of $4.50 a week. </para>
            <para>Since this is a key feature of our social services structure, perhaps the House will allow me to say something of the history of these allowances. The child&#39;s allowance was introduced in 1943, and when the Chifley Government went out of office in 1949 it was paid only in respect of the first child of invalid pensioners and age pensioners who were invalids, and only at the rate of 90c a week - equal to about $2.25 a week at today&#39;s prices. . Widows under the Chifley Government received no child&#39;s allowance at all, except for the 50c a week difference between the class A widow&#39;s pension and age and invalid pension rates then current. &#91;Quorum formed.&#93; </para>
            <para>The Chifley 90c, which was payable only to certain invalid pensioners, was increased to $1.15 in 1951, and in 1956 second and subsequent children became eligible for an allowance of $1 a week. This allowance was then extended to the second and subsequent children of widows. </para>
            <para>In 1961 the allowance payable for the first child of invalid pensioners and age pensioners who were invalids was increased to $1.50 a week, as also was the allowance for the second and subsequent children of widows. In 1963 payments for the second and subsequent children of invalid pensioners and age pensioners who were invalids, were increased to $1.50 a week and a payment of $1.50 a week was introduced for the first child of widows. For the first time widows with dependent children received a mother&#39;s allowance of $4 a week. Tn 1965 the children of all age pensioners were included, and a &#39;guardian&#39;s allowance&#39; of $4 a week was introduced for single pensioners who had the custody of a child. </para>
            <para>In 1968 the rate for all children was increased to $2.50 a week. In 1969 the rate for the second and subsequent chi. die was increased to $3.50 a week, and mothers&#39; and guardians&#39; allowances were increased to $6 a week where there was a child under 6 or an invalid child. Now, in this present Budget, it is proposed to increase the rate for the first child from $2.50 a week to $4.50 a week, and the rate for the second and subsequent children from $3.50 a week to the same level of $4.50 a week. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>I have set out this history in some detail, because it shows the development of a plan to provide an entirely new treatment of children in bereaved or deprived circumstances. From the position under the Chifley Government, where a widow received nothing extra for her children beyond her 50c a week, and invalid pensioners got only 90c a week allowance altogether, however many children they had, we have now progressed to the point where all children of pensioners- - age, invalid and widow - are to receive $4.50 a week each; where all widows with dependent children are entitled to a mother&#39;s allowance of $4 a week; where some widows are also entitled to an extra mother&#39;s allowance of S2 a week; and where some invalid and age pensioners are also entitled to a guardian&#39;s allowance of $4 a week or $6 a week. All these child oriented allowances are, of course, additional to the very substantial increases in the real value of the base pensions which have been made since the time of the Chifley regime, and they are additional to the fringe benefits which have been introduced since that time. </para>
          <para>With the concurrence of honourable members I incorporate in Hansard the following table showing the position of a widow with dependent children. </para>
          <para class="block">

          </para>
          <para class="block">Each budget brought in by our LiberalCountry Party Government has brought some real improvement in social services. It is right and proper that this should be so. The standard of the Australian community has risen, and pension recipients should share in that rise. In recent years, each budget has laid special emphasis upon one aspect, in accordance with an overall plan. This Budget, as I have said, is especially oriented towards the needs of dependent children, particularly towards the needs of children in deprived families, where bereavement or invalidity has struck. I do not think that the House or the country will disapprove of this orientation. </para>
          <para>In accordance with established practice, it is proposed that the pension increases provided under the Bill will operate from and including the paydays following Royal Assent. The increase in endowment will operate in respect of the endowment period commencing immediately after Royal Assent and the increases in unemployment and sickness benefit rates will become payable from the first weekly payment falling due following Royal Assent. The Bill before the House is another practical demonstration of the Government&#39;s policy of assisting first those in the greatest need - that is, pensioners with little or no other financial means. In addition, as I have said, our social services programme for this year is child-oriented. </para>
          <para>Recent Liberal-Country Party governments have pioneered several new fields such as aid to handicapped children, subsidies to Meals on Wheels and voluntary bodies; a greater programme of decentralisation of operations; a new approach to rehabilitation services; an expanded programme of aged persons&#39; housing; and  a  complete overhaul of the scheme of Com.mouwealth Employees&#39; Compensation. While we now see all social service payments at a record level, we still have a long way to go. No worthwhile government will ever feel that it has solved all the social welfare problems which confront it, but it will always seek to deal with them as best as it can within available resources. This Government places its greatest emphasis upon improvements in social welfare. Under previous Liberal-Country Party Governments we have made great strides and under future Liberal-Country Party Governments will make even greater advances. I commend the Bill to the House. </para>

          </motion>
          <para class="block">The purpose of the Bill is to give effect to the Government&#39;s proposals in the repatriation war compensation field. The various improvements to existing pensions and allowances which were foreshadowed in the Budget Speech of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Snedden)</inline> are incorporated in the Bill now before the House. These will benefit the more seriously disabled ex-servicemen and the widows and children of deceased ex-servicemen whose death was related to war service. Specifically the Bill provides for increased payments to ex-servicemen who are totally incapacitated from war related disabilities or tuberculosis; to those whose incapacity allows them to work only part time or intermittently; to those who need the assistance of an attendant; to those who have lost one or more limbs or an eye; and to war widows and the children of ex-servicemen whose death was related to war service. The Schedules to the Repatriation Act express pension rates in fortnightly amounts, but it has long been the practice for honourable members to refer to weekly amounts. I shall continue that practice in explaining benefit changes. </para>
          <para>I shall now proceed to explain the proposed changes in more detail. The special (TPI) rate, which is payable not only to the totally and permanently disabled, but also to the war blinded and the temporarily totally incapacitated, will be increased by $3.50 to $42.50 a week. The intermediate rate of pension, which is payable to those whose incapacity from war related disabilities or tuberculosis enables them to work only part time or intermittently, and who are consequently unable to earn a living wage, will be increased by $1.75 to $30.25 a week. Attendants allowances payable in addition to war pension to the most severely disabled ex-servicemen are to be increased. The higher rate of $14, payable to the war blinded who are also afflicted with total loss of speech or total deafness, and to those who have had both arms amputated, is to be increased by $2 to $16 a week. The lower rate of $8.50, which is payable to those who are blind, paralysed or have suffered severe amputations, is to be increased by $1 to $9.50 a week. </para>
          <para>In keeping with the tenor of the foregoing proposals, which provide improved benefits for the more seriously incapacitated, increased payments are also proposed for all those who have lost one or more limbs or an eye. Those amputees who have always been paid the equivalent of the special (TPI) rate will receive an increase of $3.50 a week. Amounts which are, in addition to pension, payable in respect of other amputations or the loss of an eye will be increased by various amounts according to the degree of incapacity suffered. The new amounts payable, will range from $1.70 to $11.20 a week. I should add that the $11.20 a week has been raised by $4.10 in this Bill. Increases, are also proposed in rates payable to war widows, to their children, and to those children who have lost both parents. For war widows themselves, the Bill provides an increase of $1.25 raising the basic rate to $17.25 a week. For the first child of an ex-serviceman whose death was related to war service, an increase of $1 a week will be payable, while the rate payable in respect of second and subsequent children will be increased by $2 a week. The new rates for all these children will be $7 a week. For a child who has lost both parents, the increase will be $2 and the new rate will be $14 a week. </para>
          <para>As in the past, service pensioners are to receive the benefit of increases in age and invalid pension rates. This Bill contains a minor amendment necessary this year to incorporate into repatriation legislation those increases which do not apply automatically. Honourable members will no doubt appreciate that, although all the war compensation increases proposed in this Bill will be paid in full, the consequent increase in income may affect those also in receipt of means test pensions. For those whose means test pensions are reduced because of their war pension increases, the reduction will vary between 10c and $1, giving an overall result of an increase. For example, a single TPI pensioner in receipt of a service pension will receive an aggregate increase of between $2.50 and $3.40 a week in his total payment, that is, with his TPI payment and the service pension. On the other hand, a TPI pensioner with a wife and 2 children, who also receives a service pension, but with no other means, will receive a total family increase of $5.12 a week. This is because of various liberalisations introduced into the means test pension provisions by this Government in recent years which allow some means test pensioners to receive increases in those pensions as well as the full amount of their war pension increases. </para>
          <para>The Bill also appropriates the Consolidated Revenue Fund to the extent necessary to provide during the current year the additional payment to which the Bill gives effect. The foregoing amendments will come into force on the date on which the amending Act receives royal assent and the pension increases will be paid on and from the first pension payday thereafter. A table which sets out the repatriation Budget details in respect of war pensions and allowances has been prepared and, for the convenience of honourable members, is being circulated with copies of this speech. The measures I have outlined, together with increases granted last April, represent further significant advances in repatriation measures this year. I commend the Bill to the House. </para>

          <para class="block">It is the usual practice of the Government to keep the rates of pensions and allowances payable to seaman war pensioners under the Seamen&#39;s War Pensions and Allowances Act in line with the rates of pensions and allowances payable to other war pensioners under the Repatriation Act. The purpose of the Bill before the House is to raise, in relation to seamen, various rates of pensions and allowances in line with the increases of corresponding rates being made in the Repatriation Bill just introduced. These increases are in accordance with the higher rates announced by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Snedden)</inline> in his Budget speech. Clause 3 of the Bill increases the intermediate rate of war pension by $1.75 per week to $30.25. The intermediate pension is paid to seriously disabled persons whose war caused in capacities render them incapable of working other than on a part time basis, or intermittently. Clause 3 also increases the pension rates in respect of the children of deceased seamen coming under the Act. The weekly rate for the first child rises by $1 &#171;o $7, and the rate for each other child rises by $2 to $7, thus bringing the weekly rate of pension for each child of a deceased seaman to a uniform amount. Where the mother is dead also, the rate rises by $2 to $14 per week for each child. </para>
          <para>Clause 4 substitutes a new First Schedule to the Act to provide for an increase of $1.25 in the weekly rate of pension payable to widows of Australian mariners. The Second Schedule to the Act prescribes allowances for attendants for specially handicapped seaman pensioners. The weekly rate of S8.50 is increased to $9.50 and the $14 rate, payable where both arms have been lost, is increased to SI 6. The Bill does not have to provide for the increase of .$3.50 to S42.50 per week in the rate of TPI pension or for various increases in the weekly amounts payable in respect of the disabilities described in the Fifth Schedule to the Repatriation Act, as the increased rates under that Act will apply automatically to seaman pensioners by virtue of section 22a of the Seamen&#39;s War Pensions and Allowances Act. As usual, the increases in pensions and allowances will be payable on the first pension pay day after the date on which the Bill receives the royal assent. 1 commend the Bill to the House. </para>

          <para class="block">This Bill seeks the approval of the Parliament to amend the Railway Agreement (Western Australia) Act No. 67 of 1961 by removing from that Act the time limitation on Commonwealth contributions towards expenditure by the Western Australian Government on the railway standardisation works in that State. Members will recall that the 1961 Act provided for both standardisation of the main line from Kalgoorlie to Perth and Fremantle and certain works of a developmental nature. These were to facilitate the development of an integrated iron and steel complex at Kwinana based on the iron ore deposits at </para>
          <para class="block">Koolyanobbing. The Act also provided for a larger number of new standard gauge locomotives and rolling stock. The Act also provided that the Commonwealth would accept, as a charge against the rail standardisation project, expenditure incurred by Western Australia up to 12 months after the completion date and actually made within 24 months of that date. The completion date was 14th June 1969. That is the date when regular services commenced. This meant that expenditure had to be incurred bv 14th June 1970 and made by 14th June 1971. </para>
          <para>Although regular freight and passenger services are now operating on the line, the project is not yet complete. The main reason for this has been the necessity to re-design and expand the marshalling yards and freight terminals brought about by a more rapid increase in traffic than originally expected. Recognising the difficulties encountered by the State the Commonwealth agreed that it would bc reasonable to delete the time limitation and substitute an overall limitation on the cost of the project. Under the 1961 Act the Commonwealth undertook to provide 85 per cent of the total expenditure subject to the time limitation to which I have already referred. The current estimated cost of completing the project is S125m. Accordingly, under the new arrangements, it has been agreed that the Commonwealth contribution will be limited to 85 per cent of this estimated cost, that is, $106,250,000. The Bill before the House amends the 1961 Railway Agreement Act as necessary and ratifies the new agreement which incorporates the above principles. I commend the Bill to the House. </para>

            <para>- Honourable members will recall that on Tuesday last when I was speaking on this matter I sought leave to continue my remarks at a later stage following a series of interjections and a good deal of talk in the chamber. Leave was granted and the sitting was suspended prior to the evening resumption. First of all I wish to explain certain things. It is necessary for me to do this to be able to put my case in the right  light as far as the amendment by the honourable member for Banks <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Martin)</inline> is concerned. The Standing Orders Committee has recommended in relation to the days and hours of sitting: </para>

          <para>To this, the honourable member for Banks has moved inter alia: </para>

          </quote>
          <para>After moving this amendment, the honourable member for Banks said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>This would enable honourable members who can go home on Thursday night to make their arrangements accordingly. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>This is the very thing to which I object: I oppose the amendment and I wish to give the reasons why I oppose it. It is recognised that, if it is known that the House proposed to rise at 6 p.m., honourable members will want to leave the House at 2 p.m.. 3 p.m. or at other times before 6 p.m. because they desire to get home. The honourable member for Banks has interjected that he stays here all the time. He may stay or he may not stay. I do not know. I am not making an attack on him personally. I am talking of what happens. No honourable member can deny - the Party Whips, of which I am one will know this - that many members who live in Sydney and Melbourne are asking for leave to get on an early plane home. The honourable member for Grayndler <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Daly)</inline> said some very nice words which I appreciated. He said he was very sympathetic with me in that I may have a job to keep Government members in the House all the time. If any honourable member should know about this, it should be the honourable member for Grayndler for the simple reason that be was Whip when the Labor Party was in government. We also sat on Fridays on different occasions when the Labor Party was in government. What happened? On a number of occasions as early as 3 o&#39;clock the Labor government, realising that there was not a quorum decided to lift the House. This is a well-known fact and honourable members can look in Hansard to prove it. Therefore, I believe that the House should sit right through until 10.30 p.m. or 11 p.m., or whatever time is set on a Thursday night. Speaking personally, if the House rose at 6 p.m. I would certainly stay here until that time - 1 have never left before then - and if <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> could get to Melbourne, perhaps I could stay there and continue home the 165 miles by car the next day. I believe that this amendment is really only encouraging honourable members to ask for leave to get away earlier than the time the House will rise. Can the honourable member for Banks say that because he stays until the House rises he is confident that other honourable members will do this? I am not, and I have proof of what has happened in the past. Even during the last few weeks and during the debate on the Supply Bill, I have proof that honourable members just will not stay here. They want to get away. I am very happy that we are returning to the old system of sitting on 3 days for 3 weeks and then having a week off. I say this for the simple reason that when the House met, under the present system, on the Tuesday of the first week I had to leave home on the Sunday. I would be here on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, </para>
          <para class="block">Thursday and Friday and then return up country again only to leave home again on the Sunday because the House would be meeting on the Monday. Therefore I was travelling on 12 days out of the 14. Honourable members have a much better chance of conducting their business in their electorates and also in this House under the old method. When (he Standing Orders Committee was discussing this matter 1 said that if it wanted my opinion on the different proposals it should look at Hansard to see how I voted when the matter was before the House. Honourable members were saying that they would have a great opportunity to stay in Canberra over the weekend, to attend committee meetings and to carry out work they could not do at other times. But how many honourable members stayed over the week end? Some honourable members told the House at that time that they would not stay here. Only one or two stayed and the whole thing was just a farce. I appreciate very much that this motion will be carried and that we will return to the cycle of 3- weeks sitting and 1-week up. I believe it is in the best interests of all honourable members. Of course, the system under which the Parliament is operating now suits those honourable members who represent city electorates in Melbourne, Sydney and some in Brisbane but it does not suit honourable members who should receive consideration, those who have to come from the far flung places of this Commonwealth to this House. It does not suit them, and it is not in the best interests of sane government in Australia. Therefore, I support the motion that standing order 40 be carried and hope that the amendment will be defeated. I do not think it is in the best interests of the country. I have some admiration, shall 1 say, for the honourable member for Banks for bringing forward an amendment which he thinks is a good one but I do not think it is good and naturally I will vote against it. </para>

            <para>- I basically support the recommendation brought down by the Standing Orders Committee. &#93; seconded the amendment moved by the honourable member for Banks <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Martin)</inline> because I think it has some merit. I think it is fair to say that the new system we adopted - the 4-day system meeting in 2 consecutive weeks - has proven to be ineffectual inasmuch as honourable members do not stay in Canberra over the Saturday and Sunday. In fact, it makes it much more difficult to get back to your home over the weekend. Coupled with this is the situation that arises whereby it is impossible for members to return to their electoral offices to deal with electoral work for a period of 12 days. Coming to Canberra on the Tuesday returning home on the Friday, leaving again first thing on the Monday morning of the next week and staying in Canberra until leaving on Thursday evening or Friday morning means that honourable members are away from their electoral offices for 12 days. Therefore, I prefer to return to the old system. In the first place I voted to retain the old system. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The proposal advanced by the honourable member for Banks is basically this: Most honourable members are in Canberra on the Tuesday morning some time after &#176;a.m. It would not be too difficult for honourable members from the closer capital cities - Melbourne, Sydney and Adelaide - to be here by 10.30 a.m. Most honourable members from the far flung areas are here in Canberra the night before, anyway. Therefore, it would be possible for the House to meet at 10.30 a.m. on the Tuesday, in which case the House would have <inline font-style="italic">2i</inline> hours of business, before the luncheon adjournment at 1 p.m. That 24 hours could be well compensated for by the House rising at 6 p.m. on the Thursday allowing honourable members who live in the closer capital cities to return to their homes on the Thursday evening and for those honourable members who come from Perth, parts of north Queensland and other outlying areas who normally stay overnight anyway, to return home at the normal time. This system does have the advantage of 2} hours compensation either way- If the House meets on Thursday evening the dinner adjournment is from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m., and the House rarely sits beyond 10.30 p.m. which means that effectively there is only <inline font-style="italic">2i</inline> hours debating time after the dinner recess on Thursday. I think it would be beneficial for many honourable members to be back in their homes on Thursday evenings. This would bring about a situation where they were away from their families on only Tuesday evening and Wednesday evening and would be back in their offices first thing Friday morning. I think every honourable member is aware of the fact that having to pack one&#39;s bag, checking out of hotels, getting on planes and getting back to one&#39;s electoral office at midday Friday leaves most honourable members reasonably tired. Therefore, it is difficult for them to give their time for the rest of Friday afternoon to constituents. But if they were in their homes on Thursday evening in most cases they would be able to have a night&#39;s sleep, even if they arrived home late Thursday evening, and be fresh on the Friday to see their constituents. Such an arrangement would allow for honourable members to be in their electorate offices on Mondays and Fridays. I think this is important. I do not mind coming to Canberra for an extra week or for any extra weeks, but 1 think this system of being locked up in this political incubator for 5 days in 2 consecutive weeks is too much for most honourable members to stand. I think everyone has expressed the opinion that wandering around the corridors and being in the House for debates for so many hours in one week is too much. It leaves most people fairly dull by the end of the week. The other system which is now proposed with the amendment moved by the honourable member for Banks, which 1 hope will be carried, would allow for as much discussion and for the House to debate as many issues as it does under this system and allow honourable members to remain home for an extra night during the week. </para>

            <para>- I shall vote against this amendment for the reasons put forward by the honourable member for Mallee <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Turnbull)</inline> which I felt were sound reasons. I regret to some extent the terms of the motion, although I feel certain that the House will carry it. A good deal of mis-information has been given in this debate. I remind honourable members of the facts. It has been said during the course of this debate that the system of 2 weeks on, 1 week off, was given a trial and it did not work. Many honourable members have said this, including the honourable member for Blaxland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Keating).</inline> He said that everybody was going away over the short week end, that they were not staying in Canberra, that it was a farce and things of this character. The truth of the matter is this: Owing to the rather extraordinary events of the last session the system was put into operation for only 1 weekend. It was never tried. I do not suppose this kind of disturbance is likely to occur again in the history of this House. It has occurred only once. But because of this disturbance the system was never tried. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>We have heard much imaginary nonsense from some honourable members. The honourable member for La Trobe <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Jess)</inline> spoke about members being killed in the rush. There have been other statements. This was all imagination, because the system was tried on only 1 weekend during the whole of the session so, in point of fact, it has not been tried properly. Honourable members may feel that they do not want it. They are perfectly entitled to do so. The wishes of honourable members should be respected in this regard. Their wishes will be enforced, because honourable members will vote and naturally the majority vote will carry the day. However they vote will determine the question. But I think we should put the facts straight and forget the kind of fantasy that has been emerging from the lips of  speaker  after  speaker.  They have said that we have tried the system and it has not worked. The facts are, if we look at the record, that it was tried for only 1 weekend. </para>
          <para>To some extent I also regret the proposed change because I believe it will leave less time for the business of the House and of the Senate. Two things which have happened should be brought to the notice of honourable members. The first, which I for one think is good, is that the Senate has established a series of committees. This House is going in for more committee work too. I believe that the time required for the business of the House and committees will tend to increase. Therefore, the step now proposed is a retrograde step because it will cut into the ability of members to carry out properly their real job. I regret the downgrading of the work of this House which has appeared in this debate. I know that honourable members have duties outside this House. They have duties to their constituents and in their constituencies, but the proper and most important work of members is in this House, in the committees and in the party meetings which are ancillary to the work of this House. This is what members are really here for, although I would be the first to agree that there is real work to be done in the constituencies also. </para>
          <para>This House will be less effective if all of us think only of what we are to do in our constituencies, in the Liberal Patty, in the Labor League or whatever it may be. I know that a good member will keep in touch with his constituency. He is here to represent his constituency so he needs to meet his constituents to find out their views. He wants to get from them the feeling which will help him in his vote and his conduct in the House. But let us remember that this is a means to an end. The real business of all honourable members is here in the House, in the committees and in the party meetings which go along with being a parliamentarian. Honourable members perhaps will find that the shortage of time will be worse than they think, because not only is the weight of committee work very properly being increased but also, as honourable members will know and as those on the other side of the House would be the first to admit, because it is the business of the Opposition perhaps to oppose, in the last session and, indeed, in this session, we have had the use of procedural devices to interrupt and obstruct the business of the House in a way that it has never been done before, certainly not in the 20-odd years that I have been a member. In the last 2 or 3 weeks of the last session, which was a crowded session at the end, a great proportion - perhaps 30 per cent or 40 per cent - of the time of the House was taken up by procedural motions, idiotic points of order and things of that character. I note that this kind of practice is appearing again in the ranks of the Opposition. </para>

The question before the House is whether it shall accept the recommendations of the Standing Orders Committee or an amendment which proposes to change the sitting hours to include 10.30 as the time of meeting on a Tuesday morning and- 6 p.m. as the time to adjourn on a Thursday. What has the matter of procedures and obstructions in the House to do with the question we are considering? </para>

I agree entirely with the first part of the speech of the Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wentworth),</inline> but after 16 years in this House I should not like the news to leak into my electorate that I did agree with him - for the first time. However, his final remarks did not, in my opinion, touch on either the motion or the amendment. I am not reflecting on your opinion, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> because there may have been some relevance in those remarks. The Minister claimed that the Opposition was being obstructive. Most of the obstruction was retaliation. Honourable members will recall that in the last week of the last period 19 bills were foisted onto the House which was allowed only 21 hours of debating time. The gag was applied to important measures. Yet apparently the Opposition is supposed to sit here day after day and have its nose rubbed in the dirt without taking remedial measures. T do not think we would be worthy of an Opposition if we did not take measures. </para>

One such committee is the Public Accounts Committee. Other committees include the Foreign Affairs Committee. </para>

              <para>- The honourable member said that members can be here at 10.30 a.m. on Tuesdays. This is not so of all members. Some members also would have a dickens of a job getting home on Thursdays. There can be transport difficulties particularly with aircraft. They would find it difficult to be here by 10.30 of a Tuesday morning. It has been said that most members from remote electorates come here of a Monday night. That may be so in some cases, but not in every case. I know that a lot of Queensland members come to Canberra on Tuesday mornings. They would lose the Monday nights in their homes or their electorates. </para>

However, I am afraid I cannot agree with it because I do not think he has taken into consideration the difficulties of members who travel much further than between Canberra and Sydney or Canberra and Melbourne. I agree with what the honourable member for Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Cope)</inline> said about committee work on Tuesday mornings. Also we need to acknowledge that Cabinet works on a Tuesday morning. This is the regular meeting time for Cabinet and it is necessary, whatever government is in power, for Cabinet to meet and carry on its business. </para>

              <para>- If we have sittings of 3 days a week it would not apply. If we adopted the amendment moved by the honourable member for Banks I would have to travel to Canberra on Monday. The honourable member&#39;s amendment provides that business would stop at 6 o&#39;clock on a Thursday night. If my memory is correct, I think the air services could not get me even to Brisbane on a Thursday night. Apparently my Queensland colleagues and I would be expected to sit around and twiddle our thumbs while members who come from Sydney went home. Why can we not sit for 3 hours on a Thursday night? Why should we throw that time away? In other words, the honourable member for Banks is saying: &#39;Do away with the time that is now given for committee work, do away with the time allotted for Cabinet discussions that are so necessary in the scheme of things and let the Sydney and Melbourne folk go home on Thursday nights&#39;. Honourable members who do not live in Sydney or. Melbourne would still have to wait interstate to catch their planes on Friday morning. Therefore, I believe the honourable member&#39;s amendment does not help at all. If we accept the amendment moved we may as well stick to the present system of sitting 4 days a week. T think that is all that needs to be said. </para>

            <para>- As a member of the Standing Orders Committee I will support the proposal to revert to the former pattern of sitting days. I also advocate a change back to the old sitting times, although they are actually not under discussion at the moment. We have tried the system in which the House sits 4 days a week for 2 weeks and is in recess for the third. This system came into operation on 13 th October 1970. I agree with those members who say that this arrangement has not been truly tried. I believe that the Tuesday morning of the second week, when we met on a Monday, should have been used for the purposes of Parliament. Committees could have been held at some other time or even could have sat when the House was in session. Many of our parliamentary duties are carried out while the House is sitting. I attended a two hour long committee meeting yesterday which were held by members from this side of the House. Committees could sit while the House was sitting if there was a proper arrangement by the Whips to pair members attending meetings on joint committees. So I feel that the system of 4-day a week sittings possibly did not get a fair trial. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The 4-day a week sitting arrangement would be much more advantageous for members from distant places, especially those from Western Australia, because they could stay in Canberra over the weekend between the Friday sitting day and the Monday sitting day. However, folk who come from Sydney and Melbourne can be home in three-quarters of an hour or one hour. Of course, they go home every weekend except when they have had to attend to committee work here. </para>
          <para>I would like to stress one thing about this Parliament. No parliament in the world has members who travel so much or so far to their parliamentary duties as do members of this Parliament. A Western Australian member who flies from Perth to Canberra at the beginning of a week travels almost the distance from London to Moscow. They fly the same distance back to Perth at the end of the week. That example illustrates the distances that members travel in Australia. So the Standing Orders Committee and the House have to work out a fair balance as between the time members of Parliament spend at home and the time they have to spend here. </para>
          <para>The Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wentworth)</inline> said that our proper function is to be in this Parliament. 1 agree. But anyone who neglects his electorate will not be re-elected to this place. There we have it in a nutshell. No-one can neglect his electorate and survive in this Parliament. So what is the use of talking a lot of rot about what one can do in the national Parliament if one neglects one&#39;s home base. No army will attack a new area without consolidating its home base. No member of Parliament can survive in this place unless he does his duty as well as he can in his electorate. It is plain nonsense to say that this place is not important. None of us in this place would say that. This is the most important legislature in Australia, bar none. We will not underrate the work done here. </para>
          <para>The time spent by members in Parliament is time given to the nation&#39;s legislation which affects every man woman and child from Cape York to Hobart, from Sydney to Perth and from Brisbane to Geraldton. This place is vital in the parliamentary system of Australia. We all appreciate that all members in this Parliament are sincere and hard working, more so than we ever had in years gone by. Next month I will have been in this place for 25 years and I can look back over many Prime Ministers and even to the time when the Chifley Labor Government was in office. </para>

              <para>- I hope so. I remember that 25 years ago Tasmanian members had to travel to Canberra by boat and train and they stayed the whole session here. Members now travel by plane and we can get home to our electorates each weekend not only for family reasons - and they are very important reasons - but in order to look after other matters. The people of Australia now demand that then member be available in the same way as they demand that their doctor be available to them. As a matter of fact, I think we are far more available than doctors. Indeed, some doctors will not come to patients any more; patients have to go to the doctors. </para>

          <para>The problems of the country have multiplied with the type of life we are living today. Life today has many more pressures and the problems have multiplied. The work of a member at home is a vital adjunct to his work in Parliament. We spend about 75 hours a week at our work. Not many of us in this Parliament would spend less. That total includes, of course, work done here in Canberra. Some 32 years after the 1939 Budget, which amounted to $200m, this Commonwealth has a Budget of over $8,900m. The intensity, extent and quantity pf the work here have trebled in the interval. Our work in our electorates also has trebled. Unfortunately we still have the same number of staff to help us handle this work - only 1 secretary. Members of the Opposition front bench have not been given any additional assistance. </para>
          <para>Just in passing, I believe that the Government should give consideration to creating a pool of 6 typists for the use of members of our front bench who have to research for and prepare important speeches and keep up to date with the Government on every issue with their field. But though the work has trebled our facilities have remained the same. Air transport brings us to Canberra quickly and takes us home quickly and I feel that because of the volume of work at home we must continue to have enough time to attend to our electorates. There is no doubt the 3-week cycle did crowd in on this. We could not spend every Monday and every Friday afternoon with our constituents and with a fortnight away things do mount up. This applies in electorates in which people have problems. Not every electorate perhaps has the same number of problems but we have to try and get a balance between the time we spend at home and the time we spend in Canberra. The 3-day week is all right on the condition that we spend more weeks in Canberra. This is the secret. </para>
          <para>The old system involved 3 days in Canberra. We came up and started on Tuesday afternoon at 2.30 and finished at midnight on Thursday. This is what we are going back to. We sit on Tuesday afternoon and night, Wednesday afternoon and night and Thursday morning, afternoon and night. That is not sufficient time to handle all the legislation, as we found at the end of the last sessional period. The honourable member for Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Cope)</inline> mentioned a moment ago that we discussed 19 Bills in 22 hours. </para>

              <para>- That is how discourteous you were to me. I do not appreciate it very much. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline> I was speaking about what you said regarding the concertinaing of legislation at the end of the autumn sessional period. If we could spend more weeks in Canberra on the 3-day week basis we could get through the legislation in an even, orderly fashion. None of us would mind spending an additional 3 or 4 weeks here if we did not have to sit past midnight on any night and if the Government spread the debate of leg is lat on much more evenly as was promised by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McMahon)</inline> after the fiasco at the end of the autumn sessional period. This is important and I would not vote for the 3-day week if we were not assured of spending more time here to deal with the legislation which, as I have said, has trebled in quantity in the last 20-odd years and in many respects is more important, too. The 3- week cycle did break down because so many honourable members had to go home on Friday afternoon. Some were unfairly criticised for doing this. As the Opposition Whip let me say that the Government Whip and I had to deal with all the pairs that this necessitated. We have to do this every day in fact, but Fridays were a nightmare. I am glad to be getting away from it because we used to have 13 or 14 honourable members on each side who needed to be paired. We had to (et most of those people go home at that time or they would not have arrived home on Friday night. For instance, if we did not let the Western Australians and the north Queenslanders go at 2 o&#39;clock on Friday afternoon they would have had to stay the night and go home the next day and that is not fair. </para>

              <para>- No, they would not. All the honourable members we had to pair on Friday afternoons had to travel long distances and we were doing it for sheer humanitarian reasons. On the matter of work I just want to make the point that we as members of Parliament are understaffed. When I was in the United States last year I checked the staffing arrangements very carefully. Every Congressman in the United States has 8 on his staff and every senator. has 14. Yet the moment any salary rises for members of Parliament in Australia are mentioned or even dreamed about there are critical editorials in newspapers throughout the country. Every time we increase expenditure to try and make ourselves more effective as members of Parliament the Press immediately starts a campaign against us and it is completely outrageous and completely mindless and without any knowledge of what goes on in other countries. So I make the plea that the Government should have a look at the staffing position again, particularly for our front bench members. I assume that the new Assistant Ministers will get a secretary - I guess that is understandable - and I think that our men on the front bench deserve secretarial help with all the work they have to do. So I will vote for the 3- day week hoping, firstly, that there will be no sitting past midnight because if this happens we will cause trouble using the Standing Orders. I think it is outrageous and wrong to expect honourable members who spend 14 or 15 hours a day in this place to sit past midnight. Secondly, I hope that we are given more time to consider legislation. </para>

            <para>- The honourable member for Wilmot <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Duthie)</inline> has used his full entitlement of a quarter of an hour and taken up the time of the House when he knows that a lot of other honourable members want to speak. I would suggest that this matter is one on which many people are waffling and saying what they would do and what they would not do, trying to make good fellows of themselves by telling us how hard they work in their electorates. If they got up, spoke up and shut up we would not need to sit anywhere near as long as we do and we would not need to sit an extra day of the week. But this place being what it is we have to take people as they come. </para>

They are only new to the place so they do not really understand what is going on. They have not caught up yet and are not likely to do so for a long time. I am all in favour of sitting on the Tuesday morning. I think it is a complete waste of valuable time to shut this House on Tuesday morning. </para>

              <para>- 1 know that Cabinet Ministers say that they must have time to sit but they can sit during the rest of the week. They do now. The honourable members who sit on committees and are paid for doing so say that they must have the time to sit. They can sit on Mondays. It . is a paid job and they should be prepared to do it and not sit and take a sitting fee on the day that the House is sitting. I know I have done it myself for years but I am just stating the facts. So we should be sitting on Tuesday morning. We should be sitting full time 3 days a week at least. There is nowhere near enough time given to the consideration of Bills. It has been rightly said by many honourable members that the volume of business has become so large now that it is impossible for Bills to be given full consideration. There is no opportunity given for them to be considered at the Committee stage. They are put through before honourable members have had time to sit down&#39; and examine them. But for anyone to say that in exchange for Tuesday morning we should rise at 6 o&#39;clock on Thursday is completely ridiculous. Only a few people from Sydney could get home. Even honourable members travelling to Melbourne could not get home. The last aeroplane leaves at 5.45 p.m. and they would have to leave here at 5.15 p.m. So the same old story that we have now on Friday would be repeated. </para>

          <para>I just want to add one more thing and that is that the Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wentworth)</inline> said that the 4-day week had not been given a fair trial and this is quite right. We did make a change to the 4-day week at the suggestion of the Standing Orders Committee and now for some reason or other pressure has been put on and we have decided to go back to the old 3-day week. If it had been tried properly and we had had committees meeting on the Monday before the Tuesday sitting and on the Friday after the Monday to Thursday sitting of the second week we would have been able to do a lot more of the committee work that is sadly neglected in this place. The honourable member for Wilmot said that while the House was sitting yesterday he spent 2 hours attending 2 separate meetings. I know that this is done, but this is not the way in which the Parliament should be run. I make the plea that at some time or other honourable members should consider whether it would not be much better for them to return to their electorates every third week instead of every fourth week. I would prefer to keep in touch with the people in my electorate by being able to see them every third week instead of every fourth week as is proposed. Unfortunately, the amendment was not properly thought out. </para>

            <para>- 1 support the system of days of sitting under which we are working at the present time, that is, sitting for 2 weeks and having one week off. But I am a very sensitive and kind-hearted sort of a fellow. I feel very deeply for those members who come from Sydney and Melbourne. They must be suffering great inconvenience and experiencing great difficulties. When one looks at the situation one finds that they are very unfortunate if they are not back home an hour after the Parliament adjourns. This must be terrible. The mere fact that I leave Canberra tonight and cannot get home until tomorrow morning should not worry me when I see the inconvenience which is caused to these other members. We hear the plea from these members and we have to take notice of what they say. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Under the present system of sitting days, these members cannot spend all day Monday and all day Friday in their offices. This is terrible. Under the system which they want adopted I will not be able to spend a Friday or a Monday in my office for 3 weeks. But here again, I should not let this influence the way in which I will vote on this question. Also, I feel very sorry for those members who have huge electorates of approximately 4 or 5 square miles. I have to look at the inconvenience that this causes them. My electorate is only 900,000 square miles, which is nine-tenths of the total area of Western Australia. It is very easy for me to get from one point to another point 1,500 miles away. Why should I worry about that? Just because the present system suits me, 1 should not worry if it is changed. I am touched by the generosity and mateship which exists in this place in relation to the question of sitting days. </para>
          <para>Let us consider the report of the Standing Orders Committee. It says that experience has shown that the present sitting pattern does not provide as efficient or convenient an arrangement as was expected. Where was the experience gained? As the Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wentworth)</inline> said, the present proposal was tried for one weekend. Actually, I never experienced it at all because that weekend I was in New Zealand attending to parliamentary duties. So I certainly have not had any experience of what the Standing Orders Committee is talking about. What is meant by the present sitting pattern not proving to be efficient? How can anybody say whether or not it has proved to be efficient if it has not been tried? Surely that is something which must be considered. Then it is suggested that the proposed sitting arrangements will be more convenient - convenient to whom? Let us be told that. Then the Standing Orders Committee said that a majority of members favour a return to the previous pattern of sittings. The members of the Committee did not ask me for my opinion and I do not know whether they asked anybody else. This is the Committee&#39;s proposition. I say it is a lot of rubbish, and that it is only in this place that we will ascertain what the true feelings of members are. I do not intend to delay the House because, as I say, I feel terribly for these members. This is something that you cannot continue to talk about for long or you will break down. </para>
          <para>I want to say something about the amendment which, if carried, would make the position more convenient for the members from Melbourne and Sydney who are suffering so many hardships. It is proposed in the amendment that on each Thursday this House should sit from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. That is very good. It would allow those members from Melbourne and Sydney to get home on Thursday night. I would be lucky if I got home on Friday night, for the simple reason that if I left Canberra at 6 o&#39;clock on Thursday night when the House adjourned I would be able to get a plane to Melbourne, but I would not get any further. So I would have to stay in Melbourne. </para>

The proposed sitting pattern should be thrown out, and if honourable members are fair dinkum and have the courage of their convictions they will throw it out, and we will continue with the present arrangement for which they voted just a few months ago, because as yet it has never been tried. </para>

              <para>- Then I shall move to speak to the amendment. The honourable member for Wilmot <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Duthie)</inline> told us why he will not vote for the amendment, and I can see his view. He referred to the business before the House and how experience has shown that the former pattern of times and sittings of the Parliament was perhaps more productive than the present system. He also said that he will support the recommendation of the Standing Orders Committee if we sit for more weeks.  I  do not think that this question has been sufficiently emphasised by honourable members on both sides of the chamber. I will support the Committee&#39;s recommendation and vote against the amendment on the understanding that we will sit for more weeks. I think that this is the understanding of most members of the Parliament. </para>

          <para>I am not too sure how I will link what  I  am about to say to the amendment, but the honourable member for Wilmot said that this was the most important Parliament in the world and naturally that is the reason why we should consider amendments. He could have fooled me, and this is why I rose to speak. This is Australia&#39;s national Parliament. The honourable member referred to the great issues which we have to discuss and which perhaps we would be able to discuss more effectively or less effectively, according to which amendment was accepted. But at the same time, recently I noticed the salary that is paid to the Press Secretary to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McMahon)</inline> and compared it with the salary that is paid to members of this Parliament. As I say, the honourable member could have fooled me as to our importance. Having said that, I think we have heard sufficient. Therefore I move: </para>

            <para>- The discussion on the Budget each year is interesting. Much of a muchness arises from year to year. Generally, an amendment is moved by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam).</inline> On this occasion, there is really no substance in his amendment. At least, there is nothing to back up the accusations he makes in it. He said that we need a fundamental review of social services and methods of adjusting them. I think that since the present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McMahon)</inline> has been the Government Leader he has certainly shown goodwill towards meeting this fundamental necessity by providing 2 increases in the pension and by providing various other increases. The second reason of the Leader of the Opposition for his amendment is that the Budget contains no proposals to balance the finances and functions of the Commonwealth, the States and local government. That is exactly what the Government did at the last Premiers Conference. Everybody knows that local government is entirely a function of State government, and that any funds made available to the local authority must necessarily be made available through the State government. Thirdly, the Leader of the Opposition claims that the Budget produced no programmes for high national objectives of social welfare, economic strength and national security. It is the confidence that is maintained in business, in industrial matters, in foreign affairs and in many other spheres that shows that this Government has met these needs to the full. A lack of confidence would be evident were the Leader of the Opposition to become Prime Minister of this country. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Leader of the Opposition commenced his speech with an absurd statement. I just wondered, as I listened to him, how he could be so irresponsible and absurd. He brought criticism against the Government for not giving the lead on international currency matters. Surely ho knows that the Australian dollar is not a major currency unit, even if as a nation we regard it as very significant. For Australia to make a decision prematurely before there was any devaluation would be silly. That statement by the Leader of the Opposition shows his irresponsibility. We must necessarily wait to evaluate the position before we make any decisions on those vital matters. Does the Leader of the Opposition suggest that because some other nation whether it be Japan or Timbuktu might make a decision next week in relation to currency matters, this Government should have the prevision to declare what it will do? It shows how gullible the Leader of the Opposition is. </para>
          <para>Honourable members can understand his gullibility in going to China and accepting its policies so readily. He accepted the domination that comes from a one party government. I do not suppose that the Leader of the Opposition met a leader of the opposition in China. 1 wonder whether he found one there? He accepted the policy of domination of the Chinese Government. He accepted Communist policies of China rather than the policies of Taiwan. Communist China believes that the people of Taiwan should be suppressed and forced to accept Communist domination. They have been successful in avoiding the domination of that Government by setting up their own Government and proving their ability as a nation. Surely those people are entitled to be free. AH I can conclude is that the Leader of the Opposition is anti-freedom. He is against any freedom for the 14 million people of Taiwan. He is against Tibet. He obviously favours the domination policy of China in crushing Tibet. He is against small nations. Yet he is inconsistent, because he recently travelled to New Guinea and stirred up the rabble there saying that they should have self-government immediately, even before the people themselves wanted it. That shows his inconsistency. </para>
          <para>Budgets never meet all of our requirements. I do not suppose that this Budget has met all of my requirements. No budget can meet the multitudinous demands that people put on the Government of the day. The Government has the responsibility to analyse, to assess and to determine our economic programmes and development. We have had satisfactory progress in this country although certain factors have caused inflation. I have heard many reasons advanced in the Parliament for this inflation. I think one that contributed very much to inflation was the excess of demand which was created by too rapid progress in development. I think that the Government&#39;s Budget of 12 months ago was a contributing factor to that excess demand. Looking at the Prime Minister&#39;s programme for this year honourable members will see that the Government has pruned it heavily. Whilst there is an increase in expenditure, that has been caused in the main by the amount that is to be advanced to Qantas Airways Ltd for the purchase of its additional aircraft. However the amount to be advanced to Qantas exceeds the increase in that particular vote. I submit that more advance planning is needed. If the Government could plan 3 or 4 years ahead, when an excess of demand was created the 12 months programme envisaged in a Budget could be extended to, say, 14 months. This would ease the demand. The man who has to pay for the erection of a house finds that there is an excessive demand for building material, a shortage of labour in the industry and that he has to pay overtime rates to get sufficient men to construct his house. These are all added costs and are extremely inflationary. My suggestion could be applied to the Post Office programme. The expenditure on its construction programme is to be increased by several million dollars this year. If it is found that the rate of progress is inflationary would it hurt the nation very much if the expenditure were extended over IS months instead of 12 months? Employees would be retained to undertake the construction tasks and this would ease the pressure of demand. One of the reasons for inflation is the excessive demand created because our progress has been too rapid. </para>
          <para>A second reason for inflation I attribute&#39; to the policy and general approach of industrial leaders. I do not criticise the working population of Australia but I criticise and condemn the policy and general approach of industrial leaders who initiate and prolong industrial and political stoppages. This has been a big factor in Australia&#39;s troubles. I should like the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> or someone else to supply me with an analysis of the costs of industrial stoppages. It may be that the losses that result from stoppages sometimes enforced by industrial leaders represent more than the increased wages awarded by the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. This is where the public is suffering. The working classes agree with me. They have shown this in 2 recent by elections in Queensland. On the Wednesday prior to the by-election there was an enforced strike occasioned by the political intervention of the Queensland Trades and Labour Council Central Executive. Workers throughout Queensland were forced to go on strike. The reaction of the general public was shown by the electors in the Maryborough and Methyr by-elections. </para>
          <para>In the Maryborough electorate a government candidate previously has not got within 2,500 votes of the Labor candidate but on this occasion the Government candidate won by about 1,600. This was a clear indication of the voters&#39; reaction to the domination of the Brisbane Trades Hail. The situation was aggravated by the  President  of the Brisbane Trades Hall who publicly, in effect, said: &#39;If anybody does not obey our dictates his name will go in my little black book&#39;. Do we want Jack Egerton and his little black book dominating this country? The people gave the answer to that question in the 2 by elections and they will give the answer in the next State and Federal elections if labor leaders do not learn a lesson from what has occurred. I notice that the honourable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hansen)</inline> is in the chamber. He must have got a shock when he saw the Maryborough by-election figures; T got a pleasant surprise. </para>

              <para>- The honourable member already has told me what he thought was the background to the by-election. The fact that the Government candidate won by about 1,600 votes instead of losing by about 2,500 indicates the resistance to and the rejection of the domination by the Brisbane Trades Hall, lt seems as though the labour leaders have not learned a lesson because they are still on a witch hunt. When they saw the result of the by-elections the leaders tried to crawl out from under. They blamed the Labor politicians and put 2 right-wingers on the mat. If they keep up with this witch hunt and the division remains in the Labor Party that will suit us nicely for the next elections. </para>

          <para>The honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Enderby)</inline> was really interesting when he spoke to the Budget. He said he was biased. I wonder why he should be biased especially if one looks at the financial allocations to the Australian Capital Territory. No part of Australia has been as well treated. I instance Belconnen as an example. No suburb of that area is older than 4 years. I am told that its population is 25,000. Splendid residences have been built in Belconnen. I admit that there is much private enterprise in the area and that not only Government expenditure is involved. But associated with the residential construction are school buildings - high schools and primary schools - hospitals and everything else that caters for the needs of that population. So why would the honourable member be biased? He says that some of the immigrants in Canberra would prefer to go home to their own countries and not retire in Australia. I should imagine that they would return to their homelands for emotional reasons only, not because they would be better off there than in this great country. The honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory was not very critical and contented himself by saying that he was biased. He was so biased that he did not want to give credit where credit was due. </para>
          <para>In the vote for Canberra there is one deficiency. There is no reference to a much-needed new Parliament House. I do not know why we spend $lm or $2m every year on the present building. It is not adequate to accommodate the people who want to come to Parliament House, yet we spend $lm, $2m or $3m every year adding to it, like adding a shanty on to a farmhouse. We still have this building when we ought to be planning now for a new Parliament House. The building will take 10 years to complete. If we start to make financial provision for a new parliament house on an annual basis we will not need such a big outlay to complete it. </para>
          <para>How time flies. I suppose that the Opposition will give me an extension of time? </para>

          <para>The precise findings as stated in Volume 1  of  the consultants&#39; report Chapter 2 Section D2 under the heading <inline font-weight="bold">&#39;Major Findings&#39;,</inline> are: </para>
          <para>Para. 3 Control and regulation of international air services in the Territory by the Commonwealth Department of Civil Aviation has been responsible for the development of these services to their present high standard. However, this degree of control is inconsistent wilh other aspects of Commonwealth policy regarding the transfer  of  executive powers to the Administration. </para>
          <para>Para. 8 In view of the high cost of the air services in the Territory both to the Government and to private users, the theoretical economic benefit of competition inherent in the two-airline policy is of questionable validity in the circumstances of the Territory. For this reason there is a case for examining the benefits of a single airline, in which the Administration could have a controlling financial interest, taking over the main internal routes and giving more room for the development of local services by local operators. </para>
          <para>Regarding paragraph 3, there is in fact no inconsistency; Commonwealth policy is for the&#39; progressive transfer of powers in consultation with the wishes of the people of Papua New Guinea. The Civil Aviation power is one of a number of functions of Government that are exercised in the Territory by Commonwealth Departments and instrumentalities. As I announced on 3rd September 1970 the Government is reviewing the position of those Commonwealth Departments and instrumentalities that are performing functions of infernal self-government in Papua New Guinea outside the aegis of the Administration with a view to establishing a programme for the absorption of their Territory activities in appropriate cases into the Papua New Guinea Administration. </para>
          <para>Regarding paragraph 8, the November 1970 session of the House of Assembly decided to set up a Select Committee to consider and report on all aspects of the UNDP Transport Survey regarding modes of transport within the Territory and all aspects of transport, outside the Territory insofar as they affect transportation modes within the Territory. This Committee has not yet reported.&#39; </para>

          </list>
          <para>The nature of TAA&#39;s flying operations in Papua New Guinea and the standard of airman ship which these operations demand is such that a pilot must have basic qualifications and previous flying experience in order to assimilate the advanced training which is required prior to qualification as an airline pilot. </para>
          <para>Airline operations over a long period of time have shown the desirable minimum in this respect to be Commercial Pilot Licence standard and at least 500 hours of previous aeronautical experience before joining the Airline. </para>
          <para>The only exception to this rule of thumb for many years has been the 2 cadet pilot courses which TAA conducted during that time, but these are not regarded as being truly representative because the selection standards for the entrants was abnormally high and not suitable for application in Papua New Guinea. </para>
          <para>It should be noted also that a number of pilots acquire significant flying experience in the armed&#39; services, which provides them with an excellent background on which to build an airline career. </para>
          <para>Most pilots, however, acquire training to the level stipulated, through aero clubs, flying schools and general aviation, and TAA believes that such activity is essential to the growth and development of the general aviation sector of the industry. TAA is not equipped, either on the mainland or in Papua New Guinea, to provide elementary and intermediate flight training, because it considers that the development of pilots within general aviation is of mutual benefit to both branches of the aviation industry. </para>
          <para>This relationship already exists, in fact, in Papua New Guinea and the general aviation activities in the area do provide a suitable background for potential airline candidates. </para>
          <para>In respect, TAA has demonstrated a practical interest by training and employing indigenous flight traffic officers on Twin Otter operations. This position brings the individual into direct contract with the operational and flying environment </para>
          <para>As part of its developmental role in Papua New Guinea, TAA has a positive interest in promoting opportunities for young ind i genes who are motivated towards a career in aviation and looks forward to the employment in the early future of ind i gene pilots who have gained the experience and qualifications necessary to enter airline flying. </para>

          <para>If the 16 ILS at Sydney were modified now then it would be out of service for about 30 days, during which period it would be necessary to divert alt aircraft requiring this facility to the 07 ILS.

            <para>- The answer to the honourable member&#39;s question is as follows: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Formal representations seeking the removal of Japanese plant quarantine restrictions against the importation of Australian fruit were submitted to t he Japaneseauthorities in 1962, 1963, 1965 and 1967. In 1965, Japanese Plant Quarantine officials were brought to Australia to observe conditions at first hand, and in 1970 the Chief Fruit Officer of my Department visited Japan for discussions with Japanese officials on the subject. These endeavours have been supplemented by separate discussions in Tokyo and Canberra between Japanese and Australian officials. </para>
          <para>So far as citrus is concerned, the Japanese authorities continue to refuse to permit the entry of Australian fruit unless it has been subjected to a commodity treatment approved by them as being fully effective in controlling Australian strains of both Mediterranean and Queensland fruit fly. They have consistently rejected proposals that Japan accept Australian citrus originating in areas declared to be free from findings of any species of fruit fly, and have rejected alternative proposals for the acceptance of citrus from Eastern States which has been subject to a commodity treatment as fully effective in the control of Queensland fruit fly. </para>
          <para>Experimental data confirming the effectiveness of ethylene dibromide (EDB) fumigation in the control of Queensland fruit fly are available in Australia and parallel data are available from American sources confirming the effectiveness of EDB fumigation against Mediterranean fruit fly. The Japanese authorities have refused to accept this evidence and have insisted that trials be conducted in Australia using Australian strains of both flies to demonstrate the effectiveness of a common fumigation treatment under Australian conditions. </para>
          <para>The Fresh Fruit Dis infestation Committee, a group consisting of Commonwealth and State technical officers, has already arranged for trials to be undertaken and work will continue in Western Australia and New South Wales where particularly suitable facilities are available. It is expected that two years will be required for the completion of the work. </para>
          <para>An appreciation of what is involved in the trials may be gained from some aspects of the conditions set by the Japanese for the experimental work. It is required, for instance, that tests should demonstrate a 100 per cent kill  of  insects in 3 separate batches, each of not less than 10,00 insects. Any test that resulted in less than a 100 per cent kill would be unacceptable. The tests are to be carried out only on the most resistant stage of the life cycle of the insects. The physical task of breeding huge batches of test insects and implanting insect eggs in fruit is itself a substantial project. </para>
