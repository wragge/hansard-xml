          <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> I have to inform the House that a former Governor-General, Field-Marshal Viscount Slim. K.G.. G.C.B., G.C.M.G., G.C.V.O., G.B.E., D.S.O., M.C., died in London on 14th December. 1970 after a long illness. I am sure I do not need to remind honourable members that Lord Slim was a highly respected and popular Governor-General and a courageous professional soldier who had risen through the ranks. He had a particularly warm place in the hearts of Australians. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Lord Slim was born on 6th August 1891 and spent most of his youth in Birmingham where he began his working life as a junior clerk. Then he became a gang foreman and after that an elementary school teacher. At the outbreak of the First World War he joined the Royal Warwickshire Regiment and, after a short spell in the ranks, was given a commission. By August 1915 he had seen action at Gallipoli, - where he was wounded, France and Mesopotamia, where he was wounded again, and had been awarded the Military Cross. Although he was then discharged as permanently unfit, he rejoined the Army within a year and saw action in France and in Baghdad. After the war he went to India and spent the next 20 years in the Indian Army. </para>
        <para>When the Second World War broke out he was Brigade Commander of the 5th Indian Division in the Sudan. He also served in Eritrea, Iraq and Syria and. when Burma was falling, he was sent to command the 1st Burma Corps. He was given command of the famous Fourteenth Army which finally cleared the Japanese from the Indian frontier and eventually right out of - the sub-continent. He wrote two notable books about the war in Burma: &#39;Defeat into Victory&#39; and &#39;Courage&#39;. In 1947 he left the Army to become a full-time member of the British Railways Executive.. In 1948 he was asked to return to the Army as Chief of the Imperial General Staff and was promoted to Field-Marshal. In 1952 he was appointed Governor-General of Australia in succession  to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> McKell. He remained Governor-General until January I960, a term of office longer than any except that of Lord Gowrie. He travelled tirelessly to all parts of Australia, and both he and Lady </para>

On retiring from his post as Governor-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Slim was created Viscount Slim.

          <para>- On behalf of the Australian Labor Party I support the motion and associate the Party and its supporters with all the Prime Minister&#39;s statements and sentiments on this occasion. It is probably not too much to say that of all the British-born Governors-General, Lord Slim was personally the most distinguished. It is probably true that he was the most popular. It is neither patronising nor provincial to say that he was at home here - that he fitted in extraordinarily well - because his qualities were very much those which Australians most admire. In his character, indeed his physique, he was every inch the Head of State. He was equal to every occasion and circumstance, as I early noted when he inaugurated the 3 war cemeteries in New Guinea. When he had to pick up and don his field-marshal&#39;s cap for the national anthem it was swarming with ants - mordant ones. Only those in the parliamentary entourage could see his predicament. He never&#34; flinched. It may be that Lord Slim&#39;s very success in his great position delayed the day when it became accepted as inappropriate to appoint any other than an Australian citizen to it, for one had to concede that, in accepting Australia&#39;s highest honour, so great an Englishman honoured Australia herself. </para>

          <para>- I should like to associate the Australian Country Party with this condolence motion .and the remarks of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. Field-Marshal Viscount Slim was one of the .great men of our time and, if I might personally say, I think he was the. .greatest man with whom I have had .the pleasure of being associated. He was a self-made, man, a completely competent man, who reached the zenith of accomplishment in his profession. He was. a; valiant soldier, a first-class author, an excellent orator and an outstanding leader. Australians were proud to have him as their Governor-General. I express appreciation of his dedicated service in that position. He was a man whose presence was always felt. He was a stately man who held himself erect with shoulders , back.  His  great chin expressed the determination that made him a famous man, I will always recall one occasion when he attended a parliamentary function. He was walking up the front steps of Parliament House and photographers were trying to get a photograph of him. One photographer said: Your  Excellency,  would you mind smiling?&#39; and he said: &#39;What do. you think I am doing?&#39; On this official occasion we give a final salute to honour him and say: &#39;Long live his memory and his example&#39;. To his widow and family I express the sympathy of my Country Party colleagues. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ormonde</inline>was born in 1905 in Scotland. He came to Australia as a young boy. He was educated at the Marist Brothers College, West Maitland. He then worked on the northern coalfields before turning to journalism. By the 1940s, he had become prominent in the organisational side of the New . South Wales Labor movement. He, in 1958, was appointed to the Senate to fill a casual vacancy and was elected at the general elections held later that year.

          <para>- I would like to associate myself with the remarks of the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Australian Country Parly. I had known Jim Ormonde from when I was a small boy. The Prime Minister made reference to the fact that before Jim Ormonde became a journalist he spent his early life on the northern coalfields. How very true. Jim Ormonde was reared in the heart of the northern coalfields at Kurri Kurri where I was reared. It was there, I believe, that the true principles of the Australian Labor Party were infused into his bloodstream. He never diverted from them. It is true, as the Prime Minister has said, that Jim Ormonde was a man of great humanity, high principles and full of humanism. </para>

          <para>- On behalf of the Australian Labor Party I support the motion moved by the Prime Minister. The name Blackburn is imperishable linked in Australia with the cause of human rights and civil liberties and, in particular, opposition to conscription. Maurice Blackburn&#39;s single mindedness in these causes undoubtedly deprived him of the highest offices of political life. He and his wife enjoyed a unique partnership in Australian parliamentary and political life. Of the 3 women who have sat in this House, 2 were the widows of former members. It is a striking commentary on the singular difficulty facing women who seek a political career in our country in their own right. </para>

It was a shock to discover that a vigorous and vital person who only a few months before had been showing an active interest in all of the affairs in which she had been interested all of her life had suddenly passed on. It was difficult to believe that this was a woman of about 82 years. I wish to place on record my personal tribute, and 1 am sure the tribute of all of those who were associated with the things in which she played a very active and effective part over a very long lifetime. </para>

Under no circumstances would she surrender any of the principles in which she believed. In fact, in the 1930s she resigned from, the Australian Labor Party because she wished to continue work with one of the. international peace movements. During the time I knew her she retained her active and effective interest in the Women&#39;s Christian Temperance Union, the Women&#39;s International. League for Peace and Freedom, the Save the. Children Fund and, as the Prime Minister mentioned, the Aborigines Advancement League and the Federal Council for the Advancement of Aboriginals and&#39; &#39;Torres Strait Islanders, of which she was a founder.

        <para>In her local area, kindergartens and such instrumentalities found her interest effective. She was the originator of some of them even as recently as 2 or. 3 years ago. I believe she was a woman, who was able to mix very effectively in the rough and tumble of politics in the community &#39;which I represent. When she won the seat in 1946, it was almost a revolution. She was one of the few independents to enter this- Parliament, and was a woman at that. Therefore,&#39; she carried with her a great capacity and integrity and was a representative of Australian womanhood. I have just glanced at Hansard to see some of the things that she: said in the last term she was here. During the Budget debate of 1949 T see that, amongst the things she had to talk about, she said: </para>

J think she was genuinely independent of all the political parties. If it be true that her philosophy was in general on the left, it would also be true that she was completely independent and pursued an attitude entirely of her own. She was a very gentle woman; she was very humane. In that Parliament of 1946 to 1949 she contributed a quite distinctive outlook and was a valuable member of the Parliament. </para>

            <para>The red kangaroo, largest marsupial in the world, has, through shooting for commerce, become extinct or rare in many areas of Australia where it was once prolific. </para>
            <para>All scientific evidence points to this decimation of numbers, which is clear evidence that State governments are unable to control commercial shooting within their boundaries. </para>
            <para>We, the people of Australia, feel strong repugnance to the fact that industries should be allowed to operate, which in the past have decimated the koala to extinction over vast areas of this land, and which have now similarly exploited the kangaroo. We feel that the taxpayer should not have the heavy burden of having to pay for the control of an industry which benefits but a few people in this country, and that live kangaroos through their value as tourist attractions are economically far more profitable to our economy and to us aesthetically. </para>

            <para>- I ask the Treasurer a question without notice. The honourable gentleman will have noted that last weekend the Bureau of Agricultural Economics officially released the report which it prepared for the Minister for Primary Industry on the immediate and longer term needs for debt reconstruction and farm adjustment, with special reference to the sheep industry, and which had previously been made available to subscribers to a privately circulated newsletter on 18 January. In these circumstances I ask him whether the Treasury will now officially  release the text of the report which it made to him on the economic consequences of the National Wage Case decision and which was similarly made available to subscribers to the same newsletter a week later on 25 January. </para>

            <para>- There is no similarity at all between these two things. One was a report which has now been released and although at first it was given only a very restricted circulation, it was a complete document. The alleged Treasury document which did appear illicitly in the financial Press was in fact only an early working paper which was sent by comparatively junior officers to their counterparts in other departments for discussion and subsequent interchange of views. It has no status whatsoever. I certainly will not publish it. </para>

The Minister will- recall that some time ago the Atomic Energy Commission called tenders for a nuclear power station at Jervis Bay. Have these tenders been assessed yet? If so, when will a contract be let? Can the Minister say whether &#39;.the Commission favours a power station using natural or enriched uranium? </para>

            <para>- Last year I kept the House informed of the progress in the calling of tenders and I indicated that possibly consideration of. the., tenders would be concluded by the end of&#39; the last calendar year. However, due to the amount of work involved and some other matters that had arisen consequently, I advised the House before the end of last year that conclusion of the matter could not be anticipated until early this year. It has not yet been finalised but I would expect that by the end of this week I -would have the recommendation from the&#34; Australian Atomic Energy Commission. I ask  that I have a few weeks to study this recommendation after it comes to me. It will be a fairly complicated matter. Subsequent to that I will be making a submission to the Government. At this point of . time I cannot inform the House of the results of the tenders but when the information is available regarding the letting of <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> contract I will make a full statement to the House. That statement, of course, can be debated if required. </para>

            <para>- To the best of my recollection I have received no such direct representations. Indeed, this would not surprise me because it would appear that although the Leader of the Opposition makes many representations in public, for political purposes, in his own way of thinking his attitude to this question is somewhat different from the public presentation he would have&#39; us believe. I recall that the honourable member for Shortland told us of what happened in the Labor Caucus. Apparently the Leader of the Opposition spoke of feather bedding when it was suggested by the honourable member for Shortland - and I have no doubt he suggested it - that the pension rate should be raised. I for one do not regard this as feather bedding. 1 would hope that as soon as it is economically practicable the rate will be raised. But I draw the attention of the House to the very notable discrepancy between the published - the intended to be published - attitude of the Leader of the Opposition and the attitude which he reveals in the comparative privacy of his own Caucus. I have no doubt in my own mind that the honourable member for Shortland has given us a truthful version of what there occurred. </para>

            <para>- I said something very similar to what the honourable member asked me if I said, and I can give him the printed words actually used. But it was along the lines that with wage awards in the arbitration court and in other areas, the control of the economy was not entirely now in the hands of governments - not just the Commonwealth Government, but governments generally. This is no real change in essence from what has occurred before, but it has become much more evident because the effects on the economy of such awards have been much heavier and have led to much greater cost increases. This is an area where no government can interfere at the moment in the present state of the law, and that being so, it must be conceded that it is an area where decisions can be made which have a very great impact on the economy but which cannot at present be affected by governmental action. </para>

          <para>There was a considerable discussion of each one of the principal commodities. As a result of the Outlook Conference, it is hoped that farmers in the field as well as the 300 delegates will have a far better understanding of the general problems in marketing some of our agricultural products in the next few years. The whole objective of the Outlook Conference was to bring farmers in the field into a little closer contact with the Bureau of Agricultural Economics, the producer organisations and those who are specifically working towards putting the task of marketing on more of a scientific basis than it has been in the past. Generally, it will succeed only to the extent to which the products of the Conference are now disseminated among farmers in the field. 1 hope that all honourable members will ensure that as far as possible within their capacity farmers see and understand something of the products of the discussion because I am sure that that will be generally to the advantage of the rural community. </para>

            <para>- As yet &#39;we do not have full details of the results&#39; of the agreement which we understand &#39;has been signed by the international oil companies and some of the oil producing and exporting countries, but we believe we will have full information concerning&#39; this agreement soon. Of course, some other negotiations have to be conducted with- other oil producing and exporting countries before the matter can be cleared finally-.&#39; However, in Australia at the <inline font-style="italic">moment</inline> we are producing approximately 50 per  cent of our own requirements. Within the- next 2 years that figure will be raised to approximately 70 per cent of our fuel requirements with the exception of some heavy fraction components of petroleum. The petroleum which we find, principally in the Bass Strait area, consists mainly of light fractions and we will still be dependent on importations for the heavier ends, such as fuel oil, diesel fuel and.  .50.  on. The effect of the proposed change in the agreement will not be known until we have the opportunity to study fully the agreement with existing countries and other countries that have to consider the matter in the near future. As I have said, our buffer is the fact that Australia is producing a substantial quantity of its own requirements and the agreement will affect us perhaps less than it will affect some other countries. As soon as we have full details of the price agreed by all countries concerned, and the impact that this will have, I will provide the information to the honourable member. </para>

            <para>- I am sorry that 1 cannot inform the honourable member when that question might be answered. All 1 can say if that the strength of the Tariff Board in respect of staffing arrangements and facilities has been increased progressively over the last two or three years. At the moment there is a request before the Government to strengthen further its . operations. As soon as I am in a position to ascertain this information I will see that the honourable member&#39;s question is answered. </para>

Firstly, can the Minister inform the Australian farming community how soon it may be able to expect assistance from the Rural Reconstruction Board?

            <para>- My understanding is that most States still. have available certain funds which have been held in a trust capacity since the debt reconstruction schemes of the 1930s and those funds are available immediately for the application of debt reconstruction. As to the longer term proposals, the present position is that all States, except Victoria, have, in general, agreed with the proposition submitted by my predecessor and by the Treasurer to them, as a result of which, after legislation is passed by this House, funds should be made available partly for the purposes of reconstruction and partly for the purposes of farm rehabilitation, lt is my intention to accelerate as much as possible the submission of that legislation. In some States, however, I believe it will be dependent upon State legislation being passed. I can assure the honourable member that the Commonwealth Government recognises the need to deal with this legislation with considerable urgency as many farmers are in a serious financial position. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The whole purpose of the approach being made by the Commonwealth is to provide immediate help to farmers who are getting back on to their feet again. The reconstruction scheme is based on the general principles followed in the field of reconstruction by the New South Wales Rural Reconstruction Board. The aim of farm rehabilitation is to be pursued within the general ambit of the report of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics which was released by me only last week. </para>

            <para>- As the honourable member well knows, there are considerable constitutional limits upon the strictly regulatory powers of the Reserve Bank in the field to which he has referred. Nevertheless, this does not inhibit the Reserve Bank keeping in very close touch both with what is occurring on the inter-company market and with the activities of finance companies, particularly those which are members of the Australian Finance Conference. There is a regular pattern of exchanges between the Reserve Bank and the Australian Finance Conference, and this pattern will continue. Although there is considerable limitation on the strict legal power, there is an opportunity to exert influence by discussion and by exchange of views with both the Reserve Bank and the Government. Therefore these avenues will not be neglected but will be explored to the maximum possible extent. </para>

I am sure that the elected members of the Northern Territory Legislative Council and the Commonwealth Government will do everything possible to have a comprehensive study made of the problem. </para>

We have not had detailed reports of mobilisation of North Vietnamese battalions or regimental groups in order to counter the operations of the South Vietnamese. From ail that I can gather, the operations of the South Vietnamese, assisted in the north of South Vietnam by the Americans, are going along amazingly successfully, lt is too early to judge but I hope that this continues and that the operations finish up a total success for South Vietnam. As yet, we have not been asked for any assistance by the South Vietnamese. We were not in fact consulted about the operations by the South Vietnamese or the United States forces in northern South Vietnam. No Australian  troops are involved and I doubt whether we will be required or asked to give any assistance. </para>

            <para>- In, my previous office as Minister for Primary Industry I had started negotiations between the Department of .Primary Industry and the Department of the Treasury on formulating a scheme for the operation of a farm loan insurance corporation. The idea of this scheme is similar to that of the scheme which is operated by the Housing Loan Insurance Corporation, whereby the lenders of money are guaranteed against default of payment. It is well recognised that one of the most urgent and critical needs of primary industry today is to obtain money on longer terms. If money is borrowed on short terms it is impossible for primary producers to repay the loan at the required rate. We will be pushing ahead as quickly as possible to try to formulate an appropriate scheme. However, many institutions and creditors will need&#39; to be covered by it. Whilst the banks, which&#39; are the traditional source of credit for rural industries, supply a substantial amount of money, the survey of indebtedness carried out by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics shows that a very high proportion of money has come from insurance institutions and from solicitors&#39; private trust funds. All these various forms of credit will have to be taken into consideration if farmers are to get the benefit of the proposed scheme. </para>

            <para>- 1 ask the Prime Minister a question  related to his 9th February statement on doctors&#39; fees in which he indicated that the Government regarded me proposed increases as unreasonable and that, failing agreement or arbitration between the Government and the Australian Medical Association, the Government would &#39;take all measures open to it to combat the proposed rise&#39;. I ask, firstly: What percentage increase would the Government have regarded as reasonable? Secondly, when threatening to take all measures open to it, what measures does the Government believe to be available, other than the possibility of instituting a participating doctors scheme. </para>

            <para>- 1 think it is not for me to say what would be or would not be <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> reasonable increase in this field; this is something which, in the event of a disagreement such as has occurred, could perhaps better be looked at by some independent authority. In reply to the second part of the question. I believe that there are a number of courses which are open, at any rate, to governments. For example, it is within the competence of State governments, should they wish to do so, to bring in the equivalent of price fixing on these services. This is not the proper and best way of dealing with this matter, as any doctor here would agree, because it would mean that no doctor, no matter if he were more skilful than another and if patients were prepared to pay him above the common fee out of their own pocket, would be enabled to charge any more than the level set down. This would not be in the interests of the doctors or, 1 think, of the patients. But that is a course which one State, I gather, has already indicated that it might embark upon. The participating doctors scheme is obviously another course which is open i:i this field in order to see that neither the patient nor the taxpayer is mulcted too heavily by people choosing their own fee levels. </para>

            <para>-  As the honourable member ought to know, I am bound by an Act and regulations of this Parliament in the administration of the censorship provisions of this country. Regulation 4A of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations specifically states that- the Minister for Customs and Excise is bound to prohibit as an import that which is obscene, that which is indecent, and so on. I have said before, and frankly admitted, that I find it extremely difficult and undesirable for a Minister to impact his subjective standards on 12 million people. Therefore we consider a community standards test as well as an obscenity test when looking at a particular item. I come back to what the regulation provides. We now have one court in the nation - in Victoria - which has pronounced unequivocally this novel to be obscene. We have another court in Western Australia which also has pronounced unequivocally this publication to be obscene. However, because of the peculiarities, if I can use that term, of the Indecent Publications Act of Western Australia which precludes the application of that legislation against works of literary merit, the court was bound to dismiss the prosecution. I put it as simply as that. I cannot see at this time how a Minister for Customs and Excise can allow a prohibited import into a country in which 2 courts have already declared the proposed import to be obscene. </para>

            <para>-  My understanding is that all States, except Victo&#39;ria, have agreed to the introduction of this scheme. Consequently, the New South Wales Government should be able to get it under way fairly soon. It is regrettable that this legislation, which was introduced by my predecessor so long ago, has taken so long to be implemented, particularly in an industry which for such a lengthy period has been subject to overseas market fluctuations and also to fluctuations in the return to producers. This is an industry which depends substantially upon government assistance, particularly from the Commonwealth Government. For these reasons I hope that it will be possible for the one government now outstanding to join in the scheme and for the scheme to be implemented as quickly as is possible. </para>

            <para>- &#91; ask the Treasurer a question which is supplementary to that asked of him by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. In view of the large amounts of financial movements being transacted outside of the official money institutions and the weaknesses this imposes on monetary policy I ask, firstly, whether he would consider encouraging hire purchase organisations to register voluntarily under banking legislation through the inducement of tax concessions. Secondly, would he consider appropriate selective fiscal measures to regulate the vast movements of cash between companies from sources such as undistributed profits and loans? I draw his attention to newspaper reports regarding Min sec for a current illustration, on a restricted basis in some respects, of what I mean. Thirdly I ask him whether, if he proposes none of these - or anything else, to be consistent, I suppose - is it his intention to continue- </para>

            <para>- Firstly I should point out that the current credit policy is not affecting only small people; it is right across the board. In fact it is tied up with limiting the total money supply and this affects large concerns as well as small concerns. The obvious reason for doing this is to keep inflationary forces in check. The honourable member asked me whether I would consider some special inducement for hire purchase companies . to register and to come under some kind of voluntary control. I have not considered this form of inducement but I certainly will take note of what the honourable member suggested. I certainly do not propose to endeavour to set up controls which would vet every transaction on the inter-company market or on markets generally because this in fact would slow up the whole business world. The result would be that the entire community would suffer. This is not to say that I would not consider like controls of a strategic nature. If the honourable member has any sensible ones to suggest I would be glad if he would convey them to me </para>

            <para>- Yes. 1 have never used the words that the Minister for Social Services attributed to me or any words like them.  I  have never used such words or any like them at any meeting of my Party, as all its members will confirm, and  I  have never used them anywhere else, as many thousands of pensioners whom  I  have represented and served as a member of this House would also confirm, and they resent and refute this allegation. </para>

            <para>- When  I  was answering a question from the honourable member for Cowper 1 may have given the impression that New South Wales has accepted the dairy farm reconstruction scheme.  I  hasten to correct that impression.  It  is hoped that this will be the subject of one of the first decisions of the incoming Liberal-Country Party Government.  I  am told that there have been very useful discussions, and  I  hope that they will continue in the right direction. </para>

          <para class="block">This Bill proposes an amendment of the income tax law to give effect to the Government&#39;s decision to suspend the taxation investment allowance on manufacturing plant and equipment. This decision was announced by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Gorton)</inline> on 3rd February 1971. The investment allowance provides a special income tax deduction of 20 per cent of capital expenditure on new plant and equipment used in manufacturing. It is supplementary to the normal deductions allowable for depreciation and thus results in total deductions for income tax purposes of 120 per cent of the installed cost of eligible plant and equipment over its scheduled life. The investment allowance was introduced in 1962 at a time of declining employment, slow economic activity and uncertainty as to the outlook for the balance of payments. It was one of a series of measures designed to stimulate demand and restore confidence in the future growth of the economy and was particularly directed to encouraging expenditures on equipment and re-equipment of manufac.turing industries which were then at a low ebb. &#34; </para>
          <para>The economic conditions which led to the introduction of the investment allowance do not exist today and the Government has considered whether, in the current economic climate, this special incentive for investment in manufacturing plant and equipment should continue to be available. We have reached the conclusion that the allowance should be suspended. Private investment in non-farm plant and equipment is rising at an annual rate in excess of 20 per cent and, at a time like this when one of our pressing economic needs is the restraint of inflation, the Government does not feel justified in continuing the investment allowance on manufacturing plant and equipment. The suspension of this concession is one of the measures we are proposing to deal with the current situation. I emphasise, however, that the suspension does not affect the investment allowance for plant and equipment used in primary production which is allowable under separate provisions of the income tax law that were enacted in 1963. </para>
          <para>The suspension of the manufacturing allowance, as proposed by the Bill, will mean that the special deduction will cease to apply in respect of expenditure incurred after 3rd February 1971 unless it is made under a contract entered into before that date with the supplier of goods or services. Accordingly the suspension will not affect entitlements to deductions for any eligible expenditure that was incurred on or before 3rd February 1971 nor will it apply to disallow deductions for expenditure that is incurred after that date in acquiring or installing plant if the expenditure is made under a contract entered into before that date with the supplier or installer of the plant or equipment. That is the effect of the Bill, but the Government is now receiving submissions from industry that the transitional provisions to continue the allowance for plant acquisitions straddling the suspension date should apply in a wider range of situations than those in which contracts have actually been entered into by 3rd February 1971. These submissions, which naturally cover a complex field, will be carefully considered and to, the extent that the Government wishes to adopt any of them, it will ask the Parliament to implement its decisions by further amending legislation. I have arranged for a memorandum explaining technical aspects of the Bill to be circulated to honourable members. I commend the Bill to the House. </para>

            <para>- The Bill which the House is now debating has been on the notice paper for some months. Its purpose is to make certain amendments to the Broadcasting and Television Act in relation to the finances of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board and the Australian Broadcasting Commission, the delegation of authority by the Commission, the increasing of financial and time limits placed on the Commission in property transactions and the repeal of a limitation on the payment of compensation. It also seeks to make certain amendments to the Broadcasting and Television Act which will curtail the tendencies of some of our mass media owners to extend their monopolistic tentacles even further into the ownership of broadcasting and television stations. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Opposition does not object to the new financial and banking provisions of the Bill, the repeal of the section limiting compensation payments or to the raising of the limits imposed on the tight of the Commission to purchase, dispose of and lease property, but it feels that the amendment which seeks to widen the powers of delegation of the Commission is open to criticism. At present the Commission can delegate to a Commissioner or to the General Manager all or any of its powers except the power of delegation. As the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Alan Hulme)</inline> said in his second reading speech, this restriction of the delegation of power has led to administrative difficulties in that only the Commission or the General Manager may, for example, incur expenditure or issue contracts. The new proposal should allow for greater efficiency and more expeditious decisions, but I cannot understand why the restriction on the delegation of power to appoint officers of the Commission has been retained. Proposed section 40(1.) of the Act reads: </para>
          <quote>
            <para class="block">The Commission may, by instrument in writing under ils common seal, delegate to a Commissioner or to an officer of, or other person employed by, the Commission, either generally or otherwise as provided by the instrument of delegation, all or any of the powers of the Commission under this Act except - </para>

            </list>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I cannot imagine a more unwieldy and inefficient procedure than this imposition on the General Manager of the task of having to approve of the employment of every permanent officer of the Commission. The General Manager has to approve of the employment of the lowest paid junior which is a time consuming and annoying procedure to say the least.&#34; Surely the General Manager of the Australian Broadcasting Commission can be trusted to delegate authority for the appointment of all but senior officers to one of his present senior officers in each of the States. A good administrative officer is riot likely to delegate too much authority to one of his subordinates and he is certainly not likely to allow the appointment of senior officers to be exercised by other than himself. The Opposition suggests that the Postmaster-General should have another look at this matter and introduce the appropriate amendment during the Committee stage of the Bill. The Opposition will be anxious to hear the Government&#39;s reasons for the non-acceptance of this suggestion if it is reluctant to act. </para>
          <para>I turn now to some of the operations of the Australian Broadcasting Commission in the radio and television field. In this regard I wish to pay a compliment to the management and staff of the Commission. Since its inception the ABC has done a magnificent job in presenting first class radio and television programmes. It has been shouldered with the responsibility under the Act of providing adequate and comprehensive programmes and is required to take, in the interests of the community, all such measures as, in the opinion of the Commission, are conducive to the full development of suitable broadcasting and television programmes. As. one who is more inclined to patronise the ABC&#39;s radio and television programmes than the programmes of commercial stations - I must admit that with the increasing interest that is being taken in pop music by my teenage children I do not get my own way as readily as previously  -  I have generally found them to be of. a high level. The Commission at least tries to present programmes which appeal to minority groups and certainly makes some attempt to encourage Australian actors, writers and artists. </para>
          <para>The public affairs programmes that the Commission presents are . generally of a high standard and dp make an effort to give coverage of controversial topics of public interest and importance. The Australian Broadcasting Commission is the only television authority with regular current affairs programmes and this is a situation which is to be de planed. The commercial stations have a duly to present regular current affairs programmes as does the Australian Broadcasting Commission. The Commission&#39;s activities iri &#39; music, concerts, drama, features, education, -Papua and New Guinea and over Radio Australia cater for both majority and minority audiences. In its 37th annual report,., for 1968-69 the Commission states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Commission invites attention to the ABC&#39;s continuing concern with the :efficient operation of ils services as they now stand at home and abroad; to the additional financial burden which must be associated with further extensions of services to less populous areas of Australia; -to the future cost of the introduction of colour television and the general costs of maintaining its diverse services. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">In its annual report for 1969-70 the Commission is shown as having a total expenditure of $53,008,659. Included in this expenditure are such charges as approximately $4m paid to the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department for tine charges. This is approximately 8 per cent of the total budget of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. The Commission is compelled to pay this amount to the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department for the use of its interstate and intrastate lines. It is a charge imposed by the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department and the Commission has no right to negotiate a price on a contract basis. It is a case of: Pay up or the lines are not available&#39;. As a business undertaking the . Postmaster-General&#39;s Department should be prepared to enter into a contract for the supply of lines, when required, by the national radio and television radio stations. The .complaint of high charges for relaying programmes is also made by the Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations in its annual report for 1969. On page 25 the report states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The increased use of satellite reception of television programmes has, however, thrown into sharp focus the  extremely  high cost of relaying programmes through the internal relay systems furnished by the Australian Post Office ... its rates for microwave relays do mitigate against their greater use by the industry, and particularly by stations outside me mainland capital cities. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">A comparison of rates charged by the Australian Post Office and rates charged in the United States of America for a 1-hour telecast at full time rates over a similar mileage is as follows: which was recently opened between Melbourne and Perth costs approximately $8,600 for 1 hour of transmission. The charges for a cable distance of approximately 2,000 miles from Sydney to Perth are about Si 0,300. A relay over 2,451 miles in the United States would cost $1,202. So there is a difference of 800 per cent or 900 per cent in charges between Australia and the United States. The Australian Broadcasting Commission is supposed to be efficient but if these charges are so high it is no wonder that the Commission is spending something like 8 per cent of its total outlay for the year on cable charges. It will be seen from the figures that I have quoted that Western Australian, Tasmanian and country stations and people are disadvantaged by the high cost of Post Office relays. People in the distant States and people in the country are entitled to view major Australian or international events at the same time as those in the capital cities on the eastern seaboard and it is about time that the Post Office reviewed its charges for the use of relay facilities by national and commercial television stations. </para>
          <para>Some further charges that are imposed on the Commission without any concession being granted to the Commission for the community service aspect of its activity are in the fields of programmes on radio and television for schools, the operation of Radio Australia and operations in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea. In none of these activities is the Commission given any subsidy by the Government to cover some of the cost, yet no-one can deny that the work performed in all of these areas is of paramount importance to Australia. The Commission should not be expected to bear the whole of the financial burden for these or other community services. The Departments of Foreign Affairs, External Territories and Education and Science should be compelled to contribute towards the cost of these service programmes. </para>
          <para>Another expense of considerable volume which is borne by the Commission is the rent paid for leased premises throughout the Commonwealth. This amounts to approximately Si. 25m per annum. In its report on the Australian Broadcasting Commission the Joint Committee of Public Accounts published on page 83 a table - I see the  Chairman  of . the Committee, the honourable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Dobie)</inline> in the House at the moment - which shows that the Commission owns office and studio space in capital cities amounting to 577,911 sq ft and leases for the same purpose premises providing 376,390 sq ft. The amount of space leased in country areas is not shown. The Commission had drawn attention to this state of affairs in its 35th annual report of 1966-67. It stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Commission again draws attention of Parliament to some of  the  difficulties under which its organisation works. The role of the ABC in mass communication is important in our developing community. Its annual expenditure is large and Parliament has the right to expect efficiency and economy on the one hand and responsibility on the other.  lt stated further: </para>
            <para class="block">However in spite of some improvement, the ABC Still operates in Sydney from 17 separate and largely unsuitable buildings and in Melbourne from 10 buildings. In other cities, the situation is similar. Effective supervision and control is not easy because of this division of personnel between widely separated locations - a situation which inhibits the necessary consultation between officers and the effective co-ordination of our varied activities. The Commission has an urgent need for new buildings in Adelaide, Sydney and Melbourne and it is hoped that in spite of other claims, Parliament will find it possible to approve the capital costs involved. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I recall that during the past few months there have been a couple of announcements made of plans for the provision of new buildings for the Australian Broadcasting Commission. But not only the amount of space that is leased by the Commission but also the diverse types of widely separated locations must have an influence on efficiency by their effect on supervision, travelling time, staff rostering and communications, as was pointed out in the Commission&#39;s 37th annual report. As far as I can ascertain, the position in relation to accommodation for the Australian Broadcasting Commission has deteriorated rather than improved since 1967. Again I say that a couple of announcements have been made about improvements in this position. The present position in capital cities appears to be that in Sydney 20 buildings are leased, in Melbourne S, in Brisbane 4, in Adelaide 3 and in Hobart 2. In country areas in New South Wales 7 buildings are leased, in Victoria 3, in Queensland 4, in Western Australia 6 and in South Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory 1 each. </para>
          <para>The 110th Report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, dealing with the Australian Broadcasting Commission, drew attention to the deplorable accommodation available in various States to the Australian Broadcasting Commission. The report used that very word &#39;deplorable&#39; in describing conditions in Adelaide. The report went on to say that the fire protection and construction of the Hindmarsh Square building were totally sub-standard. The report stated that the accommodation in Melbourne was inadequate. It stressed the need to consolidate the operations in Sydney and to improve dilapidated studios. The accommodation in Brisbane was described as over-crowded and inadequate. The Committee concluded its report on the buildings used by the Commission by stating: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>On the basis of the evidence and the inspections that it made your Committee believes that the capital city accommodation available to the Commission, particularly for radio and administration purposes, is inadequate and in many cases is seriously sub-standard. Your Committee further believes that, in the interests of efficiency, sustained and urgent efforts should be made to provide the buildings required by the Commission. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">With this the Opposition agrees. We ask the Government to take immediate action to provide accommodation which will allow the ABC to perform its statutory functions and to provide adequate and comprehensive programmes as efficiently and as economically as possible. Part of the Bill allows for a change in accounting procedures for the Board and for the Commission. It is in relation to that part of the Bill that I have spoken today. If the Government expects the Commission to operate efficiently and economically, the Government has a duty to assist the Commission by providing some of the facilities that it requires, particularly in relation to buildings. I return to Hie point about dele-, gatton of authority. I ask the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Alan Hulme)</inline> to consider giving power of delegation of authority to the General Manager in relation to appointing staff. </para>
          <para>The Bill also provides for the curtailment of certain investments of superannuation funds in television station shares. This is not the first time that  wa  have discussed the curtailment of the ever-spreading control and ownership of television stations. Since the introduction of television in Australia in 1956 this type of amendment has become commonplace. The companies which have been granted television and radio licences have tried every means at their disposal to circumvent the provision of Divisions 2 and 3 of Part 4 of the Act on ownership and control, and they are still trying. Legislation was introduced in 1960, 1965 and 1969 in an attempt to curtail the activities of those people who already controlled major newspapers, radio stations and television stations in Australia. Less than 1 2 . months after the 1969 amendments had been moved, this Bill was brought into the House. The Opposition has repeatedly warned of the dangers of having an almost monopolistic control of our mass media. lt is interesting to look at the ownership and control of our broadcasting and television stations. A perusal of pages 144-49 of the 22nd Annual Report of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board shows that in relation to capital city newspapers the Adelaide Newspaper Ltd, that is the Advertiser&#39; in Adelaide, has substantial or multiple interests in 4 radio stations and 1 television station; the Australian Consolidated Press group, that is the &#39;Daily Telegraph&#39; in Sydney, has substantial control of 11 radio stations and 10 television stations; Davies Brothers, that is the &#39;Mercury&#39; in Hobart, has substantial control of 2 radio stations and I television station; John Fairfax Limited, that is the &#39;Sydney Morning Herald&#39;, 10 radio stations and 10 television stations; the Herald and Weekly Times, that is the Melbourne &#39;Herald&#39;, 17 radio stations and 5 television stations; News Limited, that is the &#39;News&#39; in Adelaide, 5 radio stations and 1 1 television stations; Queensland Press Limited, that is the Courier Mail&#39; and the &#39;Telegraph&#39; in Brisbane, 3 radio stations and I television station; West Australian Newspapers, that is the &#39;West Australian&#39; in Perth, 5 radio stations and 1 television station. The same thing apples with regard to provincial newspapers - newspapers controlling 2 radio stations and 3 television stations. These things, must be stopped. I am pleased that the Minister is making a further attempt to do so in this Bill. </para>

            <para>- When the honourable member for Lang <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Stewart)</inline> commenced his speech he said that this Bill has been on the notice paper for a long time. I suppose that the yellow colour of the paper that he used for his notes indicates how long ago his speech was written. He made reference to the undesirability of monopolies controlling the news media. As a member of the Australian Labor Party, he is quite aware of the manner in which his Party uses its radio stations for pushing political propaganda. If any member of a party was aware of the danger of the news media being in the hands of a biassed party, surely a member of the ALP would be. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>My purpose in speaking is to raise a matter which is not under direct discussion at the moment but which I have been drawing to the attention of the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Alan Hulme)</inline> for some months now. Most honourable members depend very much upon their constituents to bring to their attention facts and features of various Acts of Parliament which, at times, are not exactly fair, lt was in this manner that in mid 1969 I had drawn to my attention the provision in the Broadcasting and Television Act which makes the person who is watching a programme on an unlicensed television receiver the person who is liable to prosecution. At that time 1 wrote to the Postmaster-General. He undertook to have the matter investigated and he did so. In due course he advised me that his department, in collaboration with the Attorney-General&#39;s Department, would examine the matter with a view to devising a legally acceptable arrangement whereby a person other than the one detected may accept responsibility and thus be successfully prosecuted. In most cases the person caught using an unlicensed television receiver would not worry greatly about who was to be prosecuted. But there are unusual instances. For example, a husband may not own the television set; it may belong to his wife. The inspector calls and the husband is watching the set, and automatically the summons is taken out against the viewer. In certain instances this can mitigate against the person caught. A successful prosecution may affect his employment. The wife, in the instance to which T am referring, may be more than willing to accept responsibility. The present Act does not permit this. </para>
          <para>Recently T wrote again to the Postmaster-General drawing attention to his letter of 15th October 1969. He told me that the matter was still being considered, in collaboration with the Attorney-General&#39;s Department. My argument is not with the Postmaster-General because the matter is purely a legal one. A legal matter has to be considered very carefully by the Attorney-General&#39;s Department before it can give the best advice possible. But this is the question I ask: How long are we expected te sit by and watch Acts of Parliament, needing minor amendment, continue in their present state while innocent people are wrongly convicted? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bryant</inline> - It is a waste of effort. </para>

I suggest that when items such as this are referred to it the Attorney-General&#39;s Department has more than an obligation to attend to them promptly. I am disgusted to read in today&#39;s newspapers stories of tape recorded conversations being used in a court case in Victoria. One wonders about the responsibilities of the Attorney-General&#39;s Department when Acts of Parliament are so blatantly flouted from time to time. Nobody seems to care. I might say that 1 am one who does care. I. understand that the Postmaster-General has to wait on advice from the Attorney-General&#39;s Department in these matters. But for Heaven&#39;s sake let us have a change because in the meantime a lot of innocent people are suffering as a result of what might best be described as inadequate legislation. </para>

            <para>- in reply - On 25th August last year the honourable member for Blaxland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Keating)</inline> led for the. Australian Labor Party on this Bill and my comments will relate only to the remarks which he made at that time. Normally one would not waste time on the extraordinary issue of inaccuracies which the honourable member put together but he saw fit to use these totally inaccurate facts - he called them facts - to attack me and the Broadcasting Control Board. </para>

            <para>The Bill is designed to cover up some of the mistakes made in the past by the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hulme)</inline> and his adviser, the Broadcasting Control Board and to justify their actions in the future. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The honourable member also accused me of deliberately breaking the law and he said:  . . the  Postmaster-General has broken both the spirit and the letter of the Act . . .  Let me say at once that if I or the Broadcasting Control Board have failed to administer the Broadcasting and Television Act strictly in accordance wilh its provisions we are not fit to hold our positions. If the honourable member can find any evidence that we have failed in this way I ask him. to produce it. If he cannot - I know he cannot - I hope he will have the decency to withdraw any suggestion of improper practices by me or members of the Board. </para>
          <para>The Government&#39;s policy with respect to the control of broadcasting and television stations has been clearly stated on many occasions. Broadly, the policy is that no person or company should be in a position to control more than 8 broadcasting licences or more than 2 television licences. The . Broadcasting and Television Act was framed with the intention of giving effect to this policy. Notwithstanding the comprehensive provisions of the Act some companies have over the years found ways of circumventing these requirements. In every case when these tactics have been used I have moved to amend the Act, just as I am doing with the present Bill. If the honourable member for Blaxland had any true understanding of this matter he would have known that in 1965 when I introduced some most far reaching amendments to the Act to overcome some of the means of avoidance that had been discovered his own leader, then the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, said:  lt is admirable that the Postmaster-General has at last been stirred to take fresh steps to control the monopolisation in ownership and programming of Australian commercial television stations. </para>
          <para class="block">The legislation to which the now Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> referred on that occasion was, like the present legislation, introduced to prevent circumvention of the Government&#39;s intentions. Apparently this is yet another matter upon which the Leader of the Opposition and some members of his Party do not find themselves able to agree. The honourable member for Blaxland bolstered his extraordinary allegations with a collection of what he described as facts which he claimed to have gleaned from the 21st annual report of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board. He said he found them only after very close scrutiny. I can only add that it is a pity he did not scrutinise the very clear and exact information contained in Appendix I of that report a little more closely because if he had he might then have managed to get more of his so-called facts correct. </para>
          <para>I do not wish to take up the time of the House with a long recital but I shall content myself with a few examples of the honourable member&#39;s total failure to comprehend the truth. For example, he stated that John Fairfax Ltd owns ali the shares in 2GB Sydney and 2WL Wollongong, all the ordinary shares in 2CA Canberra and a majority of the shares in 3AW Melbourne, 5DN Adelaide and 2LF Young. In fact John Fairfax Ltd does not own one share in any of those companies. <inline font-style="italic">It</inline> does hold a 26 per cent interest in Macquarie Broadcasting Holdings Ltd, which in turn has a prescribed interest - that is to say, more than a 5 per cent shareholding - in the stations I mentioned. The honourable member said, that John Fairfax Ltd had a controlling interest in 4BH Brisbane. It does not. Indeed, Macquarie Broadcasting Holdings, which does own shares in that station, does not even have an interest amounting to a prescribed interest. Worse still the honourable member went on to say: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Chandlers (Australia) Ltd of Brisbane transferred its shares in 4BH to John Fairfax and Sons Ltd although the company must have fully realised that in doing so it was consenting to a violation of the strict terms of the Act. Although he was not the responsible Minister at the lime the Postmaster-General should have personal knowledge of this transaction. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I was in fact the responsible Minister at the time. The shares were not transferred as the honourable member suggested but were transferred in parcels of less than 15 per cent to a number of groups which did not include Fairfax. I believe it is true that Chandlers had considered transferring the shares in 4BH to one purchaser but this transaction was specifically prevented by the amendments to the Broadcasting and Television Act which I had introduced, and to which this House had assented, in 1969. </para>
          <para>For the rest of the honourable member&#39;s misstatements - I do not propose .to list all of them - let me say that he is apparently unable to distinguish between a controlling interest and a prescribed interest as defined in the Act and that he is further unable to distinguish between those 2 interests and a minor shareholding interest. I believe I should put right the Hansard record in relation to the statements -made by the honourable member for Blaxland who led on behalf of the Opposition in the debate on this Bill. </para>

It is all very well to confront me with what he calls facts at the moment. I would like to see the second reading stage continued so that I may have the opportunity to answer a few of his allegations in detail. I move now to the amendment. On 12th December 1969 the Postmaster-General issued a Press release stating that he would introduce legislation to apply restrictions on the number of television stations that could be controlled by one interest. Obviously there have been improper uses of employees&#39; pension funds by the interests who had caused such funds to be set up. He said that the Government believed it was undesirable that there should be any appearance of pension funds being used to add to such interests. </para>

          <para class="block">The Australian Labor Party would like to know why the effective date was changed from 22nd October to 12th December. We consider that some organisation must be able to escape the net if the legislation operates from 12th December and not 22nd October as first intended. If. the Postmaster-General cares to say why the legislation will now operate from 12th December 1969 and not 22nd October 1969 we will be pleased to hear his explanation. I cannot understand why the date of the release of the Press statement has anything to do with choosing 12th December. The Postmaster-General said in the Press release that the legislation would be effective from 22nd October. He is reported as saying that the reason why this legislation is to be implemented is to overcome the occurrences in the future which were mentioned in relation to John Fairfax &#38; Sons Ltd and its interest in Canberra Television Ltd. I intend to leave the matter here and commend the amendment to the House. </para>

            <para>- What was done in this matter had nothing whatever to do with any interest of John Fairfax and Sons Ltd in Canberra Television Ltd. It related to a situation which developed in Western Australia. I shall deal with it broadly. The situation arose with the transfer of substantial television interests to a pension fund. It was discovered that 2 out of the 3 trustees of the fund were directors of the television company. It was believed that if 2 trustees out of the 3 were directors of the company as well as trustees of the pension fund in fact the fund is virtually still under the control of the company. On 22nd October it came to my notice that this was the situation. I made the statement as at 12th December. Normally when a statement is made and something is intended to apply out of that statement it applies as from the time the statement is made. It was intended to apply as at 22nd October because at that moment 1 did not know whether anything had happened. Subsequently it was found that there had been no change and no advantage had been taken of the Broadcasting and Television Act as it stood between 22nd October and up to 12th December. It therefore seemed appropriate that we should change the date of operation to the date of the announcement, 12th December, there being in the Government&#39;s view no disadvantage from the point of view of control. Under  these circumstances the Government rejects the amendment. </para>

          </quote><para class="block">This amendment adds clause 17. to the Bill. I shall make a few comments although I believe a statement was circulated to honourable members at an earlier- point of  time. It was circulated because it had been intended that this clause would be incorporated in another Bill. Since other aspects of broadcasting and television which were being looked at could not be brought in at that time it was decided that the clause should be made part of this Bill. So that there would be an explanation before we came to the debate on the Bill and. a consideration of the amendment the statement was circulated. I shall read it so that people might understand what is intended and so that it will be included in Hansard. The purpose of the clause is to permit the service; by means of the registered post, of summonses for offences in relation to unlicensed broadcast and television receivers. This will provide an additional means for the service of these summonses in most of the States, lt will not do away wilh the availability of personal service in appropriate cases. In the past, it has been the practice to have summonses for offences relating to unlicensed broadcast and television receivers served on defendants by members of the State police forces, but for some time there have been indications that, in some States at least, there was dissatisfaction with this arrangement. Some State Ministers in charge of police have taken the view that the service of summonses is not a proper police function and that it diverts trained men from more responsible activities. Acting on that view they have directed that police are not to be used for the service of certain summonses for offences under- their own Slate laws. More recently, with increasing demands on the police, it has been made clear to the Commonwealth that some of the States are no longer prepared to see members of the police used to serve summons for the more common Commonwealth statutory offences.  The Chief Secretary for Victoria has already informed the Commonwealth that the Victoria Police will no longer undertake the service of summonses issued under the Broadcasting and Television Act. lt has, therefore, become necessary to arrange immediately for some other means of effecting service of summonses in respect of the common minor offences under the Broadcasting and Television Act in relation to unlicensed broadcast and television receivers. In considering means of effecting service of these summonses, consideration has been given to amendments made to the law of most of the States during recent years with the object of relieving the police of the need to serve all summonses. Until fairly recently, the laws in force in all States and Territories required that there should be personal service of all summonses for offences. Personal service generally involved delivering a copy of a summons to the defendant himself or leaving a copy in the last known or usual place of abode or business of the defendant with some other person who was apparently an inmate of, or employed at, that place and apparently over the age of 16 years. Between 1962 and 1967 the laws in force in most of the States were amended to enable summonses for relatively minor offences to be served by post. The new procedures seem to have worked satisfactorily in the States and it is desirable that a similar procedure be authorised by Commonwealth law for service of summonses for offences in relation to unlicensed broadcast and television receivers. The new clause has been drawn so as to ensure, first, that there will be a high degree of probability that the defendant will in fact receive a summons that is posted to him and, secondly, that if a defendant does not receive a summons posted to him there will be a simple procedure by which he or the prosecutor may proceed lo have set aside any conviction that was recorded in circumstances where the defendant was not in fact served wilh a summons or was not served soon enough to give him a reasonable opportunity to answer the charge. In providing for service by registered post, a more secure means of delivery than is required by corresponding laws of the States will be provided. Moreover, the provisions of the clause enabling convictions to be set aside are more favourable to defendants than the provisions in corresponding State legislation. </para><list type="upperalpha-dotted">

          <para class="block">The Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Alan Hulme),</inline> in the speech which he has just delivered, said that there was a simple procedure which could be followed whereby someone who had allegedly been served a summons by post, who had been convicted and who could then show that he had not received the summons at all or in time to allow him to do something, could apply to the court within 2 years after the date of the conviction, or an officer Of the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department could apply to the court within 2 years after the date of the conviction, for the conviction to be set aside. The Opposition moves the deletion of the words &#39;within 2 years&#39; and the insertion of the words &#39;at any time&#39; because a person who was summonsed for an infringement of the Act could have left for overseas just prior to the issue of the summons and might not return to Australia for three or four years. He might be a member of the Foreign Affairs Department who was posted away and who did nothing about it or perhaps knew that the summons was there and let it go. If he came back after 2 years he might then find that in his absence, as he had not appeared at court, he had been convicted of an infringement of the Act. He has no right under this clause of applying to the court to have the conviction set aside. </para>
          <para>The Opposition cannot see that there is any good reason or that there are sufficient reasons for making the limitation of 2 years. Most of these applications would be made within a short period of the conviction having been recorded, so the Opposition cannot see that there is any difficulty in removing the words &#39;within 2 years&#39; and inserting the words &#39;at any time&#39;. I commend the amendment to the Minister. </para>

            <para>- The Government is not prepared to accept the amendment which the honourable member for Lang <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Stewart)</inline> has moved. I understand that under the State Acts where service of summons by post is approved the time specified for an appeal against conviction is about 3 months. The honourable member raised a point which related particularly to a person going overseas. Very few people who go overseas do not sign a power of attorney appointing people who would have full responsibility for their affairs and who in  the  normal course would receive all their correspondence and therefore have a substantial chance of knowing what had taken place in relation to such a matter as this. Another important factor is that the Opposition says: &#39;Let us not have a limit of 2 years. Let us have no limit at all.&#39; </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>If a person of 20 years of age were prosecuted he could have the right to appeal until he was 70 or until he died. Where would the court records be? Where would the departmental records be? There would be a hopeless situation if the amendment moved by the honourable member for Lang were accepted. Compared with State legislation on a similar matter 1 feel that the Government is being generous in allowing a 2-year period. For that reason I indicate that we will not accept the. amendment. </para>

            <para>- Whilst I support the amendment that has been moved by the honourable member for Lang <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Stewart)</inline> I would put one suggestion to the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Alan Hulme).</inline> The Bil! deals with the prosecution of persons who &#34;fail either to take out or to renew &#39;a television viewer&#39;s licence. I think it is a fact that at least 50 per cent of those cases which are dealt with in the courts apply to people who have overlooked the need to take out a licence. I have had quite a few people come to see me at different times when the inspector has been around and their names have been taken because they have failed to take out a licence. I have not found anyone yet amongst those who have been prosecuted or who have come to see me who has refused to take out a licence. In most cases they had been mixed up in their dates or the husband &#34;had&#39; left it to the wife to pay it and the wife- hart left it to the husband to pay it. The result was that no-one paid it. In the main these have been the reasons for the convictions. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Information that has come to me indicates that in 1968-69 there were 20.959 prosecutions throughout Australia. No doubt this has involved the. Minister&#39;s Department in quite a deal , of legal work in preparing the summonses. . Previously they had to be served, but now there is a new procedure. The matter&#34; then comes before the court. All of this takes&#39; time. Very few people are prepared &#34;to defend the case. I have watched the&#34; reports of proceedings of these cases in the local newspaper. Invariably they are not defended. But still, it takes up the time of the court and it takes up the time of the Department in preparing the summons. Someone has to be present at the court on the day that the summons is dealt with. I would suggest &#39; to the Minister that the Department should give some thought to on-the-spot fines in these cases where the inspector finds that someone has not got a licence. The inspector could give him a ticket, as is done for speeding or certain other breaches of the traffic laws. In such cases a man receives an on-the-spot fine. He can pay it if he wants to. Certain amounts are prescribed to be paid for committing the breaches. If a man knows that he is guilty of having exceeded the speed limit or having done something that the traffic laws say he should not do then within a certain time - I think it is 28 days - he pays the fine and that is the finish of it. He does not have to&#39; appear before the court. The Police Department does not then have to go through the process one has to go through here, of drawing up a summons, serving it and having the court hear it. If a person says: &#39;I did not exceed the speed limit and I am going to take on the police&#39;, he has the right to do so. The case is then dealt with in court and the person can exercise his civil rights in the court to challenge the evidence given by the police. </para>
          <para>This same idea has been extended a bit further in New South Wales now with on the spot fines for people who throw litter on the streets, in parks and in other places. The process is simple. A person is fined $5 for a certain offence. If he wants to pay it he pays it within 28 days. If he does not want to pay it he can go to court and fight the council or whoever served the summons. I cannot see anything wrong with a similar procedure being adopted in relation to television licences. I do not think any of us would suggest for 1 second that a person who does not have a television viewers&#39; licence has committed some serious crime that requires him to be brought to court to be dealt with, lt is a clear cut case. It is a simple breach of the law. </para>
          <para>Another aspect to be taken into account is that a lot of people who are quite law abiding citizens overlook the need to renew their licence. They are then dragged into court. I know a lot of people who are worried not by the fine but by the though! that they have had to be dealt with by the court. I think my suggestion is a way in which the Minister could easily get around this problem. He could forget about the procedures of drawing up and serving summonses and rights of appeal and all the rest of it. It is an opportunity to get with the times. I say that to the Minister advisedly: In this field 1 think it is an excellent opportunity to eliminate all the unnecessary court procedure and substitute for it a simple process. If a person gets a ticket and he knows he is guilty he can pay the fine and that is the finish of it. </para>
          <para>We know that in the main very few of these people are fined in excess of about $20. The only people who deliberately refrained from taking out licences were some of the radio and television personalities. I remember one person in particular whom I will not name because he is no longer with us. I think it was part of his act to get fined periodically. This was before we had television in Australia. He periodically got fined for not having a radio listeners licence. As I said, I think all the show that he used to put on at that time was part of his act. I think he deliberately failed to renew his licence so that he could get the publicity. It all worked into his programme. That is just my impression of what he did, because he was fined too often to forget his renew his licence. But I am talking rather about the average citizen who forgets to renew it. </para>
          <para>Not very long ago I made representations to them. iii ster on behalf of a constituent and a friend who assured me that he had genuinely omitted to renew his licence. But this fellow still had to go through the court. Against my advice he took a day off work to appear in court. With a system of on the spot fines he could have settled the matter immediately. He probably would have been fined $10 for his first offence and $20 for his second. The Minister could decide the amount of the fines. It is only a very minor offence. I am simply putting the suggestion forward in good faith in the hope that the Minister will give it serious consideration. I do not necessarily wish to move an amendment to this effect at this stage but the next time this particular portion of the Act is being considered I hope that the Government will do something about the position by way of an amendment. </para>

            <para>- I appreciate the comments made by the honourable member for Newcastle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Charles Jones).</inline> I would be the last person to wipe a proposal for which I believe consideration is justified. I am pleased that the honourable member did not move an off the cuff amendment because it may have been very difficult to accede to it. But I assure him that I will look at the proposal and consult my legal advisers about it. At some future time 1 may be able to indicate to him quite clearly whether we are able to carry out his suggestion or whether the Government feels there are reasons why it should reject it. lt should be appreciated that we in the Department believe we do the maximum possible so that people can avoid prosecution. We send a notice of renewal before the inspectors go into an area. We undertake publicity through newspapers and by radio. I think this gives fair notice to people that they,, should check whether their licence is due for renewal. But this is not what the honourable member was referring to. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The honourable member was speaking about those people who accept that it is overdue and that it has to be paid. One would have to consider the fine to be imposed because in some cases the licence has not been paid for 3 or 4 years. Of course, this represents a substantial amount of money to many people in the community. If they had to meet the cost of a licence from the time of the expiry dale they would have to pay $20 a year for 3 or 4 years plus a fine. This would be fairly costly. We would have to look at the question of allowing time in which to pay. But I will have a look at the proposal which has been made and, if possible, incorporate it in a future amendment to this Act. </para>

            <para>- The Opposition regrets that the Minister for Education and Science <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr N. H. Bowen)</inline> has not seen fit to accept the recommendation of the Council of the Australian National University that student representation on the Council be increased. The Minister&#39;s reply to the recommendation is somewhat light. He said: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>The University Council also recommended a further undergraduate  representative,  but the Government believes that having regard to the nature and composition of the Council and its methods of operation, the measures it proposes will provide adequate representation for undergraduate students. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I do not know what that means really. The Council itself said there should be more undergraduate students on the Council. The Government takes the view that the operations of the Australian National University Council being what they are, whatever that means, there are enough undergraduate representatives now. I draw the Minister&#39;s attention to the fact that the University of Western Australia has 3 undergraduate members on its Council and that the request of the Australian National University for extra undergraduate representation was because of the conviction of the Council and the administrative staff of the University that this was necessary. </para>
          <para class="block">The Minister must realise that communication between a governing body of a university and its undergraduate body is today a very important feature in university discipline and it is very important that the decisions of the Council of the Australian National University, for instance, be fully understood by the student body. For this reason it is a very good thing that at the meetings of the student body there should be a number of student representatives who are able to explain the decisions of the Council and also to participate in those decisions. </para>
          <para>It is an advantage in the University of Western Australia that this now takes place. My son was the  president  of the undergraduates of the University of Western Australia -  President  of the Guild Council - last year. I know from comments of the Vice-Chancellor how important the university regards its channel of communication with the student body. For the year my son was the only representative on the Senate of the University of Western Australia but the number being enlarged to 3 has improved the situation. I think it is simply a matter of communications. One student member can be singled out as, shall we say, being rather square or conservative or he may not be able to explain the decision of the Council effectively. If there are a number of student representatives it tends to prevent a breakdown of communication between the governing body of the university and the student body. The relationship between the Council and the student body of the Australian National University has been excellent. In the main the whole disciplinary structure at the Australian National University has been very good, as I am sure it has been in the University of Western Australia. Seeing that the Council itself felt that extra undergraduate representation was necessary I can only regret that the Government has rejected the proposal. However, it has made certain changes to the structure of the Council in that the undergraduate representative no longer has to be a graduate of the university. That is good. What is more, the research students&#39; representative does not have to be a graduate of 2 years standing and the age of the student representative on the Council has been reduced to make it realistic that he should be an undergraduate. </para>
          <para>I think it would be a very good thing if the Council of the Australian National University had a representative of external students on it. External students at the Australian National University are a very important group. They are mostly Commonwealth civil servants who are studying for a degree and are very highly motivated towards their studies. It is an interesting feature of universities that external students within the faculties where one can be an external student include some of the very best students. However, because of their struggles to get a university education their results, which in certain cases can be amongst the very best in the university, generally are not up to the average. But some of these students are quite strongly motivated. They tend to be the shadowy figures of the university flitting in and out and yet they are students with special needs. It would be very good for those students to be represented on the Council of the Australian National University. I realise the Council itself did not ask for this and consequently I press it with some diffidence as a personal point of view. I can only say that while in the main I congratulate the Minister on the changes he has made I regret he has not seen lit to accede to the requests of the Council which are based on its experience as a governing body. </para>

I said then that in order to decide what action should be taken now, Cabinet had sought to discover the areas in which demand seemed to be growing most strongly. One of those areas is the public sector - spending by governments - and we believe one of the first lines of attack on rising costs and prices should be to restrict what is being spent in that area. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>When our Budget was introduced last August it was estimated that total &#39;Commonwealth&#39; expenditure would be $7,883m. 1 should say here, I think, that although called Commonwealth expenditure, this amount included $2.708m for reimbursement grants and other payments to the States. Indeed, such payments made up more than one-third of the Commonwealth Budget. The total increase was 11.2 per cent more than the year before. But since that Budget was formulated the Government has been faced with significant additional expenditure. The national wage case decision and other wage determinations are estimated to add directly, in the rest of this financial year, $88m to the Commonwealth&#39;s own wage and salary bill in 1970-71. In addition, those wage determinations, because they have led to an increase in average wages greater than was expected, will require the Commonwealth to pay an additional $20m to the States under the formula between the Commonwealth and the States. In addition, we will need to pay some S58m to the States in this financial year to recompense them for the loss of the receipts duty tax on which they had budgeted. Mainly as a result of these two outlays, payments to the States are now expected to exceed the Budget estimates by some $83m. and emergency payments associated with recent floods will doubtless increase the outlays required. </para>
          <para>Other additional demands on our resources since the Budget was brought down include the provision of $12m as a capital advance to the Australian Wool Commission, and we believe some $6m will be required this financial year for rural debt reconstruction and farm adjustment. We must also expect increases in costs of the material used by the Government. So all in all, it is estimated by the Treasury that the net increase in expenditure since the Budget was prepared would amount to approximately S242m, if departments were provided with the sums they have asked for. This is the background against which we have decided that we should make reductions in what would otherwise have been spent. </para>
          <para>Having made a complete and detailed survey of Commonwealth expenditures, we propose to reduce the amounts which departments have sought by some $75m in the remaining months of this financial year. </para>
          <para class="block">These reductions are made across the whole range of Commonwealth departments, but they do not involve any reductions in our payments to the States. Our object has been to effect reductions in the Commonwealth expenditures for Commonwealth purposes. We have not sought to achieve this at the expense of the States. A dissection of the reduction of &#167;75m as between the main categories of Commonwealth expenditure is provided in a table which, with the concurrence of honourable members, I incorporate in Hansard. </para>
          <para class="block">
            <graphic href="071131197102162_32_1.jpg" />
          </para>
          <para class="block">Further details of the various reductions will be provided as necessary by individual Ministers. These reductions are spread right across the board, but it will be observed that the areas where the more substantial savings have been made are defence, capital works and capital advances, and departmental running expenses. We were particularly anxious to effect economies in administrative expenditures, including the overtime and salary expenditures of Commonwealth departments. At the same time we have endeavoured to avoid reducing expenditures on essential development activities. In more general terms we have sought to reduce the contribution of Commonwealth expenditures to total demand and to curb the Commonwealth&#39;s demands n the labour market. </para>
          <para>Thus the reductions in departmental expenditures will involve restraint on Public Service employment. The Public Service Board reported to me that a routine statistical projection made prior to my instructions indicated an increase in 1970-71, in full-time employment under the Public Service Act, of 4.6 per cent on the numbers employed as at 30th June 1970. In 1969-70 the comparable increase was 4.8 per cent, whilst the increase in total civilian and defence forces employment in the community was 4 per cent. The Board advised me that my instructions for restraint on establishment increases could benefit the health and soundness of administration in the Commonwealth Service, and it suggested that a limitation should be placed on the increase in Service employment. </para>
          <para>The Public Service Board has now reported to me that in its discussions with departments, it has stressed the Government&#39;s policy of restraint but has not endeavoured to impose arbitrary cuts in employment in particular directions. The Board&#39;s recommendation, which has been accepted, was that departmental increases in employment, which will be kept to the minimum, should not exceed at 30th June 1971 an overall increase in the Service of 3.4 per cent as compared with numbers employed under the Public Service Act on 30th June 1970. This is a reduction of about 25 per cent on the projected increase in employment disclosed in the Board&#39;s earlier survey; or put another way, the Board&#39;s original projection was that the Service would grow by 10,534 in 1970-71. This growth has been cut by 2,735. _ </para>
          <para>The Commonwealth has, I believe, moved quickly and firmly in the area available to it. It is necessary to do so. For as we see it, the best interests of the community require that inflation shall be overcome, and one of the first steps to this end must be action to restrain our own expenditures.

              <para>- Under the proposal the Council of the University will consist of 12 members appointed by the Governor-General, 7 ex officio members, 6 members elected by heads of schools and professors, 4 members elected by Parliament, 4 members elected by non-professorial academic staff, 4 members elected by convocation, 2 co-opted members from outside the University, one member elected by research students who, of course, are graduates, and one member elected by undergraduates. I have some sympathy with the remarks of the honourable member for Fremantle concerning student representation because, as a member of the Council, I was privy to discussion within the Council which unanimously recommended to- the Government that, amongst other things, the Council be increased by further undergraduate representatives. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The recommendation was based on several criteria. Firstly, the Council had been most impressed over the years with the excellent contributions made to Council discussion by the student representatives. These single representatives have had an increasingly difficult task to perform. In addition to their responsibilities as students they have had the task of representing ali student bodies on the Council. They have been unremitting in their efforts to acquaint themselves with student views and their efforts to fulfil this obligation, plus their other responsibilities, have, in some cases, precluded the opportunity they have had of taking as active a part in Council activities and committees as would be desirable. Undoubtedly their participation, where possible, has been helpful. I point out that since the student representative has been <inline font-style="italic">on the</inline> Council student numbers have more than trebled, with a similar proliferation of the clubs, societies and sporting bodies which he alone represents. </para>
          <para>In view of the increasing burden being placed on the student representative and because the Students Association felt it should have a voice, some years ago the Council invited the  President  of the Students Association to attend Council meetings and to speak if necessary. He, of course, has had no voting rights. The amendment before the House formalises this arrangement and gives the  President  of the Students Association voting rights, lt does this by making him an ex officio member of the Council. The  President  of the Students Association has many other responsibilities within the University and I believe he may find great difficulty, because of this, in taking part fully in Council activities. There is no doubt in my mind that the student body should have a properly informed voice which has the opportunity to participate fully in Council functions and, while so doing, adequately represent a wide range of student views. </para>
          <para>It may be thought that it is a large Council and that it would be unwise to make it too much larger, lt may be felt also that the Council should be a balanced one without undue numbers being achieved by any one section within or outside the University. 1 would agree with both these sentiments but, in looking at the composition of the Council, the one section heavily outnumbering the other sections is that represented by the Governor-General&#39;s appointees. Certainly an additional student representative would not alter unduly the balance nor would it lead to a student takeover. If one were concerned about the size of the Council I doubt whether it would be logical to look to the student representation as one in which cuts should be made, lt may be thought that matters concerning students do not come before the Council frequently and that they are dealt with at a lower level. This certainly is not the case. The Council of the University has an important and real role in hearing and understanding the student point of view and considering the student position, lt should be remembered also that in many cases the Council of the University is seen by the students of the University as a somewhat mystical body which docs not understand the problems of the undergraduate body and, more importantly, does not want to understand them. Through student representation on the Council this can be seen not to be the case. Tn fact, quite frequently Council changes its view in the light of representations properly made and properly argued by student representatives. </para>
          <para>I believe the two-way flow of communication between the governing body of the University and those being governed to be of tremendous importance. To my mind, the role of the student representatives in presenting Council decisions to the student community is just as important as their role as representatives on the Council. Only good can come from such participation and responsibility. To deny adequate participation is merely to increase the chances of unfortunate mistakes and actions occurring, brought about by lack of information, contact and communication. The Council of the Australian National University is a responsible body with practical and constant experience in the task of administering a great university It was unanimous in its recommendations to the Government. These recommendations were designed to further develop and enhance a history of achievement in sound universityy government and practical, workable council-student relationships. </para>
          <para>Like the honourable member for Fremantle, I am disappointed that the Government has decided at this stage not to fully endorse the Council&#39;s recommendations with respect to student representation. I am glad that the Government has gone part of the way by including the </para>
          <para class="block">
            <inline font-weight="bold">President</inline>of the Students Association as a full member of the Council. It should be remembered that the person holding the position of  President  of the Students Association is, in fact, elected to that position, so in one sense the elected student representative membership has been increased to two. However, in view of what I have already said, I feel that the  President  of the Students Association may be hard put to fully discharge all his responsibilities and that a less than desirable student representation and involvement in Council activities may result. As a member of the Council I will have a first hand opportunity to assess the effect of the proposed alterations. Should my fears prove soundly based I hope I will have the aid of the Minister for Education and Science <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bowen)</inline> in my efforts to have further amendments ratified. </para>

            <para>- I gather that the honourable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr MacKellar)</inline> is displeased with the approach of the Minister for Education and Science <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bowen)</inline> to this matter and, if that is the case, I support him. As far as one can judge, this approach to student representation on the Council of the Australian National University is just another piece of legislative humbug. It seems to me that this is a simple and straightforward matter where the most logical response would be to advance student representation. However, with what should be the least expensive piece of policy to implement the Government still fumbles the ball. The issue, it seems to me, is: What is a university? What is it about? What are the criteria upon which it functions? A university is a partnership between the community and the student body which also is an important part of the community. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>At present in Australia about 1 per cent of the population are students of Australian universities. An increasing percentage of students are able to take their full place in politics in this country. I think that the son of the honourable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Beazley)</inline> is a senior officer of the Australian Labor Party in Western Australia. Many students stand for Parliament. Many of them are active members of political institutions yet, in respect of the simple issue of their having some effective say and representation on the bodies which control their own future, they are not to be trusted with more than one representative in 30 or 40. I believe it is nonsense that at this stage in a country such as Australia, in a community which in the past has always established fairly advanced attitudes on what representation means - votes for women and so on - we are being more conservative than most other countries. Here we are proposing a continuing hierarchical structure. </para>
          <para>The honourable member for Warringah spoke about the governing and the governed. I do not think that is what a university is about. Admittedly there are highly specialised people who are supposed to train people in various ways in the technical faculties - tradesmen in medicine, dentistry, architecture and so on - but in the real fields of education, in the humanities, a different kind of thinking altogether must be produced. Therefore the. professorial body - the teaching body- is a specialised kind. Probably in this area of education, as much as any other - perhaps more than in some others - the student body is a very important part of society. It has been trained to take a more important and effective role in the community than most others. But we have no trust in it whatsoever. </para>
          <para>We are to carry out a revolution in the Australian National University. On a body of some 40 or 41 we are now to have a couple of students representing the student body. I do not know what the Minister fears. Is he afraid that these 2 or 3 students will overrun the whole system? Is he afraid that they will take over? Of course, this is nonsense. I believe it is time that we did something such as has been done overseas. Take what has been done in Britain as an example. In that country a select committee made up of a standing convocation of people concerned, with education has been set up to examine the way in which students must be fitted more effectively into university bodies. The legislation now before us is a pretty fair demonstration of the continuing conservatism of Australian education and particularly of the way it is administered from this place. Of course, nothing demonstrates the conservative nature of Australian education and university management better than a glance at the representation of students on the governing bodies of Australian universities. According to last year&#39;s report of the Vice-Chancellor&#39;s Committee, Adelaide University, as becomes that stronghold of establishmentism and conservatism, does not have student representation. The Australian National University will have 2 student members out of a total membership of  41.  The Flinders University will have 1 representative - a big advance. James Cook University in Queensland will have 2 students who will be admitted as observers. We would not want the danger of letting these students have a vote. It is heartening to see that La Trobe University and Melbourne University - the stronghold of freedom, progress and the militant approach to these things - have 4 student members. Monash University has only a couple. Other universities such as New England, New South Wales and so on have single representatives. In fact, as I think my col le age from the other side pointed out, representation of this sort is bare))&#39; representation at all. Even the most skilled of us here, even the most hardened sufferers under majority domination, find it difficult to have an effective say when there is only one of you and 40 against you. </para>
          <para>I think we ought to put ourselves in the place of the student. No matter how much the student is vigorous and dynamic in his student body, when he turns up in the council of the university he is amongst people many for whom he has a great deal of respect for their intellectual capacity and many of whom be may regard as unduly conservative. However, he is bound to have some sort of respect for them. How can such a student get the views of his student body across? We are speaking of student bodies of Australia representing 100,000 students. In Australia we have about IS or 20 student representatives on the governing bodies. It is worth while putting on record what the students of the Australian National University had to say in talking about what the council itself had said. I would not regard the council as being the most revolutionary, militant and progressive body in Australia either. The students said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>But the rebuff is seen within the University as even more important than the mere rejection of further student representation, though the seriousness of this is great enough. The whole so-called autonomy&#39; of the University is held up to ridicule by this decision. </para>

          <para class="block">I would like the Minister to explain exactly upon what criteria he is operating when he says: &#39;J know better than the council of the university&#39;. Of course, a number of members of the council are representatives of the Ministry - they are appointed by the Ministry. What are the great intellectual attainments, achievements and capacities of the Minister who says: &#39;I know better than all of this council&#39;. I do not have the names of the members of the council with me now. While the Minister has established his reputation in some fields 1 doubt whether even he would claim that he has this final touch over all of the assembled body of which 2 members of this House are members. It will he worth while the Minister explaining why he or perhaps his advisers in the Department of Education and Science  -  I am not too sure whether he is the creature of his advisers or whether they are the implementers of his policy - have followed this course. However, someone along the line has said, and the Minister is prepared to implement it, that what the council of the university has said cannot be adopted. </para>

We are talking of people who are of a mature age; people who can be asked to accept all kinds of responsibilities in the community. Yet we think it would be dangerous to have 3 or 4 such people on a council of 40. I do not believe that the Minister feels this way at all. I would be very interested to get into the back of his mind or the minds of his advisers to see whether they think this is good enough. i believe that the under-graduate student body of the Australian National University now numbers between 3,000 or 4,000. In fact, a couple of representatives of the nature proposed in the legislation is almost non-existent representation. I would again make a plea, as has my friend the honourable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Beazley),</inline> that part time and external students ought to have some say in the system. A university is terribly important to the people who go through it. A remarkable and alarming number drop out for all sorts of reasons. They do not see the point of it. Therefore, participation in a representative capacity is more than just where it fits into the academic scheme. We have relations between the student body and the general management. Of course, management is supposed to use the term &#39;the government and the governed&#39;. One has to accept the fact that there are some people who will have to run such an institution. It is said that this institution does not belong to the students because the community itself subsidises the university system very heavily. Therefore the system of the relationship between the students, the staff and the whole body of the university has to be developed. Representation is a very important feature of our life. It is the way in which we manage most affairs. Participation is another important feature. It is unfortunate that the House has not had a greater opportunity to look at this in depth. With the increasing role of universities in Australian life and with the increasing number of students and the disappointment of people who cannot get into universities this may well be another field in which the House could do something such as was done by the House of Commons when it set up a select committee to examine this matter. </para>
          <para>I am critical of the Minister in this regard. 1 believe he is being unduly conservative. In fact, he has turned back to feudal times. He is being quite feudal about this. Even 300, 400 or 500 years ago universities were a little more democratically controlled although discipline then was perhaps a little more rigorous when one did break the rules. I believe that we must find some way in which more people can be brought into this. There has to be a great deal more thinking. Perhaps the precedent established by the House of Commons might be well worthy of consideration. A lot of people have had a lot to do with universities in one way or another either as students or as people who pay for students or people who have been members of the council. Some members of this House have been on university staffs. I am sure that they could bring some expertise to bear from which even the Minister, steeped as he is in the exaltation of his own position, might gain something. </para>

            <para>
              <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr Speaker,</inline>two of the three speakers who preceded me in this debate are members of the Council of the University under discussion and therefore, I think, might be considered to have a fairly special interest in this subject and perhaps even to be listened to with more intent than the honourable member for Wills <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bryant)</inline> or myself. Nevertheless, I wish to take leave to join issue with them and with the honourable member for Wills on some of what they had to say. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>We are discussing the question of raising the Council membership of the Australian National University from 38 members to 41 members. Might I say at this stage that I think that we have before us questions of principle and of practice. </para>
          <para>The question of principle on which 1 would join some slight issue, I think, with the Minister for Education and Science <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr N. H. Bowen),</inline> as have the honourable members who have spoken before me, is that of declining to accept the proper judgment of the now Council of the University. I think that if that judgment can be accepted at any stage, it should be so. 1 think that, in general, it is unfortunate if we need to exercise our will in an opposite direction. At the same time, this Parliament is substantially, if not entirely, responsible ultimately for the structure of this university, unlike the others in the country, and I think that it must remain to the Government to exercise its judgment on matters of this kind. </para>
          <para>If we are talking about something which is a specifically academic issue, I would find it abhorrent - I notice with some slight pleasure that the Minister has agreed with me - and I would say that it was quite unethical and a transgression of the rights of the University if we were to join issue on a specifically academic matter. But this, surely, is not so. It is a matter of structure of the administration of the University. </para>
          <para>Having made that point which I believe to be one of principle in the broad, I would like to talk about the practice. I believe that a number of red herrings have been drawn across the trail or, if not red herrings, in fact some misconstructions have been presented notably by my friend, the honourable member for Wills, but also constructions with which I do not agree have been put forward by the honourable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Beazley)</inline> and, perhaps to a lesser extent, by my colleague from Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr MacKellar).</inline> They spoke - one or all of them - as if the addition of one or two more students - in fact, it is one student who is being knocked back, as it were - to the Council would change the situation entirely. They spoke as if this would change the situation from one where it is suggested that the student body <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> being rebuffed and not trusted to one in which the student body is seen to be trusted intimately and in which no problem remains. I do not see it that way. </para>
          <para>I think that what we need to look at is this: A body of 38 is to be extended to 41 which, in my view, already becomes well nigh unmanageable in terms of efficient committee organisation. The question is: Who should be added? I would like to put this into context. I think that, if we are talking about the people who importantly should be added to this body, the people to whom I would look first are the sub professorial representatives. I, at one stage of my young existence, had the benefit of the experience of being on a university council as such a person - a sub professorial representatives - for 2 years. There is no doubt whatsoever in my mind - whether or not I had been in that position - that the more important addition to this Council are the 2 extra sub-professorial members. </para>
          <para>Now, it may be regarded by the honourable member for Wills and some other people as a somewhat conservative and even archaic notion - no, I do the honourable member for Wills wrong; he said something to this effect - to believe that a university is in fact a community of scholars. Some people do not believe this any more. But, if it is, a university is a community of people of all ranks and grades who have proved their scholastic worth, more or less, and who join at certain times with the administrative echelons to run an academic institution. </para>
          <para>By definition, the people who are there to learn scholarship are not already scholars. They may be coming along very well in the making. Therefore, we must look at the reasons for student membership of the Council. The reasons are good reasons but, basically, they are reasons, as I see the situation, which involve a 2-way play of information. They enable the student body to put its views and its slant upon any decision which is being made by the governing body, that is, the Council. They enable that Council officially, formally and with due writing to transmit through the student body representative or representatives the reasons for certain decisions being taken and so on. </para>
          <para>There has not been any suggestion either in this legislation or by the people who so far have spoken to the Bill that any attempt should be made to have the student body in such a situation that its representatives were remotely in a position to out-vote for example the professorial nominated members, the Governor-General&#39;s nominees, the Convocation&#39;s nominees and so on. So, it is a question of representation for the transmission of information and attitudes as well as, if honourable members like, judgments; but it is not a question of out-voting. The acceptance of an extra undergraduate representative in no way would have made any difference to that situation. </para>
          <para>Tn fact, it could be said that the views of the students would be represented adequately by, let us say, the  president  of their representative council or whatever it is called. It therefore seems to me that much the more important additions really in terms of practical academics is the adding of sub-professorial representatives. </para>
          <para>Still, it is true - and I agree with the honourable member for Wills on this point - that we in Australia are conservative in this matter. As far as I know - I may be a little bit out and I may even have the names wrong - the most progressive, if honourable members like, the most enlightened and the most permissive liberal representation of any governing body that I can recall is at the University of Sussex in which the University&#39;s statutes say something to the effect that not more than one-third of the council of the university or its equivalent shall be of professors. In other words, the non-professorial or sub professorial staff has a major say in the governing of that quite new institution. </para>
          <para>We are a far cry from that position. But I would argue, without I hope being dubbed the greatest conservative of all time, that on a body of this size the acceptance of a total of 3 student representatives - one a graduate student in effect, one the  president  of the governing body of students and one another student - is not a bad representation to enable the situation which I have outlined as 1 see it to exist. This is a situation in which the transmission of attitudes and information is possible and even is formalised. </para>
          <para>There is - and people have tended to overlook this fact - on that governing body a sector whereby the Convocation can have 4 representatives out of the total of 38 which is to be increased by this legislation to 41. We are in the process of passing a Bill to provide that these people shall not need to have 3 years standing. They can be - I know that it is unlikely, but they can be - graduates of immediate succession. In other words, it would be possible, however unlikely, that the Convocation could put forward 4 immediate graduates onto the governing body of the University. So, it is very hard to see how one can properly argue that the views of undergraduate students, of research students and of newly graduated people will be overlooked. </para>
          <para>A great deal of this, as of any system, depends on the worth of the operators. What I am really talking about is the structure. If the operators have it in mind not to listen to properly put views, decently reasoned arguments and so on, no system will make the position better. But it seems to me that, given the goodwill of the operators - and that is almost to be expected in a situation such as this - this structure is not one which is inimical to the rights of the undergraduates. </para>
          <para>One could dilate and broaden this argument very greatly indeed, lt has been implied, 1 think by some of the previous speakers, that this raises the whole question of youth and student representation in particular. Of course, this is a major issue of debate in the world as of the last 2 or 3 years, lt is not true to say however that the structure which is here being revised or modified shows a lack of trust in students, shows a disinclination to listen to their views or anything of that kind. In fact, the contrary is true. But I would maintain the conservative view that essentially the same outlook applies to people in training as that which applies to those at much lower levels of education - about which we could argue at some length - involving essentially the  comprehensive and even sub-comprehensive views of education and the suggestion that people who know not very much may. by sitting around in circles of their own number, pool their joint ignorance and thereby learn a great deal. Having not so terribly long since been an undergraduate in two or three universities, although the time moves on, I submit that basically students are at a university to learn and to offer what views they develop from that learning as they go along. There is no case to answer about having any very substantial student representation, although it would have been a nice sop or, even better than that, perhaps a nice acquiescence if in fact the Government or the Minister had not seen fit to drop one undergraduate representative from the Council. </para>
          <para>I do not want to raise the whole issue of student power and student representation in institutions such as universities at large. I think 1 have indicated briefly the relative conservatism of my view. I believe that basically it is not doing students a great favour to take ever increasing numbers of their body on to the ultimate governing body of an institution such as a university for the purpose of making them feel they have power. Unless they have a potential majority of votes, they do not have power; they have only the appearance of power. In fact they have representation. That is what they should have; that is what they do have. That is what they can best use, and I believe that for the time being representation on the Council of students, as distinct from the sub-professorial staff, to whom I have referred earlier and whom I regard as being on such a body as this by right, can properly be regarded as a matter of grace and not necessarily as a right, because the students are there to learn at least because they know somewhat less than the people who are there to teach them, although you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> and others might disagree with that viewpoint. </para>

            <para>- I am a bit on the side of most of the speakers tonight but I disagree with the honourable member for Denison <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Solomon).</inline> I am rather surprised at his reaction to the advice given by the Council of the Australian National University. I take it that the Council is hardly a revolutionary body. 1 should guess that most of the nominees would be well and truly acceptable to the establishment in all respects. I cannot understand the terrible fear which gripped the heart of the honourable member for Denison when he saw the recommendation from the Council that 2 more students should be added to the Council. </para>

              <para>-  I wonder whether the honourable member for Denison had in his mind some picture that with one more student representative on the Council the numbers would be completely the way of the students. Of course that is not the position, and I do not think he would really think that. I do not understand why he chose to ignore the advice of the body that is basically responsible for running the University. I know that the honourable member for Denison has said that it is our responsibility to determine the administration of the Australian National University. I will grant that. But since most of us are not experts in this field, I should have thought that we would have been prepared to take the advice of the group of people we have determined should be running the institution. I do not agree with the honourable member for Denison that students are at universities just to shut up and learn and to have facts and figures shoved into their heads. They are there to question, to argue and to disagree. They are there to think about not just the narrow confines of the subject they are there to study in order to get a degree; they are there to think about all that involves the living of a university. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I think that perhaps the increasing student unrest throughout the world is a sign that students are becoming more responsible regarding this aspect of university life. It has very little to do with the actual attainment of a degree. Unfortunately, that is all we ever hear about most of the time. I think that it would add to the confidence of the student body and would increase the students&#39; sense of belonging to and participating in the university if they had more say in the running of the university. I agree that the university staff also should have more say, which was essentially the point made by the honourable member for Denison. If we feel that the number of representatives on the Council is becoming too large - I will grant that 41 people is a lot for rational discussion - perhaps we can afford to cut off some of the fuddy-duddies on the Council. I refer to some of the people who have been there for many years or the more senior members of the Council. Often they are businessmen or even heads of departments who have grown old and rusty in their outlook on this responsibility. I think that more than ever universities need to be alive to the problems facing this community and they need to have a more resilient approach. They have to be prepared to take new departures, and this is not a facility that older people have. So for these reasons I join with the other honourable members who deplore the fact that the Government has chosen not to take the advice of the University Council and has in essence put only one more student on the Council. I admit that this is not such a revolutionary thing anyway, but that is all the more reason why the gesture of accepting the recommendation of the Council would have been so valuable. </para>

            <para>- in reply - I would like first to express my appreciation of the reasoned and constructive speeches which honourable members have made during this debate on the amendment to the Act governing the Australian National University. But underlying the remarks of a number of honourable members was the implicit thought that there was something inherently wrong in the Government, which has the responsibility for running the Australian National University, rejecting the  recommendation of the Council of the University as to its own membership. I reject that implied suggestion by honourable members. I do not think that on a question of the structure of the Council the Government automatically is bound by the Council&#39;s recommendation as to its structure. </para>

              <para>- But that was implied. On the other hand, 1 want to make it quite clear that at all times the Government would treat with the greatest of respect any recommendation that came from the Council of the University. But to suggest that the Government, having the responsibility, could not review or reject a recommendation would be wrong. As the honourable member for Denison <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Solomon)</inline> pointed out, it is not a matter affecting the administration of the University or its academic position. It is the structure of the University for which we are responsible. </para>

Lest it be thought that this is a common pattern in Australia, I think that to put the matter in its perspective 1 should state to the House just what the current position is in the universities of Australia. The number of student representatives ranges from 1 to 3. </para>

              <para>- Three is the maximum. Some of the larger universities including the University of Sydney, the University of New South Wales and the University of Queensland, have only 1 student representative. A number of the smaller ones also have only 1 representative.

              <para>- Order! 1 would suggest to the honourable member for Wills, who is interjecting, that he restrain himself. He has interrupted the Minister on 3 occasions since the Minister began to speak. I had to warn him previously about interjecting. In fairness to the House, to the Minister and to honourable members interested in the debate, the honourable member for Wills should restrain himself, and I suggest that he does so. </para>

              <para>- lt is true that there are 2 universities which have 2 student representatives on their governing bodies. These are Monash University and the James Cook University. There are 3 which have 3 student representatives. These are the University of Melbourne, La Trobe University and the University of Western Australia. I think that one honourable member suggested that La Trobe University had 4 undergraduate representatives. It has 3 undergraduate representatives plus 1 graduate representative. As we are not including the graduate representative in our discussion of the Australian National University the comparison is 3 as against 2. This is the picture in Australia and I think that this amendment to the Act in fact very greatly liberalised the position in the Australian National University, not only in increasing the number of student representatives from 1 to 2 but also in reducing the age from 21 years to 18 years, in providing that graduates do not have to be of 2. years standing but may be elected immediately on graduation and so on. </para>

          <para>Broadly speaking I think that honourable members who have spoken would be in favour of the advances in this Bill but would consider that in this one respect they do not go far enough. 1 would like to make some comment on this question of student representation. The Government considers that what it has approved in liberalising the student and graduate representation on the Council will in fact give appropriate representation to the various interests. The present size of the Council is, as honourable members know, 41  -  a very large and unwieldy body for discussion - and the Government considers this is large enough. It is a number which should only be increased for very strong reasons. In the Government&#39;s view in a, council as large as this one the strength of the representation of the students will depend not upon the number - because 3 would not have a much greater proportion of 42 votes than would 2 of 41  -  but on the quality of the representatives. Anyone who has been on one of these bodies knows that it is really the quality of the representation rather than the numbers which counts for strength of representation in the councils of such a body. </para>
          <para>I think therefore that the Government&#39;s view, reflected in this Bill, is a proper and responsible approach to the constitution of the Council at this time. Nevertheless, I have listened with care to what has been put. I did, when announcing the Government&#39;s decision, say that we would keep the position under review and consider the performance of these students on the Council and if I came to the conclusion at a later point of time that the number should be increased, then I would not hesitate to review the matter. In maintaining it under consideration I will certainly have in mind what honourable members have said during the course of the debate this evening. I suggest, however, that we should not hold up what are very beneficial advances embodied in this Bill. </para>

            <para>- The Opposition does not oppose this Bill but offers criticism of the paucity of its provisions, the delay in its introduction and the failure of the Government adequately to conceive of. the modern trends in the world of banking. In terms of mechanics this Bill merely repeals section 88 of the Bills of Exchange Act and substitutes in its place proposed sections 88b to 88e inclusive. It is true that finance is government and, of course, this Government typically justifies the old saying of &#39;a mountain in labour which has brought forth the proverbial mouse&#39;. The Government&#39;s thinking is outmoded. It is living in an economic and intellectual backwater. Quite a number of years ago the Manning Committee brought down a very substantial report. It adequately and conscientiously covered the whole field of cheques and bills of exchange. It went so far as to draft a new Cheques Act which it suggested might be considered by the Government. Of course the Government with its usual Fabian concepts and modes of behaviour has failed to do anything about it. For what the Bill is worth it merely deals with some of the mechanics of handling cheques payable to order. </para>

              <para>- Very substantial, of course, in terms of the mechanics of banking and the number of tellers to be employed. There will conceivably be a quite substantial saving to the trading banks. We do not disapprove of this but we offer very strong criticism of the absence of legislation relating to the crossing of cheques and also the absence of a new Cheques Bill. As a matter of fact, as the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hughes)</inline> mentioned, the general law relating to Bills of Exchange originated way back in the year 1882 because our Bills of Exchange Act as it now stands is based substantially upon that measure. On the mechanics of the handling of cheques payable to order I repeat the comment made by the Attorney-General that of some 800 million cheques issued annually in Australia about a quarter were order cheques and at least three-quarters of all cheques that were drawn were deposited to the credit of the payee. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The most that this Bill does is to say that if a cheque payable to order is paid into the account of the payee there is no obligation on the teller to examine the endorsement on the back of the cheque or even to check if there is an endorsement. In the case of a cheque presented over the counter for payment where it is payable to order there is still an obligation on the banker. In respect of a collecting banker there is, of course, an obligation to check an endorsement but again there is an exemption offered to the paying banker, and we do not disapprove of that. But we do say that the Government is about 20 years behind the times in its whole approach to banking. A cheque is, of course, a bill of exchange drawn on a banker and bills of exchange have a very long history. There is perhaps a very rudimentary form of a bill market in Australia and it is time that the Government considered stimulating a true bill market, because if one takes the example of the English financial system the rate of discount for bills of exchange is the main economic regulator of the British economy. It could well be done in this country. A bill of exchange is a very potent and valuable weapon and a very good means for a government actually to control the credit on issue in a country. </para>
          <para>In more general terms this Government has completely failed since the early 1950s to prevent the gradual filching of the control of the credit system of the country that is taking place by the hire purchase system and by the fringe banking system - the grey banking system as it is called - and more recently it has completely failed to control the advent of merchant banks from overseas. Wherever there is a honey pot one will find the flies gathering. I do not disapprove of the Government&#39;s policy of restricting the number of banking charters. We quite agree with that. One of the main characteristics of banking in the last 20 years has been the gradual diminution of the number of trading banks and so far as I am concerned - and I speak for the Opposition - they are reputable, well administered, sound and conscientious organisations. But if one examines the total advances of the hire purchase system today one will find that they almost equal those of the banking system. </para>
          <para>That is due to the decision of the Government in the early 1950s to curtail the extent to which trading banks could discount the promissory notes and hire purchase agreements offered as security by various finance companies. When they were told there was a limit to the credit available to them they decided to thumb their noses at the Government and to go on to the open market and borrow directly from the public. That decision resulted in the distorted interest rates which prevail in this country today. This situation is nothing short of a major scandal. </para>
          <para>I particularly want to draw the attention of the Government to a decision of the High Court of Australia given 57 years ago. I refer to a case in the High Court between the Commissioners of the State Savings Bank of Victoria and Per me wan, Wright and Co. Ltd in which it was held:   . . that the essential characteristics of banking were the collection of money by receiving deposits on loan, repayable when and as agreed upon, and the utilisation of the money so collected by lending it again in such sums as were required. A majority held further that it was not necessary, in order to bring a banker within the Bills of Exchange Act that he should as part of his business collect cheques for, or pay the cheques of, his customers. </para>
          <para class="block">In other words, that definition exactly fits the functions of the average hire purchase company in Australia today. Those companies are not dealing merely with hire purchase. They are usurping the functions of banking. Every form of credit must be brought under the control of the Banking Act and under the control of the national government. The power is there. Let the Government use it if it will because the activities of these organisations today are responsible for the record rate of interest being paid on long term loans that are being raised by this Government. The only way to curb this is to place these institutions under control. </para>
          <para>Perhaps one of the least satisfactory aspects of the banking system today is the participation by the major trading banks in subsidiary hire purchase companies. There is an old motto that if you cannot beat them, join them. Under the circumstances I suppose that there is some justification for this participation by the trading banks but the sooner we place the control of all credit back in the banking system the better for all concerned. I do not suggest that these fringe banking organisations should be given full banking charters but I do say that they ought to be brought in under a secondary charter and placed in a subordinate capacity. Equally today we find merchant banks coming in- </para>

              <para>- I accept your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> and I pass on to another point. In terms of banking techniques we are faced with a new age - the electronic age. The Government has yet to come to grips with all the implications proposed in electronic banking which will involve simultaneous transmission of transactions from a retail store to the bank where there will be an immediate cancellation on the account. It will also involve magnetic credit cards. The Government has not considered the implications of this new age. In addition the Government has failed to consider the activities of the trans-national companies which are the major corporations intruding in Australia today and which are completely bypassing the provisions of the Bills of Exchange Act. The technique used by these corporations is a simple one. When a major overseas banking company cannot get its charter in Australia it either forms a subsidiary or forms a suitable link with a known and reputable local company. It then proceeds to do everything in the way of banking with the exception of issuing cheques and dealing with bills of exchange. I do not propose to take up the time of the House any further. I commend my remarks to the serious consideration of the Government. </para>

            <para>- The honourable member for Cunningham <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Connor)</inline> expounded to the House, with some personal variations his favourite area of orthodox Socialist theories which we have heard on a number of occasions. The honourable member suggested that Australia ought to try to set up a bills of exchange market comparable with that in London to control the credit issues of this country. He displayed little understanding of the conduct of monetary procedures in the London market, of the huge resources there which have been built up by vast dealings, being as it is at the crossroads of international trade in Europe, and having a very long and traditional evolution; a system that has operated for over  1,000  years in an area which is the hub and base of the sterling bloc. The honourable member&#39;s comments are just glib commentary on the monetary and fiscal control in Australia. Surely he is aware of the difficulty of obtaining in Canberra, even if it were the desire of the Government, necessary constitutional powers which would never be given by the people of Australia. This has been demonstrated time and time again. Even if it were to happen, honourable members on this side of the House know that it would stack le development finance in this country, and lock out and drive away prospects. It is a proposal for part of the dead hand of Socialism. </para>

          <para>The main purpose of this Bill is to deal with part of an estimated  800  million cheques used in Australia per annum. It is estimated that  200  million of those cheques are order cheques and  2  million are dishonoured annually because of lack of endorsement or irregular endorsement. It is further estimated that  1,500,000  are cheques which are endorsed cheques deposited to the credit of the payee. This Bill provides that endorsement of those cheques need not in the future be made. Reference has been made to the report of the committee appointed by the Government to review the Bills of Exchange Act. The report dated 1st May 1964 at page 17, in relation to the subject of this Bill states: </para>
          <list type="decimal-dotted">
            <item label="99.">
              <para>There is  no  doubt that a  great  deal of unproductive work is involved for  the  recipients of cheques and for banks as a result  of the  need for  indorse men  of cheques without very much, if any, useful purpose being served. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">That report also states:   the Committee is of the opinion that an amendment to the Act reducing the need for indorsements would affect a worthwhile saving of time, effort and cost. </para>
          <para class="block">For those reasons I support with enthusiasm the provisions of this Bill and I am sorry that it was not introduced earlier. There is a rather striking quotation in that report at page 5 which repeats some of the provisions of an English report on the subject and 1 think this graphically displays the position. The quotation is a passage from a letter which was sent in by a witness. lt reads: </para>

            <para>As Secretary of this Company, I spend 15 to 30 minutes daily endorsing cheques.

I often delegate it to my assistant and I am contemplating delegating it to the office boy which proves the unimportance of this work. </para>

          <para class="block">As has been pointed out by the honourable member for Cunningham and by the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hughes),</inline> a great deal of time is spent within banks in returning cheques which are either not endorsed or are insufficiently or inaccurately endorsed. 1 believe that it should be an interest of this Parliament to consider in the provisions of Bills the achievement of simplicity and standardisation. In this context and in the context of this Bill it is not too much to say that this country needs now, and will need increasingly in the future, to find ways and means to cut unnecessary accounting and book-keeping procedures where there is an unjustifiable cost - or where the cost is greater than the benefit - because that is a charge on the Australian economy and we ought to seek ways in the public and the private sectors of minimising such costs. 1 have had some number of years&#39; experience as a practising chartered accountant and I believe that there is too much detailed book-keeping in this country, some of it required by the provisions of Acts of Parliament, much, of it traditional. Too many people are engaged in tertiary employment. We should seek ways and means of providing simplified procedures - encouraging a reduction - which we should seek progressively. That is a wide subject on which 1 will, develop on a more appropriate occasion. I believe it is a matter of some regret that the Manning Committee&#39;s proposed Cheques Act has not yet been enacted. The report was dated 1st May 1964. It was tabled in this House on 12th October 1965. This first step which we have before us tonight takes place in 1971. The Cheques Act with the other provisions are still awaited. </para>
          <para>The draft Bill which is the main appendix to the Manning Committee&#39;s report contains many recommendations. I cannot make specific reference to all of them but I would like to refer to paragraph 72 which refers to the crossing of cheques and states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The making of cheques payable to &#39;order&#39; when crossed with the words &#39; &#39;account payee only&#39; seems to the Committee to constitute an ambiguous and contradictory instruction to both the collecting and the paying bank, in that, on the one hand, banks are told that the cheque is to be lodged only to the credit of the payee&#39;s account and, on the other hand, that the cheque may be paid to the order of the payee, that is, to another person. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Many large companies operating in this country issue cheques in exactly that way: The report contains many recommendations apart from those which are the subject of this Bill. Entirely different subjects are covered in paragraphs 44, 60, 67, 87, 89-9.1, 164-5, 170, 193, 194-5, 201-2, 203-4, 229 and 231. One may well ask what is the reason for the delay. I can find only one reference to it. In the main it is in answer to a question which I asked over a year ago. I was advised that there was a number of developments in banking techniques, in particular dealing with advancement in the use of computers. But that has been going on for many years and it will continue to go on for many years. I do not know where the delay exists, whether it is in the consultation with the trading banks or whether it is within the departments concerned. </para>
          <para>I do not criticise the present Minister. Indeed, I expressly exclude him from these remarks and compliment him on introducing this measure which rightly makes the major reform and a significant saving in time wasting procedures in commercial activity. 1 urge the Attorney-General to press forward, in the haste called for after a delay of 6 or 7 years&#39; consideration, with the early introduction of an Australian Cheques Act which can, of course, be amended from time to time to take account of changing banking techniques which develop. </para>

            <para>- in reply - I shall reply very briefly to the contributions that have been made by the honourable members who have spoken in this debate. I accept the plea of urgency that has been made by the honourable member for Cunningham <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Connor)</inline> and by my colleague on this side of the House, the honourable member for Curtin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Garland).</inline> There is no opposition to the terms of the Bill. The complaint that is made is that the Government has not pressed ahead fast enough with a comprehensive Cheques Bill in terms of the recommendations of the Manning Committees report. This is an enormously complicated subject. Throughout 1970, and indeed up to the present time since 1 made my second reading speech on 19th May last year, substantive discussions have been taking place between officers of my Department and representatives of the banks concerning the contents of a comprehensive Cheques Bill. I can understand that there is some impatience at what would appear at first sight to be an inordinate delay in this field. When the facts are examined fully it will be seen that the delay is by no means unforgivable and is by no means as inordinate as it is made to appear. </para>

          <para>At the present time we are witnessing almost kaleidoscopic developments in the fields of automation and electronic data processing, lt is with the developments of this kind, fast as they have been occurring, that the discussions between officers of my Department and the banks have been concerned. The position has now been reached where I would anticipate, according to the information given to me, that instructions on most of the matters that have been discussed through 1970 between the representatives of the banks and officers of my Department can be given to the Parliamentary Counsel for the drafting of the desired legislation. The legislation is desired as much by me as by the honourable members who have spoken in this debate. The whole problem is by no means as simple as it might be thought at first sight to be. I can assure the honourable members who have made valuable contributions to this debate that I will continue to keep the matter under my close attention with a view to getting legislation of the kind we all want to see into the House as soon as possible. I hope that the honourable member for Cunningham will not think me guilty of any discourtesy if I do not follow him by answering some of the broader matters that he sought to raise, because during his speech I rather took the hint from you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> that if 1 were to do so my contribution would not be altogether welcome to you.

            <para>-  I move the following amendment: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>That all words after &#39;That&#39; be omitted with a view lo inserting the following words in place thereof: whilst not refusing to give the Bill a second reading this House condemns the Government for the delay in providing a comprehensive programme of migration education, adequate finance facilities and capital equipment, including buildings. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The provisions of this legislation were outlined fully in a preliminary statement by the Minister for Immigration <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> to the House on 23rd April 1970 and have been further detailed in his second reading speech. In these circumstances, it is hardly necessary for me to reiterate them in detail. Broadly speaking, however, they provide for an expansion of the migrant education programme for adults and children before and after arrival in Australia, in co-operation with the State education authorities. The Commonwealth is to provide the cost of teachers, certain capital equipment, text books, supervisory assistance, and allowances for migrants studying certain courses, and will give incentives to industry to assist in the educational programme. </para>
          <para>The Opposition is not opposed to the general principles of the scheme as we are well aware of the fact that the basis of successful integration or assimilation is communication. Without a knowledge of the language migrants are not only at a distinct disadvantage in respect of employment but also their general participation in community activities and our way of life is denied to them if they are unable to speak and understand our language. The importance of education in the English language to the migrant - adult and child - has been stressed by responsible authorities and migrant organisations ever since the commencement of the scheme, and particularly in more recent years. Successive Immigration Conventions and the Immigration Advisory Council have confirmed that the great barrier to assimilation and integration is the failure of the migrant to speak English and expressed the view that there is a real need for the teaching of the English language at every level for assimilation, social and economic reasons. </para>
          <para>As the amendment indicates, the Opposition is far from satisfied with the educational programme to date. It is not so much a criticism of what has been or is being done for migrants in this regard but rather that a more comprehensive scheme has been delayed so long, particularly in view of the constant urging by conventions and immigration authorities. This measure, which is by no means the be-all and end all of the matter, is belated and a long time overdue. </para>
          <para>At this stage I pose a few questions in respect of the subject, and some constructive criticisms of the Department and its activities in this field. Firstly, having in mind the Government&#39;s sustained drive for migrants, has this aspect of migration been neglected, or at least, has the Department not been insistent enough in the priority that should be given to migrant education? </para>
          <para>Provision of educational services to enable adult migrants to learn the English language began in 1947 in the opening days of post-war immigration schemes or, if I may say so, in the infancy of the programme. Since that time, great changes have taken place in the immigration programme, such as increased numbers, differing types of migrants and methods of transport. The fact that more than 50 per cent of the 700,000 migrants requiring instruction in English discontinued the classes would seem to present proof that a new and stimulating approach was needed in this field. These figures should have been an indication to the Department that the programme was falling short of what was required, particularly as lack of communication by language is accepted as the great barrier to citizenship and assimilation. It was evidently not until about 1967 or 1968 that the real seriousness of the situation dawned on the Government and with it the need to provide a scheme whereby the children in schools and those adults whom I might term the waverers, or those who were not highly educated and were unable to learn English, needed a new and comprehensive scheme if they were to do so. This point of view is substantiated by the figures I mentioned earlier and by the fact that only about 22,000 or 23,000 at this date are enrolled in continuation classes, radio and correspondence courses throughout Australia. </para>
          <para>Surely, with this problem being stressed by immigration authorities everywhere, including citizenship conventions, advisory councils and other interested parties, a scheme might well have been expected at a much earlier date. Even now, under this scheme there are some glaring weaknesses which I shall show later. For instance, on the question of adult, education under these proposals, the casual migrant, as I shall call him, must be prepared to spend 5 hours a day for 6 weeks in the partly accelerated course at his own expense or 2 hours a week for a period of 18 months a,t a night school course if he desires to learn the language. This is a fairly tough proposal. It must be extremely doubtful, therefore, whether this large section of the migrant force, or a large percentage of it, will benefit by the scheme. When all is said and done, no matter what a person&#39;s educational capacity may be, it is essential that he learn the language of his adopted country. Many thousands of migrants have neglected to do this for many and varied reasons, lt has yet to be proved whether the incentive and the expansion of the educational programme as outlined will encourage them to do so. Since  1945  more than  2  million migrants have come to Australia. lt would be an interesting exercise to ascertain how many or what percentage have learned to speak English since their arrival. </para>
          <para>Secondly, at a time when every educational body in Australia - State, independent and university - is clamouring for additional teachers, schools and finance, where does the Government consider that the necessary number of teachers will be recruited? lt is estimated that the number of teachers required will be  300,  and this at a time when there is an acute shortage of skilled teachers in Australia. </para>
          <para>Classes are too big, classrooms are overcrowded and generally speaking the shortage of everything is acute. In fact, New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland are recruiting teachers from abroad. I am informed that  100  teachers will be required this year,  60  next year and  330  for the year  1971-72.  This is a very tall order at a time of acute teacher shortage, so the Minister might indicate what arrangements have been made to recruit them, what are the prospects of securing them, what are the qualifications necessary and what are the reactions of the educational authorities. </para>
          <para>Thirdly, what indication has been given that the migrants, whom I would describe as being :on the fringe&#39;, that is, those who have no special educational qualifications or inclination but who must know English for employment and other purposes, will be more interested than they have been previously in learning English. Probably the scheme is intended to appeal to them but in what way, as compared with the previous scheme, will it do so. On the surface, it will remain much the same as it is today. Information has already been given to the House that only  47  per cent of the  708,000  migrants who have come to Australia and attended pre-embarkation ship board, continuation or correspondence courses, have completed the course. Even in November  1969  only  14,840  migrants were enrolled in  1,050  continuation classes, and  7,780  migrants were taking combined radio and correspondence courses. In view of the number of migrants involved, these figures are by no means heartening. Will the position be improved under this scheme? </para>
          <para>How will this scheme appeal to this section of the migrant population who have neglected to learn English? What incentive is to be given to them? Most of them, no doubt, cannot afford to take time off from work and at night are either too tired or lack the inclination lo spend time to which they are no doubt unaccustomed for periods of  2  hours a week for  18  months. This is not an easy problem, but it certainly merits special attention. </para>
          <para>Has the Minister any idea as to what will be the response of industry to participation in the scheme? Will it co-operate? Will the lessons be given in the employers&#39; time or after work? This is important because I believe it will have a distinct bearing on the success or failure of the scheme. These are just a few of the questions one may ask. They are asked not in order to knock the proposals but more in an endeavour to ascertain the depth of the Government&#39;s investigations of this subject. </para>
          <para>I believe that it would be reasonable to ask industry to participate in a practical way in bringing a knowledge of the English language to this section of the migrant force. After all, industry has benefited a lot from the immigration programme. In fact, to my mind industry has had it on the cheap. It has been provided with employees - sometimes highly skilled - at little or no cost to it. This in turn has resulted in increased production and increased spending and purchasing power. T believe that industries employing large numbers of migrants should, at their own cost, provide classes in English. They should also encourage migrants to learn the language for safety and economic reasons, and it should be done at the employers&#39; expense during working hours. </para>
          <para>Industries might also provide some monetary incentive or additional leave, promotion or something of this nature as a further stimulus to overcome the language barrier. I understand that some industrial organisations already are co-operating and providing classes in English along the lines I have suggested, and the scheme might well be expanded. However, the scheme should cover the whole range of industry, and I suggest to the Minister that implementation of an extensive campaign throughout industry along the lines I have mentioned might bring success in the recruitment of migrants to English classes. Today, for a number of reasons, migrants discontinue their classes and their education in the English language. </para>
          <para>Comparatively recently two excellent surveys were conducted, one by the Department of Immigration in Canberra and the other by the New South Wales Department of Education, on the question of migrant education and the education of migrant children. These excellent reports, which are available to all and from which quotations have been made in the Parliament, referred to some of the problems confronting people who do not know the English language. I shall quote a few extracts from the reports broadly and quickly in the time available to me in order to give honourable members an idea of some of the problems which face this scheme and which must be overcome if the scheme is to be of great benefit. For instance, the report of the survey conducted by the New South Wales Department of Education in 1968-69 stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Migrant children performance in many subjects is affected by their language difficulties. </para>
            <para>The predominant groups of migrants with English difficulties are the Italians, Greeks, Yugoslavs - totalling 61 per cent of the sample. </para>
            <para>Of those with English difficulties 42 per cent come from homes where it is never spoken and 43 per cent sometimes. </para>
            <para>Comparison shows that a significant proportion of migrants with poor school progress came from homes where English is never spoken. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The report of the survey conducted by the Department of Immigration in Canberra stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Based on evidence from departmental surveys it would be reasonable to estimate that approximately one-third of foreign bom migrants would be unable to speak English. Applied to the foreign bom migrant population this would mean that some 240,000 migrants would benefit from English language instruction. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That shows the nature of the problem and also indicates that this legislation has to cover a wide field. The report of the survey conducted by the New South Wales Department of Education in 1968-69 on the question of education of migrant children also stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Incidence of migrant children in total school population is about 1 in 20 and of the 50,664 reported migrant pupils some 16,452 - 32 per cent - have some type of English language difficulty. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">One could quote at great length, from the report of the survey, which was an excellent one, because there are pages which deal with the problems facing these children and the problems which the Department of Education in New South Wales faces in providing education for these children. </para>
          <para>As I mentioned earlier, migrant children present a very difficult problem, and one of the most significant statements which have been made on this subject appears in an article by Carolyn Dowling. In an article entitled &#39;Seen But Not Heard&#39;, which was published in March 1968, she said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The passive, uncomprehending figure whose idleness and blank stare mar the most industrious of classes, is a more common sight, particularly in the lower forms of suburban high schools, than we care to admit. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That, as the Minister quite rightly pointed out, is one of the major- problems confronting us. The survey indicates the severe strain that has been placed on the educational system and on teachers in New South Wales and no doubt throughout Australia. It is difficult for a teacher to transmit knowledge to a child who has very little, if any, understanding of the English language. It is just as unfair to the children who, in many cases, while mentally more advanced that those who know and understand English are forced to languish in lower classes because of this disability. Of course, as I have mentioned, because of the conditions the teachers find the task well nigh impossible and can only do the best they can. </para>
          <para>The number of migrant children in schools runs into many thousands, as has been pointed out in these articles and as is indicated by the number of teachers to be recruited. It has certainly taken the Government a long time to realise how unfair it is to teachers, children and State authorities to bring non-English speaking migrants into the country in thousands and leave the full responsibility for their education at every level to State governments and independent schools. The need has been there for a long time and, very belatedly, the Government has evidently realised its responsibility but still bulks at the capital expenditure and at making more extensive grants to the authorities for educational purposes. increased education costs to the States because of the influx of migrant children has given rise in many quarters to the question whether our migration programme should be curtailed. That is one of the major reasons advanced by those who advocate that course. These remarks, critical though they may be, are offered constructively in the hope that the Opposition&#39;s views will result in improving the approach of the Government, both financially and practically, in the important field of migrant education. So important is language that  1  submit to the Government that migrant education should be encouraged by a wider range of activities in language and citizenship instruction, as appears to have been clone in Canada. For instance, in Canada classes for language instruction and courses in civic affairs have mushroomed and are conducted under various auspices, such as provincial departments of education, local school boards, service clubs, churches, welfare agencies, universities and ethnic groups. </para>
          <para>It is true that there are many variations in the degree, quality and intensity of the courses offered. Some offer education by trained teaching personnel. Others are of a sporadic nature and are guided by volunteers. However, iri spite of all the diversity, there is a common thread running through the courses offered and growing evidence of uniformity amongst all the programmes because of the liaison and help provided by officers of the Canadian Citizenship Branch. Without saying that Canada has the perfect system, surely it is an indication of how much could be done in Australia along these lines. A national campaign seeking the co-operation of voluntary organisations, industries, clubs, progress associations, churches and other sections of the community would be a forward step in the education of migrants. If necessary, some form of financial or material assistance could he given. </para>
          <para>Another factor that appears to be overlooked is that, I understand, approximately  60  per cent of the migrant* coming to Australia travel by air and the percentage might increase. This means that unless migrants have pre-embarkation instruction, they land in Australia without any knowledge at all of the English language. This is quite different from the days when practically all migrants travelled by ship and an education officer gave them instruction in the English language. Naturally this has accentuated the problem that we now face. </para>
          <para>Clause 3 of the Bill states:  capital equipment of an educational nature&#39; includes tape recording and playing equipment, but does not include any building. </para>
          <para class="block">This is undoubtedly one of the major weaknesses of the scheme, lt is in line with Government thinking on education generally, in that it fails to take into consideration the overcrowding and in many cases the non-existence of classrooms. Every education authority in the nation is clamouring for money for capital expenditure on buildings. There is nowhere to teach children in many schools, State and independent. Where are the educational classes proposed in this Bill to be assembled? What consideration has been given to the environment in schools for this type of teaching? lt is a specialised teaching requiring special facilities but, most importantly, it requires a suitable type of room. Is it to be expected that the teachers will lump all their equipment into the playground and teach under a tree, or will they teach on a verandah, in a weather shed or some other makeshift accommodation, because unless capital is available this is precisely what will happen? This appears to be the only way out for those who are short of capital. </para>
          <para>There can be no excuse whatever for the Government failing to provide funds for capital expenditure on buildings as part of this scheme. As it stands, it means that the Government reluctantly has accepted the fact that it has a responsibility to the children, the States and the teachers to provide some finance for the thousands of migrants who have been brought to Australia, but it is confining it to the very minimum and leaving the responsibility for finding additional capital to the States. This is not good enough, and this is why the Opposition has moved the amendment which indicates that the Government should provide funds for capital expenditure. </para>
          <para>The Minister estimates that the cost of the scheme over the next 4 years will total $16m, or $4m a year. The full cost of the migration scheme is extremely high. Only a small percentage will be spent on the education of migrants, yet this is generally accepted as the most important factor in their assimilation. Is it too much to ask that a substantial amount be made available for capital expenditure on buildings to alleviate this problem? Members of the Opposition believe that this should be the most important part of this legislation, quite apart from the provision of teachers, and unless the amendment is adopted we believe the scheme will fail. In his Ministerial statement of 23rd April 1970 the Minister said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Government recognises that the ability of migrants to communicate is fundamental to their successful integration. There are short and long term social and human benefits for the migrant and for the community in encouraging and providing the means for migrants to learn English. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Very few would disagree with this sentiment. The question is how do we achieve it and does the legislation now under discussion solve or at least make a major contribution towards this objective. As I have already indicated, I believe it is correct to say that while the legislation proposes an expansion of the present limited programme in the field of migrant education there are many gaps still to be plugged, as suggested by the amendment that 1 have moved. </para>
          <para>I have referred somewhat briefly to 2 major considerations in the migrant education problem. First, there are children to be considered and, secondly, adults. A few moments ago 1 quoted from a statement by Carolyn Dowling about migrant children. I believe it is a sound move to give specialised teaching in English in the classroom. This appears to be the ideal place within the school curriculum - in school hours, in school surroundings with the proper textbooks, equipment and environment. It gives the child the opportunity in the right atmosphere to learn the means of communication and fulfil his educational desires according to his capacity as times goes on. I think it is fair to ask the Minister how long it is expected that the classes will function until the child is competent in English. Also, what will be the ages of the children who will attend these classes It is more essential than ever that some form of teaching be introduced to the school when it is considered that the New South Wales survey on this problem revealed that about 47 per cent of the children come from homes where no English is spoken lt is probably true to say that this form of planning, when expanded, must prove of benefit to the child, and particularly to the harassed teacher who is endeavouring to transmit knowledge to a percentage of the class who simply do not know what is being said. The scheme will fail if the Government stints on finance for capital equipment and other essentials. </para>
          <para>Then there is the problem of the adults. Members of an Opposition parliamentary committee on immigration recently visited a centre where the intensive scheme was in progress. It was interesting to observe the people who were progressing favourably and quickly and to realise how lack of English had retarded their progress temporarily. One person we met was a dentist by profession but because of his lack of English he was working as a cleaner. A telecommunications technician was working as a kitchen hand. Another person undertaking this expanded course was a research technologist who was working as a laundry worker. Another was a horticultural i st but was presently occupied as a factory worker. I mention these people to indicate the effectiveness of the scheme. It is of value to these people whose experience could benefit this country. Until this intensive scheme was implemented they were denied the opportunity of pursuing their former occupations. This illustrates the need for the provision of proper educational facilities. </para>
          <para>Another problem concerns those migrant adults who vary in age from elderly grandparents or parents to those who left school immediately prior to their coming to Australia and who have probably had little or no schooling in their own country. They have no knowledge of English, no English is spoken in their homes and they drift into clubs or into an environment singularly of their own countrymen in the workshops and factories. They fraternise only with those speaking their own language, mainly for convenience and communication purposes. The number involved amounts to hundreds of thousands. The best figure to take is that percentage of the  708,000  mentioned by the Minister who have already received instruction. </para>
          <para>Does this legislation do anything to solve or relieve their problem? Is it  a  practical solution in the long term or is it an effort or contribution made hopefully to encourage them to participate in learning the language? Included in the adults are married women, many of whom do not go to work because of family circumstances. Their contact with English-speaking people is non-existent. How do they get on? Does this scheme propose  a  solution or an incentive for them? Jam inclined to think that it will not touch many of this group. It is appropriate to refer to the excellent report concerning the survey undertaken by the New South Wales Department of Education. It states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Reasons for delayed enrolment in courses were job commitments, lack of knowledge of courses, or just arrived in Australia. Students&#39; reasons for discontinuance were mainly too busy, shift work, overtime and mobility. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Men gave as their reasons for non attendance having  to  work too hard, laziness, overtime and fatigue. Women said that they were too busy at home or had family responsibility. About  97  per cent of the migrant students said they would like more opportunity to talk in English with Australian people. Many of these migrants may never attend an advanced course, perhaps because of lack of educational facilities. What effect does the Minister think that the present proposals will have on this type of migrant without incentives, including permission to attend courses during working hours? The migrants that I have mentioned must have  an  earnest desire to learn the language. They must have an incentive to improve their economic position. They must have  a  desire to integrate socially. They must find the time or be able to afford  to  learn the language either during the day or at night. </para>
          <para>I wonder whether any investigations have been made concerning what percentage of migrants in this category, or men and women over school age, really want to learn the language, and what is their intellectual capacity. The Minister has yet to state what effect the scheme will have on those I have mentioned and how many he expects will take advantage of it. Apart from those who really want to progress and learn the language because they are ambitious and anxious to succeed, I believe 2 factors stop people from educating themselves. Those with limited educational ability lack an incentive and they are incapable of finding time to attend classes. As I mentioned earlier, I believe that this problem could be overcome in respect of the men by their employers accepting more responsibility and enabling the men to attend classes in working time. Not only would this benefit the employer but it would make a satisfied citizen of the migrant concerned. To my mind the incentive scheme, in the case of adult men particularly, would appear to be the logical and practical way of achieving the best results. 1 feel that another method that might be applied - and no doubt it already has been to a great extent, but it could be more widely used - is an intensive publicity campaign among non-English speaking migrants on the need to learn the English&#39; language. Every form of available advertising should be used to impress upon these migrants prior to acceptance, embarkation on shipboard or on plane and on arrival how vital it is to learn English in order to enjoy a happy and successful life in Australia. Every industry, every bank, every public office or in fact any medium of publicity should be utilised with display signs impressing the need of migrants to communicate and learn English and advising them how they can go about it. Every migrant should be issued with a special brochure in the language he speaks setting out very clearly, but not too extensively the practical results to be achieved by being educated in the English language. (Extension of time granted). I thank the House and I will not take much longer. Whilst not criticising the objectives and the principles prompting the legislation on the education of migrants, I believe that there are still gaps through which countless thousands of migrants will escape the opportunity to learn English and participate in our community, economic and social life. </para>
          <para>Time does not permit me to go over the full range of them. This is set out in the documents which I mentioned earlier. The facts and figures are given. They show that many are suffering and failing to be assimilated into our community because of lack of knowledge of English. These figures are there for all to see and they indicate the major problem. This is a problem which must be faced: we believe it will not be adequately covered by this legislation. I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment moved on behalf of the Opposition in the spirit in which it is presented. It is an endeavour to offer a constructive approach to improving the education of adult and child migrants and to relieving the States of some of the responsibility for a national programme of immigration. We should accept our financial responsibility for education, housing and other matters. I offer this amendment as a constructive approach to improve the child and adult education of migrants brought to Australia in a scheme commenced 25 years ago which has always had the sympathy and support of honourable members on all sides of this Parliament. I hope the Minister will see fit to accept the amendment because I believe it will make a major contribution towards overcoming the difficulties in the education of migrants that I have mentioned during the course of my speech tonight. </para>

            <para>- A year ago I attended in Canberra an Australian Citizenship Convention which was one of a number of such meetings which have been held since the war. Two or 3 weeks ago I attended a meeting of the Australian Institute of Political Science which dealt with the subject of immigration. The first of those conferences dealt substantially with the problems of migrants as seen by various workers in the field of immigrant education and interest in the community. The most lasting impression that I got from that conference was of the difficulties faced by migrants in coping with the English language, most notably by those with least access to it, and particularly by migrant housewives. The main burden of the second conference which was held 2 or 3 weeks ago was in fact a discussion on the pros and cons - perhaps there were more cons than pros - of the migration programme long since conducted with joint party approval in this country. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I find it a little interesting that the honourable member for Grayndler <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Daly)</inline> in the new atmosphere produced by the second conference and just before and after it by newspaper and other comment relating thereto, has now discovered that the Government, if I read him aright, has done too little too late in the field of migrant education. I do not complain that he has found it. After all, he is in a position where he should be finding such information. In the main I compliment him on one of the more constructive speeches which I have heard him make in this House in intent if not entirely in execution. Indeed, I will agree with two or three of the suggestions he made. Nevertheless, the suggestion is that we have perhaps with some complacence but certainly with considerable agreement across the board or across the floor of this House and elsewhere in the community conducted a programme of immigration which has made various gestures and various activity projects to inculcate into migrants the best understanding that seems possible in a given time of the English language, whereby they could better be assimilated - 1 think the word is now integrated - into the community. As people who have listened to the honourable member for Grayndler will know, this is a vast enterprise. It is a very considerable operation to find out how, why and where we can best conduct the education of people not specifically brought up in the same means of communication as ourselves. Perhaps we should be glad that it is their problem at that stage rather than ours. It is very difficult sometimes to make oneself understood in someone else&#39;s parlance. </para>
          <para>The proposition before the House is quite a comprehensive one. As the Minister for Immigration <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> mentioned in his second reading speech there are 2 or 3 major aspects of this educational programme. There are the question of educating migrant children, the question of the extension and improvement of adult education in one or more parts of the world, and the question of an intensive language course for migrants better versed in some skill or other who possibly are already acquainted with the rudiments of the English language and are better able to comprehend an intensive course than are others. Some facts of the matter have already been adduced by the honourable member for Grayndler and the Minister at an earlier stage. I do not want to go over those unnecessarily. But the situation certainly is clear. About 26 per cent of 3.1 million gross arrivals - some of course have returned home in the interim - between 1945 and 1969 have been under 15 years of age. So there would appear to be immediately a prima facie case for very considerable child education in the English language for migrant children. Many of these children, of course, have come from homes and continue to come from homes where English is rarely if ever spoken. To overcome this problem the Government has identified several specific activities which it intends to implement through the Department and education departments in the States to improve the situation. The Commonwealth intends to pay salaries for the teachers of special classes. It will conduct training courses for teachers in the method of teaching English as a foreign language. It&#39; will introduce language laboratories and other equipment. This is a programme costing of the order of $1.5m per annum out of the $4m per annum overall which is to be spent. </para>
          <para>The joint Commonwealth-New South Wales Education Department survey which was conducted a short while ago showed that of the 7,700 migrant children surveyed English was spoken at home ali or most of the time in only 15 per cent of the households. In fact, English was never spoken in 42 per cent of the homes. This, of course, is a most impressive figure indicating the dearth of English in the home situation of a considerable proportion of migrant children. Further figures discerned from this survey show that in households where no English is spoken some 27 per cent of the children were making what was rated to be good progress or better at school. On the other hand, however, the 63 per cent who were making poor progress at school came from the &#39;no English&#39; speaking homes. We do not need to adduce any further figures to show that a problem exists. </para>
          <para>I think that, this having been said, it is fairly obvious even to the uninitiated in these matters that the problem with children is unlikely to be as serious in a continuing sense, lt may be serious initially and thereby provide quite some impediment to a rapid or a normal increase in educational advancement, but it is likely to be a situation which will be overcome in the natural course of events merely by virtue of the fact that children are children, they are young, they are receptive and they are mixing with other children at least most of whom certainly speak English. Therefore these children, despite the disadvantage of the home situation at that stage, are likely in the normal course of their intermixing to get along fairly well. That is not to say that the programme should not be implemented at least as much as is envisaged. </para>
          <para>It seems to me that the greater problem is the one which concerns adult education. Certainly, the honourable member for Grayndler had quite a bit to say about that. Although approximately one-third of foreign born migrants cannot in any effective way speak English when they get here, the intake in recent years in adult evening education classes conducted, to take one or two examples, has been quite considerably less than the number of current arrivals. For example, in 1966-67 there were 19,000 enrollees in the adult classes for language whereas 45,000 migrant arrivals occurred in the same year with respect to that area of need. In 1968- 69, 21,000 migrants enrolled whereas 61,000 migrants who needed to do so, in effect, arrived in this country. So, it is pretty clear that, as the honourable member for Grayndler rightly has said, we are not getting all these people in. The problem remains. 1 do not think that he quite adequately answered this problem although he tried to do so. The problem is: How do we get these people in. In particular, how do we get in the housewife more so even than the chappy who is at work and perhaps can be persuaded to get in by various employer incentives of the kind outlined. Certainly it would not appear to be exactly antithetical to the private enterprise ethic to have some employer indulgence in this matter and even an incentive whereby time was made available as well as facilities even for these people who certainly it can be argued make up a considerable part of our labour force. This is one of the major arguments for immigration being continuous. It would not be bad for those people who are benefiting most directly from the provision of this labour force to have some part in improving the status and the general worthiness - I do not use &#39;worthiness&#39; in the moral sense - of the people whom they are employing. In this way they can assist those people to partake community life as a whole. </para>
          <para>The review and extension of adult education which is envisaged takes place in several areas - at source, in Europe or elsewhere, and on shipboard, if it is shipboard, and in Australia. I have taken the trouble to talk to a small number of people who have been involved in the adult education programme. I have found that one or two problems exist. It is hard to go along with the honourable member for Grayndler who wants to provide holus bolus, as it were, classrooms, because surely this will detract from trie education need which he has identified already. We need to bear in mind that one of the biggest problems of capitalisation in the education field is that classrooms, whether they be university, technical college, secondary school or primary school classrooms, are not on the whole very greatly utilised. They may be during the day, but there are large periods during each day in a year - large chunks of each day, perhaps T might say - when classrooms are not used. This is one of the arguments for extending the university teaching year. Capital equipment in this way will be used more persistently. </para>
          <para>It seems to me that when we are talking about school classrooms being used for adult migrant education, whether or not we involve also the question of special equipment for laboratory type situations and so on, it should be possible to use existing facilities at different hours than generally those facilities get their normal use without however detracting from expenditure in other normal areas of education, or, alternatively, incurring a larger additional capital expenditure for this purpose. </para>
          <para>There are some problems which seem to be of a minor kind perhaps to which the Minister for Immigration might direct his attention if he has not done so already. For instance - and I hope that my figures are up lo date - a class maximum in the adult migrant education programme is regarded as 24. I compare this with the figure of 30 which is the generally accepted figure put forward by most teacher bodies as the optimum for normal class teaching. I wonder whether the figure for adult education in this respect might not stand a reduction given special consideration of the very considerable difficulties under which some of the people in these classes are working. </para>
          <para>There is the question of materials needed, on which I think the honourable member for Grayndler touched. I would like to raise in this respect the question of the availability and accessibility of materials and not so much the question of whether or not they exist. There needs to be a very considerable degree of co-operation between the school in which the classes are being held and those who teach the classes. If the people teaching belong to the school at which the teaching is taking place, there is no problem as I see it. But if in fact this work is being carried out in some centre where the teachers do not teach normally, it is necessary sometimes for the materials involved in teaching to be housed in some teacher&#39;s room, office or common room. For various personal reasons, understandable perhaps in the main, it is not always easy to get at such materials at the time when they are needed. This is something which perhaps the departmental officers involved in supervising these things might need to consider more carefully. </para>
          <para>Another question concerns the teaching kit required. It is quite bulky. A car is needed to move it around. Strange as it may be in this day and age it is not always possible for the teacher concerned to have access to this means of transport. This is a practical problem which again appears minor but which may loom a little larger in the eyes of some of the teachers conducting these classes. </para>
          <para>The question of incentives to enrol and the problem of dropouts from these adult migration classes in language are real ones. It is very difficult to provide an answer. I do not think that the honourable member for Grayndler grappled with these problems to ultimate effectiveness, and I find myself unable to give the ultimate answers. How in fact do we get people who prefer to do some more work, to stay at home, to earn overtime or to do whatever it is that they do, to attend such classes? How do we impress upon them sufficiently the importance to them of learning English in a working manner as quickly as possible? How do we demonstrate the fact that by doing so they will enhance their own status and increase their own usefulness to themselves, to their families and to the community at large. It is a difficult question and I think that it may be answerable only by those people who are engaged in the field of migrant education. This is not buck passing. It is deferring to those who would appear to be most likely to know. </para>
          <para>The question of intensive language courses does not need to be outlined at any length at all. These are for a relatively special group, a group already having the benefit of greater capacity, it would appear, to learn. The amount being spent on this training appears to be relatively large. It will rise from approximately &#167;100,000 to in excess of Sim in this financial year alone. This would appear to be money well spent because we are talking of people who are very likely on a per capita basis to infuse into the community a very considerable contribution not only by their efforts and through their own skills in other areas but also, one would imagine, probably by virtue of the fact of having these skills and being capable of acquiring expression in English - and other languages for that matter - more rapidly are they likely to be leaders of their own communities, insofar as there are communities of new migrants. They are therefore likely to very much repay the money spent on this avenue of migrant education. </para>
          <para>I think that through all this it should be borne in mind that, desirable though it is, it is not necessary - I do not imply that it is - that in attempting to teach English to migrants, adult or otherwise, wherever we might aim, that we have to achieve perfection in a short period of time. After all, we do not achieve it here. We do not achieve it amongst most of our students, and perhaps it would be overmuch to expect to achieve it amongst migrants. In fact, what we need is a basic form of expression, a simplicity and a general understanding that is sufficient to get the person concerned through situations of everyday life. Of course, the so-called Australian situational method has recognised that. May I indicate what I mean and show the sort of achievement which I think we might try to get. I will quote from a letter written by a West Indian day labourer in Britain concerning a problem which he had. He expressed himself as follows: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Respected Sir: </para>
            <para>When I got to the building,  I  found that the hurricane had knocked some bricks off the top. So I rigged up a beam with  a  pulley  at  the top of the building and hoisted up a couple of barrels full of bricks. When I had fixed the building, there was a lot of bricks left over. 1 hoisted the barrel back up again and secured the line at the bottom, and then went up and filled the barrel with extra bricks. Then I went to the bottom and cast off the line. </para>
            <para>Unfortunately, the barrel of bricks was heavier than 1 was and before I knew what was happening the barrel started down, jerking me off the ground. I decided to hang on and halfway up I met the barrel coming down and received a severe blow on the shoulder. </para>
            <para>I then continued to the top, banging my head against the beam and getting my finger jammed in the pulley. When the barrel hit the ground it  burs ted  its bottom, allowing all the bricks to spill out. </para>
            <para>I was heavier than the empty barrel and so started down again at high speed. Halfway down, I met the barre! coming up and received severe injuries to my shins. When I hit the ground I landed on the bricks, getting several painful cuts from the sharp edges. </para>
            <para>At this point I must have lost my presence of mind, because I let go of the line. The barrel then came down giving me another heavy blow on the head and putting me in the hospital. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">As the honourable member for Kingsford Smith <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lionel Bowen)</inline> has correctly discerned in advance, the bricklayer wanted some workmen&#39;s compensation. But the point of the story is that that letter written by somebody who had learnt English somewhere other than his native country included the elements of clarity, simplicity, perhaps a certain archaic flavour, and the dramatic effect dependent upon understatement. If we could get most of our migrants to that situation I am sure the Minister would be well pleased. I think even the honourable member for Grayndler would be well pleased. I feel, without I hope undue sanguineness of mind at this stage, that the programme involving this $16m or so to be spent in 4 years in several avenues of migrant education in language is well devised, even if not as comprehensive as some people would want, to improve the situation as we currently find it. The question of whether we intend to teach more people and to keep the programme rolling so that the problems are not perhaps compounded or increased as the years go by is one which I am sure we will be debating at another time. </para>

            <para>- The Australian immigration programme was initiated by a Labor government some 25 years ago, and it has been supported by this Government since that time. So 1 think that ail of us here are very disturbed to hear these revelations which indicate the disadvantages to which migrants are being subjected. The honourable member for Grayndler <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Daly)</inline> indicated that the migrant education programme commenced in 1947 after about 1,000 migrants had come here. We have had a lot of opportunity to get it into gear, to oil the machinery and to make it work. I think it is disappointing for many of us suddenly to get these revelations indicating the stark nature of the situation, immigration is important to Australia. We have endeavoured to secure an increase amounting to I per cent of our population each year for some years. We have rarely achieved this. I think this year we are seeking about 175,000 migrants. Seventy per cent of the increase in our work force over the last 20 years has come from immigration. We are told by the Immigration Department that something like $650 is spent administratively on each migrant, but the net gain is said to be something like $10,000 for each migrant. We are told that migrants have added $70,000m to our gross national product over 20 years. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>If all this is the case, although I know there are many who believe it is time we properly evaluated these alleged facts, clearly we should be thinking of migrants from the point of view that immigration is not a one-sided affair. It is probably time we were doing a bit more for them. We have relegated them to poor environments, crowded houses, inadequate recreation, insufficient public services, high interest rates, sub-standard health schemes, and we have often sent them off to do the toughest jobs in the most oppressive areas. There are many manifestations that migrants are socially disadvantaged in Australia. The success of Australia&#39;s immigration programme has long been tarnished by an obtuse disinclination to evaluate the problems which migrants and their children encounter. Nevertheless, I believe it is safe to say that in the field of formal education the Commonwealth has been recreant to its responsibility to ensure that adequate facilities are available. Of course, we can say this of Australian children generally: that there are many thousands trying to get into universities, that there are probably thousands trying to get into kindergartens and that there are class loading problems and the like, but there are special problems with migrants. Without the fulfilment of these obligations by the Commonwealth Government, the States will always suffer from an inadequacy of funds necessary to meet both the general needs of education and the particular finesse and expertise and special resources required for the education of migrant children. </para>
          <para>Startling revelations about language problems of migrant children have now come to hand 25 years after the then Labor Government initiated our first immigration programme. For many of the 2i million people who have comprised our total net population gain since 1946 and for a large number of their children the lost opportunities that have resulted can never be regained. So much has gone, never to be retrieved, and we all deplore that fact. How many returning migrants who have left Australia in disillusionment have suffered from an inability to communicate because of insufficient skill with the English language? Over the last 5 years 21,697 migrants who had come to Australia with assisted passages have packed up their bags and gone home within 2 years of arriving here. Most of us who work in this field and who make contact with migrants know that the language problem often contributes to their unhappiness. </para>
          <para>Some went because of inadequate housing, deficiencies in the health scheme and all kinds of things, but many must have gone because of the deficiencies of the education system and our failure to convey an understanding of the English language to them. For a long time the Government has shown indecent haste to get migrants, any sort of migrants, as long as they were of European extraction. We have not shown any enthusiasm to get the others, regardless of whether they can speak English. What thought has been given to requiring intending migrants to take a course in English prior to leaving their home country? There are lots of people who now say that we should now put a stop to or a brake on the immigration programme.  I  suppose another way of looking at it is to decide to be more selective and to bring to this country those migrants who have a knowledge of the English language because of their willingness to apply themselves to it before they arrive in Australia. It is clearly a possibility that we could make a knowledge of English a condition of their immigration arrangement. </para>
          <para>Two and a half million persons who were born overseas are now in Australia. We are told that they represent  20  per cent of the population. We have sent many back. In  1969-70  we repatriated  693  for undisclosed reasons and we deported  491. 1  think this demonstrates our inability to be selective. In addition to that, we have found that a lot of those who have come here and sought naturalisation are not suitable for many reasons. I want to mention some of the reasons because they have a very precise bearing on this subject. In the  19  years to  1969  we rejected  529  applicants for naturalisation on security grounds and  20,022  on other grounds. Bui then we rejected a lot of others because of their very inadequate knowledge of English or their inability to speak English. </para>

              <para>-  I disagree with the Minister but I must not be diverted since I am making only a passing reference to this matter anyway. It is amazing that in these years we have had such a high incidence of people whose applications for naturalisation have been rejected because of their inability to speak English. In  1961 1,683  people were rejected; in  1962, 1,920;  in  1963, 1,760;  in  1964, 1,670;  in  1965, 914;  in  1966, 505;  in  1967, 237;  and in  1968-  the last year for which the figures are available to me  - 170. </para>

              <para>-  One would have thought, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline> that rather than rejecting these applicants the interest of the Government and of the Department would have been attracted from the standpoint of teaching them English.  1  was interested in the remarks of Professor W.  F.  Connell, Professor of Education at the Sydney University. He pointed out that a recent survey by the Department of Immigration indicates that one-third of foreign born migrants cannot speak English. He said: </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <quote>
            <para class="block">Departmental classes cater for a small proportion of these . . . Present classes are not matching the numbers of recent arrivals. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I point out to the Minister in case he has forgotten - and it is a long time since this Bill was first introduced - that this Bill has a very real relevance to teaching migrants to speak English and classes are to be set up under this legislation for that precise purpose. Professor Connell said, further: </para>
          <quote>
            <para class="block">In 1966-67 the average enrolment in all courses was 19,390 and Australia&#39;s intake of non English Europe an born settlers was 44,690 . . . In 1968-69 enrolments were 20,668 and the country&#39;s intake 61,296. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">These are enrolments in courses where migrants learn to speak English. So about one-third of those coming in each year who suffer from an inability to- speak English actually take advantage of the opportunities extended to them. The Professor also said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para class="block">It appears that the language problem is steadily slipping backwards. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">What is wrong with the courses? The fact of the matter is - and surveys have shown this - that migrants do not last long at the courses for reasons best known to themselves. In New South Wales in the period from October  1968  to October  1969  a total of  19,915  students enrolled in evening classes and there were  17,959  abandonments. We are told that many attend once or twice, that half spend less than  2  months with the courses and three-quarters give up less than  5  months after commencing. It is estimated that less than  10  per cent of the yearly intake of migrants needing English instruction actually complete the courses. </para>
          <para>Then there are these special problems referred to by the honourable member for </para>
          <para class="block">Grayndler concerning women and their unpreparedness to learn the English language. There is a need for special orientation, lt has been suggested by speakers at immigration conventions that morning classes should be initiated to encourage women to participate; that women teachers should be introduced into the system; that there should be husband and wife teaching teams and that migrant couples should be encouraged to participate in these courses. It is also suggested that there should be intensive courses and that these should start, first of all. in the home countries before the migrant comes to Australia. As 1 have mentioned before, it should be a condition of migration that the courses should continue on the ship and then in the hostels for some months after arrival. While migrants are in a hostel, possibly sacrificing their employment, they should be given financial assistance probably by way of the payment of unemployment benefits so that they will be encouraged to continue in these language courses which, in the end, will bring such a considerable benefit to themselves and to Australia generally. </para>
          <para>I was also interested in the remarks of Olive Nichols, District Inspector of Schools in the New South Wales Department of Education. She said that in New South Wales 32 per cent of migrant children - almost 1 in 3 - in the total school population have language problems. This, of course, is a crisis of great magnitude. She pinpointed the crisis as being mainly in Sydney, Wollongong, Canberra and Newcastle and, to some extent, in other capital cities as well. Se pointed out that mildly intellectually handicapped children number some 30,000 but the next category of special needs in this country so far as education is concerned involves the 16,452 migrant children in New South Wales and a similar proportion of the school population in other States who have language problems. We are obviously doing insufficient about this problem. My colleague the honourable member for Grayndler has mentioned how the circumstances of a migrant child affect him in his English speaking ability at school. The amount of English spoken at home is clearly a factor. The proportion of these migrants who speak English at home all the time amounts to only 4 per cent. Those who speak English most of the time amount to 11 per cent, those who speak English at home sometimes amount to 43 per cent and those who never speak English at home amount to 42 per cent, lt is interesting to see what happens to the ,- ...... - , School progress is average for 33 per cent, below average for 48 per cent and poor for 63 per cent. I think this underlines the importance of ensuring that migrant children and their parents are given the greatest possible encouragement to learn the English language. 1 think there are lots of ways in which this problem can be assailed. 1 agree with the honourable member for Grayndler that we. need a comprehensive programme of migrant education. I think we need adequate facilities and capital equipment, including buildings and I am not sure that the Government will go far enough in respect of these things. There is already some speculation around the lobbies that the subject matter of this Bill, the migrant education programme, might become one of the first casualties of the Government&#39;s anti inflationary measures. We are told that some SI 6m might be expended over the next 4 years if this programme is fully implemented. Quite frankly, I think the programme is so recently contrived and thought out that we will have great difficulty in obtaining the skilled personnel and the resources to fulfil the programme and doubtless this will be used as an excuse to curtail the proposed expenditure. But 1 would not be surprised if we have it curtailed for anti-inflation reasons. I would like to see the special facilities and the capital equipment which have been referred to by the honourable member for Grayndler provided. 1 think there are lots of other modern and contemporary ways of doing it. </para>
          <para>We ought to have radio stations whose programmes are specially devoted to this purpose having regard to the magnitude of the problem. In the United States there are 5.201 radio stations and many of them devote their programmes to education purposes and to migrant education purposes. Some cities have 50 radio stations. There is not a shortage of frequencies in Australia. The only inhibiting factor is the unwillingness of the Government to invoke some of these new techniques which would enable migrants to be educated through radio programmes. This is the only real obstacle to migrant education that we have in this country. I am interested in the remarks of Professor Parish of the University of New England who said: </para>

              </item>
            </list>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">What is there against making avail able special radio facilities to assist with the education of migrant children and adult migrants? I think it is time that we went even further and undertook what is being done in the United States, where special television facilities are made vailable, and in the United Kingdom, where 25,000 part time students are to be educated at an open university in this specialised field. </para>
          <para>I say to the Minister that if the problems are of such a magnitude we should smarten up and get some modern ideas. If the migrants are to be located in our great cities such as Sydney, Newcastle and Wollongong, in view of the shortage of teachers and the inability of this Government to provide the buildings and capital equipment which are so essential in migrant education, there is no reason at all why further radio stations and television channels should not be made available for this programme. When considering the benefits which we derive from our migration pro gramme I sincerely hope that we will look more positively towards giving the assistance which is so necessary in this programme. I have been told that in the last <inline font-style="italic">6i</inline> years Australia has recruited by way of migration 1,400 medical practitioners, 1,600 senior students, 4,000 engineers, and 3,500 architects and surveyors. Within a period of <inline font-style="italic">6i</inline> years 36,000 professional workers have come to this country to settle. That is an impressive figure of  9  per cent of all immigrant workers in Australia. Our rich intake of quality justifies strong support for the migrant education programme. </para>
          <para>Although I am impressed with the fact that after this long period which has elapsed since the introduction of the migrant education programme and the fact that it has languished for such a long time we are now starting to do something about it but I believe that what is proposed is insufficient. I believe it is necessary for this Parliament to consider seriously the amendment moved by the Opposition that the Government should make available buildings and capital equipment which are so essential for this programme. I particularly commend the proposition that we should invoke new techniques and use the mass media by way of radio and television facilities to give the migrants the educational opportunities which they so desperately deserve. </para>

            <para>-  The answer to the honourable member&#39;s question is as follows: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>The answer to the question depends on the nature of the information contained in the contribution and the way in which the former employee obtained that information. </para>
            <para>If the contribution contained restricted information, as that phrase is defined in the Atomic Energy Act 1953-1966, which was obtained in the course of the former employee&#39;s employment or in any of the other circumstances se i out in section 48 of that Act, it would be an offence to make public that information. </para>
            <para>Again, under section 70 of the Crimes Act 1914-1960, a former officer would be guilty of an offence if, without authority, he communicated to the public information that came to his knowledge by virtue of his office and that, at the time, he ceased to be an officer, it was his duty not to disclose. Tn this connection,  it should be noted that section- 53 of the Atomic Energy Act makes it an offence for an employee- of the Commission to communicate information concerning activities of the Commission or the -contents of a document lo which he has had access by reason of being an employee. </para>
            <para>The reason for the restrictions is that many Commission employees have access to classified information of commercial or defence importance. The information could be acquired as a result of expensive research activities, in  Australia or from atomic energy activities overseas in countries wilh which we have agreements for sharing nuclear knowledge. Such agreement* could not normally be achieved unless both parties had made provision for secrecy. We could not contemplate absolving a person from .secrecy merely because he left Commission employment. However, section 5 (2.) of the Atomic Energy Act makes it clear that, for present purposes, the term &#39;restricted information&#39; does not include information published in scientific or technical literature or in public statements made or authorised by or on behalf of the Commission or the Minister. Accordingly, persons are not prevented from discussing published information - on nuclear matters merely because they have, at one time, been Commission employees. </para>

            <para>International Conferences held in Australia between 1st July J969 and 30th June 1970 which have received support from the Commonwealth Government are listed in the table hereunder. The list has been compiled from information provided by the relevant Ministers. </para>
            <para>As previously, the table includes conferences which might broadly be described as inter-governmental&#39; and &#39;non-governmental&#39; (i.e. sponsored by private organisations). The inter-governmental conferences, which for the purposes of this answer include conferences of an official nature such as those associated with United Nations bodies and the Inter-Parliamentary Union, are marked by an asterisk. Conferences and working groups relating to inter-Service cooperation -e.g. pursuant to the American, British, Canadian and Australian Armies Standardisation Agreement - have not been included. For these, the Departments concerned have continuing secretariats as part of their normal functions. </para>
            <para>The table includes the cost of support by the Commonwealth. Wilh regard to non-governmental conferences, where support in addition to a financial contribution has been provided, the form of support is shown. With regard to intergovernmenmi conferences the host facilities appropriate to the conference have been provided. These facilities vary from conference to conference and may include such items as conference accommodation, departmental administrative services, including secretarial services, transport and entertainment. </para>

The honourable member was told that the reports were confidential in the sense that they were internal to the joint considerations of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission and Electricity Commission of New South Wales. The studies were merely to ascertain the various favourable and unfavourable factors of the sites initially considered. Several of the studies necessarily were little more than of a reconnaissance nature: the studies were not uniform in depth and were not designed for publication. They nevertheless showed the pre-eminence of the Jervis Bay site. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>Question No. 1194 asked if heated waste water from the proposed Jervis Bay station would be discharged imo the ocean and asked further if there was any danger from such a release. The honourable member was informed that a final decision had not been reached on the point of discharge and that a detailed examination of the environmental and ecological factors which might be affected was being carried out. This examination is still being carried out in considerable depth and will not be completed for some time. </para>
          <para>I would add that in relation to possible dangers from the release there will be a continuing monitoring after the nuclear power station has been completed so that any effect of the discharge on the environment will be kept under constant observation. </para>

              <para>Careful consideration has been given to the question of licensing the operation in Australia of what are known in the United States of America and in certain other countries, including New Zealand, as &#39;Cit izens Radio Services&#39;. These services provide for the use of relatively low powered radio equipment on a limited number of frequencies set aside for the purpose for the exchange of communications relating to the business or personal activities of the licensees. The conclusion has been reached, however, that licensing policy in Australia which provides for the authorisation in the 27 megahertz band of low powered transceiver units in what are known as hand phone Mobile Services adequately caters for all legitimate requirements iti this country. Over 14,000 of these units have been licensed for use by Police, Fire Brigades. Forestry Departments, Civil Defence Organisations and other public bodies and also by private individuals and organisation having a need for short range communication in connection wilh such activities as building construction, properly management, sporting events and for safety and rescue purposes. The extension of licensing policy lo provide for the use of common radio frequencies for the conduct of all kinds of business and personal conversations would lead, as it has done elsewhere, to a state bordering on chaos in the frequency bands concerned to the detriment of services established to meet the important and useful public and private needs lo which I have referred. Unrestricted radio-communication would also permit the contravention of longstanding Government policy in Australia which provides that the public telephone and telegraph systems which have been provided at considerable public expense should be the normal means of communication between individuals residing in areas where these services are available. </para>

Australia has such an agreement with the United States and the Agency, but such agreements do not require legislation. </para>

          <quote>
            <para> Details of the annual heavy water requirements of the Candy and SGHWR reactors under consideration for construction at Jervis Bay are contained in confidential commercial tender documents and cannot be made public. lt is not possible to stale now the stage at which a local heavy water plant would be justified. Justification for constructing such a plant would depend upon Australia&#39;s future requirements for heavy water and the price and overseas availability of il at that time. </para>
            <para>The Glace Bay plant is not the only source of supply  of  heavy water  from  Canada - there is another plant operating at Port Hawkesbury, and the Bruce plant is expected on line by 1972. Heavy water reactors would not now be under consideration for Jervis Bay if economic sources of heavy water had not first been established. </para>

            <para>The licensing and regulatory control of nuclear installations is currently under study not only by various Commonwealth Departments and the Atomic Energy Commission but also by the joint Commonwealth/States Consultative Committee on Nuclear Energy! An important aspect of the problem is the question of what legislation may be necessary to establish effective and efficient licensing and regulatory arrangements throughout Australia. These are complex issues involving technological, legal and financial considerations and their elucidation will take some lime. It is not expected that legislation would be introduced in the immediate future. </para>

            <item label="(3)">
              <para>No detailed studies of available sites have been made for South Australia. The siting of reactors involves many complex issues such as availability of cooling media, nearness to population and load centres and other considerations. When a definite proposal is made sites must be considered individually. However, it seems probable that physically suitable sites could bc found in the region. </para>

            <item label="(4)">
              <para>At the present time a nuclear power station would not bc economic in South Australia as electricity can be produced more cheaply from oil or natural gas. </para>

            <item label="(5)">
              <para>Although no benefit/cost analysis has been done by the Commonwealth a number of less detailed studies have been made on the proposal to interconnect Victoria and South Australia. Superficially such a scheme could have attractions because of the time differences between the States. The pooling of generating resources might reduce the total amount of generating plant required in each system either to meet peak demands or provide spare plant. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>It has been ascertained however that the economics of such interconnection are not attractive at present. Very long transmission lines would be required from Adelaide to Melbourne, and there would be virtually no intermediate load centres to be served. This position may change in the course of time. </para>

          <para>MrSnedden ; The answer to the honourable member&#39;s question is as follows:  1LO Convention No. 82 - Social Policy (Non Metropolitan Territories), 1947, relates only to external territories and, therefore, does not have any application in the Northern Territory. The Convention covers a- wide range of matters and prescribes detailed policies and measures which ratifying countries undertake to apply in their non-metropolitan territories. The policies to be followed are directed to the well-being and development of the peoples in such territories and to the promotion of the desire on their part for social progress. In particular, they are directed to the improvement of standards of living as the principal objective in the planning of economic development: to protection of migrant workers: to non-discrimination on grounds of race, colour, sex. belief, tribal association or trade union affiliation; and to education and training. </para>
          <para>Compliance with all provisions of the Convention, and not only the particular aspect referred to by the honourable member, is necessary to enable it to be ratified. 1 would refer the honourable member to the reply given by my colleague, the Minister for External Territories, to Question No. 1427 (Hansard. 26th August 1969, page 712) concerning its application in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea. </para>

            <para>I am advised that no financial reimbursement is made to the States in respect of State Inspectors carrying out inspection of Federal Awards. The arrangements for the authorisation of State Inspectors to carry out inspections under Federal Awards are mutual, inasmuch as they also provide for the authorisation of Commonwealth Inspectors to carry out inspections under State laws, awards and determinations. The inspection of Federal awards by State Inspectors and of State prescriptions by Commonwealth Inspectors forms  a  very small part of the total number of inspections and it was agreed between the Commonwealth and the participating States that no financial reimbursement of either party was called for. </para>

              <para>In his statement la Parliament during the debate on the Appropriation Bill on 1st October the Minister for Labour and National Service was referring to the difficulties of breaking up national productivity trends into their constituent industry elements. This is because of problems of consistency and comparability between the data used to estimate output and those used to estimate labour input. The Minister was also referring to the fact that productivity movements can only be measured in retrospect. However, these difficulties are not greatly relevant when considering overall economic capacity for national wage purposes. </para>

          <para>From the copy of the agreement supplied by the Master Builders&#39; Association of Victoria, it is clear that the appropriate Tribunal is expected to consent to making the agreement an award provision before it becomes operative and. no doubt, &#39;.his is directly influenced by the terms of contract which, in most it not all cases,, require such approval before additional wage costs can be recovered. </para>
          <para>Apart from any other factor, it cannot be overlooked that the present proceedings for an award affect many different classes of employers in three States (Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia), such as other master builders, joiner establishments, mixed industries generally and Slate and1 Federal Governmental instrumentalities. </para>
          <para>Whilst it is claimed that this agreement between Melbourne and metropolitan master builders and the Union is without prejudice, it cannot be assumed to be without prejudice for very long.&#39; </para>

Some of these answers have indicated the Statistician&#39;s intention to examine during 1971 the desirability of compiling and publishing measures of change in product per unit of labour force despite their significant conceptual limitations. This examination will consider measures at the level of major industries, groups of industries, and gross national product. </para>

            <para>With respect to questions (1) and (2), in 1969- 70 container vessels were periodically being phased into both the Australia lo United KingdomEurope and the Australia to Japan trades. They are not yet operative in any other overseas trade. Information is not yet available as to the precise quantities of cargoes carried by container vessels in that year. However, operators anticipate that as their container services become more established a larger percentage of cargoes within the trades concerned will be carried in container ships. </para>
            <para>As to questions (3) and (4) the Government, of course, maintains a detailed scrutiny of its own container and vehicle deck ship operations. Consequently, in broad terms it is informed on operational costs and the benefits connected with these new type services. </para>

            <para>- The answer to the honourable member&#39;s question is as follows- </para>
          </talk.start>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(1)">
              <para>and (2) The actual cost of production of electricity from all Australian coal fired power stations is not available in any published form. The best information I can give the honourable member relates to the average selling prices per unit of electricity. These average selling prices to a great extent reflect variations in cost of production at power stations; in addition however they include costs of transmission and reticulation and the running costs of the electricity instrumentalities. As has been noted by the honourable member the average cost per unit of electricity to consumers has been remarkably stable as shown by the following table: </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(3)">
              <para>1 believe that such stability of average selling prices in the face of rising general costs could not have been achieved except in circumstances where the responsible authorities were highly efficient. Without detracting from this statement however I think it necessary to point out three factors which tend to lower electricity charges. These factors are common to electricity systems undergoing major expansion in many other parts of the world. The factors are: </para>
              <list type="loweralpha">
                <item label="(a)">
                  <para>economies of scale accrue from the use of larger generating units in respect of capital cost, efficiency and use of the heat content of fuel and operation and maintenance costs. The maximum size of the generator unit is related to the size of the system and therefore in a growing system costs should improve provided the expansion rate is sufficiently high to counteract inflation. </para>
                </item>
                <item label="(b)">
                  <para>Usage of electricity per consumer is increasing. However revenue tends _ to increase at a greater rate than expenditure as the cost of reticulation systems and overhead costs remain relatively stable despite a greater throughput of electricity. I might add that the statistics quoted above conceal the fact that most electricity tariff schedules have risen; but as a significant part of the total sales is made under tariffs which have a sliding scale according to the quantity used the average selling price does not increase as much as increases in the rales in the tariff schedules. </para>

                <item label="(c)">
                  <para>Technological advances have been made in the design of plant and in high voltage transmission. The first has resulted in cheaper and/or more efficient plant additional to those benefits arising from increased size; the second has permitted the location of stations adjacent to coal fields and has reduced fuel costs. </para>

              <para>It is acknowledged that power production is primarily the responsibility of State Governments.

              <para>The capital and interest components of the total cost of production of electricity from a nuclear plant depends on the type of reactor involved. In the case of natural uranium fuelled reactors the component could exceed 2/ 3 ids of the total cost. </para>

              <para>In the long term capital and interest costs move commensurate with other costs but in the short term labour .costs move much faster.

              <para>Conventional power stations in Australia&#39;s Eastern States are very advantageously placed for fuel, water and proximity to load centres. Accordingly 1 think it will be some time before nuclear stations are competitive with conventional stations in this area. Such a competitive position however might well be reached in Australia before the end of the century. Nuclear power is already competitive in major industrial countries overseas which have passed through the stage of the favourable circumstances we at present enjoy. My reasons for this view are: </para>

              <para>The Commonwealth Employment Service consistently pursues a policy of advising employers that ability and capacity to do the job should be a prime consideration in selection, and that only in exceptional circumstances or where the individual&#39;s welfare is affected should age be a factor. The Commonwealth Employment Service therefore brings to the attention of employers seeking to engage labour the most. suitable of the persons seeking its assistance to obtain employment irrespective of any age limits that may be specified, but with due regard to -the duties of the position to be filled. When an advertisement is. placed and paid for by an employer, as was the&#34; case on (his occasion, responsibility for its content rests with the employer who has the right of decision as to who shall be engaged. The Commonwealth Employment Service, irrespective of any age preferences indicated, will refer to employers persons beyond those age limits if it is satisfied that they ate capable of performing tha&#39; duties, required. It did so in this instance. </para>

              <para>My predecessors and 1 have many times indicated the Government&#39;s view that the so-called penal clauses&#39; of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act should only be used  as a&#39;  last resort when  all  other reasonable steps have been taken to resolve disputes. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>This policy is reflected in the amendments made to the Act in June of this year. They provide, inter alia, for the processes of conciliation and, if needs be, arbitration, to be availed of before the so-called &#39;penal clause&#39;, section 119, can be invoked. Moreover, a&#39; presidential member of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission must have issued a certificate before action can be taken under that section to have the Commonwealth Industrial Court impose a penalty because of an award breach by a union. And before it can be held that there is such a breach by a union because of its part in  a  ban or strike the Commission constituted by a presidential member must first have been satisfied that a so-called &#39;bans clause&#39; should be inserted in the award. </para>
          <para>It will be seen from this that before the &#39;penal clause&#39; of the Act can have been invoked every opportunity will have been given the parties to a dispute to settle their differences. If, despite that, the union resorts to direct industrial action or continues to resort to such action contrary to the award provision, therein lies the justification for the use of the sanctions provisions of the Act. Union not only have the right to seek to better the industrial lot of their members. They also have obligations to abide by the awards made to protect their members. </para>
