            <para>-I ask the Prime Minister a question. The right honourable gentleman will recall the form of the Executive Councillor&#39;s oath, which he himself has taken many times, in particular the phrase I will not directly or indirectly reveal such matters as shall be debated in Council and committed to my secrecy.I ask him whether he recalls very recent statements: By the right honourable member for Higgins that one of the problems of Cabinet in recent years has been the problem of keeping things under wraps; by the honourable member for Wentworth that the whole business of Cabinet has been subject to an enormous number of leaks and the whole place has become something like a sieve; and by the honourable member for Berowra that he had his own ideas about the source of Cabinet leaks.I ask: Do these statements by three recent Ministers testify to constant and serious breaches of Cabinet oaths of secrecy? Has he discussed the allegations with these ex-Ministers, and what steps will he take to discover those colleagues who have broken their oaths? </para>

            <para>- This is an extraordinary question to be asked by the Leader of the Opposition. He referred to the Executive Councillor&#39;s oath. This has got nothing whatsoever to do with the Cabinet secrecy. That is a convention and is not the result of swearing the oath for the Executive Council. If he looks at it he will see what the consequences are. But if he wants to know the conventions relating to the Cabinet I draw , his attention, first of all,., to Halsbury&#39;s &#39;Laws ofEngland&#39;, 3rd Edition, Volume 7, at page 354, and also to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Ivor</inline> Jennings&#39; &#39;Cabinet Government&#39;, 3rd Edition, where it is. made abundantly clear that there is no oath of secrecy relating to the Cabinet itself. There is a convention, and that convention usually is observed. </para>

              <para>- I might say to the honourable member for Riverina, who himself has recently also drawn attention to those excesses by public statement, that this is in every way a matter which the honourable gentleman ought to raise in the House and it is a proper matter for concern because the situation, as honourable members on the other side would be well aware, is that Broken Hill is a closed town and indeed is an example of the excess to which union power can run in this country. So far as the specific point which has been raised by the honourable gentleman is concerned, my understanding is that it is the policy of the Barrier Industrial Council, which has been applied with some few exceptions, that no married woman can work in that town if there is a single woman available for the job. It will be, I hope, self-evident to some honourable members opposite that this is a very serious infringement of the right of people to work. That that situation does obtain under the control of the Barrier Industrial Council is certainly a matter for regret by members on this side of the House and, I would hope, by some of the more responsible elements on the other side of the House. So far as the final point raised by the honourable gentleman in relation to the policy of the Australian Council of Trade Unions is concerned, I am not specifically aware of what the ACTU policy is in relation to Broken Hill but my very clear understanding is that the </para>

Did the &#39;Sydney Morning Herald* report on 30th July that Australian troops would be out of Vietnam by Christmas and did the Melbourne &#39;Sun&#39; report on 4th August that national service would be cut by 6 months? Can he say whether these disclosures were inspired as part of a systematic campaign to exact acceptance of a cut in the defence vote which the former Minister regarded as contrary to the national interest?

            <para>- As to the first part of the question, it is false to say that I made that statement in the Cabinet. Usually I do not like making any statement about what occurs in Cabinet but in order to show how inaccurate the honourable gentleman is I. can immediately contradict that. The second point that I want to put to him is that I have no evidence whatsoever that these leaks came from any Cabinet source. Of course, statements have been made but because they are made it does not necessarily follow that they have come from Cabinet. They could have come from departmental or other sources. I am not one of those who is prepared to suggest, by innuendo or the creation of a false impression, that some members of the Cabinet or of the Ministry are responsible for these leaks. I have no evidence whatsoever that they came from Cabinet sources and consequently I have made no effort to ask any Minister whether he was responsible for them. </para>

A substantial job has been done in this regard by the Legislation and Programming Committee under the chairmanship of my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs. This achievement indicates the work that has been done over the last few months in trying to evolve a policy of administration which will solve a problem that has worried Parliaments throughout the world for many years. The Prime Minister initiated the appointment of a committee of senior representatives of the Public Service to prepare a report and to advise the Legislation and Programming Committee in relation to this matter. A lot of other investigation has been made by officers in various departments and a tremendous amount of co-operation has been received on all sides. </para>

          <para>I am indeed happy to report to the House on behalf of my colleague and his Committee that at this point of time, the first day of the sittings of this session, we have ready for presentation 19 Bills of which 12 are outside the Budget and 7 are related to the Budget. In addition many other Bills, some associated with the Budget and others with other matters, will be ready for presentation to the House in a short time. This situation will assist the orderly conduct of the business of the House during the current sittings. As the Prime Minister has already announced, a terminal date will be determined after which time Bills may not be introduced. I assure the House that everything possible is being done to create in this Parliament a situation which will be the envy of most Parliaments. </para>

            <para>- I preface my question to the Prime Minister by reminding him of the precedent set by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1947 when he resigned voluntarily for prematurely dis closing Budget information. The Prime Minister will by now be aware that on 23rd July following a Cabinet meeting on the previous day there were reports in a number of Australian newspapers that his Government had decided to subsidise wool prices to 36c a lb. He will have noticed that this information was followed with a rally on the stock exchange in the share prices of pastoral companies which had been showing a consistent decline. What steps will the Prime Minister take to investigate the leaks in this case which provided fuel for stock exchange speculation? </para>

            <para>- I am not prepared at this moment to say what is likely to be contained in the Budget but as a matter of sheer common sense I ask the honourable gentleman: Does he think that any members of the Cabinet would want to have this information made available prematurely, knowing that the great advantage to the Government and for the Government parties would be its effective presentation in the House at Budget time together with all the other measures that we are taking? I think there is pretty good reason for thinking that if there were any disclosure I do not admit for one moment that <inline font-style="italic">there</inline> was - it did not come from a Cabinet source. </para>

            <para>- I think we are all very concerned about the announcement by President Nixon about putting a surcharge on imports into the United States of America. Fortunately for Australia, about 70 per cent of our exports to that country go there under some sort of quota arrangement, either a voluntary arrangement or a fixed quota. There is a voluntary arrangement for meat, but it could become a fixed quota arrangement should the trigger ..mechanism be brought into play. We do not have ali the information we would like about the 10 per cent surcharge on exports to the United States. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Specific reference has been made to meat. No surcharge will be imposed on meat. When I refer to meat I am referring to beef, veal, mutton and goat on which the voluntary restraints operate. Unfortunately, lamb and processed meats do not enter &#39; the United States under those arrangements. It is therefore expected that the 10 per cent surcharge, will apply to lamb and processed meats. The actual value of meat going to the United States under these arrangements which will not have the disability imposed upon it is about $2 15m. That is very fortunate for the meat industry. </para>

            <para>- Yes, the honourable gentleman is right. A decision was made in October of last year as a result of a recommendation from the defence committee dealing with pay and conditions of service. lt was announced that there would be an increase in pay for certain senior Citizen - Military Forces officers. Unfortunately there was considerable difficulty in getting these regulations drafted, I understand, because of great pressure upon the parliamentary draftsmen. That position has been rectified. The regulations, were promulgated towards the end of July and the amount of payment can now be made, lt will be made next Friday. It was stated at the time the announcement was made that payment would be retrospective. It will be retrospective to 1st July 1969. </para>

            <para>- There has been some misunderstanding about the proposed central sewerage scheme for Darwin. Firstly, I think the House must be aware that this scheme was considered at great length and recommended by the Public Works Committee after hearing evidence for and against the proposal. But since then there has been a considerable amount of criticism from the Darwin City Corporation and other groups and individuals in Darwin. I and my ministerial colleagues arranged for experts to go to Darwin and discuss with various officials in Darwin the principles relating to the proposal.

          <para>I also wish to make this point clear: It is proposed to discharge the macerated sewage not into Darwin Harbour but at a point 8,000 feet feet out from East Point into a depth of 10 fathoms. But because of the continuing public concern I have arranged for the officers of the Departments of Works, Health and the Interior to confer and to bring to me a report on this and alternative but more costly proposals for treatment works. The honourable member for the Northern Territory has been concerned about this matter and has been in constant touch with me and I now inform him and other honourable members that I have no objection at all to the matter being referred back to the Public Works Committee under section 18 (6.) of the Public Works Committee Act if this is the wish of the House.</para>

            <para>- I have noted in the Press that the Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange has indicated that it will be undertaking an investigation of certain matters relating to statements by the  Chairman  of Queensland Mines Ltd and therefore under those circumstances I would not like to deal in detail with that individual matter. However, I should like to make it clear that when figures are submitted to me by any outside organisation I will not accept them unless they are proven. This has applied always and I have stated that before in this House. Figures that have been given to rae by various organisations are in many cases estimates which have to be proven and I and my Department will accept figures only after the completion of drilling operations, when survey evidence can be produced to show that these statements are of proven fact. I say that because sometimes there is an inference that the figures which are quoted by some companies are confirmed by my Department and accepted as proven figures. This is not so. We must have direct survey evidence for any figures that we accept. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The second point which 1 think is of vital importance to Australia - I stand by my previous statement- - is that the uranium province in the Northern Territory is a significant one by world standards. There are more operations going on in that province area than those conducted by Queensland Mines Ltd. Perhaps it could be judged from some of the statements in the Press that the statement of Queensland Mines Ltd referred to the whole of the province. That is not so, and I should like te put the record right at this time. Queensland Mines Ltd still has an enormous amount of survey work to carry out in other areas. Of course, other companies such as Peko-Wallsend Ltd, E Z Industries Ltd, Noranda Australia Ltd and the Pan Continental organisation are operating and exploring in that region. In addition, the Bureau of Mineral Resources in my Department has carried out some work, in some cases in conjunction with those other operators. The Bureau has arrived at a figure that 1 accept. It has stated that it can substantiate the known quantity of uranium oxide, U308 or yellow coke - call it what you like - in the province of the Northern Territory as amounting to at least 100,000 tons. 1 quoted that figure only fairly recently in Japan. 1 would not like the international Press to pick up anything resulting from reports that have appeared following a statement by one company which would affect our credibility overseas in relation to the future development of this uranium province. Honourable members opposite are interjecting, but this is a most important matter because it relates to a vitally important industry for Australia. I am sure that the Opposition realises that. I conclude by saying that other opportunities exist in Australia for finding substantial deposits of uranium. Already in South Australia, there are indications from the exploration work that has taken place that further deposits will be established and will ultimately be proven. I can only repeat that in the future Australia will be a major world producer in the uranium field. The significance of that is obvious.</para>

              <para>- It is obvious that the Opposition is attempting to concentrate on me to obtain from me some statement that it hopes to use in a censure motion. I gave the Opposition the opportunity to move a censure motion before the commencement of question time and the Opposition did not have the courage to do so. In other words, at a later stage honourable members opposite want to interrupt the business of the House to stop us carrying on with the constructive work that we have been doing. I would have thought that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition had far more common sense and savvy than to ask a question of this kind in the House. </para>

              <para>- The phrase that was used was &#39;to bask in anonymity&#39;. Of course, the honourable gentleman would not want to be reminded of the statement that he made and which in fact was consistent with other statements that have been made by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro and the honourable member for Robertson who in part or in whole have expressed concern at the increasing involvement in this country by trade unions in political matters. That is certainly a matter of concern to members on this side of the House and I am sure it is a matter of concern to the Australian community, because I believe that the community at large is sick and tired of the extent to which unions are becoming involved in what are essentially political issues. </para>

          <para>In reply to the question posed by the honourable member for Ballaarat, I would say that there are very many good reasons why trade unions should not continue with the use of the strike weapon for political purposes. In the first place they seek to usurp the role and the function of democratically elected government. In the second place those tactics are divisive of the trade union movement in Australia. In the third place they constitute interference with the normal political persuasions of the particular unionists involved, many of whom have views quite inconsistent with those which are dictated to them by those who control their union affairs. </para>
          <para>Finally, activities of this type damage the community generally and the cost is very high indeed. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> trade unions in this country are an accepted part of our democratic fabric and they have a major role to play over the whole of the industrial relations scene. But certainly it is time for trade unionists and trade unions at large to stand up on this issue and bring back to the trade union movement the image for which at one time it was distinguished. </para>

              <para>- As to the 2 questions asked by the honourable gentleman, the answer to the first is no, I did not make any such statement because I had no evidence on which I could make such a statement. The reply to the second question is that at the dinner which was given to me by my old school no such statement as that mentioned by the honourable gentleman was made. If he had wished, he could have come to the meeting at St Paul&#39;s College. He did not come; he preferred to be in China rather than in Australia among his own people. The second question clearly illustrates that he will listen to anyone. Only recently 1 have read an article published by a former secretary nf his, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wyndham,</inline> and if anyone wants to get a very good estimate of what a former friend and colleague of his thinks of him, I advise that person to read the article. One of the inferences to be drawn from it is that one does not take a great deal of notice of anything the Leader of the Opposition says. </para>

            <para>- Some time ago the River Murray Commission undertook a survey and the report was finalised some months ago. As is known, the River Murray system is the most important river system in Australia and with the development of conservation schemes and increased irrigation it is essential that a complete study be made and a full understanding be had of the salinity problem. The report is extensive. 1 am sure that the honourable member has seen it. It would probably take him  a few weeks to read. The report involves a tremendous amount of technical work, and additional study is required. At present the report is under study by the various governments concerned and by th.e River Murray Commission. &#39; Several discussions already have been held in relation to the report but at the moment I am unable to indicate when some final recommendations will be available for consideration by the 3 State governments and the Commonwealth Government. One point in relation to this matter is that the South Australian Government has already produced a document, part of which is based on the report. However, until the report is finally studied hy all the governments concerned and recommendations are made and considered hy the governments it will not be possible to indicate what action will be taken. This may be some months yet. In regard to the other point about visiting the particular area, 1 will see whether that can&#39; be done in the future, and certainly I will contact the honourable member regarding it. </para>

He implied in the answer to that question that I had criticised the Barrier Industrial Council and labour-management relations in Broken Hill. I want to place on record that this was a serious misrepresentation. I have never at any time criticised the Barrier Industrial Council or labour-management relations in Broken Hill. In fact, I have made no public references to Broken Hill at all.

I did the exact opposite to what he claimed. I made a plea for trade unions and trade unionists to be more politically active, not less so. I suggested that they should become more interested in the politics of the nation and of the Parliament than they were in the 19th century, and I commend that to everyone in the nation, particularly at this time. </para>

          </motion>
          <para class="block">There are 2 preliminary things I want to say. The first is that this is not strictly a no confidence motion, nor in fact has the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McMahon)</inline> accepted it as such, it would have been futile to move a no confidence motion because the many Ministers who have been displaced by the right honourable gentleman have all stated that they will not vote in favour of a no confidence motion. It will be noticed that the motion incorporates the sentiments of those honourable and right honourable gentlemen. Accordingly I would imagine it would be open to them to support this motion because it incorporates the matters upon which they have gone on record in all the mass media. 1 also point out thai I was entitled to move this motion to suspend Standing Orders at any time. 1 chose to do so after question time. I believe that not only honourable members but also the public and the media have had an exceptional opportunity of studying the form of the present Prime Minister where he knew that his answers could only be refuted by a Minister - a colleague - breaking his oath or his honourable understanding or where he knew that his answer could only be refuted by a journalist breaking the ethics of his profession. Then he spoke like a trouper. He was very prepared to deny any allegation. He knew that no honourable man could come forward and refute his answer. </para>
          <para>Where, however, it was possible for people to know what was said he was very scrupulous in not giving a straight answer. It is true that he tried to conceal the issue on some occasions. For instance, he knew quite well that I was referring to a speech he made at the Old Sydneians dinner on &#39; 30th July. This was during the week when there were many rumours that the honourable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bury),</inline> the former Foreign Minister, would be relieved of his post and yet the right honourable gentleman volunteered the statement that there was no truth in these rumours. There were 200 gentlemen at this dinner. They will know, . they will have their knowledge reinforced by today&#39;s question time that the right honourable gentleman will say anything to suit his purposes, because he did state that there was no truth in these rumors. There are scores of men in this chamber who know that he was spreading that rumour before and that the rumour was correct. He deliberately tried to obscure the issue by referring to a dinner a week before - 23rd July - a dinner of the old university college which he, and I somewhat later, attended. That was before the execution had been determined for the Foreign Minister, lt was before there were any rumours on the subject at all. </para>
          <para>Furthermore, he then imported an expression of opinion apparently expressed by a gentleman whom he said I had had as my secretary. I never had the particular gentleman as my secretary He is an employee of one Maxwell Newton, and for this purpose I will quote what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Maxwell</inline> Newton said under his signature in the Canberra &#39;Sunday Post&#39; of 2 days ago He said:  lt us: have taken a . tremendous personal effort for Billy-  referring to the right honourable gentleman -  to screw himself up to suck Gorton. In the past Billy has always got other people -  -myself  Alan Reid, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frank</inline> Packer. Warwick Fairfax and many others - to stab his enemies for him while Billy waited in the background until the crisis which others precipitated came to a solution. </para>
          <para class="block">Now, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir. the</inline> important thing that faces this country and which can be resolved by members of this chamber is that this country has been held up to ridicule by the actions of the right honourable gentleman in the 5 months that he has held the top post in this country. </para>
          <para>The events of last March were still a matter of sufficient wonder, perplexity and amusement in the whole of our region when J traversed it a few weeks ago, bur what is the position now? Last Friday the London &#39;Times&#39; published an article on the events in the McMahon Administration. We have this extraordinary situation where the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party, the third man in the governmental heirarchy, the Minister for Defence, the previous Prime Minister, a man who was better known than his colleagues in our region, has been summarily dismissed although the article which he was writing, asserted to be in breach of Cabinet solidarity and unity, was in the Prime Minister&#39;s hands at 4.30 the afternoon before it was made available to the public. It was not appropriate to speak to the right honourable gentleman. Of course, like everybody the Prime Minister was able to see it fresh on the Sunday but he did not move till the Thursday. He stood back while a public scandal and hue and cry were aroused against his Deputy and&#39; throughout that time - through all those days; Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday - they were at arm&#39;s length. A man who is ever ready to resort to the telephone did not use that magic instrument for 6 days to speak to his deputy. </para>
          <para>Then the other victim - less conspicuous but nevertheless chosen by the &#39; right honourable gentleman- not chosen as a Minister because he was the Deputy Leader of his Party and therefore had to be in the Ministry but chosen b&#62; him as Foreign Minister, his own selection - was dismissed in this humiliating way. As far as Australia is concerned overseas can there be more striking examples of how we must stand? In the course of these few months the Minister for Defence and the Minister for&#39; Foreign Affairs have both been dismissed. </para>
          <para>On the second last day that this Parliament salee in the previous sessional period the right honourable gentleman similarly faced a motion criticising him, a motion of no confidence. After one of the longest winter recesses in the history of the Parliament he yet again is under censure. No Prime Minister in the history of federation has had this experience. Both these motions - the motion of 5th May and this one - have this in common: They spring directly from the conduct of the Prime Minister. Of course, the &#34;rime Minister will say these matters are matters of personality. The fact is that when he was given by my Deputy the opportunity to deny that there had been any breaches of policy by the right honourable member for </para>
          <para class="block">Higgins <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Gorton)</inline> and the  Honourable  member for Wentworth in their posts of Defence and Foreign Affairs he just slid away from the question. He does not suggest that the Ministers who were dismissed were dismissed because they had at any time misstated the policy of his government. He just does not  like  them. It is a matter of personality that they were sacked. It is worth recalling the words  of  my no confidence motion moved last May: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Prime Minister lacks the confidence of this House in that he has broken undertakings to keep the public informed of what the Government is doing and has been responsible for suppressing debate in the House on what the Government is doing. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The House will recall that the whole tenor of the debate which then ensued was about the question of the trust that could be put in the Prime Minister and the undertaking he gives, and basically this present debate must be about that same question, the question whether one can trust this Prime Minister. 1 wish to put to the House 2&#39; propositions. This is a Prime Minister who has not the trust of his own Party and who has not and cannot have the trust of this House. It was an exquisite experience  to  watch the former Ministers - Ministers whom he has dismissed - looking at him when he gave his answers this afternoon and to see the intensity, to use as neutral a term as one can properly use on this occasion, that they showed as they listened  to  his replies. </para>

              <para>- I will concede that the right honourable gentleman&#39;s expression, indicated incomprehension. Consequent to these 2 propositions and more important than either of them is a third proposi  tion -  that he has not and cannot have the trust of this nation and is totally unfit to be the leader of this nation. I do not expect honourable members opposite to accept my opinions on these matters. Today they have, for  the  first time for 7 years, amongst them on their back bench - a back bench which, if I  may  say so, is the most remarkable and distinguished that this Parliament  has  seen - one whose words they may think merit deep consideration. It is true that I can quote from newspapers, radio and television the comments by the right honourable member for Higgins, the honourable member for Berowra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hughes)</inline> and the honourable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen)</inline> but I will content myself with the usually non-polemic comments of the honourable member for Went worth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bury)</inline> who said on 11th August that as far as the Liberal Party as a whole goes: </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I  think the real difficulty of the Liberal Party  at  the moment is to produce an acceptable, satisfactory leader. One who carries general conviction and is trusted by the majority of the Party.  The honourable member for Wentworth had special reasons for making this statement. Those of us who know him know very well that he is almost the last man in this House who would walk out of a post, who would talk out of turn or out of spleen or out of a sense of vindictiveness but he does know, as we all know, 2 facts about his dismissal as Minister for Foreign Affairs. The first is that for several days before his dismissal the Prime Minister was trying to condition the Press - not just the journalists upstairs but their proprietors and editors in Sydney and Melbourne - to the view that the honourable member for Wentworth was a sick man and consequently unable adequately to fulfil his duties. The former Minister went out of his way to deny this allegation. It gives me great pleasure to say that I have never seen him looking so hale; nor have I read comments in which he has shown so much spirit. The second matter of which he is aware, because he represents a great number who were there, is the statement that the Prime Minister made at his old boys&#39; dinner about him.  His  dismissal was only the overture; it was the prelude to what was to happen in the ensuing fortnight. </para>
          <para>Everyone now knows the full significance of the article which appeared in the &#39;Daily Telegraph&#39; on Monday, 2nd August and which read: </para>

          <para class="block">Few of us are now in any doubt about the relationship between the Prime Minister and the &#39;Daily Telegraph*. There is no doubt in my mind that this was an inspired story - inspired by the Prime Minister. The right honourable member for Higgins - the right honourable John Grey Gorton, Companion of Honour, Privy Councillor, former Minister for the Navy, former Minister for Education and Science, former Prime Minister, former Minister for Defence, former Leader of the Liberal Party, former  Deputy  Leader of the Liberal Party - should have seen the portent and should have recognised the ominous sign. What we now know is that the Prime Minister and the organisation which contributed so largely to his being Prime Minister had given the ultimate thumbs down sign. It was only a matter of time and opportunity. The right honourable member for Higgins himself provided the opportunity. He did the unconscionable thing. He did what every politician in England, the United States and Australia has an acknowledged right to do. He wrote an article, or in this case undertook to write a series of articles in his own name and in his case in his own defence. It is absurd and monstrous to suggest that this in itself was in some way a breach of ethics. It has even been put around by the Prime Minister&#39;s agents that there was some special impropriety in the case of the right honourable member for Higgins because he accepted some payment for his articles. It is in fact the most common practice in the world and I myself have adopted it from time to time and will continue to do so on every suitable occasion. As the right honourable member for Higgins has pointed out, Deakin himself - a name not to be mentioned in this House without summoning up the ideas of integrity and propriety - was writing articles throughout the whole of his political career, including the years of his great prime ministership. </para>
          <para>The Prime Minister himself wrote an article only a few months ago which appeared in the Melbourne &#39;Sun&#39;, in defence of apartheid and racially selected sporting tours. I assume that he was paid as I was by that organisation for an article in the contrary sense. So let us have none of this hypocrisy that there was something improper in the action of the right honourable member for Higgins in writing his articles. The key to the whole matter is not what was in the first article but the reaction of the Prime Minister to it. He did nothing on the whole of the late afternoon and the night before the article appeared in the newspaper. He did nothing between that Sunday and the following Thursday. He was spending the time with his great friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Eric</inline> Robinson,  President  of the Queensland Branch of the Liberal Party, on the Isle of Capri at Surfers Paradise. There are 100 businessmen and journalists around Australia who could give evidence that they received calls from the Prime Minister at that time. Some were asked for advice;, some were asked for help. The advice sought was how to get rid of John Gorton. The help sought was how to pour a bucket on him; There are around this country dozens of men- great Liberal supporters - who have been appalled by the spectacle of a man in this top position so demeaning himself and his position-. They are the men who will not be contributing to the Liberal Party funds for the next election, whenever it comes. But he. was determined,- like other Little- Caesars, to destroy the right honourable member for Higgins and he sat there on the Isle <inline font-style="italic">of</inline> Capri plotting his destruction - Tiberius with a telephone. </para>
          <para class="block"> But on Monday 9th August, a firm clear political event occurred. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frank</inline> Packer agreed to be interviewed by the Australian Broadcasting Commission. At any time this would have been one of the most extraordinary coups in Australian journalism - the avowed enemy of the ABC agreeing to appear on the very sort of programme to whose destruction &#39; his organisation is most committed. The programme was &#39;P.M.&#39;, the radio version of This Day Tonight&#39;. On that programme <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frank</inline> Packer was asked: </para>

          <para class="block">
            <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frank</inline>Packer was asked: </para>

          <para class="block">In the words of the right honourable member for Higgins the Prime Minister was given his riding instructions and again in the words of the former Prime Minister from the horse&#39;s mouth*. Of course the Prime Minister would assert that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frank</inline> Packer&#39;s advice and his own decision were wholly coincidental. There is not one honourable member in this House who would believe it. All of us here know very well, and the public outside is becoming increasingly aware of, the sinister relationship between the Prime Minister and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frank</inline> Packer. We have the evidence that Consolidated Press itself gave ostensibly in its own defence only last Sunday in a full page apologia headed The Telegraph and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gorton&#39;,</inline> sub-headed &#39;Setting the Record Straight&#39; in the following words: </para>
          <para>Australian Consolidated Press gave <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gorton</inline> consistent support throughout his prime minis,tership. The company&#39;s papers supported <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Goc-</inline> - ton at the time of the leadership struggle after the death of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Holt.</inline> At this time <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frank</inline> Packer was abroad, but was kept in touch with affairs over the telephone by his Editor-in-Chief, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr D.</inline> McNicoll. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frank</inline> was informed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McNicoll</inline> that there seemed little likelihood of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McMahon&#39;s</inline> being elected leader and that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gorton</inline> was favourably regarded. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frank</inline> asked <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McNicoll</inline> to speak to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gorton</inline> and inquire whether, if he became leader, he would retain <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McMahon</inline> in the Treasury. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McNicoll</inline> had a private conversation with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gorton</inline> at the home&#39; of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr W.</inline> C. Wentworth and explained the situation to ohn. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gorton</inline> said that he admired <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McMahon&#39;s</inline> ability and capacity for hard work, and that if he <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Gorton)</inline> got the leadership there was no reason to think he would not do what he could to put <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McMahon</inline> in the &#39; Treasury. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McNicoll</inline> reported this to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frank</inline> Packer in Acapulco The Telegraph organisation then gave strong support to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gorton</inline> for tha&#39; leadership. </para>
          <para>What this statement asserts, of course, is that Consolidated Press nominated its candidate for the Treasurership of the Commonwealth of Australia. (Extension of time granted) One could hardly have a more frightening example of outside influence - influence not just inferred, not just implied, not just suspected, but influence real; ostensible, actual, blatant, at the highest level of affairs. The agent of a newspaper proprietor nominated who would be Treasurer of this country. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frank</inline>Packer has justified himself by saying that he admires the present Prime Minister. I am sure he does. What he has not said and what perhaps explains a great deal about his sponsorship, protection and promotion of the Prime Minister is the long association in business and politics which the 2 gentlemen have had. It has been a relationship which has extended over nearly 40 years. I do not condemn it. I think one must pay tribute to the mutual loyalty and fidelity which these gentlemen have shown to each other. It has been a long and fruitful association. In 1932 Frank Packer still had his way to make, even though he was the vigorous son of a forceful father, and in that year he formed a company - &#34;his first company. He called it Sydney Newspapers Pty Ltd&#39;. It was incorporated on 8th November 1932. It is a moving experience to read in the original copy of the memorandum and articles of association listing the people &#39;who are desirous of being formed into a company*, that amongst the names of investors who paid their pound is one William McMahon, student, University of Sydney, and a lady&#39;s name, presumably that of a relative. It was that company which helped to lay the foundations of the present Packer empire. </para>
          <para>Those who have a sense of history and symmetry may find .some satisfaction in knowing that that company formed so long ago - nearly 40 years ago- still survives and, since 3rd March 1955, has been registered in the Australian Capital Territory. If one looks up the phone book one can see that the name of that company, to which William McMahon, student, so long ago paid his simple pound as an original shareholder, is now listed with the most prestigious address - Parliament House. Its resident manager is listed as: <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Alan</inline> Reid, 7 Hunter Street, Yarralumla. </para>
          <para>There are very great and pressing reasons why we must have an election now. The honourable member for Wentworth has already spoken about the untrustworthiness of the Prime Minister as Leader of the Liberal Party. There will undoubtedly be various reasons given why we cannot have an election now. Let me state forthwith that Supply has been voted until the end of November. We can very readily, if we wish, this week enact any improvements in social services or any grants of rural relief, and there does not then have to be another election until June 1974 when elections for the 2 Houses could be synchronised and when, as my </para>
          <para class="block">Party certainly would do, the people could be asked at a referendum to see that all future elections were synchronised. </para>
          <para>But the really serious thing for us as  a  nation is that the Prime Minister is untrustworthy as the leader of this nation. On 1 1th July the Prime Minister said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>China has served the Liberal Party well  and  will continue to serve it well. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">One could hardly conceive a more wicked, irresponsible, outrageous statement, than that the relations of this country with a nation comprising a quarter of the world&#39;s population should be seen simply and solely in terms of the domestic advantage of the Liberal Party. This is a recipe for national disaster. It highlights and epitomises the real evil of the continuance of the present Government under its present leadership. The Liberal Party is not an evil party. It is a great party. It is part of the great democratic framework and structure of this nation. British democracy depends on the 2-party system, and the . 2 parties, which must be healthy if we are to have parliamentary democracy in this country, are the Labor Party and the Liberal Party. The health of the Liberal Party and its survival as the representative of the great, real and legitimate conservative forces in our country is essential for the survival of parliamentary democracy in this country. I want to see the Liberal Party survive. It is the legitimate representative of valuable conservatism just as much as we are the legitimate representative of progress and change. But what appeals me and what 1 assure this House will, if not challenged, destroy the Liberal Party as assuredly as it will damage parliamentary democracy is the vested interest that this Government under its present Leader believes it has in things bad and evil for this country. Up to the events of  a  fortnight ago everyone knew that the present Prime Minister wanted an early election. He was pressing for it. He particularly wanted that election to take place round about November - in, as he said, the second week of November which he thought would be about the time of the first test match between Australia and South Africa. He was thinking of an election in the framework of great violence, bitterness and disruption in our community. He wanted these things to occur. He wanted a very evil thing to happen in our nation, to our people, to the social fabric of our country. He wants it. He is pressing for it. </para>
          <para>Until a week ago he- was pressuring <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Donald</inline> Bradman, in whose hands the decision lies because the Australian Cricket Board of Control is evenly divided on the matter, to have this test, not in the interests of cricket, clearly against the interests of Australia, clearly against the sense of unity and good will that we have in Australia, but in the interests, as he sees them, of the Liberal Party. 1 hope that the Liberal Party is greater than this. I cannot believe that the Liberal Party - <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies&#39; Liberal Party&#34; - would have a bar of deliberately dividing this country in this way, on this issue. Yet this is what this Prime Minister is planning to do. He has a vested interest in industrial disruption, with all its loss economically and socially and indeed spiritually in this country. Yet he courts it. He wants it. </para>
          <para>We have reached this incredible stage where a government has a vested interest in the bad that can happen in a. country aud has actively and openly encouraged the bad to happen. There is no future for such a government. There is no future for a nation governed by such a government. There are men on the other side who know very well and who feel very deeply the truth of what 1 am now saying. An extraordinary chain of events put the present right honourable gentleman into office as Prime Minister. It was a dreadful mistake. It was a mistake imperilling this nation. To recover the consequences of that mistake would not destroy the great Liberal Party. If we must take a partisan point of view, I find the words of the honourable member for Wentworth unexceptional. </para>
          <para>I am sure that if the Opposition were in power for a short while there would be a terrific reaction. As it got to work and applied its policies there would be a traffic reaction against it which would have the effect of building up the then Opposition. Opposition really works best when there is something people really feel violently about and really feel they must oppose. This would certainly have a tonic effect on the people who support our viewpoint but are not so keen on us from a personal angle. (Extension of time granted) </para>
          <para>That is the attitude expressed in the mass media by the honourable member for </para>
          <para class="block">Wentworth, an honourable gentleman who has been a Minister for 10 years. But so have they all been Ministers of great experience. The former Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party, the former Minister for Defence, the former Prime Minister, has held office continuously for nearly 13 years in this country. The other Ministers whom the present Prime Minister has dismissed are men of considerable skill, as anybody in this chamber would acknowledge and as anybody knowing the courts would also acknowledge. What these men have said in public is the view of increasing numbers of Liberal supporters in this country. They know quite well that under this Prime Minister their Party as well as this country is going from bad to worse, and they realise that the only way to sweep out the men of the past, to sweep out the ideas of the past, is for them to go into opposition. </para>
          <para>I put it that there are men in this chamber on the Government side who realise that to have an election now. for the Opposition to become the Government and for the Liberal Party to go into opposition, is the best chance of having a proper cohesive government in this country. I put it to them that if they vote for this motion they will not destroy the Liberal Party but rather they will give it a lease of life. I want it to have a new lease of life because 1 recognise the significance to our community and our nation of the other partner in our 2-party system of government. 1 beg them to save the Liberal Party, but further and more important is the fact that this country cannot do well if we continue upon our present course. We cannot continue with a Government which desires disaster. I ask honourable members opposite to consider this: If you vote for this motion, I most firmly believe that you will help to save not only the Liberal Party but also Australia. </para>

            <para>- On another occasion I described the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> as an extraordinarily feline person. I have no wish to change my views after today. 1 have every intention of trying to deal with the facts, and I want to mention the constructive actions that have been taken by this Government, whether it has been Jed by the right honourable member for Higgins <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Gorton)</inline> or by myself. I want to mention what we are doing to ensure the greatness of this country. I have no intention to degenerate into personalities in the way that the Leader of the Opposition, this feline person, has done. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Let me mention one or two facts. Not one of the statements that the honourable gentleman made about me is true in substance. Let me deal first of all with the question of my association with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frank</inline> Packer over 40 years. It is true that on 8th November 1932 or somewhere about that time I did sign the memorandum and articles of association of his company. I was then an articled clerk in Allen, Allen and Hems ley. I had never met Frank Packer; I had never met his associates. I did not know who he was. The men to whom I was clerking. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Norman</inline> Cowper and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Arthur</inline> Hemsley, asked me to sign the document. Of course I signed it. Any person with a knowledge of law and a knowledge of the way companies are formed would have done exactly as I did. </para>
          <para>Secondly, the Leader of the Opposition referred to the statement relating to the so called payment for the articles that had been written by the right honourable member for Higgins. I did not ask the right honourable member whether he was being paid. For a fact, I did not think he was. But I see no reason in the world why I should ask him, particularly after I had read the article. It was no business of mine. If people want to ask him, he can be asked and I am sure he will give the kind of answer that he feels appropriate to be given. </para>
          <para>The honourable gentleman also referred to the fact that in some article in the Daily Telegraph&#39; there was a forecast of some further action to be taken. I will give the author of that article complete liberty to state positively, without any recrimination from me, whether he had discussed this matter with me or had let me know that the article was to be written. No member of the &#39;Daily Telegraph&#39; contacted me prior to the publication of the article, and in fact I had not talked to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Alan</inline></para>
          <para class="block">Reid for at least 3 weeks prior to that, and I have not spoken to him since his return from Fiji. This is the kind of rumour and nastiness that are inherent in the mind of the honourable gentleman. I intend for the rest to ignore them completely and to get on with the job of governing this country and doing the best we can to contribute to its greatness. </para>
          <para>The Leader of the Opposition referred to the fact that during the last session he also moved a censure motion on me. He has lost no time for a second one although we wanted to give him more time for his censure motion. I repeat that he is not only showing his inherent nastiness but is also attempting to obstruct the business of this House and is trying to prevent us from getting on with the constructive work of government. This is the device of a man and a party with nothing to offer and a great deal to be ashamed of. When the Minister for Foreign Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr N. H. Bowen)</inline> brings forward his paper on foreign affairs, I for one will participate in the debate, and I believe that I will be able to show not only that the Leader of the Opposition is dangerous to the security of this country but that wherever he went on his recent overseas trip he created an impression which was bad for Australia and which brought him into ridicule. I believe that in every country he visited be left a most unfavourable, even bad, impression. </para>

              <para>- This is the device of a man and a party with nothing to offer and a great deal to be ashamed of. It is the attitude of a party that has been conditioned by 22 years on the Opposition benches to think only destructively. &#34;Obviously it has no mind for constructive contributions to the work of Parliament and it has no stomach, as I said before, for facts, lt prefers to perform by innuendo, suspicion and false statement. Let this be known: We in the Liberal-Country Party Government want to get on with the real business of government. We believe that Australia is a country with a tremendous future. We know that the people are sound at heart and we know that they are sensible, lt is our task to represent them here in this Parliament, and we mast not be diverted from that task by tawdry personal issues raised by the Opposition. We must take initiatives in nation building on their behalf. We are doing that and we will continue to do it. </para>

          <para>The Leader of the Opposition is upset because I have made some ministerial changes. . What has this to do with him? This is the business of the Government, and we do not want him interfering with what are exclusively our affairs. He has plenty to do trying to get his own Party into shape - and, if I can go a stage further, in coming to terms with the  President  of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, who keeps rocking the boat with his excursions into what should be the Labor Parly&#39;s exclusive preserves. It has been said - and I repeat this again thai I am influenced by the Press. I have been in Parliament a long time. I have held a great number of portfolios - more. I . think, than any other person in the House. 1 make up my own mind what I personally should do in the interests of the nation, not in the interests of anyone else. Of course. I listen to advice from my colleagues in the Ministry, in the Cabinet and in my Party. I have consultations with industry. 1 meet the Press and I meet th, people. But of this honourable members may be sure: I have never taken and will never take any action designed to please the Press people. I suppose that I have had more quarrels with them than has any other person in this House. Of course, on many occasions they have been in praise of me. If we look over the long term. I think the criticism has been pretty strong too. But who in this .House has not gone through exactly the same experiences? </para>
          <para>The second point that is referred to by the Leader of the Opposition is that nf leadership. I and my former colleague know  - we are probably the only 2 in this House who do know - that it carries very great responsibilities. But 1 want to ask&#39; this question: What leadership does the honourable member for Werriwa give to his Party today? This is the man who incited young men inducted for national service ro refuse to serve in Vietnam when it was their duty to do so. This is the man who approved the attempt by some unions to interfere with the legitimate trade of this country. This is the man who gave tacit support to the left wing unions and the professional dissenters during the recent rugby tour. This is the man who went tq China to play party politics with wheat and finished up by being a total advocate for the policy of a foreign power - the greatest Communist power in Asia. </para>
          <para>The Budget that the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Snedden)</inline> will bring down tonight involves a motion of real substance. The motion before the House this afternoon has none. The Budget presents fiscal policy and an explanation of monetary policy for Australia for the whole of 1971-72. It is therefore a paramount importance and should be treated accordingly, lt is right, 1 know, for the Leader of the Opposition to talk about unity arid good government. We talk about it. But we talk about it because we know what it means and we know the contribution we will be able to make. They are. 1 believe, the qualities that a well ordered country needs and that, I believe, Australia is getting in full measure from the Liberal-Country Part)&#39; Government. </para>
          <para class="block"> Let me remind honourable members of the performance of- my Government in recent months, lt has been here just on 5 months and in that time it has brought down a solid list of domestic legislation. It has broken completely new ground in foreign affairs. It has tackled a range of problems, not of its own making, including inflation and the fall in the price of wool, which are pressing heavily on the country today. 1 believe that they will be dealt with effectively, providing we can have continuity and steadiness in government. I believe, too, that it is of importance to make the federal system of government work effectively. That great spirit of free enterprise which has served Australia so well through all its history should not be stifled by controls and directions from Canberra. </para>
          <para>I have said that we believe in cooperation as the basis for unity. In 5 months we have established, I believe, a new relationship with the States. What we did, in addition, was to give them a general growth tax. We gave them payroll tax which was designed to stop them from coming to Canberra cap in hand and begging us to give them increasing access to funds. I emphasise that what we have done all this while is to continue the development of this country and we have also - this will be reflected in the Budget tonight - developed policies which are directed at reducing inflationary pressures because inflation is one of our greatest problems. Success here is the basis on which we can successfully plan for the future. </para>
          <para>We must contain and, I believe, we must reverse the serious escalation of costs and prices. We have begun investigations as to how arbitration procedures might be improved. We have done this to give greater emphasis in wage decisions to the economic consequences of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission&#39;s awards. We have also investigated what broader measures we might take to bring about the needed restraints in wage increases and in wage costs. We have come to grips with the crisis in some of our rural industries, particularly in the case of wool. Already, we have adopted reconstruction and special aid policies in order to assist them. We have reduced the migrant intake to contain costs and to allow a greater concentration on personal quality. We have passed legislation controlling resale price maintenance and we are reviewing the Trade Practices Act so that we can strengthen it and encourage much more vigorous competition. </para>
          <para>On the advice of the Tariff Board the Government also has accepted the need for a systematic review of tariffs and this is proceeding. My Government has also reviewed important aspects of social welfare. We have done so because we consider it a prime duty to do more for the needy and the neglected. We want to clean out the pockets of poverty wherever they appear. The effective development of an adequate social welfare system, to which I have pledged my Government, depends heavily on a good working arrangement between the Commonwealth and the States. That is another reason why our new understanding with the States is so important. </para>
          <para>In March we gave pensioners a supplementary increase. We did so because we thought social justice demanded a rise to offset the sharp increase in living costs which was causing unexpected hardship. We also secured a satisfactory arrangement with the Australian Medical Association about fees to make the revised medical benefits scheme operate effectively, and we overhauled hospital insurance benefits to give a more extensive cover to fund members. So many of these activities bear on the quality of life which must be of increasing concern to everyone in Australia. We are, after all, searching for a quality of life which will be better than the one that we have today. This is the end objective of all our efforts, because the quality of life is just about everything that belongs to and relates to man. It is his place in the environment - the good he does, how he lives with his neighbours and the measures of his contentment - but at the same time we must preserve our freedoms and our civil liberties. (Extension of time granted) We must tackle the congestion and pollution of our cities. Now, having said that, I turn briefly to our record in foreign affairs. The Minister for Foreign Affairs will deal with the subject in detail later - I hope tomorrow but at the latest on Thursday. </para>

              <para>- What does the so-called censure motion have to do with the House? As I said, the Foreign Minister will deal with the subject later. In the past 5 months we have made considerable progress with the prospect of getting our troops home from Vietnam as the operation there winds down. You will recall, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, that</inline> 1 announced further withdrawals at the end of March. I will state the Government&#39;s policy in the House this week. We have completed new appraisals of our relations with Japan, Russia and China. These appraisals took place over a year or more but they have brought us to new decisions in respect of all 3 countries in the last few months. 1 will not repeat them now. They speak well for our future in the international community. </para>

          <para>Our aid programmes particularly in the Asian and the Pacific region continue at a high level. We have also made progress with the 5-power defence arrangements for Malaysia-Singapore and we have become a member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. What contribution has the Opposition made to national progress? Absolutely none. Indeed, by its actions and its abstentions it has aggravated the problems of the day. The Labor Party has encouraged a contempt for law and order and the rights of individual citizens. A clear example can be seen on the industrial scene and the increase in political strikes. We have had a rash of industrial strikes and stoppages which last year cost the work force nearly S31m in wages. The loss to the nation in output and the consequent effect on prices is enormous. We must not forget that the number of man days lost by individual disputes has gone up <inline font-style="italic">2i</inline> times in the last 3 years. Now, I want the House to answer this question: What has the Leader of the Opposition done about this? The answer is positive - nothing at all. In all of this he has been silent, and by his silence he has given consent. He has stood by helplessly while his authority has been eroded and his bailiwick invaded by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bob</inline> Hawke, the  President  of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, another leader who is causing responsible people in the trade union movement a great deal of activity. Another question 1 want to pose is this: Who is really speaking for Labor? It is not a question of who runs the country; it is a question of who runs the Labor Party. </para>

          <para>Let me return to the overseas visit by the Leader of the Opposition. He went on a disastrous - I use the word deliberately - visit to Peking after he had given his tacit support to protests against the South African football tour. In China he conceded every single point the Chinese made to him, and he did so in public. This was a disservice to Australia without any precedent.  His  performance is written into the record for all to read and for history to see. More will be said about China in the foreign affairs debate this session, but let me say just this: I believe his visit compromised discussions which the Australian Wheat Board was just about to begin with the Chinese when he announced his intention to go to China. I believe he compromised the first moves we were making through diplomatic channels to open up a dialogue with China. As a result of some cocktail gossip with a foreign representative in China, he caused more havoc than any man could have caused either in Australia or in any other part of the world. I believe it is the first time in Australia&#39;s history that a Leader of the Opposition has been the total advocate for another country&#39;s cause. I believe it is also the first time that any Australian political leader has presumed to tell other countries how they should run their business, and he did so publicly. He discredited the  President  of the United States of America by telling him he would be kicked out. He told Japan that it should cancel its treaties. Later when I have an opportunity to speak in the foreign affairs debate I will disclose more of his tactics and more of the mischief he has caused. </para>
          <para>I have visited every State in Australia - some several times - in the last few months. I have seen great progress in national development wherever I have <inline font-style="italic">been.</inline> As I went around I became aware that many people are deeply troubled by some of . the&#39; trends developing in Australia today. They are concerned with the increase in industrial disputes and lawlessness. They are concerned about the issue  01  law and order. They want to retain their right to dissent, but they do not want their civil liberties interfered with by mass protests or professionally promoted demonstrations. They do not want their right of choice within the law interfered with. They expect their parliamentarians to take note oi these issues and to give them a lead. This, I believe, my Government is doing and is doing with strength. </para>
          <para>May &#91; now return to the principles relating  10  constitutional law and practice? So much doubt has been cast these days on the Cabinet system that I felt it would be appropriate for me to make some statement about it. Of course, it is the Opposition&#39;s policy to cheapen and denigrate Cabinet. But 1 have another attitude altogether, and a far better one. I affirm my faith In the principle of Cabinet government. It is central to my own Administration. lt is the &#39; practice which best suits the executive in our democratic parliamentary system. It must work effectively, whether as a Cabinet, as a ministry or through the system of committees which has recently been reconstructed, it parliamentary democracy is to be sustained. My concern as Prime Minister relates to policy. Cabinet is the proper instrument for the development of that policy. A change in party leadership and Ministers does not invalidate the Government&#39;s authority, lt has not done so in the past and it does not do so now. It is the coalition Government of the Liberal Party and the Country Party which the people put back into office less than 2 years ago. (Extension of time granted) It is the coalition Government thai I lead, and its authority continues in for celt has operated and will continue to operate with due respect to law and with due respect to process in the area of the Cabinet system, in the relationship with the Slate* and with the electorate. </para>
          <para>I can understand the disappointment of the Opposition that a change in leadership, and the other changes that have been made, have not brought about some reduction in our capacity to govern, our intention to govern or our right to&#39; govern. The motion that is before the House is, I believe, a product of that disappointment. A similar motion was moved in vain in March when I took over- as Prime Minister. I repeat that today&#39;s motion will be in vain. I am perfectly confident that the people of Australia understand what I am saying. They understand, firstly, that they gave us authority to govern and that we still have that authority. They understand, secondly, that we are thoroughly capable to exercise that authority to their satisfaction. They understand.&#39; thirdly, that it would he folly to transfer this authority to another party unqualified and totally unable to discharge it effectively. 1 suspect they understand that the whole of today&#39;s exercise by the Opposition is nothing else but humbug. </para>
          <para>I must remind the House that we are known abroad in the great majority of countries. Despite what the Leader of the Opposition said, we have given this country great national responsibility and stable and progressive administration over a period now running into 22 years, close to a quarter of a century. This is known and respected overseas, as it is here. This administration is not upset by changes in leadership, by ministerial rearrangements or by any statements  the Leader of the Opposition might make. 1 want to state to you positively. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, that</inline> you will see evidence of unity in this Government. You will find that the Liberal Party which T lead, with the Country Party standing behind us. will give to this country the kind of government that it needs and which will take it to a very much higher destiny than we know at the moment or thai the Labor Party could ever think was realistically possible. </para>

The motion was in these terms: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>That, in the opinion of this House, the Prime Minister&#39;s methods and motives in removing his Ministers and his subservience to outside influence have destroyed trust in his Government at home and abroad. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Prime Minister made no attempt to answer the charge that he had removed from office a former Prime Minister and former Minister for Defence, as well as a former Minister for Foreign Affairs. The Prime Minister made no attempt to justify his actions. </para>
          <para>It should be remembered that the former Prime Minister, who was also the former Minister for Defence - I refer to the right honourable member for Higgins <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Gorton)</inline> - had a mandate from the people to govern this country. The present Prime Minister has no such mandate. Therefore, it is understandable that he ignored completely the charges that had been made by the Leader of the Opposition. </para>
          <para>The Government has not stumbled into a constitutional crisis on the floor of the House. All the difficulties which now confront it are the product of a  3-month  recess, one of the longest in the history of the Australian Parliament. The Government cannot claim to have had more than its legitimate share of the plain bad luck which often be devils all political parties. Its troubles are not even in the strictest sense party troubles; that is, they do not flow from internal turmoil within either the Liberal Party or the Country Party. The present Government crisis has been produced by one simple fact - the disintegration of Cabinet government in this country. Quite obviously the traditional Westminster pattern of Cabinet government with all the conventions that have been built into the system by centuries of practice is not functioning. There are  2  reasons for this tragic disintegration of a Cabinet which under <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies was monolithic. The first is that senior members of the Cabinet have not trusted each other and have worked actively to destroy each other. The second is that key portfolios in the Cabinet have been dealt round in the&#39; past  5  months like a series of poker hands, thereby destroying all sense of stability and continuity of policy. </para>
          <para>The convulsions in the Cabinet in the past few weeks have been transmitted through the rest of the Ministry, through both Government parties, through the Public Service and now through the electorate. This bitter internal fighting within the Cabinet has exacted a bitter toll of a Government which is clearly at the end of its human resources. A Cabinet which is incapable of operating as a confederation of equals hammering out consensus policies is incapable of governing. The motion for the suspension of Standing Orders, which was accepted by the Prime Minister, is intended to put these matters before the House for its deliberation and its decision. </para>
          <para>There have been various labels put on the operation of the Federal Cabinet in the past few months. The most apt and certainly the most colourful of them is the description by the honourable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bury),</inline> the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, who likened Cabinet to a leaking sieve. It is not possible to state exactly when this process of decay began within this Cabinet. Certainly the seeds had been sown by the end of  1967.  In his early months as Prime Minister the present right honourable member for Higgins, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gorton,</inline> seemed to arrest this drift and capture the loyalty of his Cabinet. However as his term proceeded the process of erosion continued and gradually mounted. Towards the end of his tenure the leaks had accumulated into a deluge which has persisted in the  5  months the present Prime Minister has been in office. </para>
          <para>There is little point in going through the leaks which the right honourable member for Higgins has documented, and, it seems, will continue to document since his elevation from the floor of this House to the Press Gallery. The right honourable gentleman and former Prime Minister has made it perfectly plain that he was betrayed by members of his Cabinet. Ironically this had the effect of procuring his own dismissal from Cabinet with the rather grim satisfaction of making his point in the strongest possible terms. The pity of the right honourable gentleman&#39;s dismissal is that he was doing a reasonable job as Minister for Defence, a portfolio ideally suited to his experience and administrative capacity. Certainly during his brief time at Russell Hill there was none of the rancour and turbulence between the defence administration and the Services which marred the closing months of the term of the honourable member for Wannon <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser} as Defence Minister.</inline></para>
          <para>The right honourable member for Higgins&#39; handling of the Kerr Committee&#39;s report will benefit many thousands of servicemen, although it seems important recommendations have also been shelved, lt has even been reported that the Prime Minister privately paid tribute to the way the right honourable member for Higgins was shaping in defence. But because of a political feud unparalleled in Australian political history, the right honourable member for Higgins had to go despite his acknowledged competence. This means there have been three Ministers for Defence within 5 months. It is no reflection on the present Minister to say that this unjustified reshuffling puts impossible demands on the whole defence structure. A process of reconstruction and reform of the defence structure was initiated 3 years ago by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Allen</inline> Fairhall who was then Minister in tandem with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Bland who was then permanent head of the Department. This was continued by the honourable member for Wannon and presumably the member for Higgins when they occupied the defence office. Now this major reorganisation is to proceed under the new Minister. </para>
          <para>The other important unfinished business in this Department is the reforms flowing from the recommendations of the Kerr Committee. This Committee into service pay and conditions was appointed by the honourable member for Wannon as Defence Minister. Some of the recommendations of the Committee&#39;s interim report were accepted by the right honourable member for Higgins and are contained in the Budget. Now this whole process of improving pay and conditions has been thrown into jeopardy by the appointment of a new Minister. How can there be any stability and sense of security in such an important and sensitive area as the armed Services when this sort of ministerial hurly-burly is in train? The Kerr Committee was initiated by one Minister who should have been permitted to oversee it and supervise the introduction of its recommended reforms. At the very least his successor should have been given full scope to do this important job. Instead a third Minister comes fresh to this sensitive area at a most crucial time. Who is to say that there will not be a fourth within a couple of months? The new Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Fairbairn)</inline> resigned once before after a difference with his then Prime Minister. There is no gainsaying that he will not do it again. The effect of these rapid changes must be to confuse the processes of reform in the defence administration and in the pay and conditions of servicemen. It will do nothing to stop the haemorrhage of officers and skilled men from the armed Services. </para>
          <para>Another vital issue of policy affected by this constant chopping and changing is the timing of Australian withdrawal from Vietnam. This has been one of the most virulent issues in the protracted controversy about leaks from Cabinet. It was revealed in a &#39;Sydney Morning Herald&#39; story on 30th July and never denied that the remaining two battalions would be out by Christmas. This brought forward by 4 months the expected and accepted date for liquidation of the Australian commitment. This was a blatant and quite deliberate leak; the motivation can only be guessed at. However it is common knowledge that the Prime Minister was holding this decision up his sleeve for a big grandstanding performance in this Parliament. He thought that withdrawal from Vietnam by Christmas would be a possible vote-winner. It points up the cynical calibre of this Government that it could win votes on committing troops to Vietnam and then hope to win votes by withdrawing them. In any case the Prime Minister had the ground sliced neatly from under his feet by the early release of what he assumed was a tightly kept Cabinet secret. The personal frustration this leak seems to have produced in the Prime Minister may well have hastened his aspirations to do away with his Defence Minister. </para>
          <para>The Prime Minister already felt that the right honourable member for Higgins had pre-empted his ground by early release of the Kerr Committee report. There had also been persistent reports that the term of national service would be cut back from 2 years to 18 months. Undoubtedly these reports are true; undoubtedly they were leaked. This built in the Prime Minister&#39;s mind the belief that the right honourable member for Higgins was white-anting him and precipitated the remarkable events of last week. It is impossible not to feel sorry for the former Prime Minister and Minister for Defence for his slip of the pen. The pretext on which his dismissal was based was an extremely flimsy one. It took the Prime Minister 5 days of constant telephoning to drum up the appropriate editorial climate for his action. Despite simulated outrage of. much of the Press and members of the Liberal Party, it is common knowledge that as late as Wednesday afternoon, the Prime Minister still had not summoned the fortitude to sack the Minister for Defence. It was a case of letting &#39;I dare not wait upon I would&#39;. He desperately wanted to get rid of the Minister for Defence but he did not think enough of his own Party would back him. He was scared the backlash would be too strong. It was not until he got back to the familiar atmosphere of Sydney among his influential cronies that his resolve stiffened sufficiently for him to do the deed. </para>
          <para>This whole course of events is symptomatic of the malaise in the Liberal Party - the lack of trust which exists in the Cabinet to the point of blind hatred. It is proof also of the outside influences which dominate this Prime Minister, that act on him like a drug. Until he gets the nod from his great and powerful friends, the Prime Minister is incapable of action. </para>
          <para>When he wants support he cannot even go to his own colleagues, to his own Party, he has to go to outsiders. </para>
          <para>I have tried to trace through something of the impact of this lack of trust and the pervading presence of outside influence on Cabinet on one important sector of public policy, that is the defence of this country and the welfare of members of the forces. The same mali se has afflicted the conduct of foreign affairs. The former Minister for Foreign Affairs, the member for Wentworth is just as tragic a victim of this lack of trust in the Cabinet as the right honourable member for Higgins. In some ways the member for Wentworth has b:en treated even more venemously. During the recess the member for Wentworth came under severe criticism for his handling of East Pakistan relief and China policy. This criticism may have been justified or not; the point is that the member for Wentworth had no chance of defending himself. If he had remained as Minister he would have been questioned by the Opposition in this House. This would, have allowed him to defend his actions. Alternatively he could have emulated the right honourable member for Higgins and defended himself in the Press. He decided not to do this. </para>
          <para>This left him a defenceless victim of the indiscriminate wrath of the Prime Minister. Furthermore his dismissal was prematurely leaked presumably by one of his former colleagues in Cabinet. It has been reported that this leak took the form of an anonymous letter to a radio programme. This is the sort of example of lack of trust which is destroying the Cabinet, destroying the Government and destroying the once great Liberal Party. </para>
          <para>The effect on the conduct of public policy has been immeasurable. I have listed the impact on defence and foreign affairs. Other important portfolios have been severely damaged by this Cabinet disintegration. The portfolios of Attorney-General, Health and Education and Science have each had three Ministers in 5 months. </para>

            <para>- The reason for the Opposition motion is a series of events which took place over the last week or so culminating in the resignation of the right honourable member for Higgins <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Gorton)</inline> from his position in the Ministry and from the position of  Deputy  Leader of his Party. It is suggested that these events have led to a situation in which we have a Prime Minister and a government who are not fit to hold office. This is what the Labor Party wants this House and the Australian people to believe. However, it is most- noticeable on this occasion that members of the Labor Party, who normally have an obsession to bring censure motions before the House, ran from the issue today. They knew full well that the Government ranks would remain solid and that they were wasting their lime. Instead, what did they do? They lowered themselves to the lowest form of political battle - character assassination - running from Government policies, running from party policies and attacking the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McMahon).</inline> smearing wherever they could and hoping that by denigrating his character they could lower the standard of this Government. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I heard various questions being asked at question time and I heard the speech of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> trying to make out that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frank</inline> Packer was the villain in the whole operation. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frank</inline> Packer has been quite unequivocal in his opposition to Socialist policies and Labor governments, and members of the Opposition no doubt are taking this opportunity to try to smear him also. There has been reference to talks about leaks from Cabinet. The honourable member for Wentwortb <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bury)</inline> described the situation as he saw it in quite picturesque terms. The deplorable fact is that whilst Cabinet does not perhaps leak like a sieve. Cabinet matters at times do seem to drip out. This is obvious to everyone, and it is to be deplored, lt must .not be condoned for one minute, but we must accept that. it is difficult to lay the blame in any single direction. From our experience as members of this House we all know that the people who work in the Press Gallery are very skilled at obtaining information from various sources and then putting it all together to try to present a complete picture. The various sources can be any part of the enormous government machine. </para>
          <para>I am sure that members of the Labor Party would be the first to agree that the discussions of their caucus are far from secret, No doubt if the Labor Party gol into office there would be a miracle overnight and there would never bc any leaks from a Labor Cabinet. If this debate serves no other purpose I -hope it will be a reminder to each of us in this House of the responsibilities we carry to our parties, to our colleagues in the Government, to our colleagues in the Opposition and, most important, to the nation. </para>
          <para>On the question of the matters which arc under discussion I say only this: Both the Prime Minister and the right honourable member for Higgins over the last few weeks were placed in the most difficult and unenviable positions. 1 understand completely the action of the right honourable member for Higgins in replying to attacks made on him - in some cases quite vicious attacks - and his desire to explain and defend his position. Any red-blooded Australian subjected to the same kinds of attack would want to do, and probably would do, the same thing. He would be a most unusual man if be did- not. But I believe also that the Prime Minister, if he is to maintain the absolute principle of Cabinet responsibility and solidarity, could have taken no action other than he did. </para>
          <para>Various points of view have been put forward on the question of what constitutes a breach of Cabinet responsibility and solidarity. My own view is that it is possible for it to be claimed that in the absence of the publication of any specific information relating to Cabinet discussion or in the absence of any attribution of points of view to particular Cabinet members there is technically no breach, but 1 believe that there does not have to be PaY specific action of this nature to constitute a breach of the vital principle involved. The action of the right honourable member for Higgins in writing for publication while a member of Cabinet, and the nature of the writing, in my view did constitute a breach of the principle. In short, I believe that both men - the right honourable member for Higgins, for reasons he has given, and the Prime Minister, for reasons he has given - were compelled to act as they did. </para>
          <para>Now, the Labor Party, I suppose understandably, but quite de test ably, in my opinion, uses the savagery of politics to capitalise on this drama. The man for whom I feel sorry in all this is the Leader of the Opposition. How frustrating it must be to be reduced to the position of having to seek power not on one&#39;s own merits but through the difficulties of one&#39;s opponents. It seems to be the only desperate ploy that he has left these days. Here are a man and a party who have failed time and time again to win acceptance of their policies; to win the confidence of the Australian people. The Leader of the Opposition has never been able to put forward a policy that has been backed strongly enough by the Australian people to put him and his Party into office. How galling it must be to lead a party that has been in Opposition for 22 years; how humiliating to lead a party that in  70  years of federation has been out of office for over  50  years. </para>

              <para>- Today we see the Leader of the Labor Party brought to a state of trying to gain power, not through his own standing or his Party&#39;s standing or their policies, but through the passing problems of another party. What a tragedy to see the Labor Party and its Leader in this predicament of having to try to sneak into office through the back door after having failed so miserably and regularly and continually to get into office through the front door of acceptability to the Australian people. The aim of this motion by the Opposition is <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> create a situation which it sees as giving it a chance to govern the nation and to create divisions in the ranks of the Government by playing on personalities. What a noble and honourable way in which to try to gain control of the Treasury bench of this nation! </para>

          <para>What does a Labor government mean. It means a socialistic, trade union dominated government, and I would find it hard to imagine a Labor government in which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> did not play some part. But let us look at just one aspect, that of primary industry policy. This is one of the most important and most difficult areas, calling for a strong and united approach from both Government and industry. But we find the honourable member for Oxley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> saying that Labor&#39;s approach consists of &#39;a loose patchwork of totally unrelated propositions&#39;. The honourable member for Dawson <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Patterson)</inline> found this an incredible, untrue statement, and he said that it showed the colossal ignorance of a person who should know better. This is Labor unity. When the Australian Labor Party Conference in Launceston in June amended the rural policy report of the honourable member for Dawson, he explained this by saying that very few members of the Conference knew anything about rural matters. </para>

              <para>- Yes. He said it on an Australian Broadcasting Commission programme. The action of the Australian Labor Party Federal Executive means that there will be virtually no financial assistance for the wool industry, and it means a dismantling of the wheat, dairy and other stabilisation schemes. It is a policy really to abandon rural Australia. This is the party that tries to tell us it has the policies and the people to work best for primary industry. Are there any legitimate reasons for this motion? The Leader of the Opposition said: This country has been held up to ridicule over the period that the Prime Minister has been in office.&#39; Let us look at the things that have happened since the Prime Minister has been in office. </para>

Is confidence lacking because we have begun, as we said we would, a review of the tariff? Is confidence lacking because we are making a wide review of the arbitration system?

            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline> this afternoon we have seen the most pitiful performance from a Prime Minister that we have ever seen in this House. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McMahon)</inline> refused to answer questions which he could have answered quite easily. He could have told this Parliament the real reasons for the dismissal of the former Minister for Defence but he failed to do so. He simply turned what is a motion deploring the outside influence of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frank</inline> Packer upon the decisions of the Prime Minister of this country into an opposition to a motion which was never moved. A motion of no confidence in the Government was the imaginary motion to which the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McMahon)</inline> and the Minister for Trade and Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> gave their replies. It is no wonder that not one single Government supporter bothered to congratulate the Prime Minister after that deplorable effort. </para>

          <para>It seems to me that we are going to see desperate attempts made to prevent the honourable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen)</inline> from speaking.  His  tender remarks about the state of chaos within the Liberal Party must have intrigued most of us. Instead of defending himself the Prime Minister, as i say, carried out a vicious personal attack upon the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> in an attempt to deflect the attention of the House from the charges that the Opposition has laid against him. There is no doubt whatever that the Prime Minister was in difficulties. He did not deny, as he could easily have done, the charge that he has been trying to use the Australian Cricket Board of Control and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Donald</inline> Bradman to bring about a cricket tour in order to throw this country into a state of disunity in the hope that that would assist him in his campaign to retain office. </para>
          <para>He did not deny the clear imputations levelled against him that it is he who has leaked the information to the Press and not the other Ministers against whom he is now casting aspersions. There is not any doubt at all that the present Prime Minister was the leak to the newspapers. There is not any doubt at all that this country holds the unenviable position of being the only parliamentary democracy in the world where one can find out most of the important decisions contained in the Budget a week before it is delivered. In the United Kingdom under a Labour Government when a Labour Minister, Hugh Dalton, was found to have leaked information unwittingly by dropping a chance word to a pressman he was dismissed immediately. The Prime Minister should begin emulating the British tradition by sacking himself at once because he is the person who has leaked information to Newton. I know for a positive fact that at one time he rang Newton regularly every Sunday afternoon and spoke to him for 2 hours about Budget information and about discussions within the Cabinet. If he denies that he telephoned Newton on those occasions, if he denies that he has not been in constant touch with the Press and with the proprietors of the Press over the last few days prior to getting the courage up to dismiss the right honourable member for Higgins <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Gorton)</inline> let him table the telephone dockets. I challenge him to table the telephone dockets and let us see to whom he spoke. I will table mine if he will table his. Is it any wonder that he took a whole week to get up the courage to dismiss the right honourable member for Higgins when it is well known that he has told his friends confidentially that he always feels uncomfortable in the presence of the right honourable gentleman and does not like him in the Cabinet? He said: &#39;I feel inferior when I stand before him&#39;. Is it any wonder when one looks at the two of them? Compare the two people. Is it any wonder that he feels inferior when he stands before the right honourable member for Higgins? Is it any wonder <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Max</inline> Newton was able to say: </para>

          <para>Is it any wonder that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> McEwen vetoed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McMahon</inline> as Prime Minister? Can one wonder that the Country Party said: &#39;We will not serve under a man who is so distrusted, a man who will betray Cabinet secrets, a man who is prepared to go to Max Newton and give him information that money could not buy from anybody else&#39;? Is it any wonder that Max Newton was able to reap a small fortune from his teleprinter confidential information to his very select clientele of people who paid him for valuable secret Government information? Among his clients were the Mutual Life and Citizens&#39; Assurance Co. Ltd, General Motors Hold ens Pty Ltd, top stockbrokers and the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. That gives an idea of the sort of people who are prepared to pay Maxwell Newtown for the information that the present Prime Minister deliberately leaked to him in his regular 2-hour talks on the telephone. If he denies that he had regular 2-hour talks with Max Newton on the telephone prior to the time when <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> McEwen got the wind of it and refused to have him as Prime Minister, let him table telephone dockets from his office now for us to see. I know that he did. </para>
          <para>I would like to see the telephone dockets representing the telephone calls he made from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Robinson&#39;s</inline> home in Surfers Paradise while he was there plotting to get from the Country Party the seat now occupied by the Minister for External Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Barnes).</inline> While he was plotting to get rid of the Country Party representative in McPherson he thought it would not be a bad idea to get rid of the honourable member for Moreton also. If the honourable member for Moreton loses his preselection it can be put down to the plotting of the Prime Minister and of Eric Robinson who would probably like to have the seat himself. But it will be the silliest thing the Liberal Party ever does because the moment it takes the preselection off -our friend Killen will be the moment we take the seat from the Liberal Party. There is no doubt about that. The people did not give the present Prime Minister the authority to govern this country. They gave that authority to the right honourable member for Higgins who was cut and clawed down as only a cat could do it. They certainly did not give it to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frank</inline> Packer who is now governing this country. Packer&#39;s credo is: &#39;Let the people elect the Prime Minister and I will sack him if he does not do as I say.&#39; As Roman Rivett put it in the Sunday Review&#39; recently: </para>

          <para>That may not be nattering to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frank</inline> Packer but it is certainly not libellous because it is true, and now that he has become the de facto Prime Minister of Australia it is in the public interest that everybody who is ruled by this man should be able to see the real character of the non-elected dictator of the Liberal Party and of the Australian people. From now on a vote for McMahon is a vote for placing the control of the country in the hands of a multi-millionaire Press baron who will have power without responsibility, which has been the prerogative of the harlot throughout the ages. </para>
          <para>The Prime Minister has become the Vyshinksy of Australian politics. Through <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frank</inline> Packer&#39;s guiding control and at his behest the Treasurer was picked back in 1968. Packer picked the Prime Minister in 1968 and again in 1971. Packer sacked the Foreign Minister and the Defence Minister in 1971 and Packer intends to take the preselection away from the honourable member for Berowra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hughes)</inline> if he can. If the honourable member for Berowra loses his preselection that will be proof positive that what I say is correct. If he loses his preselection everybody will know that it was lost as a consequence of the inordinate pressure and power that this man Packer has over the Liberal Party. The honourable member is the best Attorney-General I have seen in this Parliament, with the exception of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Garfield</inline> Barwick. He did not deserve the sack but he got it because he was no longer prepared to be a puppet of Packer. That is why he was dismissed. The present Prime Minister knows perfectly well that the people whom he has sacked are people who did not deserve to be sacked. The honourable member for Moreton did not deserve to be sacked when he was the Minister for the Navy. He at least was not one who was prepared to emulate his Prime Minister, who as Minister for the Navy took a post as the admiral&#39;s gentleman on the eastern seaboard and was thus able to dictate his requirements to the admiral. </para>
          <para>It is a great tragedy to see this once united party hacking itself to pieces at the behest of an outside person. Treachery, intrigue, vilification and a smouldering hatred now pervade the Party. When we look at the sorry sordid sight that fails to grace the benches opposite one is able to understand why the Government has lost all sense of direction. It is more like a tin of worms or a bag full of cats than a Cabinet of responsible men. The end is not yet in sight. One of those how in line for the axe is the Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wentworth)</inline> whom 1 admire for his courage in resisting the temptation or the invitation on television to stab his former leader in the back. I bow to him for&#39; his courage, lt took great courage and he has it. He deserves full credit but unfortunately his action only makes his demise all the more certain. He will be replaced by somebody like the former honourable member for Riverina, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hugh</inline> Roberton, who will give the pensioners a decent serving of Liberal Party policy. The next man for the axe - perhaps it will not be in this order - is the Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Peacock).</inline> The next man is the Minister for Immigration <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Forbes)</inline> and after him my good friend the Minister for Customs and Excise <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Chipp)</inline> although I hope I am wrong in saying this because he certainly does not deserve to be dismissed. In my opinion he is likely to be the fourth to go. They will then join on the back benches their illustrious colleagues the right honourable member for Higgins and the honourable members for Moreton, Wentworth and Berowra. </para>
          <para>The right honourable member for Higgins and the honourable members fm Moreton and Berowra have something else in common. They all are in for the preselection axe. In case the right honourable member for Higgins thinks he is out of the pie-selection woods let me sound this word of warning. I know that the new Minister for the Environment, Aborigines and the Arts <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howson)</inline> has a commission from the Prime Minister to use his influence in the Liberal Party to destroy the former Prime Minister of this country. Here you have this sordid intrigue of a Prime Minister going to one of his Ministers - perhaps this is the price of his appointment to the Cabinet - and saying Your duly now is to remove the man who used to be the Prime Minister of this country&#39; - a man who fought for this country in a way the present Prime Minister did not. They have plotted and planned the defeat of this man over a period of months. I only wish I could talk more about the future of these people to whom I have referred. </para>
          <para>The Prime Minister has given a prize to everybody in the Liberal Party who has said &#39;I am prepared to betray my party and vote with the opponents if a no confidence motion is moved&#39;. They are the ones who have now been elevated to the Ministry. Let me tell the Prime Minister this: In giving this imp rim at eur on party treachery he is setting the pattern for his own destruction because he cannot complain if three or four other persons get up in the party room and say: &#39;Unless the Prime Minister is sacked <inline font-style="italic">we</inline> will walk across the floor of the House and destroy him in the way he has destroyed John Grey Gorton.&#39; The situation has reached a very sorry state.  1  wish  1  had further time to enable me to talk about the sorry situation which now exists in the Liberal Party. We will need a strong Opposition after the next election. We will need one badly but instead we will get a disunited rabble. We want an Opposition that will be in a position to tell the Labor Government when we are wrong and when we should improve our kind of government. </para>

            <para>- I understand it is the wish of the Leader of the House to dispatch this motion before dinner and accordingly I must truncate what I have to say. I turn at once to thank the honourable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Clyde Cameron)</inline> for the encomium which he directed to me. I also extend thanks on behalf of the honourable member for Berowra - <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hughes).</inline> I congratulate the honourable member for Hindmarsh most warmly On his performance. I think it was one of the best George Arliss performances J have seen but I am distressed beyond measure to find that he is in such a state of acute distraction. He said: &#39;My friend Killen, the poor member for Moreton.&#39; He did not even observe his customary intonation and pronounce my electorate as &#39;Mortein&#39;. I suppose we are all entitled to an aberration at some time. The honourable member has many remarkable accomplishments but for my part I would excuse myself from numbering amongst them that he is genuine in his endeavour to isolate the truth. I speak as one who was asked by the present Prime Minister not to serve and I suppose in the ordinary course of events one may draw the conclusion that that is good ground for resentment and good ground to nurse a measure of animus.  1  do not know whether it is a sign of incipient old age but for my part I am thoroughly convinced that in this world you can build nothing whatsoever on bitterness. lt may be that that is a bit old fashioned but that is my view.  1  would also be the last person on this side of the House to deny that there has been a disturbance within the Liberal Patty in recent months. That is a world of reality but are we- expected to go through life nursing hatreds and believing that we can build constructively and positively by saying: There goes that man, I wish him in hell.&#39; Is that to be the view? That is not my view and I venture to say that it is not the view of the great majority of those who sit on this side of the House. We have our differences: I do not deny this. Indeed I assert it. But at the same time I assert that there is within the corporate good will of those who serve in the Liberal Party - those who serve here in this Parliament and those who serve the Party outside - sufficient intellectual reserve to settle the problems. Our aim is to settle those problems and indeed this will be our accomplishment. 1 have said that the right honourable member for Higgins <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Gorton)</inline> had a right to defend himself. I have always apprehended as one of the most fundamental principles of natural justice that we hear the other side. Honourable members may disagree with it, reject it or condemn it but I believe that we must hear the other side. The right honourable member for Higgins has defended himself but he did not do it according to the wishes of the Prime Minister. That was the Prime Minister&#39;s judgment but that is a resolution of yesterday. What of the morrow? We seek not to live in the past but to live in the future because that is where we are to spend the rest of our lives. I would maintain this view against any other. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>What does this motion amount to. Curiously the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> said that it is not a motion of censure. Not even all his well cultivated charm or the prospect of spending my days in Madrid would coax me to go over to the other side and vote with him on this motion. On that let me be quite clear. But what is the alternative? According to the Leader of the Opposition the alternative is that he is better able to lead this country. Let me say this to the honourable member: Those who would follow him would follow him only out of curiosity. The honourable gentleman says: &#39;Here I am, unblemished, prepared to lead you.&#39; Moses in reverse. If he takes the view that his attitude is to be vindicated, that he is right and we are wrong, that he is better fitted and equipped to serve this country then let him answer such questions as these: Did he and his Party not go through the turbulence of the 36 faceless men while waiting outside the hotel? Where does the honourable gentleman stand with respect to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harradine?</inline> I will defend him to the end, quoth he, and when it came to the crunch a groaning silence came over the honourable gentleman. </para>
          <para>Would the honourable gentleman describe his relationship with the right honourable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Calwell)</inline> as being the entente cord i ale of the South Pacific? What was it that possessed the honourable gentleman to describe his own Federal Executive as witless men? Does the honourable gentleman repudiate that? Does the honourable gentleman resile from his humiliating apology to the Federal Executive? Does the honourable gentleman take the view that he and the honourable member for Grayndler <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Daly)</inline> walked through the corridors close together, each trying to. outdo the other in murmuring: &#39;I&#39;m on your side.&#39;? What of the relationship of the honourable gentleman with the honourable member for Shortland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Griffiths)?</inline> Would he describe that as being an expression of splendid harmony? </para>
          <para>One has only to recount these matters to come to the realisation that the honourable gentleman is not, as he asserts, better fitted to lead a government of this country. I say this to the Australian people: You cannot expect to get together a political party, a national party, having national ideas, standing for principles, having hundreds of thousands of members, sending them to Parliament, getting them in Parliament and expect to get out of it the one blob of conformity. That is not on. Whatever differences we may have will be settled, and they will be settled not merely to the advantage of the Liberal Party but to the advantage of the Australian people and those who will come and live in this nation. </para>

          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">That the  Bill be now  read a  second  time. </para>
          <para class="block">In doing so I present the Budget proposals. </para>
          <para>Amongst these are important proposals to improve social service and repatriation benefits, to provide new forms of assistance for rural industries, notably wool, and to increase considerably our expenditure on defence. There will be minor tax concessions which, like the social service proposals, are oriented towards the claims of children and students. </para>
          <para>We will also bring down measures to increase revenues and charges. </para>
        <para>THE ECONOMY</para>
      <para>Even more than usually the Government has this year found it necessary to shape its Budget to serve an overriding economic purpose. Australia is in the grip of inflationary pressures. The rate of increase in costs and prices is already fast and has tended to become faster. This is a serious&#39; condition. If allowed to develop unchecked it will cause increasing economic and social hardship to many people, add to the burdens of rural industries already depressed, disrupt developmental plans of great promise and undermine the rich possibilities of growth which our future unquestionably holds. So far as lies in our power as a government we are determined to combat this pernicious trend, slow it down and hobble it. </para>
      <para>Until last financial year, inflation had not, for almost a decade, been a matter for serious concern with us. Through a long, unbroken phase of expansion it had usually been present in some degree but it had never gained much ground. Over the five years 1965 to 1969 average weekly earnings rose by 6.5 per cent per -year and consumer prices by 3.2 per cent per year. These were years in which our population and employment increased steadily; at no time did unemployment exceed 1.5 per cent of the work force. </para>
      <para>These facts establish that, in this country, we can have strong, sustained economic &#39; growth and continuous full, employment of resources with only a moderate degree of cost and price inflation. This is a vital fact, a re-assuring fact. It demonstrates that, in undertaking, to bring the current more serious form of inflation under control, the Government has not embarked upon any futile task. We accept that the Government must take the lead - this we are doing - but we must have the co-operation of the community. We would be lacking in duty to ignore our responsibility or fail to take that action which lies within our hands as a government. </para>
      <para>In some respects, the last two financial years have gone along much as did the preceding years. If anything, . 1969-70 was somewhat above the trend - employment rose by 4 per cent and last year employment rose by 3.7 per cent - again above the trend. In both years there was a notable, further strengthening of our external payments and reserves position., This performance was achieved despite the further decline in the overall position of the rural industries, amounting to a severe slump in the case of wool. This tended to offset and mask the growth of the other sectors of the economy. </para>
      <para>That having been said; it is in these 2 years that cost and price inflation have gathered pace. Average weekly earnings rose by 8.9 per cent in 1969-70 and by over 10 per cent last year. In the earlier year, the Consumer Price Index rose by 3.2 per cent; but last year by 4.8 per cent and by the June quarter the underlying rate of increase in prices was above 6 per cent. </para>
      <para>The factors which have caused these increases cannot be disentangled, still less quantified. Undoubtedly, a significant part of the impetus has come from wage increases in various forms. These increases have reflected the level of demand and a willingness on the part of employers, under pressure, to pay more for labour. Apparently it has been possible to pass on increased costs, wholly or partly; in higher prices. It is probably more helpful to think of an inter-acting set of conditions than to look for a single dominating cause. But it is important to appreciate that a cost-price sequence can become a&#39; self-activating force so that cost increases lead to price increases and these to further cost increases. </para>
      <para>In general, as we see the problem, there has been and still is a powerful up thrust of costs, stemming largely though not wholly from large wage claims relentlessly pursued. </para>
      <para>There has also been and still is an over strong pressure of demand in some sectors, the effects of which spill over into other areas. Over the past couple of years, expenditure has been running very high in non-residential construction and, to a lesser extent, on the purchase and installation of capital equipment. It has also been running very high in the public sector, both Commonwealth and State. </para>
      <para>In the very big area of consumer spending there appears to have been a growing rate of increase in recent months. This is a critical area because of the massive additional call on resources there would be if consumer spending did rise more rapidly. This could be made possible by the big increase in personal disposable incomes that has occurred and by the large buildup in savings bank deposits over&#39; recent months. That it might happen is evidenced by a sharp growth in retail sales, at an annual rate of 12 per cent, between the recent March and June quarters. It is a development which we must have very much in mind . in assessing the economic outlook. It would be calamitous for a general demand-type inflationary pressure to be superimposed upon and exacerbate present cost pressures. </para>
      <para>Therefore it is essential to achieve the right rate of increase in demand through the year, lt must be high enough to make possible full employment of the labour available - new labour as well as existing labour. At the same time it must not be so high as to facilitate and encourage further cost and price increases. Since, as I have said, demand .has been running too high in some sectors, this indicates the need for a degree of restraint on demand. One obvious direction in which restraint should be applied is that of public authority spending in its various forms. </para>
        <para>THE EXPENDITURE PROBLEM</para>
      <para class="block"> While the Budget provides for substantial increases in expenditures to meet present and high priority needs in social welfare, the rural sector and defence, the Government has nevertheless been ruthless in pruning expenditure proposals. </para>
      <para>There are, of course, large segments of the Budget where there is relatively little scope for pruning. There are large areas - notably in our payments to the States - where expenditures are determined by formula or by formal agreement. There are other areas - notably welfare and repatriation - where rates of benefit and the number of beneficiaries determine our outlays. Again, there are strong constraints with our expenditure on defence. Taken together, payments to the States, welfare and repatriation, and defence this year constitute considerably more than two-thirds of total Commonwealth expenditures. I need hardly add that a substantial increase in expenditure on many government services and activities was unavoidable because of sharply increased wages and salaries and other costs - including an extra pay-day this year. </para>
      <para>The overall increase in our expenditures &#39; would, however, have been much larger but for a determined pruning of expenditure proposals. It may be fairly said that this year has seen the most rigorous restraints on proposals for expenditure for many years. We propose&#39; to continue to exercise this restraint and we have decided to limit the growth in the numbers employed full-time under the -Public Service Act to 3.1 per cent in 1971-72. To assist in controlling the growth of expenditures, we have arranged that, in future, all Commonwealth Departments will prepare for the Government&#39;s consideration expenditure estimates for a further 2  yeaTs  beyond each budget year. This will clarify the longer-term implications of individual proposals in the context of the emerging overall expenditure situation and will enable the Government to act earlier in relation to developing trends. </para>
      <para>In terms of the conventional Budget presentation, total expenditure this year is estimated at $8,833m, an increase of $728m or 9.0 per cent. This figure does not allow for the effect on inter-year comparisons of the transfer of pay-roll tax to the States. After adjusting for that factor, the increase in expenditure would be $987m or 12.2 per cent compared &#34;with the actual increase of 13.8 per cent in expenditures last year. The success of our restraints is seen in the more meaningful figures of the Commonwealth&#39;s outlays in Australia. After adjustment to remove the estimated effects of the transfer of pay-roll tax to the States, our outlays in Australia are estimated to increase by 11.7 per cent compared with the actual increase of 14.9 per cent last year. </para>
        <para>THE EXPENDITURE ESTIMATES</para>
          <para>Defence</para>
        <para>The Government has made an assessment of our strategic situation in the light of changes which are occurring in our international relationships. </para>
        <para>With further improvements in the security situation in South Vietnam, and the growing capacity of that country to provide for its own defence, reductions in the Australian Force, Vietnam, have already been possible. The Prime Minister will make a statement in this Session. Arrangements for the disposition of our forces in the Malaysia/Singapore area within the Five Power arrangement are proceeding very satisfactorily. </para>
        <para>The Defence Vote proposed is $l,252.4m. This is $117m, or 10.3 per cent, more than last year. </para>
        <para>Some $66m of the increase is for pay and salaries. New rates recommended by the Kerr Committee for other ranks will apply as from the beginning of the next pay period, and actual payment will be made as soon as regulations are promulgated. The Minister for Defence will make a statement on the new pay structure. </para>
        <para>Expenditure on new capital equipment and works is estimated at $227m. This is about $32m more than last year. <inline font-weight="bold">Major equipments</inline> to be delivered this year include ten Skyhawk aircraft for the Navy, thirteen Mac chi Trainer aircraft for the Navy and Air Force, twelve Light Observation Helicopters for the Army and communications equipment and armoured personnel carriers. An amount of $6.2m will be spent on the development of the Naval base at Cockburn Sound and on Learmonth Airfield on North West Cape. There will be a small increase in expenditure on defence aid programmes. </para>
        <para>Payments to the States </para>
        <para>I believe that recent developments have led to a significant improvement in Commonwealth-State financial arrangements. The new grants formula settled in June 1970 is increasing State revenues considerably. More recently the agreement to transfer pay-roll tax to the States has improved their capacity to raise their own revenues. We count that agreement as a major co-operative achievement between the two branches of Government. The present aim is that the transfer of this tax should take effect as from 1 September 1971. On that basis, the offsetting reductions in the States&#39; financial assistance grants will result in total allocations to the States from the Commonwealth Budget increasing by only an estimated &#167;88m to $2,93 lm. </para>
        <para>In addition, the States will receive an estimated $259m from pay-roll tax at the existing rate and a further estimated $90m if the rate is increased by t per cent as they have indicated. Thus, after allowance both for Commonwealth allocations and revenue from their new tax, the States are estimated to receive $3,280m, an increase of $43 7m or IS per cent on the comparable figure for last year. </para>
        <para>The Commonwealth will continue to impose pay-roll tax at the rate of 2&#163; per cent in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. Details of the arrangements will be given when legislation to amend the States Grants Act 1970-1971 and the Commonwealth&#39;s pay-roll tax legislation is introduced into Parliament. There are two aspects of particular importance. </para>
        <para>First, local government authorities will benefit by an estimated $6m this year and $8m in a full year through the Commonwealth meeting the cost of exempting the non-business activities of such authorities from pay-roll tax as from the date of transfer. This decision by the Commonwealth has been warmly welcomed by all local authorities. </para>
        <para>Secondly, while accepting that pay-roll tax would be a useful addition to their revenue resources, the States emphasised that the full-year costs of the abnormally high wage and salary awards granted by various wage-fixing bodies to State Government employees last year would still make it very difficult for them to cope with their prospective 1971-72 budgetary situations. Accordingly, the Commonwealth agreed to pay the States special non-recurring revenue assistance of $40m this year as well as an amount of about $22.4m associated with the transfer of the pay-roll tax. </para>
        <para>The allocations to the States include an amount of S860m for the State works and housing programme approved by the Loan Council. This amount, which includes an interest-free capital grant of nearly $2 10m, involves an increase of $37rn or 4.5 per cent on last year&#39;s programme. In addition, the Commonwealth makes available to the States a wide range of capital payments for specific purposes, such as roads, education and the development of resources. These payments are estimated to increase by around 1 1 per cent to $406m. Consistent with the effort we have made right across the Budget to restrict increases in expenditure as far as possible, the increase in these specific purpose capital payments is almost entirely a result of commitments entered into prior to the current year. We shall be bringing the same attitude of rigorous restraint to all proposals for new specific purpose capital . commitments coming before us in the year ahead. </para>
          <para>Social Welfare</para>
        <para>Expenditure on social welfare and repatriation constitutes the largest single item of the Commonwealth&#39;s own expenditures. Social services, repatriation benefits, health services, housing and other welfare activities will involve this year an expenditure of $2,095m. This is $268m more than last year. Of this increase, $78m represents the cost in 1971-72 of current proposals for improvements in social welfare. The full year cost is $108m. Further details are given in Statement No. 10. </para>
        <para>AGE, INVALID, WIDOWS&#39; AND SERVICE PENSIONS</para>
      <para>The Government has pursued its policy of assisting those most in need. There will be higher pensions for those who are wholly or substantially dependent on their pensions. The standard rate pension payable to single people and widows with children is to be increased by $1.25 to $17.25 a week. The married rate of pension will rise by $1.00 a week for each person to give a married couple who are both pensioners a combined maximum pension of $30.50 a week. </para>
      <para>Pensioners now receiving pensions at the current maximum rate and those who received part of the increase of 50c a week given in April this year will receive the full increase of $1.25 or $1 a week. Pensioners who narrowly missed qualifying for any part of the April increase will receive part of the present increase so that their total income will not be less man that of maximum rate pensioners with full allowable means. </para>
      <para>The allowance for the non-pensioner wife of an invalid pensioner and the allowance for the non-pensioner wife of an age pensioner who is permanently incapacitated or who has a dependent child, have been reviewed. The wife&#39;s allowance will be increased by $1 to $8 a week. </para>
      <para>Increases are also proposed in the additional pensions payable where a pensioner has dependent children. The first child will attract an increase of $2 a week and each other child $1, bringing the payment for each child in a pensioner&#39;s care to a uniform rate of $4.50 a week. </para>
      <para>The increases will apply, where appropriate, to rehabilitation and sheltered employment allowances, tuberculosis allowances and long-term sickness benefits. The proposed increases in the wife&#39;s allowance and pensions for children will be extended to the dependants of those receiving unemployment and sickness benefits. Comparable increases will also be made in service pensions payable under the Repatriation legislation. </para>
        <para>CHILD ENDOWMENT</para>
      <para class="block">To assist young families, endowment will be increased by 50 cents a week for each child under the age of sixteen years in excess of two in a family. The rate of payment for children under 16 years in institutions will also be increased by 50c a week. </para>
        <para>REPATRIATION</para>
      <para>We propose a number of improvements in Repatriation pensions and allowances. </para>
      <para>The special rate pension payable to a totally and permanently incapacitated war pensioner will be increased by $3.50 to $42.50 a week. </para>
      <para>The intermediate rate war pension, payable to those able to work only part-time . or intermittently, will be increased by $1.75 to $30.25 a week. </para>
      <para>War widows&#39; pensions will be increased by $1.25 to $17.25 a week. The rates payable for their children will be increased by $1 for the first child and $2 for the second and each subsequent child, making the pension for each child $7 a week. The pension for a child who has lost both parents will be increased by .$2. to $14 a week. Also to be increased are the additional allowances payable to war pensioners who require an attendant and- to those who have suffered amputation of one or more limbs or the loss of an eye, </para>
        <para>WAR SERVICE HOMES</para>
      <para class="block">The maximum loan under the War Service Homes Scheme will be increased from $8,000 to $9,000. Pending assent to the necessary legislation, applications for the increased loan will be accepted from  eligible  new purchasers and borrowers. As soon as the legislation is assented to, applications will be accepted, in conformity with existing policy and within the new loan limit, for additional loans for essential extra accommodation and approved utility services. An amount of S60m has been provided, under advances for capital purposes, for War Service Home. </para>
        <para>COMMONWEALTH HOUSING ASSISTANCE TO THE STATES</para>
      <para>We have adopted a new approach to Commonwealth assistance to the States for housing. Under the previous CommonwealthState Housing Agreements such amounts as were nominated for housing by each State out of its annual Loan Council borrowing programmes were advanced by the Commonwealth at a rate of 1 per cent below the long-term bond rate. The States will continue to determine the amount of their annual Loan Council borrowing programmes to be allocated to housing. However, the Commonwealth will no longer make housing advances at concessional interest rates to the States but instead will offer direct grants to help the States continue to provide housing for lower&#39; income groups. </para>
      <para>Subject to conditions, designed to maintain the Home Builders&#39; Account arrangements, we propose, in respect of State housing activities in each year from 1971- 72 to 1975-76, a basic grant of $2.75m a year payable for a period of 30 years. Because this annual grant is cumulative, we will be committed to pay over $412m to the States during the next 34 years. We also propose a non-cumulative grant of $ 1.25m each year for the next five years as a contribution towards the cost to the States of reduced rents for families they regard as being in need of this assistance. The Commonwealth will also offer to advance all the funds to be spent by the States on building homes at the Commonwealth&#39;s request for serving members of the Forces - thus relieving the States of the obligation to use a portion of- their housing funds for this purpose. </para>
      <para class="block"> The Minister for Housing will elaborate on these proposals. </para>
        <para>ROYAL FLYING DOCTOR SERVICE</para>
      <para class="block">There will be an increase in the operational subsidy payable to the Royal Flying Doctor Service from $180,000 per annum for the triennium just completed to a new yearly rate of $315,000 for the triennium 1971-74. In addition, the Government will continue to provide a capital grant at the same rate of $170,000 per annum as has applied for the past three years. </para>
          <para>Education</para>
        <para>The Commonwealth is meeting a significant share of the cost of education throughout Australia, both through the support it gives to State budgets and by direct expenditure under Commonwealth programmes. </para>
        <para>In 1971-72 Commonwealth payments to the States for particular types of expenditure on education are expected to exceed $200m. The bulk of these payments - about SI 28m - is for universities and colleges of advanced education. This figure includes a special allocation to assist these institutions in meeting the cost of exceptional increases in non-academic salaries. In its own territories the Commonwealth expects to provide about $77m this year. </para>
        <para>The number of advanced education scholarships will be increased from 2,500 to 4,000 awards from the beginning of 1972. There will also be 200 new awards for students in teacher education who contemplate joining the Commonwealth Teaching Service. Expenditure on the various scholarship programmes this year is estimated at $43. 7m compared with $3 8. 4m last year. </para>
        <para>Taken as a whole, Commonwealth direct expenditure on education is estimated at almost $346m, or 14 per cent more than last year. The value to taxpayers of deductions for education expenses is estimated to be $7Sm this year. </para>
          <para>External Aid</para>
        <para>The estimates provide for an increase of $9m in external economic aid to developing countries including Papua New Guinea. As explained in Statement No. 8, a greater increase could conceivably emerge later in the year. Bilateral aid (excluding Papua New Guinea) will increase by 8 per cent in 1971-72. Further details are set out iri that Statement. </para>
        <para>For the first time, Australia in 1970 exceeded the internationally accepted &#39;one per cent&#39; target for the total flow of financial resources, both official and private, to developing countries. The probability is that we shall do so again this year. In terms of the amount of official development assistance extended to developing countries, expressed as a percentage of Gross National Product, Australia was ranked third in the world in 1970, for the fifth year in succession, by the Development Assistance Committee of OECD. </para>
          <para>Assistance to Industry</para>
        <para>Commonwealth assistance to industry takes a variety of forms including payments to industry, special taxation concessions, and contributions to promotion and research. Last year, Commonwealth assistance under these three heads amounted to $658m, of which payments to industry accounted for $3 17m. Details are given in Statement No. 9. </para>
        <para>Commonwealth payments <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> industry are expected to total $37 lm or $54m more than last year. Export incentive payments are expected to total $53m, industrial research and development grants $13m, net expenditure by way of subsidy to shipbuilding $10m and payments of petroleum search subsidy $8.6m. </para>
        <para>Rural industries continue to encounter serious difficulties in export markets; countries of the European Economic Community adhere to a protective Common Agricultural Policy and many other countries pursue policies aimed at agricultural self-sufficiency. There seems to be little prospect that these difficulties will ease. </para>
        <para>In considering the amount of assistance to be provided from the Budget this year for rural industries, the Government noted that farm income in 1970-71 is estimated at about $8 10m, about $265m less than the year before&#39;. This has had an impact not merely on the producer but on rural communities generally. </para>
        <para>The Government has given high priority to measures aimed at giving support to farmers whose enterprises are basically viable, but who are burdened with an excessive amount of short-term .debt or whose properties could with advantage be built up to a larger size. To finance schemes of debt reconstruction and farm build-up, an amount of $4m was paid to New South Wales last year and a further $40m is provided this year for payment to the States. </para>
        <para>Provision is also made for payment to the States of $ 11.5m under the marginal dairy farms reconstruction scheme. Payments last year were $3.lm. </para>
        <para>Advances for capital purposes include $10m for the Commonwealth Development Bank to help finance an extension of the Bank&#39;s operations to include loans to farmers to build up the size and operational efficiency of their farms. </para>
        <para>In these various ways the Government has demonstrated its willingness to assist farmers to adjust to the changes that are occurring in the rural sector. For those farmers not in a position to achieve commercial viability, the Commonwealth will introduce a retraining scheme. Details will be announced by the Minister for Labour and National Service. The rural reconstructions scheme also provided for rehabilitation assistance - where this is necessary to alleviate personal hardship - to those farmers obliged to leave rural&#39; industry. </para>
        <para>The Government has given particular consideration to the position of those farmers substantially dependent on their income from wool. The collapse in . wool prices during 1970 brought them to a figure as low as that ruling in 1948 when, of course, costs were much lower. </para>
        <para>The Australian Wool Commission&#39;s operations have had a stabilising effect on wool prices. As already announced by the Minister for Primary Industry, the Government will continue to support the Commission in its reserve price operations on the same basis as in the past season, subject to regular reports and review by the Commission on its purchases and buying limits. Last year the Commonwealth made available to the Commission $12m for working capital to finance purchases of wool and an arrangement was negotiated with the trading banks to. provide up to $34m to the Commission for this same purpose. This latter amount is not yet fully drawn. Advances for capital purposes include a further $10m to be advanced to the Commission as working capital .should this be needed. </para>
        <para>The Budget provides, in addition, $4m against a. possible loss by the Commission and &#167;3.7m towards the costs involved in handling wool included in the Price Averaging Plan. </para>
        <para>The Government has decided that producers of wool should be given additional assistance this year, and will introduce a 1- year scheme of deficiency payments in respect of the 1971-72 wool clip. Deficiency payments will be a percentage of market realisations, calculated from time to time so as to ensure that, on average, growers receive for shorn wool - other than specified inferior types accounting for about 10 per cent of shorn wool - a return corresponding to a price for the whole clip of 36c a pound greasy. Under this method individual growers will retain an incentive to obtain the best possible price for their wool. The necessary legislation will be introduced by the Minister for Primary Industry as soon as practicable. </para>
        <para>Provision is made in the Budget for expenditure of $60m under this scheme in 1971-72. Some expenditure will also be involved next year in respect of wool sold towards the end of the season. In calculating the possible total commitment, the Government has, of course, had to assume a figure for likely market proceeds from sales of wool in 1971-72. However, accurate estimation of this figure is scarcely feasible because of the many factors that have a bearing on it and the expenditure estimate I have mentioned is subject to a considerable margin of uncertainty. </para>
        <para>The phosphate fertilizers bounty will be extended to 31 December 1974. Expected expenditure this year is $38m. </para>
        <para>The 1-year additional bounty on 1970- 71 butter and cheese production is to be extended to 1971-72 production at a lower rate. Expenditure on butter and cheese bounties this year is expected to be almost $40m. </para>
        <para>A 5-year stabilisation plan for the apple and pear industry will be introduced, at an estimated cost in 1971-72 of $3m. </para>
        <para>Payments to rural industries, details of which are given in Statement No. 9, are expected to total $275m- -that is, S65m more than last year. </para>
        <para>The Commonwealth has assisted primary producers affected by drought by reimbursing State Governments where they are involved in substantial relief expenditures of an abnormal nature. Last year we provided nearly $14m to New South Wales and Queensland and this year we will continue to assist the Queensland Government in financing relief measures and restocking assistance. </para>
        <para>The situation in the wine industry has been kept under close review by the Government. Having considered the report of an inter-departmental committee, we have decided not to alter the existing duty on wine. However, the problems currently affecting some growers in the industry are well recognised and will be kept under review by Commonwealth, State and industry authorities in conjunction with the Agricultural Council. </para>
        <para>The Export Payments Insurance Corporation Act will be amended to enable a buyers&#39; credit scheme to help Australian exporters of capital goods. The Minister for Trade and Industry will introduce the necessary legislation. </para>
          <para>Advances for Capital Purposes</para>
        <para>It is  estimated  that  advances for capital purposes will increase by $47m  to  $495m. Last year the increase was $83m. </para>
        <para>The largest increase - $56m - is in the advance to Qantas to meet payments on new aircraft. This item represents a transfer to Qantas of the proceeds of drawings against certain loans raised overseas for aircraft purchases; it does not involve any domestic outlays. </para>
        <para>The amount to be provided to the Post Office from the Budget is S255m - $8m more than last year. The remaining finance for its capital programme will be provided by the Post Office from internal resources- mainly depreciation funds. </para>
        <para>Post Office charges were increased last year, but increases in wage and salary levels have been much larger than were expected. The full year cost of wage and salary increases awarded in 1970-71 is estimated at $77m. Were charges to be left at their existing levels, a loss of more than $30m would be incurred this year. This would require either a substantial reduction in the Post Office capital programme, and consequently in the level of services, or a provision from the Budget much larger than our overall financial position would justify. To avoid such a loss, and to help in financing the capital programme, it is proposed to raise charges to increase Post Office receipts by about $50m in 1971-72. Details will be given to the House by the Postmaster-General. </para>
        <para>A further capital payment of $12. 5m is to be made this year to the Australian Industry Development. Corporation. The payment made last year was $25m. There are substantial reductions also in various other advances, including those for the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Authority and the Australian National Airlines Commission. </para>
          <para>Other Capital Works and Services</para>
        <para>Expenditure on other capital works and services is estimated to be S262m, an increase of $22m. </para>
        <para>There will be an additional $9m for new hospital construction in the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory, and an additional $4m towards construction of the new standard-gauge line between Port Augusta and Whyalla. </para>
          <para>Departmental Running Expenses</para>
        <para>Departmental running costs are estimated, at current levels of salaries and costs, to increase by $84m, or 15 per cent. This large increase is in part explained by the additional public service pay-day in 1971- 72 which takes $16m and in part by the full-year effect of salary increases awarded last year. The Government is concerned about the rate of growth of departmental expenditure and has taken action to curtail it. It is proposed to initiate within the Government a review of the existing functions and activities of departments. It is not expected that this review, which will of necessity be spread over some months, will lead to substantial additional economies in the current financial year. In the longer term, however, the Government aims to achieve further economies which should ensure that the rate of increase in departmental expenditure is restricted to the absolute minimum consistent with the execution of Commonwealth functions of vital importance to the national -welfare. </para>
          <para>Other Expenditures</para>
        <para>SUPPORT FOR THE PERFORM ING ARTS</para>
      <para class="block">Grants in support of the performing arts will be increased to $4.5m. Details to be announced by the Minister for the Environment, Aborigines and the Arts will show increased funds for further, development of the Australian Opera Company and Orchestra. </para>
        <para>ABORIGINAL ADVANCEMENT</para>
      <para class="block">An amount of $14.35m will be available for expenditure from the Aboriginal Advancement Trust Account mainly for special programmes of housing, health and education. This is an increase of $3.1m or 28 per cent. Grants to the States will be increased by 31 per cent to $9.2m and expenditure on study and secondary grants for the education of Aboriginal children is expected to increase by - 52 per cent to $3.8m. </para>
      <para>In addition, expenditure on Aboriginal advancement by or on behalf of the Northern Territory Administration is expected to amount to more than SI 6m. </para>
        <para>RETIREMENT PENSIONS AND ALLOWANCES</para>
      <para class="block">Existing Commonwealth Superannuation Fund and Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Fund pensions, which were last increased in 1967, will again be increased  by the notional salary method, using salary and pension entitlement levels ruling on 30 June 1971. </para>
      <para>The estimated cost of the increases is $ 11.5m this year, but the net cost, to the Budget is estimated at $6.2m because a large part of the cost will be met by the Post Office and other authorities outside the Budget. </para>
      <para>A comparable adjustment of existing pensions payable under the Parliamentary Retiring Allowances Act will also be made at an estimated cost of $78,000 this year. </para>
      <para>The notional salary method is complex and experience has shown that it generates anomalies and inequities between pensioners. The Government proposes to examine simpler and more equitable methods of adjustment with a view to future application on a regular basis. . </para>
        <para>THE BUDGET STRATEGY</para>
      <para>We see it as a critically important objective of our policy to combat the inflationary forces now running in our economy, and it is against this objective that 1 now come to explain the strategy of this Budget and our decision to raise additional revenues. </para>
      <para>Although cost increases and the price increases which follow them may be due, in the first instance, to increases in wages and other cost elements, they are without doubt stimulated and made possible by conditions of strong demand for resources. Hence, if resistance to such cost increases is to be stiffened, as it must be, there has to be a sufficient degree of restraint on potential demand for resources, particularly in those sectors where it is obviously running too high. - </para>
      <para>The chief instruments available to the Government and its related authorities are the annual Budget, the. effects of which are spread over the ensuing year, and monetary measures taken by the Reserve Bank in collaboration with the Government. </para>
      <para>I said earlier, one of the most expansive sectors of demand has been public sector expenditure, of which Commonwealth expenditure comprises - a large share. Obviously, therefore; we had to make this our first target, and I have described the steps we have taken to slow down the rate of increase in this source of demand. </para>
      <para>Since there will still be, within Australia, a considerable increase in Commonwealth spending, it must at least be offset by an increase in Commonwealth domestic receipts from taxation and other sources of revenue. But if, as we believe, there is need to apply a wider restraint than this and exert a steadying influence on the upward course of demand in the economy, the rise in these receipts should more than cover the increase in expenditures. In other words, there has to be a larger surplus of domestic receipts over domestic- expenditures. The practical question is how much larger this surplus ought to be. </para>
      <para>After considering this question in depth the Government reached the view that it should seek a somewhat larger domestic surplus than the $550m envisaged in the 1970-71 Budget. Because subsequent events added heavily to our expenditures and our revenues were adversely affected by the Senate rejection of our legislation on the States&#39; receipts duty, the domestic surplus last year proved to be $460m. We see this, however, as an adventitious result, hardly to be taken as a guide for what should be sought in 1971-72. </para>
      <para>For some time there has been a prospect that monetary liquidity would rise excessively. This has been due principally to the rapid build-up of our overseas reserves which in turn has been due to excellent results on our external trading account and the sustained high level of capital inflow. The effect is to add to the financial resources available to people and institutions within Australia over and above those derived from domestic sources. Obviously this must operate to facilitate higher levels of expenditure at a time when these are already high. </para>
      <para>Achievement of a domestic surplus, by which more is withdrawn in revenues than is put forth in expenditures within Australia, works against this tendency for liquidity to rise to excess. Net sales of securities to the public, together with monetary measures such as restraints on bank lending, operate in the same direction. In the prevailing and foreseen economic conditions, it will be necessary to maintain a restrictive monetary policy and, as was the case last year, to encourage sales of government - securities. The relationship between the Budget and monetary conditions is discussed in some detail in Statement No. 3. </para>
      <para>From what we see now, the influences tending to produce excess liquidity could continue strongly in 1971-72. This provides a further reason for seeking to achieve a large domestic surplus. The figure we have decided upon is $630m, which is S80m more than the amount for which we budgeted last year. </para>
        <para>THE REVENUE ESTIMATES</para>
      <para class="block">Before allowing for revenue measures which I will discuss later, it is estimated that total receipts this year would be $8,654m, an increase of $624m, or 7.8 per cent. However, if adjusted to allow for the transfer of pay-roll tax to the States, the figure comparable with , actual receipts last year would be $8,913m, an increase of 11 per cent. The basis of these revenue estimates is discussed in Statement No. 5. </para>
      <para>Because of cost increases, we are proposing to increase some charges. Governments are not immune to cost increases and users of government services - rather than the general taxpayer - should be required to meet these costs. However, to achieve a domestic surplus of $630m it is necessary for us to seek additional tax revenue in this financial year of $157m. </para>
          <para>Taxation Measures</para>
        <para>To decide upon the particular taxes by which this additional revenue would be raised proved to be a matter of some difficulty. In the present context the object of any tax increase is to moderate development of demand and that can be done either by taxes on incomes or by taxes on spending - that is, taxes levied on commodities. The latter form of taxation has the drawback that it adds to prices. Taxes on incomes are more likely to be free from this consequence although it is sometimes argued that company tax increases eventually find their way into prices. On balance, the Government has decided to seek the major part of the additional revenue it needs in 1971-72 from taxes on certain company income and on personal incomes and the lesser part from increases in customs and excise duties on petroleum products and tobacco products. Our proposals are accordingly as follows. </para>
          <para>Company Tax</para>
        <para>At present, the first $10,000 of a company&#39;s taxable income is generally taxed at a lower  Tate  than the balance. We have concluded that the present concessional rates are no longer warranted. In reaching this conclusion we have been mindful not only of revenue requirements but also of the fact that the rates were adopted in circumstances largely different from those now prevailing and that, in some instances, these provisions have been the basis of tax minimising schemes by some taxpayers. We therefore consider this change as a move not merely producing additional revenue, but also as one towards a sounder and more equitable system of company tax. We propose that the rates applied to the first $10,000 of taxable income, including shading in and special rates, be. increased by 5c in the dollar. Friendly Society Dispensaries - which have a uniform rate of 37&#177; per cent - will not be affected. The general public company rate of 47&#163; per cent will therefore apply to the whole of the income of public companies other than income taxed at special rates. For private companies the rate on the first $10,000 of taxable income will be 37&#177; per cent and the rate on the balance will remain at 421 per cent. These changes, which will apply to incomes of companies .for the income year 1970-71, are estimated to yield $24m this year. </para>
        <para>A consequential change will be made to the rate on the first $10,000 of 1971-72 investment income of a superannuation fund that does not invest a sufficient proportion of its assets in public securities, as these funds are taxed at the same rates as mutual income of a life insurance company. </para>
          <para>Personal Income Taxation</para>
        <para>It is proposed to raise a large part of the balance of our revenue requirements through the personal income tax rather than add further to sales tax. Accordingly, we propose to increase the <inline font-style="italic">2i</inline> per cent levy to 5 per cent. This increase is estimated to yield $68m this year. The new scale of tax instalment deductions from wages and salaries will operate from 1 October 1971. </para>
        <para>The levy will not apply to tax calculated under the age allowance. Consequently the upper limits of the shading-in ranges of the age allowance will increase. Apart from that, it is not proposed to change the agc allowance. </para>
        <para>It is proposed to liberalise certain deductions allowed to personal income taxpayers. The deductions in question relate to education, a matter to which we attach great importance, and to child adoption expenses. We propose that the maximum deduction allowable for education expenses of a dependent full-time student child be increased from $300 to $400 per annum. We also propose that education expenses will be allowable deductions in respect of such students under 25 years instead of under 21 as at present. Consistently with that, we shall increase to 25 years the agc at which a student ceases to qualify as a dependant for purposes of the dependant&#39;s allowance. Finally, it is proposed that a deduction be allowed for legal expenses and court costs of the kind normally incurred by a taxpayer in adopting a child. It is estimated that the cost to revenue of these concessions will be $405,000 this year and $6,350,000 in a full year. </para>
          <para>Customs and Excise Duties</para>
        <para>We shall need to raise more revenue than will be yielded by the measures 1 have just mentioned. Accordingly, we propose to increase the rates of customs and excise duties on cigarettes and cigars by 50c per lb and on manufactured tobacco by 25c per lb. It is estimated that these increases will yield $21m this year. </para>
        <para>We also propose to increase by 2c a gallon the customs and excise duties on motor spirit, automotive distillate used in road vehicles operating on public roads, aviation turbine fuel and aviation gasoline. These changes are estimated to yield $43 m this year. </para>
        <para>For some years there have been exemptions from excise for coal tar and coke oven distillates produced as a by-product in the process of converting coal to coke. The Government is satisfied that the circumstances giving rise to the exemption no longer have force, and has decided to remove this exemption where these distillates are used as substitutes for or in admixture with motor spirit. It has also been decided to remove the current excise exemption for condensate produced from natural casing head gas when it is used in admixture with motor spirit in internal combustion engines. These changes .are estimated to save the revenue $1.3m in 1971-72. </para>
        <para>The&#39; net effect of the various taxation proposals I have just outlined will be to increase revenues this year by $ 1 57m. </para>
        <para>As promised when the investment allowance for manufacturing plant and equipment was suspended, the Government has given further thought to the transitional provisions but has decided against amendment of the legislation. </para>
          <para>Miscellaneous Charges</para>
        <para>Listeners* and viewers&#39; licences </para>
        <para>Listeners&#39; and viewers&#39; licence fees were last increased in October 1968. Since then, the gap between receipts from licence fees and expenditure in providing and maintaining the National Broadcasting and Television Service has increased because of mounting wage costs, extension of television to lesser-populated country areas and development of programme services. lt is proposed to increase licence fees, other than the special rates payable by pensioners, to yield Slim in 1971-72. Fur, ther details will be provided by the Postmaster-General.  light dues </para>
        <para>To help meet the rising costs of providing marine navigation aids, it is proposed to increase light dues - that is, charges to shipping for the use of these facilities - from 20 cents to 22 cents per net registered ton per quarter. The increased charges will apply from 1 October 1971 and are estimated to yield $480,000 this year. pharmaceutical benefits- patient charge </para>
        <para>The Government has for some tune been greatly concerned at the mounting cost of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. The charge payable by patients has been 50 cents since the charge was adopted in 1960. In that year the cost of the Scheme was $49m; last year it was $160m. A charge of 50 cents, appropriate eleven years ago, cannot be regarded as appropriate today. Accordingly, the Government proposes to introduce legislation to increase the charge to one dollar. As a result of this change it is estimated that </para>
        <para class="block">Commonwealth expenditure this year under the Pharmaceutical Benefits arrangements will be reduced by about $16m. Pensioners and their dependants enrolled in the Pensioner Medical Service, who are entitled to free pharmaceutical benefits, will continue to be exempt from any charge. Special arrangements will be made for those persons enrolled in the Subsidised Health Insurance Scheme to continue to receive pharmaceutical benefits for the present contribution of 50 cents for each prescription. </para>
        <para>AIR NAVIGATION CHARGES</para>
      <para class="block">In recent years there have been annual increases in rates of air navigation charges in accordance with the Government&#39;s policy that the air transport industry should progressively meet a greater proportion of the costs of airports and airway facilities. A Working Group of departmental officers and airline representatives will shortly complete a report, in which the airlines are making submissions concerning the costs they should meet. A decision on air navigation charges will be taken by the Government after consideration of the report. </para>
        <para>CONCLUSION</para>
      <para>Fiscal action can exercise a pervasive effect, but the Government&#39;s capacity to deal directly with inflationary pressures arising primarily from cost &#39; pressures is more limited. We have already taken some action in areas where we have power to do so and the Government has under active study various other aspects of the problem of excessive cost increases. I might mention, in this budget context, that the Government is considering what might be done by way of strengthening the arbitration system and, in particular, bringing more to the forefront the economic consequences of decisions which are taken within that system. When these studies have been completed, we will consider whether further measures should be taken to cope with the problem of excessive cost and price increases. </para>
      <para>I must refer to the escalating level of industrial unrest. Working days lost through industrial disputes in the first five months of 1971 topped the high rate of last year by nearly 25 per cent. In the past three years the annual loss of working days has been 1.1m, 2.0m and 2.4m. But it is not the direct losses of production and wages from this rising tide of militancy which are so disturbing as the fact that confrontations in industry are often resolved only at the cost of grossly inflationary wage settlements. The real costs to the community of the stimulus to inflation which such settlements provide dwarf, I venture to suggest, the direct losses from prolonged stoppages. If the inflationary trend is to be contained, a halt will have to be called to this process. </para>
      <para>I need hardly add that the Government will do all it can, by persuasion and example, to encourage those in the private sector who make decisions directly affecting wages and other costs, profits, and ultimately prices, to have at all times in the forefront of their consideration the broad national interest. Let mc say too that we are very conscious of the problems posed for manufacturers and other businesses by inflationary tendencies and other economic trends. </para>
      <para>In striving to restrain the forces of inflation, the Government has been concerned to ensure that this Budget does not contribute to a situation- where demand pressures might be superimposed upon cost pressures. There may be some who believe that we should have taken that risk and allowed demand to have its head. At least in the short term, this would have been the easier and perhaps the more popular course. But in our view it would not have been the right way nor the responsible way. We will be keeping the whole situation under very close review throughout the year so as to make any adjustments in policy which might prove to be necessary. </para>
      <para>As it is, we believe the Budget will not discourage the real growth of the economy. Given the anticipated growth in productive capacity, there should be scope for growth in the demands of the private sector. There is scope for a real lift in the standard of living which should be shared by many who would otherwise be the undefended victims of inflation and the self-seeking of stronger, more aggressive groups. </para>
      <para>On its own, the Budget cannot, of course, ensure that the nations&#39; objectives are achieved. But this Budget, concerned as it is with the high national objectives of social welfare, economic strength and national security, provides the essential framework for the attainment of these national goals. </para>

        </subdebateinfo>
          <para>The Economic Context</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The 1971-72 Budget has been framed in a context of rapidly increasing costs and prices, a relatively tight labour market and the prospect of increased pressures on resources in the year ahead. Gross national product at constant prices increased less rapidly in 1970-71 than in the preceding year, but is expected to grow somewhat faster in 1971-72. </para>
        <para class="italic">
          <inline font-style="italic">1970-71</inline>
        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Estimates of the main components of gross national product and gross national expenditure in 1970-71 are given in detail in the document &#39;National Income and Expenditure 1970- 71 presented with the Budget Papers. In terms of constant prices, the estimates show that gross national product increased in 1970-71 by 3.9 per cent, with non-farm product increasing by 4.4 per cent, and farm product declining by 1.2 per cent. Gross national expenditure increased by 2.8 per cent at constant prices. Of its main components, personal consumption expenditure is estimated to have increased by 2.7 per cent, private capital expenditure by 5 .  0 per cent, and public sector spending (current and capital) by 2 .  2 per cent. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In current prices, the main changes in 1970-71 from 1969-70 shown by the estimates are:- o an increase of 9.7 per cent in gross national product, comprising an increase of 11 . 4 per cent in the gross value of non-farm product and a decrease of 12.0 per cent in the gross value of farm product;  o  an increase of 9 .  7 per cent in gross national expenditure, including increases of 8 .  9 per cent in personal consumption, 2 .  1 per cent in private gross fixed investment in housing, 15.6 per cent in other private gross fixed investment and 11.0 per cent in public expenditure on goods and services; o moderate growth in both imports and exports, although in the outcome there was an excess of exports over imports of goods and services of $10 million compared with an excess of exports over imports of $4 million in 1969-70. </para>
        <para>Also in 1970-71:- <inline font-style="italic">o</inline> there was a sharp acceleration in the rate of increase of money wages and prices, especially in the second half of the year; o although the labour market tended to ease over much of the year, the total movement was relatively small. </para>
        <para class="italic">
          <inline font-style="italic">1971- 72</inline>
        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In 1971-72, gross national product at constant prices seems likely, on present indications, to increase by something over 5 per cent; an increase similar to the average in recent years. Average employment in 1971-72 is expected to increase by a little under 3 per cent; the rise in non-farm productivity may be about 2.5 per cent. There is, of course, considerable uncertainty at this stage of the season about the likely movement in farm output but this forecast assumes a moderate increase. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Demand is expected to accelerate in 1971-72. In particular, a faster growth of consumer spending is likely, given a delayed impetus by the strong recent growth in money incomes and in savings. Gross private investment on dwellings should rise considerably faster than in 1970-71, and, despite moderating influences in some, areas, other private investment should continue to grow overall. The financial position of the State sector will doubtless permit a very strong growth in expenditures to continue in that sector. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The rate of increase in average weekly earnings continued in 1970-71 the accelerating trend evident in recent years. A more moderate trend has been assumed in 1971-72. Nevertheless, the increase of 9 per cent assumed for the purpose of estimating pay-as-you-earn tax collections is a very large- one reflecting, to a large extent, the fact that average weekly earnings are <inline font-style="italic">already</inline> well above their <inline font-style="italic">average</inline> level in 1970-71. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In the light of this economic assessment the Budget sets out to provide for increases in essential expenditures whilst restraining the growth in the Commonwealth&#39;s total domestic outlays. At the same time it aims, by raising additional revenues, to guard against the development of undue demand pressures </para>
        <para class="italic">
          <inline font-style="italic">Budget Estimates in National Accounts Terms</inline>
        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The estimates in national accounts terms are set out in detail in Statement No.  2  and further reference is made there to their economic implications. They are also discussed further in the Supplement to the Treasury Information Bulletin which accompanies the Budget documents. The following table provides a summary of the main Budget aggregates in national accounts form. </para>

          <graphic href="073131197108174_48_0.jpg" />
        </para>
        <para>Notable aspects are:- </para>
        <para pgwide="yes"> The growth in domestic outlays is estimated to be 8.4 per cent in 1971-72 (11.7 per cent adjusted) compared with 14.9 per cent in 1970-71. A reduction in the rate of growth of Commonwealth outlays in Australia has, of course, been a prime objective of Government policy, lt is estimated that the Commonwealth&#39;s domestic expenditure on goods and services will increase by 12.2 per cent compared with an increase of 14.3 per cent in 1970-71. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes"> An estimated increase of 13. 1 per cent in Commonwealth outlays overseas contrasts with the outcome in 1970-71 when the Commonwealth&#39;s overseas outlays were virtually stable. In view of trie strength of Australia&#39;s external reserves, this rapid growth in overseas outlays gives no cause for concern from the point of view of externa&#93; balance. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes"> An increase of 7.5 per cent in receipts before taking account of the proposed revenue measures and 9.6 per cent when allowance is made for those revenue measures which are estimated to yield $168 million in 1971-72. When adjusted to remove the effect of the pay-roll tax transfer the estimated increase is 12.8 per cent. The revenue measures announced will, of course, have a restraining effect on demand in Australia and should contribute to growth in estimated revenues in 1971-72 which both in absolute and relative terms exceeds the growth in domestic outlays with the result that the Budget, domestic surplus is estimated to be larger than in 1970-71. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes"> The surplus of revenue over outlays in Australia- the Budget domestic surplus - is estimated to be $630 million compared with $460 million in 1970-71. Thus, the Budget will result in a substantial withdrawal of liquidity from the economy. This should act as a strong restraining factor on expenditure by the private sector. </para>

        <para>Notable aspects are:- </para>
        <para pgwide="yes"> An increase of  $728  million or  9.0  per cent  ($987  million or  12.2  per cent on the adjusted basis) in expenditures. On a basis comparable with  1970-71  the estimated rate of increase in expenditures is smaller than in  1970-71. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes"> An increase of  $792  million or  9.9  per cent in total receipts. On a basis comparable with  1970-71  the increase would be  $1,051  million or  13. 1  per cent. </para>

        </para>
        <para class="block" pgwide="yes">Some features of the expenditure estimates in conventional Budget terms are: - </para>
        <para class="block" pgwide="yes"> Proposed increases of  $217  million in payments to the National Welfare Fund and  $40  million in expenditure on repatriation services arising in part from the occurrence of additional pension pay-days and in part from changes in the numbers of recipients and the full-year effects of increased rates of benefit introduced last year. There and increased benefits announced in the Budget Speech contribute an estimated $73.9 million of this increase. The increase would have been larger but for increased patients&#39; contributions for pharmaceutical benefits which are expected to reduce estimated expenditures in 1971-72 by $15.8 million below what they would otherwise have been. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes"> A proposed increase of $117 million or 10.3 per cent on expenditures on defence services. The largest part of the increase - some $66 million - is for service pay and civil salaries. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes"> An estimated increase in departmental running expenses of $84 million or 15.4 per cent. About $69 million of this increase is due to greater payments of wages and salaries, arising from increased numbers of employees, from increases in wage and salary rates which became effective in 1970-71, and from an extra public service payday in 1971-72. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes"> A proposed increase of $55 million or 17.2 per cent in payments to industry arising in large part from assistance of various kinds to rural industry, particularly the wool industry. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes"> Of the estimated increase in expenditures including those above, an amount of about $40 million is attributable to the occurrence of an additional public service pay-day and a further $40 million to additional pay-days for some social service and repatriation pensions </para>
        <para class="block" pgwide="yes">Further details of estimated expenditures in 1971-72 are given in Statement No. 4. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Before taking account of the proposed revenue measures, total Commonwealth receipts are estimated to increase by $624 million  -  7.8 per cent - to $8,654 million. Adjusted to remove the effects of the pay-roll tax transfer, the increase is estimated at $883 million or 11 .0 per cent. This would be a substantial rate of increase but below that in 1970-71 and in 1969-70. The assumed increases in average earnings and employment are estimated to produce another large increase in pay-as-you-earn income tax collections. The growth in income tax collections as a whole, however, will be adversely affected by the lower rate of growth of company incomes in 1970-71, which will be assessed for tax in 1971-72, and by the further decline in the incomes of primary producers in 1970-71. Continued growth in private sector expenditures is expected to result in increased revenue from indirect taxes. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The proposed revenue measures announced in the Budget Speech are estimated to produce a net increase in receipts of $169 million in 1971-72- or $210 million if applying for the full financial year. The measures and their estimated revenue effects are shown in the following table:- </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">After taking into account the estimated revenues arising in 1971-72 from these proposed measures, total Commonwealth receipts are estimated to be 58,822 million, an increase of $792 million or 9.9 per cent- $1,051 million or 13.1 per cent on the adjusted basis. </para>
          <para>Summing Up</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The Budget provides for substantial increases in outlays for social welfare, assistance to industry and defence. Other substantial increases in expenditure reflect the rising cost of sustaining the wide range of activities and services provided by the Commonwealth. These increased outlays will themselves contribute to the growth of demand and activity in the economy, although it is to be noted that the estimated rate of increase in the Commonwealth&#39;s domestic outlays is significantly below the actual rate of increase in 1970-71. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">To guard against the possibility of overall demand and activity in the economy running to excess, measures are proposed to raise substantial additional revenue. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The estimated outcome of the Budget is a small deficit, but it is also estimated that the net result of the Commonwealth&#39;s outlays and revenues <inline font-style="italic">within</inline> Australia will be a domestic surplus of about $630 million in 1971-72. At the same time, it is expected that there will be a substantial build-up in liquidity in the economy, especially in the first half of the financial year, due in part to the sizeable <inline font-style="italic">temporary</inline> deficit in the Budget which arises largely from the seasonality of the Commonwealth&#39;s tax collections. This may facilitate preparation by the private sector for the expected liquidity tightness in the second half of the year. The monetary and financial aspects of the Budget are examined in more detail in Statement No. 3. </para>

      <para pgwide="yes">Comparison of increases in receipts and outlays in 1970-71 and 1971-72 is affected by a number of special factors, the effect of which is discussed in a later section. Before allowance is made for these factors the estimated increase in total outlay in 1971-72 is $711 million, $284 million less than the actual increase of $995 million in 1970-71. In percentage terms the estimates imply an increase of 8.7 per cent this year, compared with an actual increase of 13.8 ner cent in 1970-71.

      </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">On the outlay side of the Budget there is an important distinction between payments made within Australia and payments made overseas. The immediate effects of overseas outlays are on the balance of payments ;(*) such outlays must therefore be deducted from total outlay as a step in the process of assessing the impact of the Budget on the domestic economy in the year immediately ahead. This is done in the following table: </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The table shows that the much smaller estimated increase in total outlay this year is attributable to the trend in the domestic component. Following a small increase of $1 million in 1970-71, overseas outlays are estimated to increase by a further $68 million in the current year.(2) </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">After deducting overseas outlay the estimated increase in domestic outlay is $643 million compared with an actual increase of $994 million in 1970-71. This represents an estimated increase of 8.4 per cent this year, compared with an actual increase of 14.9 per cent in 1970-71. The increase in Budget outlays within Australia is estimated to be considerably less in 1971-72 than in 1970-71, and is smaller than the concurrent increase in receipts. The implications of the domestic surplus for liquidity conditions are discussed in Statement No. 3. </para>

        <inline font-style="italic">Composition of domestic outlay</inline>
      </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Within the domestic component of outlay there is a further basic distinction to be made between expenditure on goods and services, and transfers and advances from the Budget. Expenditure on goods and services adds <inline font-style="italic">directly</inline> to demand within the economy, while the impact on demand of transfers and advances depends on their effects on the spending of the recipients.(3) (&#39;) Such payments do not add to domestic incomes and the demand for locally-produced goods and services. Payments within Australia may add <inline font-style="italic">indirectly</inline> to overseas rather than Australian incomes, because orders met by local suppliers may include an import content. Although it is not possible to make reliable estimates of the import content of Commonwealth expenditure within Australia the proportion would not be large, and it may be assumed that it is unlikely to change markedly between one year and the next. By contrast, direct payments overseas by the Commonwealth may fluctuate widely between one year and another. (*) The main overseas components are shown separately in Table 2 on page 9 of the Supplement to the Treasury Information Bulletin, entitled &#39;National Accounting Estimates of Public Authority Receipts and Expenditure&#39;, being published concurrently wilh the Budget  (*) Whether payments from the Commonwealth Budget are themselves a source of demand for domestic resources, or add to demand indirectly by transferring purchasing power to other public authorities or the private sector, the initial impact of Budget outlays on expenditure can be expected to induce further increases which ara financed out of the incomes earned in meeting The initial change in demand. As the <inline font-style="italic">relative</inline> sizes of the total increase in demand in two successive years would depend largely on the relative sizes or the initial increases which supported them, these &#39;multiplier&#39; effects are not considered explicitly in the discussion which follows. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The following table compares, for each main component of domestic outlay, the estimated increase in 1971-72 with the actual increase in 1970-71. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The estimated percentage increase in domestic expenditure on goods and services is less than in 1970-71. Moreover, some part of the estimated increase of 12.2 per cent results from the occurrence of an extra public service pay-day during 1971-72 and approximate adjustment to remove the effects of this factor would reduce the rate of increase to 10. 1 per cent.f.1) This. is substantially lower than the increase of 14.3 per cent experienced in 1970-71 and, indeed, could carry some implication that the Commonwealth&#39;s domestic expenditure on. goods and services in 1971-72 may expand at a rate somewhat lower than the rate of expansion of the total output of the economy. The actual out-turn in any year can, of course, be influenced by rises in wages and costs unforeseen at the time of the Budget, as was the casein 1970-71. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Precise estimates of the effect of the extra pay-day on the rates of increase for the main components of domestic expenditure are not available, but it is probable that, but for it, the rate of increase in expenditure on war and defence would be rather less than the 10. 5 per cent increase in 1970-71. The estimated increase for other current expenditure would be reduced, perhaps to the vicinity of 13 per cent - substantially below the 1970-71 increase of 16.9 per cent. Estimated capital expenditure probably would not be very much changed by this adjustment; the very small increase of 2.8 per cent in this category shows a sharp drop compared with the preceding year when the increase was 19.9 per cent. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The percentage increase in domestic transfer payments and net advances expected in 1971-72 is less than half the percentage increase which occurred in 1970-71. However, the comparison is affected by certain special factors, particulars of which are given below. Adjustment of the figures to eliminate the effect of these factors results in an estimated increase of 10. 5 per cent in 1971-72 compared with a rate of increase of IS. 6 per cent in 1970-71. (2) As noted above, the impact of transfer payments and net advances on demand and incomes depends on their effects on the spending of the recipients. </para>

After adjustment to remove the effect of this factor, the increase in payments to the States is estimated to be 13 . 8 per cent in 1971-72 - a relatively high rate of increase, although still well below the rate in 1970-71 . These payments go to finance the expenditures of the States and their authorities, which are predominantly expenditures on goods and services. (The analysis here is, of course, concerned with the effects of increases in Commonwealth Budget outlay. But it is also relevant to note that, when the adjusted movements in payments to the States are considered together with announced increases in State taxes and charges, a substantial increase in State expenditures is again in prospect.) </para>

For the purpose of judging the influence of such payments on rates of income or expenditure within a year, these increases should also be adjusted - first, to remove the effects of variations in the incidence of pay-days, and secondly, to allow for the &#39;full-year&#39; effects of changes in the rates of benefit.(1) The adjusted rate of increase in outlay on cash benefits in 1970-71 is 11 . 0 per cent- before- account is taken of the full year effect of the measures introduced in March 1971, and 12.3 per cent after adjusting for the full-year effect of those measures.(2) The latter percentage indicates the increase in the annual rate of outlay which had been attained in the later part of 1970-71. The adjusted annual rate of increase in outlay on cash benefits resulting from the 1971-72 Budget is 9.3 per cent, or rather lower than the rate of expansion attained in 1970-71. Cash benefit payments would largely be spent by the recipients on goods and services. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Although the advance to the Post Office is estimated to increase by a smaller amount in the current year than in 1970-71, the prospective increase in internal resources associated with the increased charges for postal and telephone services will make possible an increase in its capital expenditure on goods and services higher than in the year before.(3) </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">It is not uncommon for the net increase in other transfer payments and net advances to vary considerably from year to year, and the estimated increase of $52 million in this category in 1971-72 follows an exceptionally large increase of $123 million in 1970-71. The 1970-71 figure included substantial payments in respect of a number of items for which there had been no corresponding expenditure in 1969-70 (e.g. the initial advances to the Australian Wool Commission and the Australian Industry Development Corporation); these items show reductions in 1971-72. The net increase in 1971-72 is due largely to the estimated $60 million deficiency payment for wool, which is partly offset by the net movements in other items. There is no ready way of assessing the extent to which the increase in other transfer payments and net advances is likely to influence spending on goods and services by the recipients. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">When these various adjustments are made to total domestic outlay, an estimated increase of 10.4 per cent is shown in 1971-72 compared with the adjusted rate of increase of 15.2 per cent reached in J 970-71 . (4) </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The reduced rate of expansion of all major categories of domestic outlay in 1 971 -72 is the most striking feature to emerge from the comparison of the adjusted estimates of the rates of increase in the two years,It has to be borne in mind, of course, that the extent to which increases in some of the categories of outlay would be reflected in increased expenditure on goods and services is somewhat uncertain. Nevertheless, it is clear that the expected increase in domestic outlay in the 1971-72 Budget would add directly and indirectly to demand for goods and services at a significantly lower rate than did the increase in domestic outlay experienced in the preceding year, in other words the outlay side of this Budget is considerably less expansionary than was the case, in the event, last year. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">It is true that 1970-71 was a year in which Commonwealth domestic outlay, as it turned out, expanded at a rate substantially above the rate of growth of total output of goods and services in the economy.

          <para>Composition of Receipts</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">As on the expenditure side of the Budget, there are differences in the significance which different classes of receipts may have for prospective trends in the economy. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The distinction drawn on the outlay side between transactions within Australia and transactions overseas does not have the same practical importance here. With relatively few exceptions the budget receipts are derived from within Australia. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Another distinction is between movements in receipts which are expected to emerge as by-products of evolving trends in incomes and spending in the economy and those which are consequential on changes in rates of taxation or other charges. Any estimated rise in receipts of the former class will reflect expected increases in incomes and spending and cannot therefore be regarded as an independent factor capable of varying those expected increases^1) Both classes of movements in receipts will, of course, be reflected in the expected overall Budget outcome. However, it is the second class which reflects specific Budget measures relating to receipts, and which can be regarded as arising independently of evolving trends&#39; in the economy .(2) </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">It is not, in practice, easy to classify all increases in receipts in this way. For the most part, movements which would be expected in gross collections of P.A.Y.E. instalment deductions, indirect taxes and the income of public enterprises, at existing rates and charges, fall within the former class. But the position as regards movements in taxation collections at existing rates from individuals subject to provisional tax and from companies can be somewhat blurred; it depends on past trends in income and on the spending and saving habits of various classes of taxpayers. As mentioned above, the second class of movements in receipts is most clearly -exemplified by new revenue measures which involve changes in rates of taxation or in other charges. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In 1971-72 there is a large increase in estimated receipts which is expected to be induced by the prospective growth in expenditure and incomes in the economy. However, the main factor on the receipts side which is relevant to this analysis is the changes in taxation rates for which provision has been made this year. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The changes in personal income tax rates are expected to add a net $81 million in a full year. The consequent reduction of disposable incomes can be expected to exercise a moderating effect on the expansion of personal expenditure. However, there are expected to be lags between the reduction of disposable incomes and the changes in spending it induces; thus in the short-term some of the additional tax could operate to reduce the rate of saving and, possibly, part of this reduction in saving would continue in the longer term. There will also be lags before the disposable income of persons subject to provisional tax reflects the effects of the new tax provisions. Nevertheless a significant part of the increase in income tax can be expected to operate to restrain the expansion of personal expenditure in the year ahead. (&#39;) This is not lo say that such a rise in receipts would be of no importance. For instance, when incomes are rising, an increase in receipts arising out of the operation of existing taxation provisions would transfer resources from the private to the public sector, thus exerting a moderating (but not completely offsetting) influence on trends in the economy by retarding the growth of private expenditure. However, expectations regarding trends n incomes and spending which (&#60;n-thc absence of policy action to alter trends) would evolve in the coming year should already take account of the expected moderating influence of automatic increases in receipts. (*) lt might be noted that revenue estimates may sometimes reflect prospective trends in some particular areas of activity which are not the most desirable from the point of view of economic balance and reasonable price stability but which cannot, in practice, be corrected fully or quickly enough by fiscal or monetary means. An example relevant to the revenue estimates for 1971-72 is the very large increase which has been assumed in average earnings. Should average earnings rise less than assumed, taxation revenue would be less than estimated and a larger budget deficit would emerge (although the extent of the increase in the deficit would not reflect the full extent of the shortfall in receipts, because some components of expenditure - for example, financial assistance grants to the States - could also be lower than estimated if average earnings rose more slowly than assumed). It would not follow, however, that the Budget objective of maintaining an environment conducive to balanced economic growth would be adversely affected by such a development; on the contrary, such. a result would be more likely to serve the broad economic purposes to which budget policy is directed. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">A somewhat similar observation can be made about any movement in receipts which emerges as a consequence of developments in the economy which were not foreseen at the time the Budget was framed. For example, if an increase in receipts were to result, say, from an unforeseen rise in wages, then, especially with a progressive tax-rate structure, the increase in receipts could be expected to exert a stabilising effect in that increases in disposable income would be&#39; that much less. But it Would be misleading to say that, because of that increase in receipts, the Budget had exercised a more restraining influence than originally envisaged.&#39; </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The changes in excise and customs duty, which are estimated to add $87 million to revenues in a full year, can be expected to have a near commensurate effect on purchasing power, in consequence of their direct influence on the prices of the particular commodities affected. In the past it has normally been expected that changes in indirect taxes of these sorts would be quick to influence the trend in demand. However, in view of apparent time lags between changes in incomes and consequent changes in spending which have been observed in recent times, the analysis of the effect of these tax changes on demand becomes somewhat more difficult. But it would still seem reasonably certain that most of the increase in revenue from this source would operate to restrain the expansion of demand during the coming year. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Increases in broadcasting and television licence fees are expected to yield about $15 million in a full year. The timing of these additional charges will, of course, vary according to the time at which individual licences are taken out but generally their effect on demand can be expected to be similar to the effect of increases in excise and customs duty. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The changes in company tax, estimated to yield $26 million in a full year will, other, things being equal, reduce the funds available to companies for investment and distribution to shareholders; however, the actual effects on spending and in particular the timing of those effects depend on a variety of circumstances including the ability of companies to compete for alternative sources of funds or to &#39;pass on&#39; the increased tax rates in the form of higher prices. Eventually, the increased revenue collected by the Commonwealth as a result of the increased tax rates will be at the expense of alternative uses of the funds concerned but the chain of causation is complex. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In summary, the changes in taxation rates and licence fees will lead to an increase in revenue at an annual rate of $209 million. The influence of the increased revenue on the trend in demand can be expected to be somewhat indirect, and the operation of some of the effects may be relatively slow. But even when allowance is made for these factors, it can be expected that in the aggregate the tax changes will exercise a considerable restraining influence on the expansion of demand during the year ahead. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">The economic impact of the Budget is not restricted to its direct influence on expenditure and income which was discussed in Statement No. 2. The Budget can also have significant effects on economic activity through its influence on monetary conditions. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The monetary effects of the Budget can usefully be divided into two broad components. First, there is the direct impact of budget receipts and outlays on liquidity and the money supply. This can be measured by the budget domestic surplus or deficit - that is, the excess or shortfall of receipts in Australia over outlays in Australia. A domestic surplus, other things being equal, involves a withdrawal from the volume of money of an equivalent amount ; a domestic deficit adds an equivalent amount to the volume of money. The Budget&#39;s monetary impact, however, is not restricted to the size of the domestic surplus or deficit but, secondly, depends importantly on the monetary effects deriving from the Commonwealth&#39;s domestic financing transactions. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The Commonwealth&#39;s financing transactions - together with Reserve Bank open market operations - have a major impact on the volume and composition of financial assets in the economy and may have a significant influence on the cost and availability of funds through direct and indirect effects on interest rates and the value of financial assets. Measurement of the monetary effects of financing transactions must take into account not only the movements in total holdings of Commonwealth securities which may occur over a period but also the types and maturities of those securities and the classes of institutions or persons holding them. In particular, it is important to distinguish between changes in holdings of government securities by the banking system and by the non-bank private sector. An increase in the holdings of Commonwealth securities by the latter group operates to reduce the volume of money while a reduction in these holdings has the opposite effect. An increase in the holdings of the banking system does not in the same way directly affect the volume of money nor the total - as distinct from the components - of the L.G.S. assets which constitute the general banking system&#39;s liquidity base. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Changes in holdings of government securities by particular groups are not, of course, solely the result of the Budget. These changes may be affected by the market operations in government securities of the Reserve Bank and by all of the other factors affecting monetary and liquidity conditions generally. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The stance of monetary policy, especially in regard to official interest rates and controls on the banking system, will have a particularly important influence on monetary and financial conditions. Other important factors influencing such conditions include changes in Australia&#39;s gold and foreign exchange holdings resulting from the private sector&#39;s international trading and borrowing; Reserve Bank transactions with the private sector such as Rural Credits Department advances; and the activities of financial intermediaries, particularly the lending activities of the general banking system. All these various influences are significantly interrelated and the effects of the Commonwealth&#39;s transactions on monetary conditions cannot be considered in isolation.(1) </para>

The relatively strong demand for government securities - notably short-term debt - by the non-bank private sector was, however, an important restraining influence on monetary conditions and particularly on the growth in bank liquidity. The tight liquidity positions of trading banks were a major restraint on their lending activity in this period. Between June and December 1970 the volume of money increased by 5.8 per cent compared with 6.9 per cent in the corresponding period of the previous year. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">In the second half of 1970-71, when the strong seasonal contractionary forces were operating, the volume of money increased by 1 .0 per cent compared with a fall of 0.7 per cent in 1969-70. Although during the second half of the year the Budget domestic surplus withdrew about $1,350 million from the money supply, at the same time a strong inflow of private overseas capital operated to ease monetary conditions. In addition, the private sector- probably influenced by the severe financial stringency of the June quarter of 1970- had sought to make adequate preparation for the seasonal contraction, and during the liquidity upswing in the first half of the year had invested substantially in short-term financial assets, particularly government securities, which would mature in the period of seasonal financial tightening. In the event, there was a stronger demand by the non-bank private sector for longer-term Commonwealth debt in the closing months of the financial year. The somewhat easier than expected monetary conditions and an apparent increased confidence in Commonwealth security yields may have been significant factors explaining this demand. </para>

        <para>PROSPECTS FOR 1971-72</para>
      <para pgwide="yes">There are many uncertainties in the way of predicting the course of monetary conditions over the year ahead. It is clear, however, that the Commonwealth&#39;s budgetary and financing transactions will have a very important influence on those conditions. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">It is estimated that the Budget domestic surplus for 1971-72 as a whole will be of the order of $630 million. This is about $170 million greater than in 1970-71 and will have a significant moderating effect on the growth of liquidity and the volume of money over the year. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The monetary impact of the Budget within the year will again be influenced by the seasonality in budgetary transactions. The temporary domestic deficit in the first half of the year is likely to provide a substantial addition to liquidity. This applies particularly in the early months of the financial year as a result of a high level of P.A.Y.E. refunds associated with the income tax adjustments in last year&#39;s Budget and various timing factors. The expansionary effects of this temporary deficit will depend significantly on how this deficit is financed and particularly the extent to which the non-bank private sector increases its holdings of Commonwealth securities. It might be expected that the demand for Commonwealth securities could be relatively strong. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">In the second half of the year - with the collection of company income taxation and provisional income taxation on individuals - the large Budget domestic surplus will withdraw a substantial volume of funds from the private sector. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Monetary conditions during 1971-72, however, will certainly not depend solely on the Commonwealth&#39;s transactions. The factors influencing the development of monetary conditions in 1970-71 are also likely to play an important role in the current financial year. International private capital flows could again be a significant element. Changes in the rate of such flows, both in the seasonal liquidity upswing and the subsequent downswing may accentuate or offset monetary movements emanating from the Commonwealth&#39;s transactions or from other factors. The general stance of monetary policy will also, of course, have an important influence on financial conditions. </para>

On the basis of existing legislation, collections of customs duty are estimated to increase by $64,272,000 to $530,000,000.

In 1970-71, excise collections increased by $113,592,000 or 12.1 per cent but that increase included the effects of changes in rates of duty estimated to yield an additional $92,000,000 in 1970-71, partly offset by the introduction of a scheme of weekly settlement of duties which is estimated to have reduced receipts by $13,600,000.

On the basis of existing legislation, it is estimated that sales tax collections will increase by $61,841,000 or 9.8 per cent to $695,000,000.

In 1970-71 average weekly earnings increased by more than 10 per cent and the average number of employees in terms of &#39;male units&#39; by about 3.3 per cent. For the purpose of estimating pay-as-you-earn collections, an increase of 9 per cent has been assumed as the increase in average earnings for 1971-72. This assumption, which takes account of the rise in average weekly earnings which has already occurred, does not imply that the trend in earnings from this point of time can be forecast with any reliability. Nor does its use imply that it is a Budget objective. The increase in average number of employees in 1971-72 is assumed to be 3.2 per cent, a little below that experienced in 1970-71, reflecting a slackening in the net migration intake including announced reductions in the number of assisted passage migrants in 1971-72. A considerable part of the increase of $127,989,000 in estimated refunds of tax instalment deductions in 1971-72 is due to the fact that the instalment deductions schedule incorporating the reduced income tax rates announced in the 1970-71 Budget did not apply until 1 October 1970, with the result that instalments were deducted at 1969-70 rates during part of 1970-71. After allowing, for this increase in refunds, net pay-as-you-earn collections at existing rates of taxation are estimated to increase by $372,938,000 to $2,805,000,000. </para>

      <para pgwide="yes">In early February 1971 it was estimated that Commonwealth expenditures in 1970-71 would exceed the Budget estimates by $230 million(a). In the prevailing economic circumstances this estimated increase was considered excessive and a policy of restraint across a broad range of expenditures, intended to reduce estimated expenditures as they then stood by $75 million, was adopted by the Government. Details of proposed reductions were announced to Parliament on 16 February 1971. The larger proposed reductions in estimated expenditures included $22 million in defence services, $14 million in advances for capital purposes ($10 million of which related to the Post Office), and $9 million each in departmental running expenses and payments to industry. No reductions were made, however, in payments to the States. In fact, in recognition of the abnormal budget difficulties being faced by the States, the Commonwealth agreed in April 1971 to the provision of special additional revenue assistance of $43 million on condition that this was used by the States to finance their deficits and not to increase expenditures on goods and services. However, despite this additional payment and increases in the rates of pensions, actual expenditures exceeded the Budget estimates for 1970-71 by only $181 million, that is, by $69 million less than was estimated in February before the expenditure reduction measures.(a) </para>

          <para>Defence Services</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Total expenditure on defence services exceeded the Budget estimate by $1 million. Service pay and civil salaries were $33 million greater than the Budget estimate, largely as a result of arbitration and other wage and salary determinations made after the Budget was presented. Against this, there were short-falls in other areas of expenditure, which resulted in part from the measures taken by the Government in February 1971 to reduce estimated Commonwealth expenditures. Actual expenditure on equipment and stores for the RAN and RAAF was $14 million less than the Budget estimate. Mainly because of the deferment of certain projects and some re-scheduling of payments, expenditure on the purchase, manufacture and lease of aircraft for the RAAF was $8 million less than the estimate. Expenditure on naval construction, which was affected by lags in delivery of equipment, was $4 million less than estimated. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">Payments to or for the States and works and housing programmes were a net ; $133 million greater than the Budget estimate. General revenue grants exceeded the Budget estimate by $145 million, $60 million of which reflected receipts duty compensation payments, which the Commonwealth agreed to provide following the cessation of duty on monies received after 30 September 1970. The operation of the financial assistance grants formula resulted in an increase of $38 million in these grants over the Budget estimates, mainly because average wages in the year ended March 1971 increased by more than had been assumed. Additional revenue assistance of $43 million, for which no allowance had been included in the Budget, was also provided to the States to assist them with budgetary difficult ties arising in large part from abnormally large increases in wage and salary costs. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Specific purpose payments of a revenue nature were a net $5 million greater than the Budget estimate, mainly because natural disaster relief payments, particularly drought relief payments to Queensland, were greater than estimated. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Specific purpose payments of a capital nature fell short of the Budget estimate by a net $14 million. Capital payments to the States for education purposes were $15 million less than the estimate. Although payments for school libraries exceeded the Budget estimate by $4 million there were short-falls of $9 million in payments for teachers&#39; colleges, $4 million for universities and $4 million for colleges of advanced education. Payments to the States for railway projects were $3 million less than the Budget estimate. Natural disaster relief payments of a capital nature for flood relief were $5 million; no  provision  was made  in  the Budget for these payments. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">Payments to the National Welfare Fund exceeded the  estimate  by  a  net $4 million. Expenditure on national health services was $4 million greater than estimated, largely because of increased pharmaceutical benefits payments, which exceeded the estimate by $6 million. Payments to public hospitals for pensioners fell short of the estimate by $3 million and medical benefits were $2 million less. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Although pension rate increases were announced in March 1971 expenditure on age and invalid pensions fell short of the Budget estimate by $5 million. Expenditure on unemployment and sickness benefits exceeded the estimate by $3 million. </para>

          <para>Debt Charges</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Expenditure on debt  charges  exceeded the Budget estimate by a net $4 million, mainly  because  of the interest payments arising from the very large  amounts of  Treasury Notes on issue during much of 1970-71. </para>

During 1970-71 there were substantial increases in wage and salary rates arising from arbitration and other determinations brought down after the Budget was presented. Similar factors account for much of the increase  in  expenditure for the Territories, which exceeded the Budget estimate by $4 million. </para>
          <para>Commonwealth Payments to Industry</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">These payments exceeded the Budget estimate by a net $3 million. Payments to manufacturing industry were $9 million greater than estimated, the main factors being the provision of $6 million more than estimated for pay-roll tax rebates under the export incentives scheme and $1 million more for the net ship-building subsidy. Payments to rural industries were a net $5 million less than estimated. There were short-falls of $9 million in emergency assistance payments to wool-growers and $5 million in expenditure on the phosphate fertilizers bounty. Payments of $6 million were made to assist the canned deciduous fruits industry and an initial $4 million was provided for the rural reconstruction scheme; no provision had been made in the Budget for these expenditures. </para>

The advance to the Post Office was $7 million greater than estimated mainly because of increased wage and other costs during 1970-71. Advances to Qantas Airways Limited were $14 million less than estimated because of revisions to the expenditure programme relating to aircraft re-equipment. </para>
          <para>Other Capital Works and Services</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Expenditures on other capital works and services were a net $8 million less than the Budget estimate. In total, civil works expenditures were a net $3 million less than the estimate partly because of revisions to the programme in the latter part of 1970-71. The largest shortfall in the civil works programme was $8 million, which related to Northern Territory buildings and works projects. Expenditure on civil works for the Department of Civil Aviation was, however, $9 million greater than the estimate.

No provision had been made for this transaction in the Budget estimates. The interest income of the Loan Consolidation and Investment Reserve was $5 million  less  than estimated due largely to cancellation during the year of part of the Reserve&#39;s holdings of securities.

        <para>SINCE 1961-62</para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The tables shown later in this Statement set out Commonwealth Budget receipts and expenditure in both &#39;conventional&#39; and national accounts form. Subject to the important qualifications outlined in the notes to the tables, the figures for earlier years are broadly consistent with the figures for 1970-71 and the estimates for 1971-72 outlined in Statements Nos. 1 to 6. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Tables 1 and 2 on pages 60 and 61 show Commonwealth expenditures, receipts and financing transactions in &#39;conventional&#39; form for each year since 1961-62. This presentation is essentially a rearrangement of the transactions of the three Commonwealth Funds within the Public Account (Consolidated Revenue Fund, Loan Fund and Trust Fund). </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Table 3 on pages 62 and 63 shows figures in national accounts form for each year since 1961-62. In this form, transfers between different parts of the Commonwealth&#39;s accounts are eliminated and additional detail included so that the figures shown relate to the transactions which occur between the Commonwealth Government and the rest of the economy or overseas. The national accounts figures therefore show government transactions classified into economically significant categories, corresponding with those for which similar information is presented in past years for the entire economy in the White Paper on National Income and Expenditure. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Over the 1960&#39;s, Commonwealth, State and local Governments in Australia have been faced with rapidly increasing demands for the many services which they provide, including such functions as defence, education, social welfare and health services. This has meant strong pressure on Governments to increase the share of available resources in the economy subject to their control. It is to be noted, however, that a large part of Government outlay is in the form of transfer payments, such as payments of pensions or subsidies, or in the form of advances to other sectors. The effect these transfers and advances have on the economy depends, of course, on the reactions of the recipients. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Over the period 1961-62 to 1970-71 the direct demands on resources by the public sector in Australia grew more rapidly than private sector spending or total spending in the economy. This is highlighted in the following table which compares the relative growth in public sector (Commonwealth, State and local Government) spending on goods and services with the growth in gross national expenditure and with the major components of private sector expenditures. </para>
      <para class="block">
        <graphic href="073131197108174_98_35.jpg" />
      </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The preceding table .shows that the main increase in total public sector expenditures has been in respect of current expenditures on goods and services. Capital expenditures by public authorities and enterprises have increased much less rapidly than private sector capital expenditure. The table also illustrates the fact that the main component of private sector demand which has grown more slowly than total expenditures in the economy, and which has, in a sense, provided scope for the more rapid increases in Government expenditures, is personal consumption expenditure. Personal consumption expenditure has shown an average annual rate of growth of only 7 .9 per cent and has declined from 65 . 1 per cent of gross national expenditure in 1961-62 to 57.4 per cent in 1970-71. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">It would be incorrect, however, to infer that the relative and absolute growth in the size of the public sector necessarily has led to an absolute or relative diminution in the welfare of persons. Indeed, the provision of many goods and services by the public sector, such as education and health facilities, may be seen as an important factor contributing to increasing standards for the Australian population as a whole. The relative growth in the size of the public sector may therefore be seen as, in part, a reflection of the importance which the community places on the facilities and services provided through the public sector: </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The Commonwealth has contributed to the growth of public sector expenditures both directly through Budget expenditures and indirectly through the operation of its instrumentalities in the non-budget sector. The following table shows details of Commonwealth budget outlays as a proportion of gross national expenditure in 1961-62 and 1970-71. . </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">A feature of these figures is the strong growth in Commonwealth budget outlays- on goods and services which, over the period since 1961-62, have increased significantly more rapidly than gross national. expenditure. In total, transfer payments and. net advances grew, less rapidly than gross national expenditure over the period. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The more significant areas of increase in Commonwealth expenditure responsibilities can most readily be indicated by reference to the &#39;conventional&#39; budget classification. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Over the period 1961-62 to 1970-71 total Commonwealth expenditures have increased by $4,532 million or at an average annual rate of 9. 5 per cent. The following table summarises the main components in this overall increase. </para>
      <para class="block">
        <graphic href="073131197108174_100_37.jpg" />
      </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">It may be noted that some expenditures which have been growing at a relatively slow annual rate have nevertheless made a major contribution to the absolute increase in total expenditures over the period. Thus, although Commonwealth payments to or for the States have increased at an average annual rate of 9 . 0 per cent, which is less than the rate of increase in total expenditures, these payments have contributed over one third of the total increase in expenditures during the period because they form such a large proportion of the total Commonwealth Budget. A proportion of these funds is provided for specific purposes, but the allocation of the larger part of them rests with the States. In the final analysis, these funds are in large part spent in areas which are primarily the responsibility of the States, including the provision of education and health services, the maintenance of law and order, and the construction of roads, water supply and sewerage facilities, and housing and land development projects. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Of the areas of primary Commonwealth responsibility, the main absolute growth in expenditures has been in respect of the provision of defence services and social service benefits provided via the National Welfare Fund. Each of these categories of expenditure has contributed about 16 per cent of the overall increase between 1961-62 and 1970-71. The relatively rapid increase in defence expenditures occurred largely in the middle years of the period when major re-equipment programmes were undertaken and when the strength of the forces was increased rapidly. The re-equipment programmes, which reached a peak in 1967-68, required heavy expenditure overseas and these were in part financed by defence credit arrangements made with the United States of America. National Welfare Fund payments have shown a steady increase over the period reflecting growth in the number of beneficiaries and increased and extended ranges of social service and health benefits. The rate of increase in these expenditures has accelerated in recent years following the introduction of the tapered means test and extensions of health services. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The other components of Commonwealth expenditure have had varying rates of growth. The expenditures exhibiting the most rapid rates of growth over the period were Commonwealth payments to industry (18- 1 per cent per annum); expenditure on Commonwealth Territories (16.3 per cent per annum) and departmental running expenses (13.9 per cent per annum). At the lower end of the scale, expenditures on repatriation services have, despite substantial increases in benefit rates, grown slowly - by 5.7 per cent per annum - because of the relatively stable number of beneficiaries. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The increase of $246 million or 18.1 per cent per annum in direct Commonwealth payments to industry reflects in particular the growing range of support provided to the rural sector in recent years. The rapid growth of Canberra and Darwin as centres of population is the main reason for the above average increase of 16. 3 per cent per annum in expenditure on Commonwealth Territories. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Departmental running expenses have increased relatively rapidly at 13.9 per cent per annum, reflecting in large part the increases which have occurred in wage and salary rates over the period and a growth in the numbers of departmental employees which was, over the period as a whole, more rapid than the growth in total civilian wage and salary employment. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">As a concomitant of the increase in the relative size of the public sector and in order to gain the resources necessary to meet expenditure demands, total public sector receipts have increased more rapidly than gross national expenditure. Total public sector current account revenues have, for example, increased at an average annual rate of 10.6 per cent compared with the average growth of 9.3 per cent per annum in gross national expenditure over the period 1961-62 to 1970-71. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Similarly, total Commonwealth Budget receipts, in national accounts terms, have increased by $4,852 million or 10.7 per cent per annum over the period - rising from 22. 1 per cent of gross national expenditure in 1961-62 to 24.6 per cent in 1970-71. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The composition of Commonwealth Budget receipts, in national accounts terms, in 1961-62 and 1970-71, together with the average annual rates of growth are shown in the following table. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Of the increase in total receipts over the period 1961-62 to 1970-71 about 43 per cent has been generated by collections of income tax from individuals. The largest increase was in respect of net pay-as-you-earn income tax from wage and salary earners. Collections from this, source have increased by $1 ,779 million or 1 5 . 7 per cent per annum. Revenue from company income taxes increased by $862 million or 10.6 per cent per annum over the period and indirect taxation revenues increased by $1,359 million or 9.1 per cent per annum. The relatively rapid increase in personal income tax revenue reflects in large part the operation of the progressive rate scale of this tax and, although part of the increase in effective rates of income taxation arising from the operation of the rate scale was offset by the reduction in. income tax rates in 1970-71, total income taxes on persons have risen from 32.9 per cent of total Commonwealth revenues in 1961-62 to 39.2 per cent in 1970-71. Indirect taxation revenues have declined as a proportion of total revenues from 35.0 per cent in 1961-62 to 30.8 per cent in 1970-71, largely because expenditures on goods subject to indirect taxation have increased less rapidly than incomes and spending in the economy as a whole and because many products are subject to specific rates which have been changed only at irregular intervals. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The Commonwealth has incurred a deficit in each of the years covered by the tables varying from a peak of $642 million in 1967-68 to a small deficit of $7 million in 1969-70. Any economic assessment of the relative importance of these Budget results would, of course, have to take into account the composition of receipts and expenditures in each year, the proportion of expenditures made overseas and the level of activity in the private sector of the economy at the time. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The Commonwealth&#39;s financing transactions have varied considerably over the period from 1961-62 to 1970-71.

The following year, redemptions overseas exceeded overseas loan raisings by $131 million. Net proceeds from Australian loan raisings and Treasury Notes were at their highest level over the period, $506 million, in 1962-63 and were at their lowest point, $180 million, in 1964-65. </para>

The resultant loss of revenue to the Commonwealth will be offset by a commensurate reduction in the financial assistance grants otherwise payable to the States. At the same time, however, certain special additions, estimated to total $29 million, will be made to the financial assistance grants payable to the States in 1971-72 and special revenue assistance of $40 million will. also be provided.

The accounts have been adjusted  so  that export incentives are no longer shown as an offset to pay-roll taxation receipts but rather as a part of Commonwealth expenditures under the heading &#39;Commonwealth Payments to Industry&#39;.

      <para pgwide="yes">In 1970, for the first time, the total flow of financial resources, both official and private, from Australia to developing countries exceeded one per cent of Gross National Product. In that year Australia again ranked third in the world in terms of the net flow of official development assistance to developing countries expressed as a percentage of Gross National Product. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, which comprises all the major western aid donor countries, including Australia, uses three concepts to measure resource flows from developed to developing countries, the totals generally being expressed as percentages of Gross National Product. These are: </para>
      <list type="lowerroman">
        <item label="(i)">
          <para>Total net flow of official and private resources; </para>
        </item>
        <item label="(ii)">
          <para>Net official flows; and </para>
        </item>
        <item label="(iii)">
          <para>Net official development assistance. </para>
        </item>
      </list>
      <para pgwide="yes">The first concept - total net flow of official and private resources - corresponds to the definition used in the much publicised one per cent &#39;aid&#39; target. It includes private investment in, and commercial loans and export credits with a maturity of more than twelve months extended to, developing countries. This concept is deficient in a number of important respects for comparing the relative aid efforts of donor countries, not least because it lumps private and official flows together as if they were the same, although they are, of course, generally motivated by entirely different considerations and their terms and conditions often differ widely. Such a measure, moreover, places capital importing countries like Australia at a disadvantage compared with capital exporting countries. Accordingly, ever since the first United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in 1964 when aid targets for individual donor countries were first evolved, Australia has consistently queried the validity and usefulness of this total flow concept. But, whatever one may think about it, the fact is that it forms the basis of the one per cent &#39;aid&#39; target which has been accepted in international circles. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The second concept - net official flows - represents that part of the total flow of resources to developing countries which is subject to decision by governments. However, it also has a number of shortcomings in that it comprehends various transactions which are not considered to be concessional in character. For example, net purchases by governments and central monetary authorities of bonds issued, at market rates of interest, by institutions like the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank are included, as also are official export credits, etc. Moreover, this concept, as presently defined, fails to allow fully for the difference between grants and loans inasmuch as interest payments by developing countries are <inline font-style="italic">not</inline> deducted in calculating net flows. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The third concept - net official development assistance - omits the non-concessional elements in net official flows. This is by far the most meaningful of the three concepts and it is tending to become more widely used as a measure of comparative aid effort, or burden sharing, although interest is still not deducted. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The following details of Australia&#39;s &#39;aid&#39; performance in 1970 illustrate the differences between the three concepts: </para>

      </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The fact that interest received on loans extended to developing countries has not been taken into account in the above data tends to distort international comparisons, especially vis-a-vis Australia, which until recently has provided all of its official development assistance in grant form and is still predominantly a grant-aid donor. </para>
          <para>Official Development Assistance 1971-72</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The following table lists various items of expenditure which can be fairly readily identified as economic (i.e. non-military) aid to developing countries, including Papua New Guinea. The totals shown in this table differ from those quoted in Statement No. 4 - Estimates of Expenditures, 1971-72 by virtue of the inclusion of direct expenditures of an economic nature by various Commonwealth Departments and instrumentalities in or in connexion with Papua New Guinea, which are classified under other headings in the Budget. Expenditure relating to developed countries under the Commonwealth Co-operation in Education Scheme has been excluded. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The estimates for 1971-72 do not necessarily represent the sum total of all the official development assistance which Australia will provide to developing countries this year. For instance, the estimates for payments to the International Development Association, the Indus Basin Development Fund and the Special Funds of the Asian Development Bank may be exceeded if these institutions make greater calls on Australia. The expected decline in expenditure on multilateral aid programmes in 1971-72 basically reflects the fact that the final instalment of Australia&#39;s subscription to the capital stock of the Asian Development  Bank was paid in August 1970: no similar payment will be required this year. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">No allowance has been made in the above .table for the large subventions which the Commonwealth and State Governments provide each year for various educational institutions in Australia which are attended by several thousand overseas students, most of whom come from developing countries. The imputed costs involved in this hidden aid &#39;subsidy*&#39; are estimated to exceed $10 million per annum. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Similarly, the figures in the above table do not allow for the fact that parts of Australia&#39;s contributions to the regular budgets of a number of international organisations (included elsewhere in the Budget) are used to finance aid projects in developing countries - the annual amount involved is currently estimated to exceed $600,000. Nor has any allowance been made for the costs incurred in administering Australia&#39;s various aid programmes. In all, these costs, which are subsumed in Departmental Running Expenses, are tentatively estimated to exceed $7 million per annum at the present time. Proportionately, this compares favourably with the administrative costs of most other donor countries. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Australia is also providing substantial amounts of defence aid to certain developing countries in Asia, not counting expenditures associated with the presence of Australian forces in those countries. In 1971-72, for example, military and para-military aid to Malaysia and Singapore is estimated to total $4,260,000 and military aid to South Vietnam, $3,500,000. Considerable amounts are also being expended on the Pacific Islands Regiment in Papua New Guinea. To the extent that this defence aid, which is included in the overall Defence Vote, releases domestic resources that would otherwise be used for the same purpose, it may indirectly help to promote the economic development of recipient countries. </para>

Papua New Guinea became the thirty-sixth member of the Bank in April 1971. One-half of Australia&#39;s capital subscription is to remain at call as security for borrowings by the Bank on international capital markets to supplement its subscribed capital and finance an expansion in its own lending operations.

Special Aid to the Khmer Republic (Cambodia) will also be continued in 1971-72, with an amount of $1,350,000 being provided in the Budget, compared with expenditure of $960,000 in 1970-71. Likewise, other aid will be extended to this country in 1971-72 under the Colombo Plan. The estimate of $800,000 for Emergency Relief for Pakistan Refugees in 1971-72 is the balance of the $1 million pledged by the Government, of which $200,000 was spent last year. The lower estimate for Disaster Relief is a provisional figure since the need for such expenditures, because of their nature, cannot be foreseen. </para>

          <inline font-style="italic">Papua New Guinea.</inline>The estimates envisage a reduction of $3 million in the &#39;Basic grant-in-aid&#39; to the Administration in 1971-72 but this will be offset by an equivalent increase in the &#39;Development grant&#39; to the Territory this year. Payments of allowances and other benefits for overseas officers employed in the Papua New Guinea Public Service are estimated to increase by $4,503,000, largely because of the full-year effects of the wage and salary increases which were granted in 1970-71. However, provision has also been made for an increase in recruitment this year to facilitate the task of helping the Territory to prepare for self-government in the foreseeable future. Drawings on the Tarawa loan are expected to be $3,700,000 greater than in 1970-71 to enable the Administration to meet final payments falling due on completion of the township being constructed at Tarawa in conjunction with the Bougainville copper project, which will commence production in mid-1972. Finally, $225,000 has been provided for the Practical Training Scheme for Papuans and New Guineans in Australia in 1971-72, compared with expenditure of $78,000 in 1970-71. </para>

      <para pgwide="yes">Assistance to Australian industry is provided through the Budget by way of bounties, subsidies and other payments, and by way of contributions to promotion and research. In addition, services and facilities are provided by the Commonwealth for which no charge is made or for which charges fall well short of covering the costs incurred. A large part of the current expenditure of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, for which it is estimated $50 million will be provided from Consolidated Revenue in 1971-72, is on activities undertaken for the benefit of Australian industry. Commonwealth departments providing assistance in the form of services and facilities include Primary Industry, Trade and Industry (including the Australian Tourist Commission), National Development (Bureau of Mineral Resources, and Forestry and Timber Bureau), Civil Aviation and Labour and National Service. Assistance to improve the defence capability of Australian industry is provided in a number of ways from the Defence Vote. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The Commonwealth has provided substantial assistance to the rural sector in recent years by way of natural. disaster relief payments to the States, the largest of which has been reimbursement of State expenditure on drought relief schemes. A number of the specific purpose grants to the States also assist primary industries - for instance, payments for beef cattle roads, brigalow lands development, water resources investigations, and so on. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">In addition, a very considerable amount of assistance is being provided through the Budget by way of special taxation concessions which, as they result in a reduction of Commonwealth revenues (and a corresponding increase in the funds available to the recipients), are as much a call on the Budget as direct payments which add to expenditures. Assistance of this type is provided mainly by way of income tax concessions which permit firms and individuals to make deductions from their incomes for taxation purposes beyond those normally permitted under the income tax law. </para>

      <para pgwide="yes">The amount of revenue forgone in 1970-71 through the main taxation concessions for which figures are shown below, is estimated to have been about $305 million. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Most, though not all, of that amount is forgone through concessions in the income tax law, which are shown in some detail below. (Pay-roll tax rebates, under the export incentive scheme, are shown in the section headed &#39;Commonwealth Payments to Industry.&#39;) The special estate duty reliefs for primary production estates, introduced in the financial year 1969-70, cost $3 million in 1970-71. There are numerous concessions in the sales tax field in the form of special exemptions to assist particular industries. </para>

      <para pgwide="yes">A those which allow the deduction of larger amounts than are authorized under the general provisions of the law (included in this category is the rebate for export market development expenditure, which gives a tax saving additional to the saving resulting from the deduction from income for this expenditure); </para>

      </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The preceding table does not include the cost of the averaging provisions applied to incomes of &#39;primary producers&#39;. These provisions involve assessment at rates of tax which may differ from those otherwise applicable to the taxable income. They have the effect of reducing the tax otherwise payable in a year when taxable income exceeds the average of that year and four preceding years. It may exceed the average because of fluctuations in income, or because incomes had generally risen over the period, or both. Conversely, if taxable income falls below average income, tax payable under these provisions is higher than it would otherwise be. Options allowed by the law to withdraw permanently from the averaging provisions, or to re-enter them, have enabled &#39;primary producers&#39; to have applied either tax at general rates or tax under the provisions, whichever is more favourable to them. The provisions are estimated to have involved a cost to revenue of approximately $1 1 1 million in the five assessment years ended 1970-71, of which approximately $24 million relates to revenue forgone in 1970-71. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The table also excludes the cost of the drought bonds scheme which commenced in 1969-70. This scheme enables eligible pastoralists to reduce their taxable incomes in some years, by the amounts they subscribe to drought bonds, and increase them in later years, by amounts of redemptions. By evening out fluctuations in taxable income, the scheme, can enable them to make an overall saving in tax. The cost of the scheme to revenue up to 30 June 1971 is estimated at $640,000. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">With increasing mining production and continuing expenditure on exploration, it is probable that there will be further increases in the costs to revenue of the various income tax concessions which apply to the mining and mining exploration industries. In particular, increased production of bauxite, nickel and the other prescribed minerals, income from which is partly exempted under section 23a, will result in greater revenue losses in future years. Section 23a of the Income Tax Assessment Act provides for the exemption from income tax of one-fifth of the net income from the production or sale of certain prescribed metals and minerals. Also, as the income from production of Australian petroleum grows, there will be a continuing cost to revenue of the special allowances permitted for petroleum producing enterprises. These allowances effectively free from tax income from the sale of Australian petroleum and its products, until capital expenditure incurred in finding and recovering the petroleum (other than such expenditure transferred for deduction against shareholders&#39; income by reason of section 77d, which has been enacted to replace section 77a), has been recouped out of the mining profits. Dividends paid out of such tax-free income are exempt in the hands of shareholders of the mining and petroleum companies. </para>

While the provisions in question do not allow any greater total deduction over the life of the plant and equipment than do the normal depreciation provisions of the income tax law, they result in a deferment of tax which involves a cost to the Commonwealth Budget and a benefit, namely the provision of interest-free finance, to the taxpayers concerned. Normal depreciation allowances are designed to allow taxpayers to write off the cost of plant and equipment against income as the plant and equipment is used up in producing that income. Die value of accelerated depreciation allowances to taxpayers depends on how much sooner they receive savings than would be the case if the allowances had been based on the usage of plant and equipment, and on the value to them of having the ase of these savings. Where there is a constant or increasing rate of investment in plant and equipment subject to accelerated Depreciation, the concession virtually provides the taxpayers concerned with a revolving or increasing credit in their account with the taxation revenue. </para>

            <para>- by leave - My colleague the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Snedden)</inline> has referred in his Budget Speech to new postal and telephone charges which are to be introduced during the financial year 1971-72. The legislation relating to these will be introduced during this session. For the benefit of honourable members the proposed adjustments are set out in some detail in the schedules now available to them. The increase in the charges for telecommunications and postal services are proposed to be effective in the main from the 1st October 1971. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>As recorded in my White Paper on Post Office Prospects and Capital Programme 1971-72, at the beginning of the financial year 1970-71 the overall Post Office trading profit was estimated at $30m. By the end of the year this had changed to a trading loss of $2m with a loss on postal operations of $25m and a profit on telecommunications operations of $23m. The long-term forecast for the financial year 1971-72 was a modest profit. Without an adjustment in charges the current forecast is a loss of $36m - $35m in postal and $lm in the&#34; telecommunications side. The deterioration in the financial position is due largely to new wage awards. During 1970- 71 some 50 new awards affecting Post Office staff were granted and these will add $77m to Post Office expenditure in 1971-72, compared with a 5-year average increase of $40m. </para>
          <para>In addition, arbitration awards to industry generally have had an effect on prices of materials and services used by the Post Office and increased prices will add about a further 81 Om to expenditure during 1971- 72. In the face of the abnormal increase in labour and other costs which must be met in 1971-72. the continued demand for services and the excessive pressure this places on available resources, and the serious deterioration in financial prospects for the future, the Government has decided to increase certain charges for postal and telecommunication services. The proposals which I will later present to the House are expected to provide $50m in 1971-72 and $90m in a full year. The estimated overall trading position for 1971-72 will then be $36m profit with a $53m profit in telecommunications and a $17m loss in postal. </para>
          <para>TELEPHONE SERVICES</para>
        <para class="block">When introducing a Bill to the House at this time last year proposing certain increases in telephone charges I mentioned that the rental structure that was then in force did not nearly cover the recurring annual expenses borne by the Post Office in relation to the facilities provided. Accordingly, each of the 3 rental categories was increased, as well as the service connection fee and the rental for some other miscellaneous telecommunications facilities. The new charges were based on the economic situation of the Post Office at the time. </para>
      <para>However, since the new tariff structure came into operation on 1st October 1970 the very substantial salary increases awarded throughout have added to Post Office operating costs and dramatically altered the 1971-72 financial results forecast last year. As a consequence, there is no alternative other than to make further adjustments to the telephone tariff structure and it is now proposed that the present rental charges in each of 3 classes be further increased. The present annual rentals for a basic telephone service, depend ing on its location, are $47, $31 or $23. It is proposed that these charges be increased by $8, $6 and $4 respectively which will mean that subscribers in State capital cities, Canberra and Newcastle will pay $55 per annum for a basic telephone service, and those in provincial areas will pay either $37 or $27 per annum depending on the number of subscribers they can call for a local call fee and on whether they have continuous service. The one-third reduction in rentals which is given to blind persons and certain classes of pensioners will be maintained. </para>
      <para>It is proposed also to increase the service connection fee by $10, making the fee $50. Telephone call charges have not been increased since 1967, despite rising costs, and the Post Office, as a business undertaking, has no alternative but to increase these charges. It is proposed to increase local call charges from 4c to 4.75c with a corresponding increase in trunk charges. The fees for particular person, reversed charge and fixed time calls are also to be increased. The Telex call fee of 5c per meter registration has not been altered since the automatic Telex system was introduced in 1966. It is proposed to increase this fee to 6c. Fixed fees for installing, altering or removing miscellaneous equipment (as distinct from the installation of a new or removal of an existing service to a new address) are to be increased. Present charges which have not been altered since 1964, do not cover costs. It is estimated that the variations will bring in additional revenue of $35m in 1971-72 and $69m in 1972-73. </para>
      <para>Postal Services</para>
        <para>With estimated postal losses of $25m in 1970-71 and $35m in 1971-72 at current tariffs, a general increase in rates is unavoidable if rising costs are to be recovered. It is expected that the increased charges will bring in SI 5m in 1971-72 and $21m in a full year and reduce the estimated postal loss to $17m in 1971-72. Although there was an increase in the basic postal rate last year the wage rates payable to postal staff have been increased since then by an average of 16 per cent. These have had a particularly adverse effect on the postal services because some 70 per cent of its costs are associated with labour. In the last 3 years postal wage rates have risen by about 40 per cent. </para>
        <para>Letters and Other Articles</para>
        <para>The existing basic rate of 6c will be increased to 7c, for the first ounce in respect of letters and for the first 2 ounces in respect of other articles. There will be no change in the rates for heavier weight letters and other articles. </para>
        <para>Publications Registered at the G.P.O. </para>
        <para>Tht existing general rate for registered Australian books, newspapers and periodicals of 6c for the first 6 ounces and5c for each additional 6 ounces will become 7c for the first 6 ounces and 6c for each additional 6 ounces. These concession rates represent, in effect, a substantial subsidy to the publishing and printing industry and to many organisations, ranging from religious, charitable and welfare organisations to social and recreational clubs. It is debatable whether this subsidy is an appropriate charge on the Post Office&#39;s finances. It is necessary, therefore, to continue the action taken in recent years, to reduce the extent of the postal loss from this concession. </para>
        <para>The rate for Category A publications will be increased to 7c for each 12 ounces on the total weight of the consignment, subject to a minimum per article charge of 1&#189;c. This means that most country newspapers and periodicals, and the publications of religious, charitable and welfare organisations, and of educational, scientific, technical and agricultural bodies having the dissemination of knowledge as their principal object, will still be paying only 1&#189;c postage per article compared with 7c at normal printed matter rates. Each item must be handled a number of times between posting and delivery. </para>
        <para>Registered newspapers and periodicals in Category B, including those published by professional, business, union, commercial, social, recreational and motoring organisations, will pay the following rates: </para>
        <para>For delivery from the office of posting: 2c first 2 ounces. &#189;c each additional ounce. </para>
        <para>For delivery elsewhere: 2&#189;c first 2 ounces. 1c each additional ounce up to 8 ounces. &#189;c each additional ounce thereafter. </para>
        <para>The registered publications will still enjoy a substantial concession. </para>
        <para>These increases on bulk postings of Category A and Category B publications will operate from 1st March 1971 to give publishers and organisations time to adjust subscription rates. Category A publications will continue to be registered, at least for the time being. However, because of the need to contain increases in the loss from this concession area no further registrations in Category B will be allowed after 31st December 1971. Existing Category B publications will retain their registration as long as they comply with the eligibility conditions. </para>
        <para>A new Category Cat economic postage rates and requiring compliance with conditions to reduce postal costs, will be introduced. Controlled circulation publications, sent on request by publishers to defined customer groups, and not previously eligible for registration will be eligible for the new Category C. These publications, mainly heavy business magazines, are at a great disadvantage compared with comparable registered publications. In addition, newspapers and periodicals which would otherwise have been eligible for Category B will, after 31st December 1971, be eligible for registration in the new Category C. Conditions for page inscriptions, format, and supplementary material in respect of registered newspapers and periodicals will be varied to meet more satisfactorily present day needs of publishers. </para>
        <para>Bulk Pre-sorted and Householder Mail </para>
        <para>Adjustments are being made to the postage rates for letters, other articles and registered books posted under the bulk presorted mail service. Many customers are taking advantage of these lower rates and the Post Office is benefiting from the economies of higher mail volumes and compliance with mandatory presort ing and other conditions. Rates for heavier weights have been converted to a 2 ounce basis. In the Householder Service a reduction of up to 25 per cent for postings over 100,000 is proposed in order to meet competition from private delivery contractors and retain existing business. This service will continue to pay its way because no sorting is required, the articles being addressed simply to The Householder&#39; and delivery is spread over several days. </para>
        <para>Other Postal Adjustments</para>
        <para>The rates for parcels will be increased, averaging 10 per cent for domestic and 20 per cent for overseas. The fees for many reasons for the increases when introducing the proposed legislation later in the session. </para>
        <para>I now turn to the new fees for broadcasting and television licences. These were referred to by the Treasurer in his Budget Speech. There will be no increase in the pensioner rate in either broadcasting or television licences fees. As to other areas, the broadcast listeners, hirers and lodging house licence fee for zone 1 will be increased from $6.50 to $8 and for zone 2 from $3.30 to $4.25. The television viewers licence fee will increase from $14 to $19 and the combined receiving licence, to cover both broadcasting and television, will increase from $20 to $26.50, and a new combined lodging house licence will be included with a fee at $26.50. </para>
        <para>All the proposed adjustments are detailed in tables, copies of which are being made available to honourable members. With the concurrence of honourable members, I incorporate these tables in Hansard. </para>

        </para>
        <para class="block">labour intensive special services, which fail to cover costs by a big margin, such as registered post, certified mail, and messenger delivery services will also be increased. However, the maximum compensation payable on registered mail will be increased to $150 and compensation of up to $20 for loss or damage in respect of certified mail will be introduced. Regarding overseas mail, airmail letter rates will be increased by 5c per half ounce, 2c per half ounce in the case of New Zealand, and aero grammes by 2c, because of cost increases in the handling component and the need to cover processing costs on incoming mail which is nearly twice the outgoing volume, despite a 25 per cent reduction in conveyance rates. </para>
        <para>British Commonwealth preference rates for overseas surface letters will be abolished; few Commonwealth countries have this now and Canada has just eliminated it. As far as the general public is concerned, this will have relatively little effect as their most common form of surface communication overseas is greeting cards which may be sent at the 7c printed papers rate proposed. A new rate category for all registered newspapers and periodicals, posted in bulk to overseas will also be introduced, the charge being the same as for category C in the domestic service. Other changes include a sliding scale of fees relating to volume, for business reply items, and an allowance of lc in the postage on grouped art ices. I will elaborate further on the </para>

            <para>- by leave  -  I should like to amplify the brief reference made by the Treasurer to the increases in pay included in the Estimates in respect of other ranks of the armed Services. It should be realised that the increased expenditure provision does not merely connote a pay increase, but marks a major change in the philosophy and system of other ranks pay as recommended by the Committee of Inquiry into Financial Terms and Conditions of Service Employment. In accordance with the Government&#39;s policy of ensuring the justice and adequacy of financial and other conditions of service of the armed Services, this Committee was set up in October 1970 under the chairmanship of the Honourable <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> John R. Kerr, C.M.G., a judge of the Commonwealth Industrial Court, with other distinguished members having experience of the armed forces, conciliation and arbitration, commerce and industry and the Commonwealth Public Service. The Committee also has a senior serving officer from each of the armed Services attached to it in a consultative role. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Under its terms of reference, the Kerr Committee is required to examine the principles for determining officers&#39; pay, the practical working of the group pay system for other ranks, the nature and incidence of the demands and exigencies of Service life and various compensatory allowances. In relation to the matters before it, the Committee has sought and received the views of Service boards, relevant Commonwealth departments, serving servicemen of all ranks and other interested persons and organisations. It has also visited ships of the fleet at sea, Service establishments in Australia, bases in Singapore and Malaysia and operational units in South Vietnam to secure first-hand knowledge and experience of the wide variety of service employments and conditions of work, and life in the Services. Wide-ranging discussions of both a formal and informal nature have been a feature of the Committee&#39;s inquiries, and these are continuing. </para>
          <para>Quite early in its inquiries the Committee decided that it was necessary to give priority attention to the particular term of reference relating to the pay of other ranks in the Services and this approach was endorsed by the Minister for Defence. The outcome of this was report No. 1, entitled The Group Pay System&#39;, which was made available to honourable members and to the Press with the approval of the Government on 11th June 1971. A brief supplementary report No. 2 has since been submitted by the Committee on the same subject recommending amended pay rates in the light of certain changes in the pay rates of trades and associated staffs in the Commonwealth Public Service. These changes, which flowed from a consent determination issued by the Commonwealth Public Service Arbitrator on 8th July 1971 became effective after the date of submission of report No. 1 but were foreshadowed in that report, which requested that, if and when approved, these changes be referred back to the Committee for further consideration. This consideration resulted in further increases to all of the pay levels and the noncommissioned officer pay scales recommended in report No. 1. The Kerr Committee stated that it had considered and rejected the alternative of applying this increase only to those Service employments which have hitherto been aligned with the Commonwealth Public Service grades now granted an increase. Bearing in mind all the difficulties and anomalies which this process had generated in the past, the Committee stated that it proposed to adopt the course of placing new values on the pay levels established by report No. 1. </para>
          <para>The group pay system is based on the concept of aligning Service employments with civilian trades for pay purposes. Introduced originally with the Services pay code in 1947, the system was expanded to seven groups by the Allison Committee in 1958. A further review in 1968 greatly extended the number of groups and applied the system for the first time to the Navy. While it endorsed the concept of relating Service pay to equivalent civilian rates on a broad basis, the Kerr Committee found that the progression towards alignment of Service employments with a multitude of specific civilian trades, all undergoing pay changes in an uncoordinated way, was disruptive and counterproductive so far as Service pay satisfaction was concerned. The Committee criticised the pay turbulence within the Services resulting from the constant variation of outside awards with which Service employments are aligned, the constant and irritating changes in pay relativities between different Service employments due to the erratic influence of independent civilian award movements, the lengthy delays in the system, the inconsistencies which resulted from using a variety of Federal, State and Commonwealth Public Service awards as alignments points, and the anomalies and inadequacies in the pay margins allowed for senior No ranks. </para>
          <para>The Committee concluded that an extensive change was necessary and recommended the immediate introduction of a new pay system based on an &#39;industry&#39; approach in which Service employments up to corporal level will no longer be aligned with a multiplicity of individual civilian trades but will form a co-ordinated pattern, divided into six broad pay levels. Stable internal relativities will be established and broad alignment maintained with general wage levels in outside industry and the Commonwealth Public Service. In relation to the ranks from sergeant to warrant officer class 1, the Committee recommended a structure designed to systematise and improve No pay margins, thus recognising the added responsibility which comes with increasing rank. Associated with this is a basic change in concept under which sergeant, staff sergeant and warrant officer rank will receive a uniform incremental scale of pay instead of group pay. Above the rank of corporal and its equivalent, no differential will be included for trade skill, the emphasis being placed on the common responsibility for supervision and management. </para>
          <para>Additionally, the Committee emphasised its strong view that proper pay relativities in respect of Service employment can only be determined ultimately by a systematic work value study and went on to recommend that an intensive work value examination be undertake. </para>
          <para>Because the Committee recommendations involve a concept of Service pay which is significantly different from that which currently applies to other ranks pay, all members will not receive the same percentage increase in pay. Some members will inevitably benefit more than others from the broad-banding process whereby a large number of pay groups were translated into 6 pay levels. In other cases, certain members will benefit from the application of market rates, while other members have already received this benefit. The largest increases will be given to warrant officers and senior Cos in conformity with the concept of recognising the responsibilities of rank. Although the final rates for these ranks will be uniform, the increases cannot be uniform as Cos currently receive differing rates of pay according to their respective trade skills. However, the introduction of the new system will bring pay increases to most other rank members of Australia&#39;s armed forces. The Committee clearly indicated that the pay rates which it had recommended for the various pay levels had regard to the rates paid by the Commonwealth Public Service for relevant trade and technical skills in various forms of Crown employment. This is not to say that individual Service employments are equated with specific trades in the Public Service. The Committee commented that it had in mind that members of the armed services are employed by the Crown, and that it seemed to the Committee entirely sensible that there should be, in general, equality of financial terms and conditions of employment between members of the armed forces and Commonwealth employees. In reaching its recommendations the Kerr Committee concluded that the special service allowance of $146 a year which was introduced by the Government in 1964 as an incentive to recruitment and re-engagement, was an over award payment appropriate to the period when service pay rates were related primarily to minimum award rates rather than market rates. With the new concept now being introduced, the Committee recommended that it should be consolidated in the rates of pay instead of remaining as a separate allowance. </para>
          <para>The Committee of Inquiry gave particular attention to the pay of servicewomen. Servicewomen do not receive the special service allowance, so that the consolidation of this allowance into pay will eliminate this difference between male and female rates of pay. At the private level, servicewomen will now receive 95 per cent of male rates, as in the general community, progressing to 100 per cent on 1st January 1972. Above the private level, rank margins for servicewomen are assessed on the basis of the difference in responsibilities compared with those of equivalent male ranks. The Committee observed that analysis of comparative responsibilities was a matter for the full work value inquiry but in the meantime, it recommended that the rank margin for servicewomen be raised to 80 per cent of the male margin. The Government accepted these recommendations and agreed that servicewomen&#39;s rates of pay should be reviewed during the work value examination. </para>
          <para>The Kerr Committee was not required by its terms of reference to deal with the pay of citizen forces and therefore made no recommendation in this regard. However, in conformity with past practice and the Government&#39;s desire to lend every encouragement to the citizen forces, it has decided to apply the increased pay levels to other ranks in the citizen forces using appropriate comparative levels of skill. </para>
          <para>The Committee considered that early commencement of a work value study of Service employments was essential and offered to undertake this task, emphasising the extent of its accumulated knowledge on the subject, and the interaction with some of the remaining terms of reference yet to be dealt with by the Committee. The Government has agreed that this task should be undertaken by the Committee. In developing its concept of an industry type approach to Service pay the Committee emphasised the need for periodic systematic, review of pay rates in lieu of the present system of numerous uncoordinated adjustments resulting from individual trade links with outside industrial awards. The Committee suggested that these reviews might not be limited to fixed intervals but made as necessary to maintain comparative wage justice in the light of general wage movements in the community. Initially, such reviews will be associated with the studies being carried out by the Committee of Inquiry while it continues in being. The Government will later announce what machinery of review will be established after the Committee completes its assignment. </para>
          <para>The Government has decided that the new pay scales will become effective forthwith from the commencement of the next pay period which is 26th August 1971 foi the RAAF and 27th August 1971 for Army and Navy. It will not be possible of course to effect payment immediately. This is not merely a pay increase but a major change in the structure of Service pay, which will require extensive amendment of Service pay regulations. This is a complicated process which experience has shown will take up to 3 months. Efforts are being made to shorten this process as far as possible. When made, payment will be retrospective to the dates I have indicated. </para>
          <para>All of the recommendations contained in the No. 1 report of the Kerr Committee as amended by the No. 2 report have been accepted by the Government. The Government had the benefit of the views of the Services and its defence advisers and all supported the changes now introduced. The proposed daily rates of active pay for male and female other ranks as recommended in report No. 2 of the Kerr Committee are contained in the attached schedules, which with the concurrence of honourable members I incorporate in Hansard. </para>

          </para>
          <para>For the convenience of honourable members, I have summarised the new rates of active pay on an annual basis. Recruits will receive $2,358. Privates and their equivalents in the Navy and RAAF will receive from $2,445 to $4,036 depending on the pay level to which their particular skill assigns them. Lance-corporals will receive from $2,565 to $4,157. Corporals will receive from $2,774 to $4,361. Sergeants will receive from $3,022 to $4,934 depending on their starting point on promotion or translation to the rank, and then on years of service in the rank. Staff Sergeants will receive from $4,934 to $6,234. Warrant Officers class 2 from $5,909 to $6,234, and Warrant Officers class 1 from $6,584 to $6,935. In general these are the rates applicable to single men living in service quarters. Married men receive further allowances totalling $712 per annum, and in addition all members receive uniform allowance, free medical and dental attention and other benefits. The total cost of the approved increases including those for the citizen forces, in a full year will be approximately $34m. The cost for 1971-72 will be a little over $29m. </para>
          <para>As I have indicated, the reports on group pay are only the first, though a very important stage in the Kerr Committee inquiry. Work is proceeding on the other terms of reference, including the principles and levels which should apply to officers pay, and the demands and exigencies of Service life, together with some special references on certain allowances, such as education allowance and temporary rental allowance. To these items will now be added the very important task of directing the work value examination which the Committee sees as the only satisfactory basis for determination of Service pay relativities. </para>
          <para>Finally, I should like to take this opportunity of commending the excellent work which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Kerr and his Committee have carried out to the present time. The unqualified acceptance by the Government of all the recommendations made by the Committee in relation to other ranks pay is a demonstration both of confidence in the Committee and the Government&#39;s de term in nation to provide financial and other conditions of service sufficient to attract and retain men and women with the needed qualities, skills and experience for the Australian Forces.

            <para>- by leave - The statement of the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Fairbairn)</inline> outlines pay increases for other ranks of the armed forces. It supplements the preliminary statement of the Kerr Committee which was released by the Minister&#39;s predecessor on 11th June. The estimates contained in that statement have been revised because of higher pay rates in relevant sections of the Public Service. In effect, what the Minister has done is to revise and clarify certain aspects of the initial report of the Kerr Committee in the light of the supplementary report made by the Committee. This had meant an increase in the cost of the changes recommended by the Kerr Committee and adopted by the Government. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The whole area of pay increases for the Services is an immeasurably complex one, and I have not had the time to study the comparative pay rates in detail. What is important is that the Government has accepted the recommendation and has introduced them promptly. This is commendable because the Government had to be goaded into appointing the Kerr Committee. It took a considerable amount of pressure from sections of this Parliament to force the Government&#39;s hand. Belatedly, the Government realised the extent of Service unrest over pay and conditions and has acted to improve them and remove anomalies. At first sight, the reforms in the pay structures seem to be good ones. Undoubtedly, there will be anomalies with the introduction of these broad pay groupings. However, the great majority of other ranks will benefit. It is also gratifying that recognition has been given to simplifying the complex and unwieldy structure of allowances for all 3 Services. I hope that further substantial reforms will be made in this structure. It is encouraging that the Kerr Committee is to proceed with an intensive work value study of Service jobs. </para>
          <para class="block">There has been some confusion on this point which has been removed by the Minister. </para>
          <para>This work value study is immensely important for the whole status and remuneration of Australian servicemen and women. I have seen some of the submissions presented to the Kerr Committee on this matter and the mass of evidence available will enable the Committee to assess for the first time the value of Service jobs relative to citizen employment. It is just and appropriate that the increased pay rates recommended by the Kerr Committee will be extended to members of the civilian forces. The Kerr Committee has made an encouraging start to the massive task it has undertaken. It is to be hoped that the Committee&#39;s recommendations will be brought quickly before the Government and transmitted to the thousands of servicemen and women who will benefit by better pay and conditions. These brief comments are a response to a quick reading of. the Minister&#39;s statement. The Opposition welcomes these reforms and hopes that the House will be able to debate them in greater detail later in the session. </para>
          <para>May 1 also say in conclusion that I join with the Minister in congratulating the Kerr Committee. The Minister may recall my initial objection, if I may use that term, to the appointment of a committee because I thought it would have been better had a select committee of the Parliament been appointed. I point out, however, that I did not direct my objection to the Kerr Committee specifically. The Committee which was appointed under the chairmanship of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Kerr acted promptly, I think efficiently, and certainly very comprehensively in relation to the matters it was asked to investigate. Therefore, I join with the Minister in expressing on behalf of the Opposition our appreciation to the Committee of the very valuable contribution it made towards preventing what, if it had been allowed to continue, would have amounted to continued unrest in relation to pay and conditions in the 3 Services. </para>

The Bill varies the rate of tax to be collected on diesel fuel which is sold or disposed of to a person who is not the holder of a certificate and is therefore not entitled to receive concessional treatment.

In that report, the Board put forward the view that on the information available there seemed little doubt that the alumina industry in Australia could, at least for the time being, retain a substantial export trade without the Benefit of the by-law arrangement. However, the Board also recognised that should the cost of sodium hydroxide be raised, this could affect the alumina industry&#39;s ability to continue expanding its exports and could result in decisions by international companies involved in the industry to locate new plants outside Australia. In view of the importance of alumina exports to the Australian economy, the Board believed that the risks involved in imposing a duty on sodium hydroxide used in the production of export alumina were not warranted by the potential benefit to the local chlorine and sodium hydroxide industry. These views were accepted by the Government and the arrangement whereby producers of alumina for export secured supplies of caustic soda under bylaw was continued. </para>

Most weed killers are imported duty free from British Commonwealth sources; these are subject to a 10 per cent duty when manufactured in other countries. In 1969 a system of weedicide and pesticide subsidies was introduced in New Zealand. It applies to herbicides and insecticides registered by the Agricultural Chemicals Board and approved by the Department of Agriculture, and does not include compounds which are used solely as fungicides. The scheme provides for a 50 subsidy on the factory price. For administrative purposes this, is taken to mean 42} per cent of the price paid by retailers, and the subsidy is claimed at this rate from the Department of Agriculture by registered manufacturers or importers on the basis of certified sales. </para>

        <para>Boarding Allowances. These allowances are paid to primary and secondary school children who must live away from home to attend school. The usual definition which is applied to the need to live away from home is that suitable education provision is not available within 10 miles of the child&#39;s home. The allowances range from $250 to $370 p.a. depending&#39; on the operation of a means test. About 75 per cent receive the maximum allowance. In 1971 an estimated 450 pupils including some Aboriginals, are receiving an allowance and about one third of the total are attending school outside the Northern Territory. </para>
        <para>Travelling Allowances. Pupils who must live away from home to attend a school located within the Northern Territory receive reimbursement either of a return fare or a mileage allowance each term. Those attending school in a State receive reimbursement once per annum. Normally the entitlement to such travelling allowances would be determined on the same basis as the entitlement to a boarding allowance. In 1971 approximately 450 pupils, including some Aboriginals, will receive a travelling allowance and about one third of the total are attending school outside the Northern Territory. </para>
        <para>Tertiary Air Fares. Students from the Northern Territory doing tertiary studies elsewhere in Australia are reimbursed for cost of one return air fare each year to and from their place of study. Some 55 students are expected to benefit from this scheme in 1971 and the cost is estimated at $7700. </para>
        <para>Other forms of assistance such as Conveyance Allowance payable to parents for the use of private cars or other vehicles for transporting children to school in areas where buses are not available, reimbursement of the Queensland University Surcharge, the Secondary Book Allowance and the Free Primary Books and Materials Scheme are all confined to students who are studying in the Northern Territory. </para>

              <para>and (2) The sort of radioactive wastes which will occur from the nuclear reactor at Jervis Bay and the methods employed to dispose of these products will depend very much on which type of reactor is chosen. An exact answer cannot therefore be given until the choice has been made. However, all the reactors finally examined were in the class known as &#39;water reactors&#39; and the following general comments apply to these reactors which for convenience are considered in two classes, direct cycle and indirect cycle. Direct cycle systems have the turbine driven by steam produced in the reactor core from the coolant water. Indirect cycle systems have separate loops for the core coolant and the turbine steam circuit, heat being transferred from the former to the latter in a heat exchanger. The remarks deal with the three types of radioactive wastes produced, airborne, aqueous and solid and the figures in brackets after the radionuclides are their respective half lives. The half life is the time required for the radioactivity of a radionuclide to decay to half its original intensity. This decay continues progressively; i.e. after two half lives, the intensity will be one quarter the original, after three, one eighth and so on. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
        </answer>
        <para class="block">Airborne </para>
        <para>Indirect cycle reactors produce small volumes of airborne waste which are retained for a time to allow radioactive decay. As a result of this decay, the gases finally discharged contain only minute quantities of krypton-85 (10.27 years) and occasionally xenon-133 (5.2 days). </para>
        <para>In direct cycle reactors the retention time is less. Radioactive decay is therefore not possible in Storage and the practice normally employed is to dilute the partially decayed gas with excess air and release from a high stack. The stack discharge would contain small amounts of tritium (10.26 years) argon-41 (1.83 hours), xenon-133 (5.2 days), xenon-135 (9.2 hours), krypton-83m (1.9 hours), krypton-85 (10.27 years) and krypton- 88 (2.8 hours). It may be seen from the half lives that with the exception of the tritium and krypton85 which in any case are well below internationally accepted levels, the airborne radioactive wastes will quickly decay away. Some fluorine-18 (1.8 hours) may be in the stack discharge, but races of iodine-131 (8.05 days) which may enter the steam circuit would be removed by filtration. </para>
        <para class="block">Aqueous </para>
        <para>The total radioactivity which would be discharged in aqueous effluent at far below internationally accepted levels would be very small and of 3 types, activated corrosion products such as cobalt-58 (71 days), cobalt-60 (5.27 years) and iron-59 (45 days), tritium, and mixed fission products of which minute traces of iodine-129 (16 million years) and iodine-131 (8.05 days) would be the most important. </para>
        <para>Direct cycle reactors are likely to have a greater total release of radioactivity while heavy water <inline font-style="italic">reactors</inline> will have a higher tritium release than will light water reactors. These remarks are relative in the sense that the amounts discharged would always be well below internationally accepted levels. </para>
        <para class="block">Solid </para>
        <para>Neglecting the fission products retained in the used fuel elements, the main sources of solid radioactive waste would be the filter sludge, spent ion exchange resins and filters and the residues from concentration of liquid waste. The important radionuclides would therefore be the same as for liquid waste. Solid waste would be stored for eventual disposal at a national centre, the method of disposal depending upon its activity level and physical form. Other forms of solid waste such as contaminated tools and materials would be handled similarly. </para>

            <para>Wastes other than radionuclides, with the exception of heavy water, would be classed as normal industrial wastes and treated in a fashion appropriate for such materials. Heavy water because of its value, would, where economically possible, be recovered. </para>

        <para>The dose limitation for members of the public is a more theoretical concept than the maximum permissible doses for persons exposed to ionising radiation as the result of their employment Whereas it is practicable to monitor the radiation doses of the individuals in the latter group, the dose limits recommended in these radiation Protection Standards for the members of the public are intended to provide standards for the design and operation of radiation sources so that it is not likely that individuals in the public will receive more than a specified dose. The effectiveness of the design and operating procedures are, with respect to members of the public, not normally checked by the monitoring of individual doses but are assessed through sampling procedures in the environment, through area monitoring and through control of the sources from which the exposure may arise. </para>
        <para>The actual doses received, as a result of a certain use of ionising radiation, by individuals within a group of the public may vary, depending on such factors as differences in their age, size, metabolism and customs as well as variation in their environment. These factors make it impossible to derive the maximum doses that might be received individually. In practice, it is acceptable to use for the purpose of the assessment, a group representative of those individuals in the public expected to receive the highest dose. It is recommended that the mean dose of this group be compared with the relevant dose limits recommended in Table 3. These dose limits do not take into account radiation exposure from natural background radiation or that received by members of the public through the medical and dental use of ionising radiations&#39;. </para>

            <para>It is incorrect to say that any proposed nuclear power station at jervis Bay will be based on a technology which is likely to be superseded within a few years. No doubt the honourable member is making reference to the possibility of just breeder reactor systems superseding current thermal reactor systems. As stated on several previous occasions fast breeder systems hold great promise for the future but they are not yet commercially practicable. Accordingly they are not likely to supersede the current generation of reactors within a few years&#39;. </para>

              <para>In answer to somewhat similar questions I stated it was not possible to give answers in precise quantitative terms. The cost of nuclear power generation in Australia will depend on a number of factors such as the size of the station, its location, the financial conditions involved, the type of reactor, the degree of local content and so on. </para>

          <para>It is true that as a result of the assessment of the tenders received for the proposed Jervis Bay nuclear power station we now have a better knowledge of the relative costs of electricity generated from reactors using natural uranium and those using enriched uranium. This information, however, relates only to that particular station and as the tendered figures are necessarily confidential, I am not in a position to disclose them to the honourable member. </para>

            <item label="(2)">
              <para>Costs of electricity generated by conventional plants in Australia vary very much between individual plants because of variations in local conditions so that again a precise comparative statement between nuclear and conventional generation cannot be supplied.

              <para>The varying extent to which there may be an overseas interest in a company in Australia, and the different forms which this interest might take, creates the necessity to develop some objective criteria as to what constitutes an overseas company. The Bureau of Census and Statistics has adopted the following conventions for the purpose of producing statistics on overseas participation in Australian industry. </para>
            </item>

              <para>For statistical purposes, the Bureau measures the degree of overseas ownership and control in terms of the percentage of the total value of production of an industry which is attributable to overseas and to Australian companies respectively. To do this it <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> again necessary to adopt certain conventions. When measuring the degree of overseas ownership by overseas companies, the value of production of their mining or mineral processing activities is attributed according to the percentage of the equity interest held overseas and in Australia, respectively. However, when measuring the degree of overseas control by these overseas companies, the whole of the value of production of their mining or mineral processing &#39; activities is attributed to them, except where an Australian company holds a greater proportion of the equity interest than an overseas company in which case the value of production is  attributed wholly to Australian control. </para>

Some preliminary work has commenced on the 1968-69 tables but the compilation of input-output tables is a time-consuming task requiring highly trained staff and it will be several years before the 1968-69 tables are completed. It is impossible to give any precise publication date. </para>

          <para>The Superannuation Board, which includes a member elected by the contributors, who is a party to all investment decisions, enters into private negotiations when a loan is to be secured by a mortgage of land or real property. Such negotiations are confidential between the Board and its client and reflect the established practice for lending institutions such as the Superannuation Board. Disclosure of the details of these investments would interfere with the proper functioning of the Board. The Board does not, therefore, publish details of individual loans. </para>

This information, over a period of 10 years, would involve extensive analysis of records of a large number of investments which are not normally summarised in the form provided for in the question. </para>

            <para>Welpa. This deposit was discovered by H. Evans of Consolidated Zinc Corporation Ltd in 1955 during the course of a field survey in which he was primarily concerned with petroleum exploration but under instructions to be on the look out also for other minerals. The Cape York area was mentioned in B Mr Bulletin No. 24  -  Bauxite in Australia, by H. B. Owen, issued in 1954, as an area in which &#39;commercially valuable deposits of iron ore and presumably bauxite&#39; might occur. </para>
            <para>Gove and Vessel Islands: The Vessel Island deposits were found in 1949 by part-time prospectors who had been instructed by Owen (then an officer of the Bureau of Mineral Resources) what to look for and what samples to obtain. Samples brought in by them to Owen were found to be bauxite. The individual deposits were identified by Owen in 1951 and testing was carried out in 1952. This was arranged by the Australian Aluminium Production Commission, a joint CommonwealthTasmanian Government Authority, under whose auspices most of the exploration for and testing of bauxites in Australia up to that time had been carried out, with the Bureau of Mineral Resources acting as the exploration agency. </para>
            <para>The Gove deposits were tested in detail, first by New Guinea Resources Prospecting Co., owned 51 per cent by the Commonwealth Government and 49 per cent by British Aluminium Co. Ltd and subsequently by various other companies including finally, Nabalco. </para>
            <para>Mitchell Plateau: These deposits were found by K. Malcolm of American Metal Climax (Amax) in 1965 and subsequently tested by that company. The Bureau of Mineral Resources was carrying out geological mapping in the southern part of the Kimberleys at the same time but was not directly concerned in the discovery. </para>

          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(1)">
              <para>In the period referred to. it has been the policy of the Federal Reserve Bank of the United States to bring about a rapid increase in the quantity of money in the economy. This has resulted in a general decline in interest rates in the United States. The objective of the policy, as T understand it, has been to produce conditions conducive to a general revival of economic activity in a nation which has been experiencing a level of unemployment which exceeded 6 per cent. One of the results of this increase in the quantity of money has been to make available a greater volume of funds to the housing industry and this has assisted in producing a revival in activity in that industry. The policy, however, is essentially one of general application, designed to stimulate overall economic activity. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(2)">
              <para>Yes. Figures published by the Commonwealth Statistician on 3rd May show that in the March quarter of 1971 private dwelling commencements totalled 29,550 compared with 32,214 in the March quarter of 1970. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(3)">
              <para>It should be noted that private dwelling commencements were at a seasonally-adjusted record level in the March quarter 1970. The subsequent decline has been associated with a number of factors, including tight monetary conditions. The increase in housing loan rates was part of the general rise in interest rates in the economy associated with these financial conditions. However, it is not possible- to single out interest rates as the cause of, or even a major factor in, the fall in commencements. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(4)">
              <para>While the Government would not wish to see the current level of interest rates continue longer than is necessary, it would be inappropriate at this time for the Government to direct the Reserve Bank to arrange a reduction in those housing loan interest rates subject to the Bank&#39;s direct control. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>The level of interest rates is determined basically by the demand for and supply of funds in the economy. If the interest rates on housing loans were artificially lowered, the consequential limitations on the ability of housing finance institutions to compete for an adequate share of savings could result in a marked falling-ofT in the funds available for housing. This would, of course, be inimical to the acquisition of homes, by young people. At the same time, a reduction in the general level of interest rates would, in current economic circumstances, involve the very serious risk of adding to inflationary pressures, and this too could ultimately operate to the disadvantage of potential home buyers. While the cost of borrowed money is an important factor to potential home buyers, it is relatively less significant than the actual cost of a home which, of course, could increase significantly if inflationary pressures, in the economy were allowed to go unchecked. </para>

              <para>&#39; Where premises are used by a taxpayer in gaining or producing his assessable income or in carrying on a business for that purpose, payments made by the taxpayer for sewerage and water services and the removal of effluent and ullage are deductible for income tax purposes except to the extent that they are of a capital, private or domestic nature. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>In relation to private premises, the income tax law authorises the allowance of deductions to a taxpayer for the payment of rates which are annually assessed and for which he is personally liable. To the extent, therefore, that charges for sewerage and water services and the removal of effluent and -ullage are incorporated in such rates, a deduction is allowed. However, payments made to a contractor for these services or charges imposed by the local authority independently of the annual levy for general rates do not qualify for deduction. </para>

            <item label="(2)">
              <para>In general, outgoings of a private or domestic nature are not allowable deductions. Rates paid on private premises fall within this category and the allowance of a deduction for expenditure of this kind represents a concession granted only when specific conditions are satisfied. Against this background, the denial of a deduction where the relevant tests are not met is not considered to create an anomaly; an amendment of the law would be necessary to widen the scope of the existing provisions. </para>

        <para class="block">Some care should be exercised in interpreting this information. For instance the costs are the sums of the actual expenditures during construction, and have not been brought to a common basis with regard to money values. Furthermore, there is no uniform or standard basis for determination of storage yield; for instance the yield from a given storage can vary considerably depending on the degree and frequency of restriction in supply permitted in dry years. </para>

            <para>The Government of South Vietnam is responsible for all claims for compensation that arise from combat activities of its own and other forces assisting her. The Australian Government meets, on an ex gratia basis, claims by Vietnamese civilians who have suffered loss in consequence of the wrongful act or neglects of members of the Australian force or employees of that force. Compensation is paid by the Australian Government after assessment of liability, entitlement and quantum having regard, in the light of Vietnamese law, to what probably would be paid as a result of litigation between the parties.&#39; Careful regard is given to the adequacy of each claim. </para>

              <para>As my predecessor stated in answer to a previous question by the honourable member (Hansard 25th September 1970, page 1756), it is not realistic to attempt to estimate the cost of providing pre-school education over the whole of Australia on the basis described by the honourable member. There are basic differences between the Australian Capital Territory and other areas in many of the factors which affect costs in the provision of pre-school education, such as the geographic spread of the pre-school aged population, the size of the pre-school centres which would be required, cost of acquisition and development of sites for centres, building costs, attendance patterns and salary levels. Estimates based on applying figures appropriate under one set of conditions to areas where conditions differ so substantially could not held but be misleading. For these reasons, and because the basis of Professor Goldman&#39;s estimates is not stated, 1 am unable to comment on them. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>I assume the honourable member is referring in his question to the agreement arrived at on 6th May 1970, between the A.C.T.U. and the National Employers&#39; Policy Committee as to procedures for dealing with industrial disputes. </para>
            <para>This agreement was not one associated with the National Labour Advisory Council. </para>
            <para>In an agreed statement issued in connection with the agreement, it was stated that it was &#39;the mutual responsibility of individual unions and employers to give effect to the guidelines&#39; and that &#39;it would be important to &#39; translate these principles into action as soon as practicable on the basis of mutual decisions by the parties&#39;. </para>
            <para>Unions and employers are under no obligation to keep me or my Department informed as to the extent or otherwise that they may have given effect to the guidelines. However, I am informed that in several major areas of employment there have either been discussions between union and employer representatives towards giving effect to the guidelines or there have been agreements entered into which have been influenced by the guidelines. </para>

            <para>- The answer to the honourable member&#39;s question is as follows: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(1)">
              <para>In the application form used for the wool emergency financial assistance scheme, provision was made to obtain details of the number of sheep shorn in each of the years 1968-69 and 1969-70 and the number of sheep on hand at 30th June 1969 and 1970. Where it was clear from these figures or from additional information sought from an applicant that sheep numbers had been reduced voluntarily and not as the result of drought, countervailing adjustment was made to the applicant&#39;s wool income. This was done to ensure, as far as possible, that assistance was granted only where the decline in wool income resulted from factors beyond the applicant&#39;s control and not as the result of a voluntary policy to replace sheep with some other form of primary production. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>Where an applicant maintained sheep numbers in 1969-70- at approximately the level of the previous year and was otherwise eligible for an assistance payment, he would have received a grant under the scheme. Undoubtedly some growers, particularly in areas of Victoria and South Australia where the 1969-70 season was favourable, could have maintained sheep numbers and also increased the number of cattle carried. Such growers may have received grants under the scheme even though their gross income from both wool and cattle did not decline in 1969-70. </para>
          <para>The Government was aware that, with the necessarily arbitrary conditions of the emergency scheme framed to expedite the allocation of funds to wool-growers in serious need, such cases might occur. It considered this preferable to the withholding of assistance from growers whose financial situation had become precarious following the serious decline in wool prices and the effect of prolonged drought on 1969-70 wool incomes. </para>
