In the light of this change I shall be in touch with  His Excellency  the Governor-General to tender my resignation as Prime Minister and to offer him certain advice as to whom he should give the commission to form a new government. In the meantime in these circumstances I suggest that the House should adjourn until next Monday. </para>

          <para>- The Australian Labor Party supports the motion. It is clear that there must be a proper procedure for installing a new Prime Minister and Ministry. All I need say at this time is that the permutations of personalities do not end the difficulties of the last few days. These are matters not just for any party but for the Parliament and for the people, whose opinions upon them should promptly be sought. </para>

              <para>- My colleague, the right honourable member for Melbourne, has a long and distinguished record which could well be the envy of anybody in this House and he has never been reticent when he has thought that he had to say something on behalf of the parliamentary institution. Today we have seen a most incredible exhibition of what might be called parliamentary musical chairs, with this institution being used for the in-fighting of the Liberal Party. I believe, and I say this emphatically, that it is a disgrace that at this hour, with no Minister for Defence, with the whole place in disarray and with the country needing guidance of any sort, we should close down for 3 parliamentary sitting days. </para>

              <para>The basic purpose of the age allowance provisions is to ensure that no tax is payable by persons otherwise qualified by age for age pension who are in receipt of relatively modest incomes. The Government has, in fact, examined on several occasions the introduction of the kind of concession proposed by the honourable member but has not so far seen its way clear to propose amendment of the law along such lines. </para>

          <para>However, on the basis of estimated numbers of widow and invalid pensioners with means as  assessed  in excess of the' ' minimum taxable income, it is considered that the cost to revenue of applying concessions similar to the age provisions to persons in receipt of widow and invalid pensions would not be likely to exceed $lm. </para>
          <para>I should add that if such a concession were to be granted on the same basis as the age allowance, it would apply not only to persons in receipt of pensions but also to persons qualified by widowhood or invalidity but not in receipt of social welfare pensions on this account. </para>

            <para>The Commonwealth is a substantial owner of buildings of historic and aesthetic interest for which there is still a functional requirement. It is not practicable to separate from the total expenditure on such buildings the cost of their preservation per se. As well, the Commonwealth has also spent some $108,000 up to 30th June 1970 for the restoration of buildings for historical purposes and for tourism at Norfolk Island, and in the past 5 financial years, about $69,000 for the preservation of historic buildings in the Northern Territory. </para>
            <para>While recognising its responsibility for the preservation of Commonwealth-owned buildings of historic interest, the Commonwealth Government, as a matter of policy, has not provided financial assistance towards the preservation of other buildings of historic or aesthetic importance. The Commonwealth, however, makes a general grant of $5,000 per year towards, the administrative costs of the Australian Council of National Trusts which is the central body in this field. In addition, the Commonwealth has recognised the value of the work being done by the National Trusts in each State in this direction, by granting them the benefit of concessions under the income tax and estate duty laws. </para>

          <para>In this country such people are served by the external studies available at a number of universities, though students are normally expected in Australia to have the formal academic qualifications for embarking on university work. 1 am aware that some States are well provided in that respect, others are not. It is the policy of the Commonwealth to encourage tertiary institutions to make available external studies and the Commonwealth has demonstrated its interest in the matter by adopting in 1969 a recommendation made by the Australian Universities Commission that the grant to a university in respect of each external student enrolled should be doubled. </para>
          <para>It remains to be seen whether the lack of formal academic qualifications will prove to be a severe handicap to people enrolled in the British Open University, but failure to progress adequately is, I understand, to be a bar to continuation of studies. </para>

            <para>HenryE. Znaty entered Australia on 28th October 1970- as a visitor, holding a valid Moroccan passport showing him to be a Moroccan national. Subsequently it was learned that he was convicted in Switzerland in 1967 for fraud, sentenced to 12 months imprisonment and banished from Switzerland for 10 years; and that in 1969 he was convicted in France for swindling and sentenced to 9 months imprisonment and 5 years prohibition of residence. I ordered his deportation on 26th November. Action to prevent his deportation was taken by him in the Supreme Court of New South Wales and then before the Full Bench of the High Court; but without success. On 20th December 1970 he was placed on board an aircraft travelling to Rome with a ticket to Morocco. On arrival in Rome the authorities there supervised his. transfer to another aircraft travelling to Morocco. </para>

            <para>The consultations to which 1 referred in my reply to the earlier question by the Honourable Member (Hansard 5th May 1970, page 1646) related to 2 matters - first, vocational education and second, the question of allowances being paid to migrant students attending part-time accelerated courses (or, as Professor Connell referred to them, semi-intensive courses). </para>
            <para>There has been an increase in the provision ot part-time accelerated courses, in line with the policy of providing facilities for more intensive forms of instruction as against the continuation programme spread over 18 months, and as one way of combating the high abandonment rate which was a feature of the continuation programme. Already part-time accelerated courses have been established in the West bridge, East Hills and Cabramatta hostels, in the State Migrant Education Centres in Melbourne and Sydney, and at Wollongong and Geelong, catering in all for some 1,200 migrant students. We are planning to establish further courses shortly in Brisbane, Mount lsa, Newcastle, Adelaide and Perth. </para>
            <para>The part-time accelerated courses provide for 4 hours instruction 5 days a week in the morning or afternoon (16 weeks duration) or for 2 hours in the evening 3 nights a week (20 weeks duration). The day-time courses which are particularly suited to migrant workers engaged on shift work provide in all a course of 320 hours (equivalent to the full-lime intensive course). The evening courses, which are used more by migrant women otherwise engaged during the day and by migrant workers who have completed a normal working day, provide instruction only for 120 hours as it has been found that interest in the evening courses tends to wane more quickly. Nevertheless migrants attending the evening courses can continue to enrol in more advanced courses and thus complete the full programme of instruction. </para>
            <para>It has not been possible to consider paying allowances to migrants attending the part-lime accelerated courses. Unlike those attending the full-time intensive courses (who are paid an allowance to cover accommodation and living expenses, and as compensation for loss of earning capacity), migrants attending the part-time courses continue to be employed and, as a general rule, suffer no loss of income. The possibility of providing some form of allowance to the migrants attending the part-time accelerated courses will be kept in mind in the event of any review of the policy. </para>
            <para>Consideration is proceeding into the matters referred to by Professor Connell in the section of his paper dealing with 'Vocational Preparation'. These involve however areas of policy in addition to migrant education (for example, the results of the Trellis Mission on overseas training and the work of the Committee on Overseas Professional Qualifications) and the studies involved must the  refine  be seen as essentially a long term project </para>
