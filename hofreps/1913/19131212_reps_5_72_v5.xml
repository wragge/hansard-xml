                    <para>Melbourne last night to discuss the New Hebrides question, the statement was made by a gentleman who, I understand, is personally acquainted with the conditions existing in the- islands that the death-rate among the natives employed  on the French plantations there is 40 per cent, per annum. I ask the Minister of External Affairs to ascertain, if possible, whether the statement is correct, and if he finds it to be so, will he make representations on the subject to the Imperial authorities, and, through them, to the French Government? </para>

                        <para>- I have not seen or heard of the statement referred to, but I had recently before me, in the report presented to the Colonial Office, official figures relating to the mortality on the New Hebrides plantations. The figures were for a period ending 1911, but I do not think that they showed the mortality to be as great as 40 per cent. In some parts of the islands there has been lately a heavy mortality from measles. I shall make the inquiry asked for, and I give the House the assurance that every aspect of the New Hebrides question which affects Australia is receiving the closest attention. </para>

                            <para>- Yesterday afternoon several members representing the tobacco-growing districts joined me in an interview with Messrs A. D. Hart and Wilkins, representing the British Australian Tobacco Company. We discussed with them the letter to which the honorable member refers, and as a result of the interview they assured me that it is not the intention of the manufacturers to refuse to pay .fair prices for fair quality leaf; that there is a fair prospect for the industry in the future; but that there is not sufficient good quality leaf at present produced. I was informed that there is only room for a gradual expansion in the industry, and that much of the local leaf is inferior, due to causes arising from the nature of the soil, climatic conditions, selection of seed, and preparation of leaf, but that attention paid to these matters would produce better results in quality. I have obtained several reports from our own officials, which I am forwarding through the Prime Minister to the Agricultural Departments of the States, to get the opinions of their experts on the subjects dealt with, and I hope to make a fuller statement to the House later. </para>

                            <para>- Can the Minister, before the Estimates are discussed, inform the House what quantity of Australian-grown leaf is used by our local manufacturers to-day, and what quantity was used ten years ago ; and can he also obtain the same information regarding imported leaf? I think he will find that there is a big discrepancy. </para>

                                <para>- I shall endeavour to get that information. The quantity of unmanufactured tobacco imported in 1910 was 13,586,845 lbs., the importation of 1911 being 14,900,520 lbs.; and of 1912, 15,035,532 lbs. I am informed that the increase is due to the fact that they are now storing tobacco here instead of in the United States, as formerly. </para>

                        <para>- I am not aware of the circumstances mentioned. I believe that some of the States refuse to allow their officers to accept anything from the Commonwealth, and apply the Commonwealth payments to their own purposes. That seems to me not very generous. I shall make inquiries into the matter. </para>

                                <para>- There is no difficulty in that regard at the present time. Newspaper agents like Messrs. Gordon and Gotch distribute by hand most of the British newspapers coming here, and those requiring to be sent inland are put  through  the post under the rates relating to printed matter. The trouble is, that the present system does not allow Australian newspapers to be distributed in Great Britain in the same way. </para>

                        <para>- 1 would point out that the peculiar constitution of the House and the exigencies of the situation made it absolutely essential that, on every one of the days that I was in attendance, I should not leave even for. a moment the precincts of the House. I quite admit that the flood of oratory on the part of the honorable member for Gwydir rendered it impossible for me to stay in the chamber the whole day long. </para>

                        <para>- I shall endeavour to keep on the right track; but I must say that I have been led away from the course I should follow by the honorable member for Gwydir. Like other honorable members, I have found it absolutely essential on many occasions to leave the chamber itself in order to attend to correspondence from my constituents and to other matters affecting my electorate, and very often I have done so while the honorable member for Gwydir has been addressing the Chamber, but I have always been within the precincts of the House. </para>

                    <para class="block">This Bill is founded largely on the Public Works Committee Acts of the States of Victoria and New South Wales. I think it is patent to every one at this time of day that the methods of conducting our Public Works policy are crude, inefficient, and altogether inadequate for the purpose of securing the taxpayers against loss and waste. We are spending in public works every year from &#163;3,000,000 to &#163;4,000,000; and Parliament, I am afraid, is not so well informed as it ought to be regarding the expenditure of this money and the projection of the various public works. Every one knows that we pass Bills through this Chamber, sometimes, in circumstances which, do not permit of full and detailed investigation of the projects to which they relate; and, consequently, I fear that Parliament occasionally knows very little of the actual details of the expenditure of large sums of public money. It is in order to remedy that defect, as well as to insure a more efficient spending of the money, and the wiser disposition of our public works policy, that this Committee Is proposed. Experience, both in Victoria and New South &#34;Wales, abundantly justifies this proposal. I do not hesitate to say that, in the State of Kew South &#34;Wales, a similar Committee has saved the country millions of money. </para>

                            <para>- I suppose I am safe in saying that similar results have been the outcome of the Victorian Committee. There arises, first of all, the question whether a Committee composed of members of Parliament is the test court of inquiry into these huge public undertakings - whether outside experts, permanently appointed as a board, would not conduct the inquiries more efficiently, and with a greater degree of knowledge and intelligence. From my experience - and it is a pretty large one - I think that a board of experts would not do this work as well as a Committee of this House would. </para>

                            <para>- That is not so; but members have a wide knowledge of human nature. They have that invaluable quality called common sense, and a sense of responsibility for their actions which enables them to make inquiries into all such matters with an open mind, and, perhaps, with a detached view of things which does not pertain to the mind trained to special courses. Moreover, I should like to point out that all the available expert ability that such a Committee would care to call to their aid is at their disposal, and the members may, therefore, inform themselves concerning all the projects submitted, and be in a position to pass judgment in a way that, perhaps, an expert, biased by his training and immersed in details of the undertakings to which he has given his life&#39;s work, may not do. I am not so sure that outside unbiased judgment, even relating to technical matters, is often the best that we can obtain. That is an argument that goes as far as it may; but, further, I say that in connexion with public works and public undertakings, the responsibility of this Parliament should be preserved inviolate. That is the point, I think, which ought to decide this matter. <inline font-style="italic">No</inline> outside body should have to do with projects in a responsible way which relate to the initiation of the spending of the public funds of the country. The determination of what, where, to what extent, and in what shape our public functions shall be initiated and utilized must always, it seems to me, rest with those who have charge of the purse of the country, and have the responsibility, finally, for the spending of the money. In other wor.ds, I think that this* proposal preserves the power of Parliament over the whole province of public expenditure. This appears to me to be the vital thing in deciding whether this shall be a Committee of members inside the House, or a Committee of experts outside the House. There is just another point that should be mentioned here. Ought a Minister - ought a Government - to delegate this Ministerial function - for after all it is a Ministerial function and Ministerial responsibility - to any body of men either in Parliament or outside ? The reply to that is a very easy one - the Government will not delegate their responsibility, which is preserved at every stage. The Bill will provide that the Minister himself must express his views concerning the proposals in submitting them for the consideration of the Committee. Further, the Minister must take full responsibility for the initiation of the proposals, and for the provision of plans and specifications, and all data collectable within his sphere of responsibility, for submission to the Committee. More than that, after the inquiry has been made, and the information supplied to Parliament, a further responsibility, that is made statutory in the Bill, rests on the Minister, . and makes it mandatory on him to submit the proposals for the final consideration of Parliament within a given period after the inquiry has been conducted. It seems to me that there is nothing here inconsistent with the full responsibility of the Minister or with the financial responsibility which the Government and the House have to undertake. </para>

                            <para>- That is provided for in clause 3, and it is the same method as that by which we appoint Select Committees. It is quite clear, I think, that this Committee must be a little larger than the Public Works Committee of a State. It will have to travel over a great deal more ground, and, as sectional Committees will be required, it would be difficult, with a small number, to set up these Committees in the requisite strength to insure the work being carried on continuously. While a committee of six or seven may be all right for a State, eight or nine, I think, would <inline font-style="italic">Joe</inline> more like the proportion for a wide continent such as Australia. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, but I take it only with the consent of Parliament. I think the rule in the States is that the Committee does not sit while Parliament is sitting. In New South Wales it sits in the mornings before the House meets. My recollection is that it also sits in the afternoon, with the consent of Parliament, but I do not know that that is a very good rule. </para>

                            <para>- I am not quite clear on that point. I think the payment is so much per sitting. Both Victoria and New South Wales very wisely limit the amount which may be paid to members during any one year. I think the limit in Victoria is &#163;1,200, and in New South Wales &#163;2,000. </para>

At any rate, &#163;2,000 is the total amount allowed for the members of the Committee in New South Wales. There is provision both in New South Wales and Victoria that, if there are more sittings than would allow for the amount set out in the Act as payment for services, that amount is to be proportionately reduced so as to bring the total payments within the amount specified. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know. I presume it means other purposes incidental to the inquiry, but here I am up against a difficulty. I am not clear whether, under our Constitution, we can pay our members at all.. There is a great and wide divergency of opinion on this serious constitutional point. The Minister of External Affairs, on my right, says he thinks it is all right, and&#39; I suppose the honorable member for Bendigo would say that perhaps it is all right. However, I have left the matter blank, and we shall have to fill it in when the Bill gets into Committee, but there is no doubt that whether we can pay members a fee or not we can pay them expenses. The Committee has power to divide itself up into sectional Committees so as to facilitate their work, and all the necessary machinery is provided. </para>

                            <para>- It will apply to any big public work. The honorable member is raising an important point, and I do not deny that the Bill may create some difficulty. It is an experiment, and it has to be seen whether provisions that . work so admirably in the States will work as satisfactorily over this wider field. My own impression is that they will. I believe the common sense of the Committee, and of the House generally, will triumph over all difficulties caused by the scale and range of things in the Commonwealth. Although there may be difficulties in going to the Northern Territory and elsewhere, I do not think those difficulties will be greater for the Committee than they are now for Ministers. &#34;Whatever the Ministry can do regarding the Northern Territory, or Papua, this Committee, with its even greater facilities for inquiry, can do. </para>

                            <para>- Did we? If the honorable member can show any good reason why the expert should go to Queensland, there will be no difficulty in the way. Let him make out his case, and he shall have the expert. We do not want to prevent him from going anywhere where he can do useful work for us; but he is a very expensive man, and we do not want to send him about unnecessarily. This is the first time I have heard of this. I thought he was going to Queensland. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable member can make out a good case why he should go farther north than Brisbane, he shall go there. The question of the public works of the Defence Department has to be considered in the light of the strategical requirements of the Army and Navy; and that consideration, I think, differentiates those works from ordinary works of utility which have relation to the Civil Service and the ordinary business of the country. </para>

                        <para>.- I address myself to the second reading of this Bill with considerable pleasure, because the departure projected in it is one that I think the Commonwealth is perfectly justified in taking. I do not agree with some honorable members who have already spoken that it will be an economic measure. To be effective, a Commonwealth Bureau of Agriculture must necessarily be a costly Department. </para>

                            <para>- We are the last continent in the world to come into the competition in the demand for population, and in order to obtain a satisfactory population we must hold out certain inducements to immigrants to come here and fill up our empty spaces. In establishing our bureau we shall be well advised if we take advantage of the experience of other countries, and I point with great satisfaction to the useful and important work done by the Agricultural Bureau of the United States of America. No finer results have been achieved anywhere than by that bureau. For many years to come our only source of wealth by way of exportable surplus will be wool, wheat, meat, and butter, and any difficulties we have can only be removed by having a greater increase in the exportable surplus of our primary productions. Since 1904 our imports and exports have been gradually coming together, until last year the exports only exceeded the imports by 1.2 per cent. </para>

According to the 1912 <inline font-style="italic">Tear Book</inline> issued by the Department of Agriculture in the United States of America, every million dollars spent upon the Department is returned in the shape of ten million dollars&#39; worth of wealth produced through the increased production of the land due to following the advice given by the experts of that Department. To be a little more definite as to the work done in America, I shall read from the historical sketch of the Department of Agriculture in the United States for the year 1907, which says - </para>

                    <para>And in relation to corn, the largest product of the United States, this was 23 bushels in 1839 and 44 bushels in 1899. I am pleased to notice that, under the provisions of the Bill before us, there are certain matters which the Commonwealth can investigate for the benefit of coming generations. First of all, the proposed bureau will deal with the acquisition and diffusion of information connected with agriculture and so forth. To do this we must have eminently qualified laboratory professors or experts who know precisely what they are talking about, and we shall have to pay these men very substantial salaries in order to obtain their services. The States have- made several mistakes through haggling over dollars in the matter of giving increases to their experts. Some year* agc New South Wales had the services of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Cobb,</inline> one of the finest bacteriologists in the world, but the United States very soon found out his reputation, and got hold of him, because New South Wales was not prepared to go to the expense of the dollars America was prepared to pay. Another illustration is to be found in Victoria. The State has the services of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Elwood</inline> Mead, one of the finest irrigation experts in the world. He has made wonderful alterations in the irrigation schemes in existence in Victoria, but his position is now in jeopardy, owing to advanced offers being made to him from another country. I have not heard whether he has decided to remain here, or whether Victoria is to lose his eminent services. If we are to succeed in the direction we hope to attain, that of attracting the people looking for land in a  new country, we shall have to pay well to get the services of these experts. As to our relationship with the States, I can see no evidence of any antagonism between the States&#39; Departments and our proposed bureau. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Valder,</inline> Under-Secretary for Agriculture m New South Wales, has told me that he can see no reason why there should be any friction between an agricultural bureau, under the Federal auspices, and the Agricultural Departments of the States. He considers that the two could work hand in hand, that the experience of the State Departments will probably be of benefit to the Federal bureau, and that ultimately Australia will be able to take its place in the councils of the world in this regard. </para>

In the United States, for every million, a similar Department has cost in the way of agricultural instruction, the result ha* been ten million dollars&#39; worth of wealth produced. This is one Department in which we can see a direct return ahead of us for the money we shall spend. We could follow the lines oi the United States Agricultural Bureau, and divide* the work into several divisions, each, under control of a noted expert. In the. first place, we should have a good laboratory in which eminent men can make investigations into such things as infectious. and contagious diseases of all sorts, pleuro pneumonia in cattle, tetanus,. Texas fever, tuberculosis, and other important diseases that ought to be investigated by the very highest authorities, if we wish to be as successful in our production as we hope to be. </para>

                            <para>- Evidently the honorable member for Capricornia does not. realize that we are now dealing with a national matter, and not with one that should be approached from an individual point of view. To invite the individual to deal with the national aspect of affairs would land us into such trouble that the honorable member would go- bald in a week. In the initial stages of the work of this proposed Bureau of Agriculture, I see no reason why we should be at all antagonistic to the States. I hope we shall never be antagonistic towards them, and I trust that we shall utilize their work as part and parcel of a great scheme. The State Departments are doing a lot of work that might well be published in the Federal reports for the benefit of the whole of Australia. The Departments in New South Wales, Victoria, and Western Australia are doing good, work, each for its own State, but the results ought to be made available ta  the whole Commonwealth. A few months ago Western Australia took from New South Wales the finest wheat experimentalist we had. He was the senior pupil of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Farrar,</inline> and New South Wales could ill afford to lose him, but Western Australia offered him more than he was getting in New South Wales, and, naturally, he went where his services were better recognised. As the controlling genius of the laboratory, I would suggest the appointment of a gentleman possessing a veterinary science degree, or of one holding a double degree, that is, a medical degree, and a degree in veterinary science. In most European countries the men at the head of affairs -possess double degrees. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> McFadyean, a double-degree man, is an eminent authority, particularly on bacteriology and pathology, in Great Britain, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Stewart</inline> Stock is Chief Veterinary Officer and head of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries there. In South Africa, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Thale</inline> is the bacteriologist. In America, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Mohler</inline> is the Chief Pathologist of the Bureau of Animal Industry, and in India Professor Holmes is the Imperial Bacteriologist. In Australia we have an eminent bacteriologist in <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth,</inline> the Administrator of the Northern Territory, and another in <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Dodds</inline> of the Sydney University. A name of wide-world reputation in bacteriology is Professor Bang of Denmark, who is the discoverer of the cause of epizootic abortion in cattle, which is at the present moment a matter of considerable importance to us. Tt is necessary that there should be a gentleman possessing a veterinary degree at the head of affairs, because the British Medical Association objects to an individual who has not had special training in medical jurisprudence entering the field of bacteriological investigation. A doctor of veterinary science must diagnose wholly from symptoms, and thus acquires a more intimate knowledge of the causes of many of the troubles which affect the lower creation than the ordinary medical man obtains of the causes of human disease. I say that with the greatest respect for the medical profession, and in justice to the eminent veterinary surgeons who have so wide a knowledge of the bacteria and micro-organisms affecting animal life. Coming to an -other matter, I have before me a map prepared by the Commonwealth </para>

                    <para class="block">Meteorologist, which shows that one-third of the area of Australia has a rainfall of less than 10 inches. It does not follow that that country cannot be settled, and should be abandoned as if it were  a  Sahara. It should be a function of the Agricultural Bureau to experiment with a view to ascertaining the methods to be employed to make good use of these dry areas. The Department should endeavour to find out also what constituents are lacked by the soil, and how they can be best supplied, and should generally ascertain the possibilities of the country for agricultural and pastoral occupation. Magnificent crops may be obtained with  a  rainfall of only 10 inches  a  year, provided that the rain falls in the growing season between May and October. Indeed, I would sooner have a rainfall of 10 inches between those months than one of 40 inches between October and March. In the Northern Territory, we have a Government farm on which &#163;19,000 has been spent to date. The rainfall in the locality is 40 to 50 inches per annum, but according to the Government Meteorologist, no rain is to be expected in May, June, July, August, and September. Consequently, agriculture in the ordinary sense of the word is not possible there. What are needed are experiments to ascertain the possibilities of intense culture, or of crops, possibly even of wheat, which may be sown at times of the year differing from the times of sowing in the more favored and cooler parts of the continent. The dry area to which I referred, if proved by careful experiments to be capable of settlement, would give room for a huge population that would help us to hold for ourselves what is probably the best country under the sun. The chemist has within the last few years revolutionized our knowledge of agriculture, and I look forward hopefully to a considerable alteration of our methods. There are in the soil two kinds of micro-organisms, which are hostile to each other. There are bacteria, which are beneficial, and protozoa, which are harmful, and the discovery of methods which will keep the protozoa in check and cause the bacteria to thrive will greatly increase the yields of the soil. Experiments have been made which go to show that, land which has been gradually getting weaker and weaker, or &#34; sick,&#34; to use the word of the farmer, can be brought back to almost pristine vigour. It has been found that by subjecting soil to a heat of from 56 to 100 degrees centigrade the protozoa in it is killed, but that the bacteria can withstand a heat of 150 degrees centigrade, even though it may be forced back into the spore state. </para>

                            <para>- I am trying to deal with this question from a broad point of view ; and if my remarks are having no educational effect upon honorable members opposite, who are always telling us that they are the friends of the farmer, I am sorry for them. My object is to show some of the difficulties that have to be faced in connexion with the greatest industry in Australia. The men on the land are responsible for the only exports of surplus production that we have; and honorable members opposite, who pose as the friends of the agriculturists, should be anxious to help them in every way.  If  we could have agricultural experts  of  eminent reputation engaged in connexion with the bureau to carry out experiments such as are being conducted in other parts of the world, the whole country would be benefited. If the new agricultural theories developed by agricultural chemists can be effectively brought  to  bear in many of the older settled districts, where we have to resort to what is known as the rotation of crops and fallowing, then our older ground will return a yield twofold greater than it is returning to-day, and the result must be a great increase in the wealth of Australia. Anything in that direction would be costly, no doubt, but the money would be well spent. I feel quite satisfied that the results which have been obtained in this direction in the United States of America would also be obtained in this great Commonwealth. We might have experts engaged also in connexion with the important subject  of  the afforestation of many parts of Australia. At present a wicked, wanton waste is going on. Some of the finest timbers in the world are being ruthlessly destroyed. This waste is largely due to the ignorance of the individuals concerned, and perhaps, also, to the fact that although these timbers are of commercial value, there are no facilities at hand to encourage agriculturists to prove this great source of wealth, with th*e- result that they are simply burnt off. </para>

                            <para>- We might deal with it by suggestion; and, by working hand in hand with the State Departments, we could ascertain whether those Departments could not bring influence to bear on the State Governments in this direction., Then, again, we have a number of noxious weeds which require to be investigated. Prickly pear is one of these As far as I have been able to ascertain, it is of very little commercial value.  I  conducted some experiments, at one time, to ascertain whether it could not be used, after being boiled, or as ensilage, for feeding dairy cattle, but the results were not satisfactory. There are also a number of stock-poisoning plants in different parts of Australia that need to be dealt with. We could have the opinions of the authorities promulgated in those useful publications known as bulletins, and now issued in connexion with the United! States of America Bureau of Agriculture. In such bulletins we could give the latest information concerning the efforts of scientific men to solve all these problems. These bulletins must result in better work. In conclusion, I want to point out that a bureau similar to that which we propose to establish in the Commonwealth is in existence in Canada, and is doing good work. I have before me a report by the Live Stock Commissioners of the Dominion; and looking through it I find that &#39; they act upon the suggestion I have made in regard to the employment of veterinarians at the head of the different Departments. In nearly every case where bacteriological investigation has to be made, we find that a gentleman holding veterinary degrees is in charge. The result has been a grand success, and the reports of these Commissioners have been most encouraging. I hold that it will not be necessary, in connexion with our bureau, to commence experiments <inline font-style="italic">de novo.</inline> If we are wise we should go on with our experiments where others have left off. Let us take advantage of their experience, cheerfully acknowledging the sources which we have drawn upon, and I feel satisfied that as a result of the establishment of this bureau our wealth will be largely increased; that we shall be able to discover  methods of dealing with portions of Australia that at present look somewhat hopeless, and of dealing with them in such a way as to attract to them the surplus populations of other parts of the world. </para>

                            <para>- Had my honorable friend been acquainted with the Labour movement for the last twenty years he would know that we have claimed all along that all expenditure of public money in the interests of education is of a socialistic, and in some cases, of a communistic character. Where a community is taxed to find funds for free education, that, in my opinion, is a bit of Communism. The honorable member for Hume thinks that there is a difference between a socialistic experiment and a public utility carried on by a Government or a municipality. What we try to impress on the Liberals and anti-Socialists is that the expenditure of Government or municipal funds to carry on services which they do not carry on for themselves is of a socialistic character. I regard this proposal to establish a Bureau of Agriculture as being very much in the nature of Communism- a step, of course, greatly beyond Socialism, under which people have to pay for services rendered. Our honorable friends opposite who declaim against us, and declare from every public platform that we are Socialists, while they are anti-Socialists, are going to dip their hands into the public purse to take out thousands, and, perhaps, some hundreds of thousands, to assist one or two sections of the community, and principally the farmers and pastoralists. </para>

I &#39; asked him whether he had prepared any estimate of the cost that would be involved in the establishment of the proposed Bureau of Agriculture. The reply of the Prime Minister was, &#34; That is the last of those frivolous questions that I shall answer.&#34; I asked that that statement should be withdrawn as objectionable, and the Prime Minister withdrew it, though he added that the question I had asked was objectionable to him. And no doubt the question was  objectionable,  seeing that the Prime Minister knew nothing whatever as to what the cost would be. </para>

Some weeks ago the Prime Minister, in answer to a question by myself, said he would lay on the table  the  sketch which had been prepared of the duties to be carried out by the experts, but it has not yet appeared, and I suppose that really it is not ready. Probably the Minister of Trade and Customs, when he speaks, will give us his view of the scope and character of the proposed bureau. Before I leave the subject of the great Liberal anti-Socialist party, I think I ought to indicate an amendment, of which I had intended to give notice but for the fact that I thought the Bill had been dropped. That amendment proposed to make the preamble of the Bill read thus - </para>

The Prime Minister had been with his back to the wall for so many years that he never thought that he would be in office again; and, therefore, he had no policy, and had to rush in with this Bill before it was ready. When introducing the measure he had no idea of what was to be the scope of the Federal Bureau. He said - </para>

The object of the agricultural division under the State is briefly to assist in raising the standard of cultivation and production in every part of the State where agriculture is carried on, by the means of demonstration plots and experimental farms, regular courses of lectures, and by the distribution of pamphlets, bulletins, and so forth, bearing directly on the work of the farmer. Plant diseases, and soil, and manurial problems are also a marked feature of the work. </para>

That gentleman, by supporting this Bill, proposes to supersede the State in such efforts; but if the State of Victoria, which has a comparatively small area, has lost &#163;10,000 or &#163;15,000, how much is the Commonwealth likely to lose in experiments, with the heads of the bureau, probably, in Melbourne, and farms and other experimental stations in the other States, say, for example, in the Northern Territory. </para>

                    <para>I emphasize this to show the necessity for postponing the carrying of this Bill until such time as the Prime Minister or his representatives have consulted with the State Premiers and the representatives of the State Agricultural Departments, to see to what extent it would be better to leave certain duties in the hands of the States, and to what extent the Federal Government ought to take over the work. Otherwise, there is going to be foolish and extravagant expenditure of public money in duplicating the work.&#39; </para>
                    <para>I can show honorable members numbers of bulletins issued in the various States on all kinds of subjects. In Victoria, they have a central Research Farm at Werribee, situated about 19 miles from Melbourne; the Rutherglen Experimental Farm and Viticultural College, in the North-eastern District; the Wyuna Irrigation Farm in the Goulburn Valley; and an Experimental Farm at Bamawm, in the Goulburn Valley. It is stated that &#34; the general object of these farms is to carry out exhaustive experiments and demonstrations to show the varieties of the different crops best suited to each of the several districts, the manurial requirements of the various soils; the cultural and tillage methods most likely to give best results, and the methods of crop rotation which will give the best financial results &#34; - just what one honorable member was asking the Federal Government to do. &#34; Hundreds of permanent experimental plots have been laid out at these experimental farms, and the intelligent settler who visits these plots may read from the results of the plots those practices which are likely to give him the best financial results. Expert officers, skilled in the various branches of production, are attached to these various farms, and give personal advice on all agricultural matters free. The results of the researches and experiments are published as they accrue in the monthly journal of the Department, and so are made available to all farmers in the State.&#34; </para>
                    <para>What is the Prime Minister going to do about that? Is he going to spend public money in duplicating that work without consulting the State Premiers and the State Ministers of Agriculture as to how far Federal interference is called for? </para>

                            <para>- We know that in Queensland they have discovered certain cures. One man discovered a formula for treating ticks - a matter affecting the pastoralists particularly. The Government of Queensland spent public money in assisting the stock-owners to get rid of the ticks, or to keep them down. The State Governments of Australia have assisted pastoralists to an enormous degree, and if a balance-sheet were published showing the amount of Government money that had been spent in that way the public would be astounded. Almost millions of money have been spent by the Governments of the States in giving the stock-owners wire netting and rabbit-proof fences, at very great cost, to fence their runs when, in some cases, there were no rabbits within hundreds of miles. </para>

                            <para>- They have not paid it all back in Queensland, by any means. The State Governments of Australia, and of Queensland in particular, have given the pastoralists long leases of huge areas at 5s. per square mile - the leases running in some cases to forty-two years. They let the pastoralists in Queensland have land at&#189;d. an acre, where they charged the farmer 3d. per acre for similar quality land, so that pastoralists like the honorable member for Riverina should never say anything about the parsimony of the States. </para>

Why should the Federal Government issue, through its Bureau, pamphlets on cotton-growing for the Queensland Government? There are pamphlets already&#39; printed on cotton-growing. I have here a large number of pamphlets that have been issued, and these are only about a quarter of the total number. </para>

                    <para>Here is another on the examination of Western* Australian poison plants. The honorable member for Riverina asked what the States had done to protect stock. That pamphlet supplies the answer. Here is another pamphlet from Western Australia from the horticultural and viticultural division in relation to lemon-curing. There is another on &#34; hints to stock-breeders, together with diseases common in stock, for the use of breeders of all kind of farm animals,&#34; issued by the Department of Western Australian Agriculture. There is another on &#39; &#39; orchard irrigation and drainage.&#34; </para>
                    <para>Now we come to Queensland, which issues a very large list of pamphlets, beautifully printed, and containing  &#39;a  great deal of information. Here is a pamphlet on &#34;poultry-farming,&#34; issued by the Department of Agriculture and Stock. There is another on citrus culture. There is no place in Australia where .citrus fruits can be produced so well as in that country. To show what we are doing to assist the farmer, here is a book on elementary lessons on the chemistry of the farm, dairy, and household, to be obtained free. My anti-Socialist friends on the other side can get these pamphlets free on application to the Queensland Department. There is a pamphlet on lamb-raising, which is described as an undeveloped industry in Queensland, and no doubt, considering the territory that we have, it is. Here is a lecture on the drug cure of tick fever. Here is a pamphlet concerning the very matter the honorable member for Hume spoke about - in reference to diseases in sheep, and another with reference to contagious abortion in cows. Here is another to assist the exporters of our products. I am not too keen about that matter, because, unhappily, the more we assist the exporters to send away our produce, the higher becomes the price for the consumers here. We assist them to send their butter and meat to London, and the combine charge the people here a higher price than they ought to charge. </para>

Yet they pose before the public as being people who object to Unification. I would point out that the resolution objecting to the proposal to establish a Federal Bureau of Agriculture, passed by the Conference of Farmers, was the direct outcome of the agitation of the so-called Liberal or State Rights party and their opposition to many of the functions now carried on by the Commonwealth . </para>

                    <para>Queensland has also published a pamphlet on cotton plantations, and on dips and sprays for cattle and horses. It is remarkable how much we spend in assisting the pastoralist and farmer, and how little the pastoralists and farmers, as a body, realize it.  </para>
                    <para>I quite agree that we ought to assist both pastoralists and farmers, but, in my opinion, it is about time we also commenced to assist the poor people in the community. What are we doing for sailors, wharf labourers, miners, and those poor fellows who work in the trenches in the streets, about whom cultured men, like the honorable member for Parkes, and others, complain, and say &#34; They are all idlers,&#34; if they should happen to straighten their backs during their work?

                            <para>- I am quite serious about this matter. I am only sorry that I have not time to deal with it at proper length. There is very important and generous work done by the State of New South Wales to assist farmers and producers, and if honorable members would like details about this assistance they can obtain them from a pamphlet issued by direction of the late Honorable Donald McDonald, Minister of Agriculture in New South Wales, showing the State assistance rendered to agricultural settlement in that State. A balance-sheet is given in that pamphlet showing the very large amount of money which has been spent in assisting&#34; the farmers. Those anti-Socialists who* object to the Government using money for any industrial purpose, because they say it destroys a man&#39;s independence, and think that every individual should do things: for himself, only . apply this doctrine to such men as boot operatives, miners, or&#34; sailors. If boot operatives should ask for Government money to assist them, these honorable members would say, &#34; No. If you get this assistance you lose your independence, and your moral fibre is destroyed. We breed up a race of men who will need to lean up against a wall or a post all their lives.&#34; </para>

I shall not use that vulgarism about greasing a certain fat animal, because I do not wish to imitate the Prime Minister, but when we are spending money to assist the millionaire pastoralists in Australia, surely we should not baulk when we are asked for Government aid for the unemployed. The Prime Minister the other day made -use of the communistic sentiment, &#34; Each for all and all for each.&#34; I want him not to baulk if we should ask that assistance be given to the unemployed. </para>

The Government propose to expend anything up to &#163;100,000 on a Bureau of Agriculture to assist pastoralists who, generally speaking, are fairly well to do, and to assist farmers, many of whom, unfortunately, are not too well off. &#39; </para>

                            <para>- Yes; but see the blundering method that Ministers have adopted. A sensible business-like body of men would have called a conference of State Premiers, and would have asked these Premiers to bring with them the heads of their Departments <inline font-style="italic">f&#62;i</inline> Agriculture. They would have asked what suggestions could be put forward whereby duplication  could be avoided. If we appoint an expert to deal with diseases in stock, is he to spend Federal money in issuing pamphlets dealing with this matter when nearly all the States are already issuing pamphlets upon the same subject? Can any Minister defend that kind of folly ? My complaint is not against the idea of having a Federal Bureau of Agriculture, but it is against the clumsy methods of the Government who claimed that if they got into office they would curtail expenditure, and that there would be a return to responsible Government and sound finance. This is their sound finance: The States issue hundreds of pamphlets on hundreds of different subjects concerning farmers and pastoralists, and a Federal Bureau of Agriculture is to be superimposed upon the States and to spend thousands of pounds upon the same work. Surely that is an  unbusiness-like  proposition. Honorable members would not run their private business in that way. At any rate, I do not think the honorable member for Riverina would. </para>

                            <para>- The New South &#34;Wales Agricultural Department, according to a pamphlet issued with authority, giving its history, was established in 1890, when the  Hon.  Sydney Smith was appointed by Executive minute Minister for Mines and Agriculture. A Director was appointed to organise the new Department, and it was administered by the first Minister for three years, as a separate entity. A comprehensive scheme of agricultural education was approved by the Government, the Hawkesbury Agricultural College was started, and four experimental farms were established, and sites for others were chosen in districts whose climatic conditions differed. A scientific staff was got together. It consisted of a chemist, a plant pathologist, a botanist, an entomologist, a viticulturist, and a fruit expert ; and an officer was appointed to give instruction in dairying, with the aid of a travelling dairy. The <inline font-style="italic">Agricultural Gazette</inline> was instituted, and was distributed free each month to about 500 persons connected with rural pursuits. Several experts, such as those I have mentioned, will be required by the Commonwealth Department, if the institution is likely to be of benefit to Australia. In 1893, the year of the great bank smashes, it became necessary for the Government to retrench, and the Department was coupled with the Mines Department. But it was soon found that it did not make the same progress under those conditions as when dealt with by a Minister holding a separate portfolio, and after representations had frequently been made by the classes interested - anti-Socialists, no doubt - the office of Minister for Agriculture was created by a special Act of Parliament, and the Department was, in January, 1908, placed on an independent footing. </para>

                    <para>There is a fruit expert, who, with the aid of assistants and inspectors, administers the Fruit Pests Act, and superintends operations at various orchards. </para>
                    <para>There is a sheep and a- wool expert, a wheat experimentalist, and a Government entomologist. The duty of the entomologist and his assistants is to investigate the life history of the various insects and pests which affect fruit growing, and to discover methods of keeping noxious insects and organisms in check. </para>
                    <para>There is a viticultural expert, a stock branch, a bureau of micro-biology, a seeds department - the seeds being sometimes sold and sometimes given away - and a Government botanist, together with a number of other experts. </para>
                    <para>I have not time to refer to the various experimental farms, but I draw attention to the following balance-sheet. My anti-Socialist friends who object to the unemployed man getting assistance from the State, on the score that his moral fibre may thereby be destroyed, do not object to the expenditure of large sums of money for other socialistic work. The expenditure and revenue of the Department for the financial year ended 30th June, 1910, was as follows: - </para>

                    <para class="block">That debit balance, a sum of &#163;87,218 of Government money, was spent in New South Wales in 1909-10 to assist the pastoralists and farmers of that State. </para>

                        <para>. - I wish to bring under the notice of the Prime Minister the important fact, which, perhaps, has escaped his notice, that provision is made on the Estimates of the Parliament of the Dominion of Canada for typists and shorthand writers to assist members in attending to their correspondence. A friend of mine of whom I inquired, &#34; How are you getting on as a member of the New South Wales Parliament,&#34; replied, &#34; I am not a member of Parliament, I am simply a correspondence hack.&#34; We ought to be something more than that. It cannot be denied that members have to deal with a very large volume of correspondence, and that it is largely added to whenever a new department is taken over. For instance, when we took over the old-age pensions system our correspondence was enormously increased. </para>

                            <para>- That the Government should place at the disposal of honorable members - and especially of members of this House, because it is to the district representatives that most of the electors go - the assistance of typists and shorthand writers to enable them to deal with their correspondence, which has been steadily increasing. Since we are so influenced by precedent and example, I refer the Prime Minister to the amount which is spent in this direction by the Canadian Parliament. A commencement might be made with the employment of two or three typists and shorthand writers, and if their services were found to be insufficient more could be obtained. People who occasionally visit our galleries  and see us here think that we have nothing to do. That idea is entirely erroneous. The records of Parliament show that a great many members have come and gone, and many of them have left us because of the onerous character of the work of a member of this Parliament - work that is more difficult than is that of a member of a State House. We have not only to travel long distances - and travelling is extremely disastrous to the health of members - but our work is of a most exacting nature. I am sure that if the Government would assist honorable members in the way I have suggested to attend to their correspondence and to discharge this part of their duty as it ought to be done, the public would offer no objection. </para>

                    <para>Mr.FINLAYSON .  - For a very good reason. Representatives of the other States can speak with feeling as to the time occupied in visiting the various Commonwealth offices on business. Those who visit Sydney appreciate the advantage of the free use of the State tramway system, and I do not think it is unreasonable to ask that this concession should be extended in respect of the tramway system of the other capital cities. It would not involve any heavy expenditure, because we already enjoy the privilege in Sydney, and in the case of three other State capitals - Brisbane, Adelaide, and Hobart - few honorable members have occasion to go there. This convenience would be greatly appreciated, since it would enable us to go about our business more freely. I also think that an unfair deduction is made from the allowances of honorable members from the date of dissolution of a Parliament until the date of election. </para>

It would be interesting to have, in addition, a record of the place of birth of every member, the date of his entry into Parliament, when he became a Minister, when he left office, why he left, and when  he died. If the Prime Minister will allow this suggestion to get into his thinking box for a little while, I am sure he will approve of it. </para>

                        <para>.- I should like to make a suggestion to the Prime Minister for consideration in view of the next session. The recent sad events in this Parliament House must have suggested to those who have had any long parliamentary experience that four sitting days a week are too much. I know that it is very difficult for a Government, no matter what shade of politics, to get measures through; but if members are expected to sit four days a week, I am afraid that, instead of intelligent consideration of the measures brought before us, we shall have ill-informed discussion without finality. In my opinion, three days a week are ample, more particularly in the case of the Federal Parliament. Honorable members who live in New South Wales, South Australia, or even in the country districts of Victoria are all anxious to return to their home at the week-end, and it is desirable that they should have time to do so, in view of the fact that many, in attending here, are drawn away from their own private business. </para>

                        <para>. - I indorse the remarks of the honorable member for Kennedy in reference to our sitting three days instead of four days a week. If we look at the records of the various State Parliaments we see that, with their three days a week, they do just as much work as does this Parliament. The State Parliament in Victoria claims to have put through, last session, eighty-three Bills, and the previous Federal Parliament laid claim to having passed a similar number during the life of the Parliament. Members of Parliament have other duties and business to perform and look after, as well as legislating. Outside bodies generally hold their meetings on days that Parliament does not sit; but members from New South Wales, Tasmania, and South Australia do not reach their homes until the Saturday night, and have to leave again for Melbourne on the Monday, so that they have no opportunity of attending to local affairs in their constituency, not to mention their own private business.

                            <para>- The public records show that men who have given their whole life to the public have been left in necessitous circumstances at the end of their political career. A man who was Premier and  Speaker  in Victoria &#34;died in debt, not because he was extravagant, but because, in the position he held, he was not able to pay his way. Another ex-Speaker of the same State was paid a pension because, after his years of public duty, he was left stranded. It is not to be supposed that men must abandon the whole of their private business when they become members of Parliament. A certain programme is put before the country by each successive Government, and Parliament makes up its mind to get through the business of the session, whether the sitting days be three or four a week. I am quite satisfied, in my own mind, that, in view of the atmosphere of this chamber, we sit too long &#34;for the health of honorable members. No doubt a proposal to sit only three days would be met with the objection that on the Thursday InterState members would depart for their homes&#39;; but that was the objection raised in regard to the country members of the State Parliament. If members do clear out, the Government have a grand opportunity to bring in their Estimates, and get on with the business. </para>

                        <para>.- I indorse what has been said by the honorable member for Henty in regard to old-age pensions for members of Parliament. It is not to the credit of the country that men who have served  faithfully should, when retired either compulsorily or voluntarily, be placed in a necessitous position. There is one ex-member of the House, whom I shall not name - a good party man, a good fighter and debater, and most attentive to his duties here - who now occupies a position in the Public Service which is creditable to neither the Parliament nor the country. There are others, too, who might be mentioned in an even worse position. It is not reasonable that a man should have to take the position of a clerk in a very subordinate class, after having occupied a seat in Parliament for a considerable time. Unless a member happens to live in Melbourne or the immediate vicinity, his business, should he have one, must suffer, for he cannot attend to both it and his parliamentary duties. If he be a medical man or a lawyer, he loses touch with his clients, and, after a few years, finds it most difficult to establish a new practice. The present position is all very well for those honorable members who are of independent means, but&#34; it is very different for those in less fortunate circumstances, who, on retiring from </para>

                    <para class="block">Parliament, may find themselves compelled to go around with a basket of peanuts, or something of that kind. Here are 111 men, representing nearly 5,000,000 people; and I am sure that the latter would willingly pay pensions on a reasonable scale to those who have served them well, and who, in their old age, find themselves poorly off. I, for instance, am in the &#34; sear and yellow leaf,&#34; and I know that, although I was earning as good a living relatively before I entered Parliament as I am now, I could not go back to my own business; and I am afraid that my age would disqualify me for any public employment. My suggestion is that there should be  a  graduated scale of pensions according to the number df Parliaments in which  a  man has served, with a maximum of, say, five Parliaments, . and then a pension granted sufficient to enable him to live decently and comfortably for the rest of his life. I know that the Prime Minister is not now likely to suffer that pecuniary embarrassment common to most of us, but were he in a similar position to ourselves, and had he been defeated at the 1910 election, he would have had to seek some employment. Knowing the honorable gentleman&#39;s spending capacity, I do not think he will be able to save very much during his parliamentary life, and very few of us can, especially those who are rearing and educating  a  family. I hope that the Government will give serious attention to the suggestion which has been made. </para>

Of course, those who did not require any pension would not draw it. I admit that the late Government had not the courage to bring forward a  proposal of the kind; but, if there were a pension, members would not, as they now sometimes do, feel their hearts broken. There is nothing in the world so sad as to see a man who has served his country turned on the streets to starve. </para>

I have no objection to this, because I think we have in him a very able and capable man; but I notice that the secretaries of three very big Departments - Defence, Home Affairs, and External Affairs - are receiving only &#163;900 a year each. I think they occupy positions of equal responsibility, calling for equal ability, and perhaps the Prime Minister could give me some reason why they are receiving less than the  Clerk  does. </para>

While we are looking after officers in superior positions, we ought, also, to look after those in less elevated places. </para>

                        <para>. - I hope honorable members will understand that if I do not refer to all these matters I am making a note of them, and will go over them carefully afterwards. The heads of Departments mentioned by the honorable member for Barrier have all had very large increases since the  Clerk  had any at all, and the question of their increase, in any case, seems to have little or no relation to the increase in the Clerk&#39;s salary. It is hopeless to try to even up all these officers. </para>

                        <para>.- I do not want to be always quarrelling with the artist who. designed our coat-of-arms, but I remember remarking, when it was first brought out, that the kangaroo and emu appeared to me to be up the wattle tree. It is a very inartistic design. It contains a bad kangaroo and miserable emu, and I do not know that even the wattle is a very true representation. It could easily be made a much more appropriate coat-of-arms. I notice that there is a tendency to use imported paper in preference to giving orders to our local paper manufacturers. In two of the States at least there are paper factories doing very important work, and I think the Prime Minister himself performed the opening ceremony of a large manufacturing establishment a few Saturdays ago. I do not say that they go in for manufacturing the class of paper I have in my hand; perhaps it is the rougher class of paper that they turn out, but there are paper manufactories in the Commonwealth which can turn out  paper  sufficiently good for any man in this House to write upon, and I trust that they will not be overlooked. Ever since I have been in the House, I have had a suspicion that a considerable quantity of the paper which we, who are supposed to encourage local industry, use here, is imported paper. Without making a charge against any particular official, I can Bay that there are officials who seem to have a considerable liking for the imported article in preference to the local article, and some members of the House have had to make very strenuous efforts to thwart their desires. We must give our own manufacturers a show, and I trust that those who seem to hanker after the imported article will be brought into conformity with Australian ideas. </para>

                        <para>.- On last year&#39;s Estimates I made a criticism of the note-paper. 1 find that each Department orders its own note-paper just as it pleases, with the result that the price of these papers ranges, so I am told, from about 9s. to over 40s. per lb. There seems to be plenty of room for standardization in that matter. I already have a report in my office on the question, and hope to look, not only into the aspect presented by the honorable member for Maribyrnong, but also into the question of whether we cannot save a substantial amount on the item of notepaper alone. </para>

Will the Prime Minister take into consideration some method of altering the parliamentary system of reporting, so as to adopt a similar practice&#39; to that followed in South Australia, where the parliamentary debates are published by arrangement with the daily press? This would greatly enhance the value of the reports, and lead to a wider knowledge of political affairs in the Commonwealth, with corresponding benefits to the people and to members. </para>

It is becoming a very expensive item to some honorable members to supply copies of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> to their constituents, and I really think a greater number of copies should be given to each member. It would not be very costly, and it would be giving extra information to the public which they are desirous of getting. After all, the people of this country are entitled to know exactly what the honorable members of the House are doing, and they cannot get that information from the newspapers of the day. </para>

                            <para>- I do. The atmosphere may not hurt the Prime Minister, but it affects those who stick closely to their work in the chamber. The conditions are particularly bad when the galleries are crowded. My voice is not the same as it formerly was, and my constitution is not what it was. The building must be nearly fifty years old, and though, no doubt, from an architectural point of view it is all right, from a ventilation point of view it is all wrong. The bad atmosphere in the chamber is largely responsible for the way in which business is sometimes conducted. I trust some notice will be taken of my protest, and that there will be an improvement. </para>

                        <para>. - I would like the Prime Minister to consider the advisability of having a short recess in the middle of next session. Members representing Queensland, Western Australia, and, in &#39;some instances, New South Wales constituencies, under present circumstances, are cut adrift from their homes, their constituencies, and their businesses for over five months, and. it would be a concession to them to get away for two or three weeks. Ministers might also be glad to avail themselves of the break in order to overtake the work in their Departments. </para>

                        <para>.- A few days ago the honorable member for Grey asked the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs whether a caretaker in his Department had had his salary lowered by 7d. a day; and, though the Minister at first said that this was not the case, on a subsequent day he admitted having unintentionally made a mistake, and said that he found the reduction had been made because the Public Service Commissioner claimed that under the Public Service Act no temporary hand could receive more in salary than a permanent officer doing the same work. I am not anxious to raise the question of the reduction of this individual salary. I wish to raise a matter of principle. We are entitled to know the intentions of the Government in regard to the payment of temporary hands. The late Government framed a regulation that temporary or casual hands employed by Government Departments must receive the union rate- of wages, or wages fixed by an arbitration award, and I am sure that the Prime Minister, unless he has very considerably altered his views, will be prepared to admit that; any one employed by a Department casually should receive the wages fixed by an arbitration award, or the union rate of wages. However, the Public Service Commissioner pointed out that there was a provision in the Public Service Act providing that a temporary hand must not receive more than a permanent hand doing the same work. We claimed that the concessions granted to the permanent hands should also be taken into consideration, just as a Judge in an Arbitration Court, when dealing with wages, always takes into consideration the fact whether a man is likely to get permanent work or merely casual work. For instance, when wharf labourers appear before an Arbitration Court they make a strong point of the fact that they should receive a higher rate per hour because they cannot secure continuous employment. If a wharf labourer were paid the same wage per hour as an ordinary labourer gets, he would have very little at the end of a week; in fact, although wharf labourers are paid per hour considerably more than a number of labourers in other industries are paid per hour, the weekly average earned by wharf labourers is not more than &#163;2 per week. In the same way we pointed out to the Public Service Commissioner that it was a fair and legitimate thing that, in fixing the wages for casual and temporary hands, the concessions granted to permanent hands should be taken into consideration, and we laid it down that if any person employed by the Government enjoyed all the concessions, in the shape of leave granted to the permanent hands, he had no right to ask anything more for similar work than the permanent hand received, but that if he did not get these concessions it was not a fair thing that he should get exactly the same pav. I am anxious to learn what is the policy of the present Government in the matter. </para>

                            <para>- Let me explain the position. In connexion with Government work a number of carpenters are employed temporarily. There are also permanent carpenters employed in some of the Departments, who are not necessarily paid the union rate of wage. Having entered the service a number of years ago they will remain in Government employ until they are sixty-five years of age. Each year they will <inline font-style="italic">enjoy three</inline> weeks&#39; holiday, and they will be allowed six months&#39; holiday after twenty years&#39; service. The Public Service Commissioner takes these things into consideration in fixing their salaries. The carpenters outside the Public Service appeal to the Arbitration Court, and get their salaries fixed, not on the basis of permanent work, and not with consideration to the three weeks&#39; annual holiday or the six months&#39; long-service leave. In these circumstances, it is more than probable that their wages will be 6d., 9d., or ls. per day more than those received by carpenters permanently employed in the Department. That is why I say that if it is the intention of the Government to carry out the idea of the Public Service Commissioner, they will not be able to employ trade union carpenters, unless they pay them union or current rates of wages, or the wages fixed under an arbitration award. </para>

                            <para>- Temporary and casual employes are on a different footing from  permanent employes. However long they may have been in the Service, they may be dismisse&#39;d at a moment&#39;s notice, while permanent men can only be suspended, and may appeal to a Board. I do not wish to raise the case of a particular individual; it is the principle with which I am concerned. A carpenter who is not being paid the union rate of wage cannot remain a member of his union. The last Government got over the difficulty, with the consent of the Public Service Commissioner, by not giving to casual and temporary men the holidays and other concessions enjoyed by the permanent men, and allowing them extra pay, which made tip the Wages Board award. If this Government cannot do that, they are carrying non-preference to unionists to its logical conclusion - that is, preference to non-unionists. They may reduce the wages of office cleaners by 7d. a day, but they cannot act in the same way towards carpenters, because the latter belong to a strong  union </para>

                            <para>- The Prime Minister must admit the importance of this matter to us. It may be that in the individual case that has been referred to the last Minister of Home Affairs paid the man 9s. a day on his own authority. The Opposition does not ask that the temporary and casual employes of the Government shall be paid at the whim of a Minister, but we say that such men should be paid the rates awarded by the Wages Boards applying to their trade or union rates. If such rates are not recognised there is preference to non-unionists. </para>

                        <para>. - I trust that next session the Prime Minister will introduce a Bill to alter the basis of the &#39;Commissioner&#39;s authority and power, and to abolish the present system of classification. The Public Service at present consists of three divisions - professional, clerical, and general. At the Federal Capital we found that those in the professional division would not associate with the clericals, and that the latter would not associate with those in the general division. The result of this classification is that we have a snob-breeding class institution. We ought to have in the Public Service only one class. Where you find in a Department a man of real ability, then you ought to promote him regardless of whether or not he is able to read Greek, Latin, or Sanscrit; whether he can say how long Napoleon prayed before &#34;going down the Italian side of the Alps, or how long Hannibal was in Rome before he was defeated. Coming to the point raised by the honorable member for Barrier, I wish to say that I gave these cleaners 9s. per day because I claim that, having regard to the cost of living, no one can live on less than such a wage. I gave them that wage, not because they were in a union - I do not think that there is a cleaners&#39; union - but because I regarded the rate as a standard one. These poor cleaners have since had their wages reduced by 7d. per day. What meanness ! The permanent man in the Public Service has a position for life - as long as water runs and grass grows. He has every sympathy behind him, and every one encourages and loves him. He is in a close class corporation, but the casual employe, at the end of nine months&#39; service, gets the royal order of the boot. I hope that the Prime Minister will take this matter into consideration, and bring down next year a Bill for the complete amendment of the Public Service Act. </para>

What a Judge in a Court of that description is prepared to give to those employed in any form of industry, the Commissioner of the Commonwealth Public Service should be prepared to give to casual employes. </para>

                            <para>- I believe that some such Department is necessary - that there is work to be done by it that could not be done_ better in any other Department. I would also draw attention to the items of &#34;Contingencies,&#34; and &#34;Miscellaneous.&#34; Those who have been in this Parliament for some time know very well why the amount voted under these headings must necessarily be greater in some years than in others. We find, for instance, that this year &#163;15,500 is set down in connexion with the visit of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, and &#163;5,000 as a grant towards the relief of the Antarctic expedition under <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maw</inline> son. Those two items alone account for &#163;20,000 of the increase in the Prime Minister&#39;s Department. Any one could go on a public platform, however, and point to the bald fact that the Estimates for the Prime Minister&#39;s Department this year showed an increase of nearly &#163;33,000. He could make that bald reference to the increase, just as the present Prime Minister did in his pamphlet, without giving any explanation, and the public would be misled. Honorable members know that there is an explanation for this increased vote this year, just as there was an explanation for last year&#39;s increase - although it was not given in this pamphlet; but the public do not. When honorable members talk about the great increase of expenditure under the heading of &#34;Contingencies,&#34; and &#34;Miscellaneous,&#34; without giving any explanation of the reasons for those increases, the people must be misled. As long as Parliament exists, there must be such items of expenditure - items that cannot be given individually, but must be grouped under these general headings. I have no fault to find with the increase in the Estimates of this Department, but I do find fault with the misrepresentation that is indulged in for mere party purposes, and I condemn those who seek in such a way to mislead the people. </para>

                            <para>- I agree with the honorable member for Franklin that there was never any need for a Prime Minister&#39;s Department, which is a mere excrescence on the administrative system. The Estimates do not indicate any very serious duties or functions; and all that the Department seems to do is to increase the expenditure. </para>

                            <para>- That has nothing to do with me ; I am here to discuss the present Estimates, and not what was done years ago. During the recess the Prime Minister might review the position and see whether this growing Department is really necessary. With the inauguration of a Public Works Committee at considerable expense, the Departments will be relieved to a large extent, and thus made free to undertake the work now performed by the Prime Minister&#39;s Department. If, however, the Departments are to be relieved of work, and the expenditure increased, where is the economical financing we were promised? I never did agree with the institution of the Prime Minister&#39;s Department; and the sooner it is merged in the other Departments the better. </para>

                        <para>.- This is an opportune time to suggest that additional Ministers should be appointed. Seven might be ample at the inception of Federation, but the work has since grown by 100 per cent., and the same number is by no means sufficient now. Further, the work will increase as the Commonwealth takes over fresh utilities; and unless more Ministers be provided for, any man who takes office runs the chance of being killed by overwork. The Honorary Ministers ought certainly be replaced by paid Ministers in order that the work of administration may be adequately done. </para>

I did not hear the first part of the honorable member&#39;s remarks, and I therefore could, not very well reply to them at the time, but I understood that he referred <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> some statement which I had made in connexion with the elections in New South Wales. He tried to be funny and sarcastic in what he said, and I believe he complained that in an address I made at Glen Innes I had referred to him as having failed to realize that this was a National Parliament, and as treating his duties here very much as he would if he were an advocate appearing in a Police Court. He also made some remark about my observing that he was not very often in the House. What I wanted to say, -and did say on that occasion, was that his attendances at the House were not <inline font-style="italic">as</inline> frequent as they might be, and that his attention to his duties in the House was still less frequent. The honorable member compared his attendances here with mine, but he omitted to state that I was in quarantine for about three weeks in the early part of the session, and lost my attendance at every sitting during that time, owing to my protest against the Government&#39;s vaccination proposals. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for New England was not at all careful about any remarks he made, or any innuendoes he tried to put forward, in his supposedly clever way. He does not know the difference between making a personal explanation and speaking on the adjournment of the House, which again shows that the cleverness on which he prides himself does not exist. He was making statements during the State election that were not correct, and, in order to remove any effect that they might have, I took occasion to refer to him in a good deal milder language than he was using. If he gets on a platform and alleges that a State Government have been wasting &#163;4,000,000 on Socialistic experiments, when the real facts show- that the amount spent was &#163;290,000, we must, come to the conclusion that he is  utterly  irresponsible, and has little or no regard for facts. I felt it necessary, not only to contradict his assertions by putting the facts before the people, but also to show them the irresponsible authority from whom the assertions emanated. I certainly had a right to do so in fighting for my party and their interests in the manner I thought best. Of course, the honorable member squeals when he receives a little bit of a punch, but he does not mind getting on a platform in the country and attacking men who are not there to defend themselves, regardless of the obligations imposed upon him by the responsible position he holds. I do not want to be bad friends with the honorable member, but I must say that I believe he gets a newspaper, which is alleged to be considerably subsidized by him, to publish every word he speaks here, and that he religiously sends along to it every little question that he asks. I suppose he has been looking for another paragraph by making a personal explanation this morning, and that this will appear, word for word, in the <inline font-style="italic">Guard ian</inline> - whoever takes any notice of it. He is quite welcome to any advertisement he gets out of it. The honorable member will be very careful in future, I think, in making electioneering speeches, not to treat the public as if they were a lot of gulls who will believe any statement that he might make, irrespective of its correctness or otherwise. </para>

                            <para>- Without any desire on my part, this matter has taken rather a personal turn. I quoted from a newspaper, and could have quoted a number of newspapers, word for word, and have also taken the trouble to find out whether the statements could be verified, but the honorable member has not been able to show in one particular where that newspaper report is incorrect. That being so, I must assume that the statement I read here is absolutely correct, and that the honorable member used the words attributed to him. </para>

                            <para>- That admission will shorten the remarks I have to make. It strikes me, as a new member, that there is a certain code of honour which should apply in politics as well as out of them; and people, in making statements publicly, are in duty bound to get as near to the truth as they possibly can. The question is whether the honorable member was justified in making the statement he did; whether I, as a new member, have taken no interest in the proceedings of the House, and have really not represented the electors of New England since I was returned. I can safely say that since I have been here I have not taken up much of the time of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reporters. But I have heard such a flood of eloquence from honorable members on the other side of the chamber, including the honorable member for Gwydir, that little opportunity was presented to me to make myself heard. I have endeavoured to attend to my duties here; I have shown that the statements made by the honorable member for Gwydir in my electorate were absolutely without foundation, and were really spoken for political purposes, and to further political ends, and now that the honorable member admits that he was correctly reported in the press, I think I have satisfied my electorate that during the last six months I have endeavoured to do my duty by them in this House. </para>

                        <para>. - I wish to place on the table of the Library papers in connexion with the Ordnance Stores. The report I have is from the Auditor-General, and it shows that the deficiency is not so serious as it would appear. With reference to the question submitted by the honorable member for Melbourne, as to the municipal ratings in the Australian capitals and ratings for similar services in London, Dublin, and Edinburgh, I think it is advisable to place before honorable members a copy of a further communication from the Government Statistician, explanatory of the replies which have already been furnished. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs</inline> writes - </para>

                        <para>It  was explained in the covering memorandum, sent with the statement forwarded to the Treasury on the 27th November for reply to questions asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maloney,</inline> that comparisons drawn from the figures were subject to the limitation that they did not refer to the same matters, inasmuch as in some of the cities services which were carried on by the municipalities themselves were in others intrusted to various boards, such as Water and Sewerage Boards, &#38;c. The ratings as given were those specified in the local government portion of the various State Statistical Registers, and referred to city corporations. </para>
                        <para>The most serious thing in giving the return  to  Parliament was the omission of the following remarks, viz. : - &#34; The details given refer  to  city corporations alone. Any comparisons made of them are, of course, subject to the disability that they do not all relate to the same items, <inline font-style="italic">i.e.,</inline> services which in some cases  are performed by the municipalities are in others looked after by special boards, <inline font-style="italic">e.g.,</inline> water and sewerage, &#38;c. &#39; Whoever handed you the matter for reply should have incorporated those qualifying remarks, and to leave them out was, in my judgment, a mistake. </para>
                        <para>One of the principal difficulties in the way  of  preparing a strictly comparable return  of  this nature lies in the fact that differently constituted bodies control the rating for various purposes and different States and countries, and, in addition, the rates are levied on different bases. Thus, for example, in the case of Melbourne, the City Council imposes a rate of is. in the <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> for the construction and maintenance of roads, streets, bridges, culverts, &#38;c, and a rate of 3d. in the <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> for public lighting, while the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works, a federation of metropolitan municipalities, imposes a rate of is. 8d. in the <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> in respect of water supply and sewerage, in addition to meter rentals and excess water charges. </para>
                        <para>In Perth, on the other-hand, the City Council levies a general rate of is. <inline font-style="italic">66.</inline> and a loan rate of gd., whilst the rates in respect of water supply, sewerage, and storm water are levied by a Government Department - the Water Supply, Sewerage, and Drainage Department - and are consequently not municipal rates at all. A further complication arises from the fact that in some cases the rates are levied on an assessed annual value, and in others on an unimproved capital value, the Sydney City Council employing the two systems in conjunction. </para>
                        <para>A further point may be mentioned, viz., that the general rate varies considerably, even in contiguous municipalities. Thus, whilst in the city of Melbourne the general and lighting rates aggregate only1s. 3d. in the <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1,</inline> in some of the neighbouring municipalities the corresponding rates are quite as great. </para>
