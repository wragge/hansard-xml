That could be done when the departmental officers certify that the line is, and continues to be, payable. </para>

                                <para>- Yes; with lighter materials and lighter posts, I think that we can probably build 2 miles of line for the present cost of 1 mile. My view is that if we can build a line to last for ten years, when it is proved to be a profitable investment, it will pay the Department to put up larger posts if required. These new specifications will, I believe, be ready very shortly. </para>

                                <para>- I must refer to the Minister&#39;s previous answers in order to base a new question upon them. The Postmaster-General has made a statement about new telephone lines becoming ultimately paying propositions. Is he in possession of any facts or figures from any of the States as to what the financial obligations for the Commonwealth maybe in the event of his deciding to adopt the course he has suggested ? I ask that question quite seriously, because I think it is an important matter. </para>

                                <para>- I wish to ask the Postmaster-General a question relating to the position of the mechanicians who were permitted to appeal to the Arbitration Court. A judgment was given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins in regard to their case. I should like to know, in the first instance, whether the Government intend to accept <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins&#39; decision, which has been laid upon the table of the House; and, secondly, whether it is intended to honour the promise which I gave that the casual employes affected by that award should have their increased remuneration dated back. </para>

I know that the Prime Minister has said that he had no desire to go outside the country for such labour, but that the Department could not be &#34; held up; &#34; and, further, that if we had to go abroad for it he would like to go to Great Britain. Personally, I think there are men in Australia who can do this work; and I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether he does not know that, as soon as the Postal Department pays the wages set down under the Arbitration Court award, there will be thousands of men available. </para>

Part of my district is affected by an encampment which is to be held, next December. To take away assistants from their work in that month causes great inconvenience to farmers and business men.

The sum of &#163;500 was remitted to me by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brookes</inline> for the Liberal organization of Western Australia, which sent an acknowledgment of it to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brookes,</inline> and I have his authority to say that it can be seen by the honorable member for Barrier at any time that he wishes to see it. I was given to understand at the time that the money had been collected as the result of an appeal to a number of persons in and around Melbourne who were interested in Western Australia, and the facts, I think, indicate that the thousands of pounds which are alleged to have been subscribed to the funds of the Liberal party by trusts and combines in the Commonwealth did not reach Western Australia at any rate. </para>

Before I left office, certain prosecutions were authorized, and the initial steps were taken. I should be glad to know what has been done in regard to those prosecutions in which instructions were given to proceed. So far as I know, none of the cases have come before the Court, except in the matter of one obscure newspaper in Manly, New South Wales. There were some other cases of much greater importance of which I have heard nothing since ; and I should like to know what is to happen in regard to them. </para>

                            <para>- I have the same answer to give that I gave to the same question some weeks ago. That answer is that the prosecutions to which the honorable member refers are prosecutions initiated, if at all, by the Department of Home Affairs. The only way in which such, cases come before the Attorney-General is, I think, under section 208 of the Electoral Act. By that Act the Attorney-General is called upon to advise any other Department as to prosecutions which that Department may contemplate. As to the advice that I have given as Attorney-General to my colleagues, I decline to disclose it, or any part or it, to this House. With regard to actual prosecutions, so far as the Attorney-General is responsible for the initiation of them, the persons who will first require any knowledge of them will be, as I said before, the persons mainly and primarily interested, namely, those who are accused. If the honorable member desires any further information as to those prosecutions, which are in the discretion of the Department of Home Affairs, I suggest that he had better ask that Department. </para>

The Attorney-General, as the honorable member knows, occupies a dual position. </para>

                                <para>- The Attorney-General occupies a dual position. He is the King&#39;s Attorney in the King&#39;s Courts, and in that position has no responsibility to this House. In his own Department, he is a responsible officer administering that Department, and, like every other Minister, is responsible to this House. Under the electoral law, there are certain offences, and that law is administered by the Minister of Home Affairs, just as Customs prosecutions are initiated or carried on by the Minister of Trade and Customs. The responsibility for initiating or carrying on a prosecution under the electoral law is a matter for the Department of Home Affairs, and rests with the Minister of Home Affairs. There are certain matters - and their range is practically unlimited - in which the Attorney-General, as Attorney-General, on his own initiative, finds it his duty sometimes to inaugurate prosecutions, whether under Act of Parliament or otherwise. With regard to these, he acts as King&#39;s Attorney in the King&#39;s Courts, and not as a responsible Minister of the Crown. </para>

It was further stated that this Bill was to be forced through the House of Representatives and sent to the Senate, with a view of endeavouring to secure a double dissolution. If there be any truth in this statement, will the Attorney-General be good enough, when asking for leave to introduce the Amending Electoral Bill, to explain the main features of that measure? </para>

                <para class="block">I disclaim the verbiage there attributed to me. In the first place, the ex-Minister for Home Affairs was not mentioned by me; my reference was to the ex-Prime Minister, the ex- Vice-President of the Executive Council, and the ex-Postmaster-General. I was challenged on several occasions during the no-confidence debate to prove my statements, and last night I told honorable members that I would reply to the remarks of the honorable member for Kennedy, but subsequently, as I understood it to be the general wish that the discussion should close in time to allow the last trains to be caught, I waived my right to speak then, and now crave the indulgence of the House to put what I have to say into a personal explanation. I am reported in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> to have interjected,, when the honorable member for Yarra was speaking, &#34; I mean to prove it in parton the floor of the House,&#34; and I must lay stress on the words &#34;in part,&#34; because- I do not profess to be able to prove statements which I did not make. What I said was, that persons who took money out of the tills of their employers to which they were not entitled, and did so without the knowledge of those to whom it belonged,, were put into gaol, and that the then Prime Minister and the other Ministers whom I have mentioned had been guilty of ,an offence worse than that, or words to that effect. </para>

                        <para>- I will mention any facts. The caseof <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> who occupied the position of Vice-President of the Executive Council at the time, differs from that of the honorable member for Wide Bay, because honorary Ministers have always drawn a travelling allowance when engaged on public business. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> as a representative of South Australia, had no official business in Queensland at all. Yet he drew his travelling allowance from the Treasury for every day that he was there fighting a political battle. In the same way the records of the Tasmanian newspapers show that the ex-Postmaster-General, the honorable member for Kalgoorlie, went to that State ostensibly upon public business. He arrived there some days before the elections took place, and the newspapers show that in the most inflammatory language he was day after day engaged in fighting the party&#39;s battle. Whilst so doing he drew his travelling allowance. I say that if we put a man in gaol for dipping his hand into his master&#39;s till and taking money which does not belong to him, those who occupy high places in the government of this country and who use their power to dip their hands into the public Treasury and take out money to enrich themselves under conditions which Parliament has not sanctioned, are guilty of an even worse offence. </para>

                        <para>- I am very glad to know that the present Government are above suspicion in this regard, because its members are not drawing the travelling allowance at all. I repeat that the man who takes money which does not belong to him is guilty of robbery, be he the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth or the lowest individual in the community. Both should be judged by the same standard. </para>

                        Minister for Home Affairs, were robbers. He accused them, of taking money out of the Commonwealth Treasury and putting it into their own pockets, and said there were men in gaol doing two or three years for lesser crimes than these Ministers had committed. And we make this solemn declaration, conscientiously believing the same to be true, and by virtue of the provisions of an Act of Parliament rendering persons making a false declaration punishable for wilful and corrupt perjury.

                <para class="block">That is to say, he would prove that the ex-Prime Minister is a robber, and ought to be in gaol. Other honorable members went on to say that they would have him in gaol. However, I understand that they did not mean that, although the honorable member for Echuca has not denied that he would have the ex-Prime Minister in gaol. It is very unfair to attack a man who is not present to defend himself. The honorable member for Echuca had ample opportunities to raise this question when the ex-Prime Minister was present. </para>

                            <para>- I regret that the Standing Orders do not permit of the honorable member being described in the terms I have used, but I will withdraw the remark. This question of travelling expenses was raised by the honorable member on 8th August, 1912. The intention of the Government with regard to the drawing of travelling expenses was put before the House in December, 1911, not after an all-night sitting, as has been said, but at 9.15 p.m. The ex-Prime Minister then stated distinctly the course that it was intended to follow in regard to the payment of travelling expenses. When the matter was mentioned in the Senate by the then Vice-President of the Executive Council, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor, Senator Millen,</inline> the present Minister of Defence, made a speech in which he approved of the proposed action. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think there has been any abuse of it. The honorable member has to prove that there has been any abuse. Prompted by the honorable member for Cowper, who, I understand, is the  Deputy  Whip, the honorable member went out of his way to say that the present Ministry were not drawing these expenses. Perhaps they are able to draw from some other fund. </para>

Apparently the honorable member for Echuca may say anything he pleases. He can make any insinuation he likes against the Opposition without objection on the part of his party, but because I am alleged to have made some insinuation against them they get up on their hind legs as if the remark had hit them. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Echuca says that, so far as he is aware, no blame can be attached to me in regard to this matter of travelling allowances. With that admission I am perfectly satisfied; but I do think that he has acted unfairly in attacking the ex-Prime Minister in his absence. The right honorable gentleman made the position perfectly clear. He showed clearly on a previous occasion that long before either the first or the second Fisher Ministry took office Ministers were drawing this allowance. An Executive minute was passed as far back as 1901 providing for Ministerial travelling expenses, and that minute has never been revoked. Some members of the Ministry in 1901 and also in 1909-10 drew expenses on the authority of this Executive minute. There was authority for the drawing of the money to which reference has been made, otherwise the Auditor- General would not have passed the accounts. It has been said that the ex-Prime Minister drew travelling expenses whilst he was electioneering in Queensland in his own electorate, or in other electorates. </para>

                            <para>- I regret exceedingly that this matter has been raised, but since it has been we have the right to clear the character of an honorable gentleman who stands high in the estimation of the people of Australia. I believe that nine-tenths of the Government party are prepared to say that every action taken by the ex-Prime Minister would undoubtedly be perfectly straight, correct, and honest. Apparently, there is only one member of the party who is prepared to indulge in these tactics. The ex-Prime Minister stated distinctly that during the whole time that he was in his own electorate he did not draw a penny for travelling expenses, although every one knows that a Minister, even when visiting his own electorate, is called upon whilst there to transact official business. My leader said that, whilst he was transacting official business in Brisbane on. the occasion in question, he did draw travelling expenses, and I am informed by his private secretary that only on one night out of the number that he spent in Brisbane did he speak at any political meeting. Surely a politician&#39;s nights are his own. I think it absolutely disgraceful that the honorable member for Echuca has not accepted the statement made by the ex-Prime Minister on the8th August, and I have only to say that if the honorable member chooses to say anything about me outside I shall be prepared to deal with him either inside or outside the House. </para>

I shall not adopt the honorable member&#39;s attitude. I will make him a present of it. I wish, however, to say that the present Treasurer is the custodian of the accounts relating to Ministerial expenses, and that I challenge him to examine them to see whether, on the occasion that I visited Hobart in my official capacity as Postmaster-General, I was not in the office on every day in respect of which I drew my allowance. I challenge him to say that documents cannot be produced from the office to prove my statement. It is true that there was an election in progress whilst I was in Hobart, and that I made two speeches on behalf of my party, but it is also true that I did not draw expenses in respect of the day on which I delivered those speeches. I invite the Treasurer to look through the documents, and if he can produce to this House evidence that the statement I am now making is not correct </para>

My statement was that the current rate of interest was being charged on the Victorian loan, but that, when there was added to the interest the amount which the State Government had lost by a removal of the note tax, it amounted to 5 2-5ths per cent. That statement is absolutely correct. </para>

This order is causing considerable inconvenience. People who desire to leave Newcastle on a Sunday must begin their journey on the Saturday morning, and stay in Sydney until the Sunday night, in order that they may obtain the official permission to travel. Will the responsible Minister see at once that the Government Medical Officer at Newcastle is enabled to issue orders on Sunday as in Sydney? </para>

Seeing that there is a large number of honorable members on the other side who have arrived at an age when it would be almost dangerous to be vaccinated, and seeing that they could not leave Sydney without being vaccinated, will the honorable gentleman grant to these honorable gentlemen exemptions, as is provided for in the Quarantine Act, the same as have been granted to the parliamentary visitors from the Old Land? Will he take that course and so endeavour to remove the unjust stigma put on New South Wales in particular, and on Australia in general, by the action of the Minister of Trade and Customs in quarantining Sydney? </para>

                                <para>- The Prime Minister has already said here that he will consider the question of adjourning the House for the purpose of enabling honorable members to visit Sydney on the arrival of the battleship <inline font-style="italic">Australia</inline> from England. I desire to know if he will take into consideration the age of honorable members on his side of the House, and the danger attached to their being vaccinated ? I wish to inform him that telegrams have been sent to various portions of the world stating that the skin disease, in respect of which Sydney has been quarantined, is of a very mild form. </para>

                                <para>- Order ! Honorable members seem to be under a misapprehension as to the right of asking questions. Questions are asked to elicit information, not to give it. A question addressed to a Minister must not involve the making of a speech, or statements of facts, though a statement may be made of a very brief nature to explain the nature of the question. The honorable member is going beyond that. </para>

Will he allow to honorable members sitting on the other side the same privilege under the Quarantine Act as has been granted to others? Will he allow an exemption to honorable members whose age would make it dangerous for them to receive poison in their blood as they would do if vaccinated? </para>

Parliament, I wish to know whether, in view of the state of feeling disclosed by the division last night, and the discussion of the past three weeks, the honorable gentleman will introduce for our first consideration such measures as may be described as somewhat non-contentious. I wish to know whether, before introducing a Bill to amend the Arbitration Act, by abolishing preference to unionists, and a Bill for amending the Electoral Act, by reinstating the postal vote, he will propose measures for the establishment for a general works Department, the taking over of Norfolk Island by the Commonwealth, the regulation of life and fire insurance and bankruptcy, the punishment of offences against the Commonwealth, and the taking over of the public debts of the States. I ask the question so that, so far as possible, public business may be expedited, and the Government assisted in carrying out legislation. Will the Prime Minister remove contentious matters from the business-paper, and bring forward such as might possibly be non-contentious ? </para>

                            <para>- The Prime Minister % having intimated that Ministers will not answer further questions without notice,  such questions are no longer allowable. Questions without notice may be asked only so long as Ministers are willing to answer them. It is evident that no good purpose can be served by asking questions which will not be answered, and persisting in asking them is merely wasting the time of the House. </para>

                            <para>- May I submit for your future consideration, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> that if the ruling which you have just given is adhered to, the rights and privileges of honorable members will be placed within the hands of the Prime Minister, who a minute after the assembling of the House might say that questions without notice would not be answered, which would, under your ruling, at once debar members from asking , such questions. The refusal of Ministers to answer questions is quite within their right, because there is no obligation on Ministers to answer the questions put to them, either with or without notice; but surely the exercise by them of the right to decline the answer does not take from honorable members generally the right to ask questions. The position of honorable members would well nigh be intolerable if that were so. I submit that we should not be prevented from putting our questions before the country. As to the statement that an hour and a half has been occupied this morning in the asking and answering of questions without notice, I point out that it is no unusual thing at the beginning of a session for a little extra time to be occupied in this way. We must recognise the right of the Prime Minister to control the business of the House, but he should not be able at any moment that he chooses to take from honorable members the right to ask questions. We are here as representatives of the people, whether our opponents like it or not, and our constituents may desire us to put certain questions. If the Prime Minister is permitted to say that he will not answer questions, and to thereby prevent us from putting them, we shall be prevented from representing our constituents in a manner in which they desire to be represented. </para>

                            <para>- I have already given a ruling on the point, and to discuss that ruling is irregular. Honorable members are not precluded from asking questions without notice of Ministers, but it rests with Ministers themselves to say whether they will reply to them or whether they will require notice to be given. As soon as Ministers intimate that they require notice to be given, any further questions must be placed upon the business paper, and the right of honorable members to get their questions answered is thus not interfered with. In the present instance the Prime Minister has notified that no further questions without notice will be answered to-day, and seeing that such questions are not recorded in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> the mere putting of them cannot serve any useful purpose, and can only delay the business of the House. In these circumstances honorable members must avail themselves of the opportunity to put their questions upon the business paper, either for the next day of sitting or for any other day that they may think fit. </para>

The honorable member for Adelaide, as I understood, rose, not for the purpose of questioning my ruling, but of submitting a question, as he said, for my future consideration, and if it referred to a new matter, it would have been in order. I did not understand him to raise the question of the propriety of my ruling; but to raise the question of privilege, affecting members&#39; rights. I have already dealt with that question. But now that a ruling has been given, it would be quite out of order for an honorable member to attempt to traverse that ruling. If my ruling is to be called into question, it must be done in the regular way. </para>

The sender of a cablegram has the right to decide the route by which it is to be transmitted, and, with a view to reducing the number of separate forms used by the Department, only one form is used for cables sent from Departmental offices. I have now arranged for a statement to appear upon the forms intimating that the Pacific cable is State-owned. </para>

                            <para>The award is not retrospective either as a whole or in part. The law (section 14 of the Arbitration (Public Service) Act) directs that no award shall come into operation earlier than after the expiration of thirty days after the award has been Laid before Parliament. Further, the award itself expressly states that it shall not come into force until the expiration of such thirty days. Prior thereto the rates of pay are governed by the Public Service Act and Regulations, and up to the date the award? comes into force the officers concerned in the award cannot lawfully be paid any wages other than as prescribed by the Regulations. </para>
                            <para>If the award in the present case is departed from, as regards the date on which its principal! features shall come into operation, a dangerous precedent will be established for all future cases. The Court has now before it claims by several Public Service Associations lodged at various dates back to the nth September, 1912, and, if the present request be acceded to, each of these associations will, no doubt, ask to have the awards in their cases also made retrospective in disregard of the provisions of the law. The present award will swell the salary bill of the Department up to an amount of ^30,000. per annum, and, if it were made retrospective, the Commonwealth Treasury would be required to immediately provide an additional sum for arrears of payment estimated at least at ^20,000. </para>

                                <para>- Without discussing the merits of the award at all, I wish to say that these men were told by this Parliament that they must go to the Court. They did not want to go. They tried their best to obviate the necessity of going to the Court, but they were practically driven to the Court by this Parliament. In my judgment, therefore, whatever the consequences, it would be a substantial act of repudiation to rob them now of the benefit of the award which they have obtained from the Court. </para>

                    <para>I may say that it is not controversial, and is by no means a party matter. In submitting it we have in view two objects. We desire, in the first place, to authorize payments to meet ordinary expenditure during July. Our proposition is that this provision shall apply only to payments that have been authorized by Parliament for the previous year. It is not proposed that any increase of salaries shall be paid under the provisions of this Bill. The  payments  made during July will be on the basis of the Estimates for the previous year. </para>

                            <para>- I shall come to that point in a moment. As honorable members are generally aware, much inconvenience has arisen from the fact that the Treasury is without any legal authority to make any payment whatever after the close of the financial year, on the 30th June, until a Supply Bill is passed. It has been found necessary almost every year to interrupt the debate on the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply to hurriedly obtain Supply in order that payments that are imperative shall be made. Under our procedure, in a great many cases, wages payments are made weekly, and it has happened on more than one occasion that payment has had to be deferred owing to the Parliament not meeting until close upon the end of June. </para>

                            <para>- At the end of every financial year. Payments of wages have to be made in accordance very often with the award of an Arbitration Court or a Wages Board, but it has sometimes been found impossible to make them for the reason that Supply has not been obtained. A measure similar to this has been in force in New South Wales for many years, I believe, and has worked satisfactorily, so that there is no reason to anticipate that any injury will be done to the public affairs of the country by passing it. If it were usual to meet in May, or even early in June, we should probably be able to dispose of the debate on the Address-in-Reply, and obtain </para>

                    <para class="block">Supply before the end of the month, but experience shows that that is next to impossible. As a rule, Parliament does not meet until nearly the end of June, so that, unless we alter the date of the closing of the financial year, or make up our minds to meet earlier, Parliament must either pass this Bill, or continue to submit to the annual inconvenience as heretofore. This is a matter which has been talked about a good deal by more than one Government. We could, of course, go on as before, doing the best we can; but it was felt that as we were amending the Audit Act we might submit this proposal for the consideration of honorable members. Of course, it could be said that such a measure might induce a Government to delay meeting Parliament a little longer than they otherwise would. At present we must meet shortly after the 30th June in order to get Supply, whereas under the Bill it will be possible to carry on until the 31st July, to which date, at any rate, there will be money available. The general feeling of the House is, however, that we ought to meet about the end of June as the most convenient time, and I do not think that a Government would be acting quite in accordance with what we expect, if they took advantage of a measure of this kind to prolong the recess. </para>

                            <para>- As I have already pointed out, there are great advantages. We should not be so much hurried, and the discussion of the policy of the Government would not be interrupted each year by the introduction of a Supply Bill shortly after the House had met. We should have time to settle down to business before there was any necessity to consider the finances. The second object of the Bill is to give power to the Governor in Council to make regulations for the purchase, custody, control, and issue of Government stores, and also to constitute a Supply and Tender Board to regulate the purchase of public stores. In Victoria and other States the whole management of stores is provided for by regulations of a very complete character, in the same way as is contemplated under the Bill. </para>

                        <para>. - We ought not to be asked to discuss this measure without having an opportunity to consider it. The explanation of the right honorable gentleman has been purely formal, and he has not dealt with any of those points which are of vital importance. The measure, which has been placed in our hands only this morning, deals with matters of first moment, because nothing can be of more importance than the control of the finances. Some truly revolutionary suggestions are made in the Bill, but these were not covered by the right honorable gentleman&#39;s speech. I certainly object to being asked to discuss this measure without an opportunity to see precisely how far it is proposed to extend payments after the conclusion of a financial year. Paragraph (6) of sub-clause 2 leaves very grave doubts as  to  the utility of the proposal. We have had Supply Bills this year, and, consequently, this clause would not apply until the next financial year. The proposal to institute a Supply and Tender Board creates an entirely new position. No doubt a suggestion to give authority to make necessary payments pending appropriation might, subject to certain conditions, be considered favorably; but at present I am opposed to a Supply and Tender Board, because this seems to me to be giving the Audit Department duties quite foreign to its proper functions. The basic principle of the Audit Department is that it is charged with the duty of inspection and inquiry in regard to other Departments - in itself it does nothing - and it has to inquire how those Departments have done their work. Under section 45 of the Audit Act, it is one of the duties of the Auditor-General <inline font-style="italic">ta</inline> ascertain the quantity, description, and price of all stores purchased on  account  of, and all stores supplied to, every Department, and whether any person has requisitioned for or obtained any stores in excess of the reasonable requirements of his office. It is now proposed to clothe the Auditor-General with authority to regulate the supply, price, and so forth of stores. I am not arguing against  a  Supply and Tender Board, but I direct the attention of the Treasurer to section 45 of the Audit Act. </para>

                            <para>- The Board will be under the Auditor-General. There is no authority in the Bill to create an independent Tender Board, and it will be  a  Board constituted under section 71, which gives the Governor-General power to make regulations for carrying out the provisions of the Act. The whole of the powers under section 71 have relation to the Auditor-General, his functions, and the duties of his staff. The Treasurer, I am afraid, fails to appreciate the fact that he is dealing with an Act of Parliament which was brought into existence for clothing with power an official who exercises the most important duties in the Commonwealth . </para>

                    <para class="block">This Bill has usually been in the care of the Minister of Trade and Customs. Had he been here to-day he would have moved the second reading. In his absence I have to step into the breach, and, owing to the tired feeling which appears to pervade the Opposition benches, shall endeavour to give some pabulum which can be readily digested. The Bill proposes nothing that is difficult or occult. Its object is to establish a Federal Agricultural Bureau. I do not think that at this time of day any argument is needed as to the  advisableness  of taking a step of the kind. We have all agreed that anything relating to the primary industries of the country is of first-rate importance, and to take first place in our consideration. However much we may argue as to the importance of our secondary industries, and all the manifold and multiform social manifestations of our modern existence, it is undoubtedly the first and chief consideration of any body of individuals possessing a desire for the welfare of the community that the interests of agriculture should be promoted. Because, rightly comprehended, this is the basis of everything else. The aim in every country, it seems to me, ought to be to proportion development, to maintain a ratio, or, at any rate, a harmony, between primary and secondary industries. We have heard a great deal about the urgent necessity for Tariff revision. No doubt that is an important question. But I venture to say that this is equally important. Certainly, without attention to our primary industries, there would not be much need for the revision of the Tariff for the development of our secondary industries. This is the beginning of every form of natural development. </para>

It is a clear indication that honorable members opposite have nothing to do with farmers, and that the only members of this House who will take notice of their needs are those sitting on this side. I will pass on. Our primary industries are vital to the community, and of supreme importance to the State as a whole. As showing their importance, I point out that last year our total exports of pastoral and agricultural products amounted to &#163;52,000,000 out of a total of &#163;76,000,000, or 68 per cent. In this respect Australia is receiving attention from all parts of the world in a way that has not been the ca3e for many years past. Now and again we receive a delegation to our shores of people who are interested in investigating our conditions and natural resources. Everything seems to me to indicate that the world at large is looking to countries like Australia for the food and for much of the clothing of the future. We have here potentialities in abundance to supply the world&#39;s needs. I was very much struck by reading some statements made by the Scottish Agricultural Commissioners who were out here a few years ago having a look at us. They refer, for instance, to the dairying industry: - </para>

                            <para>- Yes, in that respect we have many advantages over Canada, where the farmers have to house their stock during the long cold winter; whereas here very little of that kind of thing is necessary in the bulk .of our dairying districts. This is a matter of general interest. It does not affect the Commonwealth Government alone. It affects all the States in common. The scientific, pastoral, and agricultural problems are differentiated in various ways in the various States. </para>

                            <para>- I know that he made some excellent speeches on the subject. So did <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Quick, and so did we all. Pests, and similar troubles, have a peculiar affinity for some States and for some degrees of our climate. Every State is peculiarly interested in their obliteration from the Commonwealth. Outsiders see this just as clearly as we do. I shall quote again from the report of the Scottish Agricultural Commissioners, because I think it well that honorable members should know the impression made on their minds in respect of thi3 subject. They came to the conclusion that, in connexion with the work of the States, a great deal of overlapping goes on. Here is an extract from their report - </para>

                        <para>It appeared to us, however, that a considerable amount of overlapping was going on, that in general there was a want of co-ordination and co-operation, that the policy of allowing each State to attempt to attack the solution of each agricultural problem by itself, was not the most economical. There are many problems which are common to the whole of Australia, or to the greater part of it, and it would appear that time and money would be saved by placing some of the work of research in the hands of a Federal Department. For example, every State is afflicted with various stock diseases. In Queensland there is &#34; tick fever,&#34; in another there is &#34; coast disease,&#34; and so on. A strong and well-equipped Federal Department would seem more likely to cope with such diseases than the weaker and less well-equipped State Departments. The prickly pear, again, is not a State monopoly, but may through time spread over most of the country, and here again is an argument for Federal control, which would not &#34; absorb or limit the energies of the State Departments, but concern itself with a broader and a wider field. </para>

                    <para class="block">Now, a great deal of work in these fields is already being done by the Federal Government. We are employing many of the State agencies to do work which I am inclined to think could be very much better done by a bureau of our own. For instance, we have all sorts of quarantine arrangements which are looked after by the States. State officers do the work for us. </para>

                            <para>- There is now an American here investigating the conditions under which our beef is sent away; in fact, our meat generally. The question of worm nodules in beef is, I understand, one which relates itself to both the Quarantine Department and the Agricultural Bureau.&#39; It impinges upon both Departments, and there must necessarily be a very close relation between the two. A bureau of this kind would help us to make our quarantine very much more effective, and perhaps very much more intelligent. At present the States are doing a great deal of this work for us. I find, for instance, that the Commonwealth pays about &#163;150 a year to the Sydney Bureau of Micro-Biology for special services rendered by them. And we are investigating very closely the question of the worm nodules in beef, which, I believe, affects Queensland in a way that it does not affect any other State. </para>

                            <para>- I suppose so. I know that the other day we gave a Melbourne scientist a commission to look further into the question on a holiday trip she was about to make in Europe. I refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Sweet,</inline> who, I believe, in connexion with Professor Gilruth, has made a special study of this matter. There are others who are working in the same field. Then we pay &#163;4,000 a year to a tropical school at Townsville. That, so far, has been concerning itself with human diseases, but it is enlarging its functions gradually to embrace animals and plants, and diseases of all sorts, as they express themselves in tropical lands. Again, there is the question of bitter pit. We are paying &#163;1,000 a year for the investigation of that alone. </para>

At any rate, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McAlpine</inline> is engaged in investigating the matter, and he receives &#163;1,000 a year for his work. It has always appeared to me that what we most need in Australia is a small select body of the best original investigators we can get. I am afraid that we have never gone to the top of the tree in engaging the kind of ability that we want in these matters. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know that that is a reason for not spending money - it is a reason for persevering. That reminds me that only this morning I received from a Tasmanian a letter telling me that he has a remedy for bitter pit. He says he can tell when he goes into an orchard whether bitter pit is there or not. I have no doubt that in many ways men are investigating in this field. The trouble is that there are so many theories concerning bitter pit. One of our University investigators says he has proved to demonstration that bitter pit is simply a poisoning of the apple, and that it is caused by the various sprays which are used, and, perhaps, some poisons in the soil. Another investigator comes along and says he has proved to demonstration that the spraying has nothing to do with bitter pit. Altogether, a great realm of  exploration  lies open to us, and we have to persevere until we find a solution for many of the problems. It appears to me that a great deal of this work will be done in the laboratory - it must be done there before it can be done in the field. I know that in connexion with fruit there are many troubles. If we got a man to deal with one of these troubles and solve it for us, he would be worth &#163;50,000 a year to this country. Yet the ordinary salaries that are being paid by the States range, I suppose, from &#163;400 to &#163;600 or &#163;700 a year. We cannot buy the best ability of the world for a sum like that. I do not want to say a word about what the States are doing, except in terms of the highest praise. I believe that they are doing, most of them, excellent work; but they are not  doing the particular kind of work which a Federal Bureau ought to he set up to do. Over and above what they do in the practical fields of investigation there is the scientific laboratory work to be done, and for that purpose we want a small, well-equipped and thoroughly trained body of original investigators to tackle some of the problems that now afflict our people so much. </para>

                            <para>- To begin with, certainly. There is every possible facility in the States to test all their work. It would be an unnecessary duplication, it seems to me, for them to launch out into practical fields for the purpose of testing their own work. My own idea is to link up the practical Departments of the States to this Federal Bureau. </para>

                            <para>- No. My idea is not to set this up as an administrative, but as an investigatory, bureau. Let the Bureau get on with the work which the States are not doing at present, and, when it has got scientific information, disseminate it. When it has traced the life history of a disease, and found the remedy to be applied, let it make that information available to the State Departments, which would test it in a practical way through their own organizations. I do not want this to be a competing bureau except in the highest sense of all. </para>

Take, for instance, the payment of &#163;4,000 a year to the Queensland Institute. </para>

                            <para>- There is no more intricate or difficult problem than that of those diseases of the tropics which seem to have such a peculiar affinity for white people, and to cause them so much trouble. I do not wish to labour the question. But I desire to make it clear that the Commonwealth Bureau will in no way come into conflict with the State bureaux; on the contrary, it would assist the scientific work that they are doing, and the State agencies would test its laboratory experiments by practical application of their results. The intention is to link up the Commonwealth and State Departments, and supply what is now missing from the State machinery. We require a standard Australian wheat, which will take a place in the world like that of the Manitoba wheat. The experiments of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Farrer</inline> in producing wheats specially suited to our climate and natural conditions have already produced results worth many times more than they cost. Federation wheat, and Bobb&#39;s  wheat, two varieties due solely to his efforts, have brought hundreds of thousands of pounds to our farmers. A great calamity  befel  Australia when death took <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Farrer</inline> away from the work he loved so much. I was brought into intimate relationship with him many years ago, when for a little while I had charge of the Agricultural Department of New. South Wales; and I know with what rare fidelity to his duty his work was done. He did not work for money, and could not be paid for what he did. Indeed, he had begun his  experiments long before the Department got hold of him, and, as I have said, our farmers are to-day reaping hundreds of thousands of pounds from the results of his self-sacrificing labour. It is work of that kind that we wish to encourage. In time to come <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Farrer&#39;s</inline> name will stand high in the records of the world as that of a benefactor of his race. Others who are further away are better able to estimate the worth of such work as his than we who are- close to it are apt to do. The Scottish Agricultural Commission, referring to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Farrer&#39;s</inline> experiments, said in their report - </para>

                        <para>There are a great many varieties of wheat, and beyond&#34; doubt the possibilities of wheat raising in the Commonwealth have been in a large manner due to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> Farrer, who devoted his life to evolving wheats suited to Australian conditions. </para>

                    <para class="block">A whole vista of duties and potentialities opens up when inquiry is made as to what there is to be done in Australia. Everything that is a pest elsewhere is a pest here, and the means we have taken to eradicate pests have often brought about the introduction of others. Indeed, at the present time there is a controversy as to whether the importation of ferrets should not be prohibited, lest they become a bigger nuisance than the rabbits which they have been brought here to destroy. A phase of the matter to which I draw attention is this : Parliament has been trying by the offer of bounties to stimulate and develop new industries, such as cotton and coffee growing, the production of fibre plants and other tropical products. The Commonwealth Bureau of Agriculture will be very useful if it carries out investigations along scientific lines to show how best to undertake this work. Our idea is to help the States, not to supersede their activity in any way. If they should feel that they can hand over to us special work which we could do better because of our greater facilities, we shall be glad to accept it, and thus bring about economy and improved efficiency. But the first idea is to supplement the work of the States; to take up the higher scientific work and make the knowledge that is obtained readily available to the whole of Australia. I ask the sympathetic and kindly consideration of the House for a very useful measure. </para>

                            <para>- We are not likely to have the second reading carried this afternoon, and it is not far from the usual hour for adjournment. The Bill contains no information. Under it the cost of the proposed Department might be &#163;5,000, or &#163;50,000, or &#163;500,000 a year. We have not been told whether it is possible to make arrangements with the Departments of the States for the doing of scientific work. The Prime Minister confused the work of the Tropical School of Medicine in Townsville with the work that would be undertaken by the proposed Bureau, but the two institutions will have nothing to do with each other. He might as well have said that the proposed Bureau will deal with diseases like small-pox. Of course, it might be possible to attach a laboratory to the Tropical School of Medicine at Townsville for the purpose of making investigations, much in the way in which the well-equipped laboratory at the Customs Department is being used to do certain work for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McAlpine.</inline> The Prime Minister twitted us on this side with having no interest in the country districts; but I would remind him that, although Liberal Governments had this measure on the stocks for years, they did nothing to pass it. Without waiting for legislation, the Labour Government made an agreement with the States, under which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McAlpine</inline> was engaged to carry out an investigation of the bitter pit disease. That is one of the things for which honorable members do not give us credit. </para>

                            <para>- I think that he would, privately. I was in charge of the Department of Trade and Customs when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McAlpine</inline> was appointed. I hope that his work will be crowned with success, because bitter pit causes immense losses, not only to Australian orchardists, but to orchardists elsewhere. The United States of America have spent well over 1,000,000 dollars in trying to get rid of it. The last Government was also responsible for the investigation of the worm nodules that appear in meat. Professor Gilruth was sent by us to Northern Queensland to investigate the subject, and it was due to our efforts that the beef trade of Queensland was saved. Had it gone, the mutton trade would have suffered too, because our unscrupulous competitors were ready to make use of any statement to damage our meat business. A great deal of useful work of this kind can be done without establishing a Commonwealth Agricultural Bureau. If we merely add to six sets of professional State officers a seventh set of Commonwealth officers, there will be continual dissension. State officers will not work with Commonwealth officers unless some agreement is come to about their relative spheres of action. </para>

                            <para>- The position of matters might change if a Commonwealth university were established to do the same work that the State institutions are doing. I do not know that the States are willing to give up any of their powers. My view has always been that work of the kind to be done by the Bureau could be done more effectively by one body than by six, and the States are beginning already to cooperate to some degree. For instance, Victoria, finding it difficult to keep <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Elwood</inline> Mead, one of the best experts in his line, is seeking to co-operate with New South Wales for the retention of his services. No doubt, if the States find that they can save money by handing over work to the Commonwealth, they will do that; but their Departments are desirous of keeping as much as possible in their own hands, and will be ready to complain if the Commonwealth Bureau is started without consultation with them, and without an agreement with them. The Prime Minister has stated that if we establish the proposed Agricultural Bureau it will be able to take charge of the quarantining of fruit and vegetables passing from State to State. That is absolutely absurd. This Bureau of Agriculture could not undertake any of the quarantine functions which are referred to in section 112 of the Constitution, and which are defined in the Quarantine Act itself. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Franklin made an interjection in regard to quarantine functions, and I understood the Prime Minister to say that these could be undertaken by the proposed Bureau. I admit that the honorable gentleman found himself in a difficult position this afternoon, owing to the absence of the Minister of Trade and Customs, who is at present with the British parliamentary party which is visiting Australia. I regret that the head of the Government should have declined to grant me an adjournment of the debate, because the subject with which we are dealing is an extremely large one. The Bill before us contains only two important clauses, and yet it may involve the Commonwealth in an expenditure of &#163;5,000 or &#163;500,000 a year. I think we should know definitely to what we are committing ourselves. We should be told whether the proposed Bureau will have its headquarters here, or in the Federal Capital, or in the Northern Territory; and whether it will have branches throughout Australia. I do hope that the Bill will not be rushed through the House this afternoon. It is altogether too important; and I do not think that such a procedure would be fair to members of the Opposition, who are just as much interested in this question as are the supporters of the Government. The action which the late Government took in connexion with bitter pit, and worm nodules in beef, shows that they were thoroughly alive to the importance of this question. The Bill should not be passed before we know whether the States will co-operate with us in this work. </para>

                            <para>- If the work of the proposed Bureau is to be confined to the laboratory, we have a right to be told that. I think we should be told how much it is intended to expend on this Bureau during the first two or three years of its existence. I am aware that in Queensland, which seems to be specially affected by pests such as the cane grub, and the worm nodule in beef, some of the best scientific work might be done. I take it that a portion of the work which is now being undertaken by the Commerce Department might with advantage be transferred to this Department. Notwithstanding that we are doing a trade in beef and mutton with Great Britain and the Continent, amounting to &#163;4,000,000 annually, it is a fact that, until <inline font-weight="bold">Mr, Cherry</inline> was appointed by the late Government two years ago, we never had a representative there to look after our interests. </para>

                        <para>.- I am very sorry that the peaceful overtures which I made to the Prime Minister this afternoon were not received in the spirit in which they were offered. I have been accused of desiring to obstruct the passing of a certain measure. The Prime Minister told me that there were no politics in the Agricultural Bureau Bill so far as I am concerned. I wish again to place before the Prime Minister a proposal that he should select from the Ministerial programme such subjects as the Agricultural Bureau Bill, the consolidation of the States debts, the establishment of a general Works Department, the Bill dealing with the transfer of Norfolk Island to the Commonwealth, the question of life and fire insurance regulations, the Bankruptcy Bill, and Offences against the Commonwealth Bill, and proceed to deal with these matters, which are of a practical and non-contentious character. Honorable members upon this side of the Chamber will offer no obstruction to the passing of the measure which has been discussed this afternoon. But in the Government programme there are about fifteen other measures of a violently contentious character, and if they are to be proceeded with nothing will be done. If the Prime Minister meant anything when he said that he was going to appeal to the patriotism of honorable members on both sides of the House to carry on the business of the country he will recognise the wisdom of immediately proceeding with the non-contentious measures I have indicated. </para>

                        <para>. - I have no wish to charge the Public Service Commissioner with endeavouring to do something that he ought not to do. But I understand that it is his desire to introduce postal mechanics into the Commonwealth. It is idle for any one to tell me that we have not in Australia mechanics who can carry out any work that the Department may require. We have in the engineering trade men who are competent to do anything required in this respect. The Prime Minister, according to the newspaper reports, said he would be sorry if it were found necessary to take this action; and I hope that the Public Service Commissioner will not be allowed to do anything in this regard until the tradesmen of Australia have had an opportunity to assert themselves, and to show that they can do the work required by the Department. It is also peculiar that the Government intend, so I am informed, to introduce mechanics from the Old Country to fit up machinery for the woollen mills at Geelong. I do not know whether it is a case of the immigration question being always uppermost in their minds ; but I should like to know whether the intention is to bring out, to fit up this machinery, men who, as soon as the work has been carried out, will be thrown on the labour market of Australia. Is that what is proposed, or are these men to be made members of the permanent staff? There are already in Australia men who can look after such machinery, and do the work well. It may be necessary to introduce a leading hand to deal with some new features of the machinery; but it is an undoubted fact that we have here men who are quite capable of erecting machinery for woollen mills, and of looking after it when it has been erected. There are men here who have done such work. I do not like the introduction of this system. We had something of the sort done by the late Government in connexion with the Defence Department; and if the practice is to be continued, I shall be inclined to believe that officers of the Department are determined that Australians shall be given no opportunity in connexion with works under their control. I have nothing to say against men coming from the Old Country, for, no doubt, they would be highly capable mechanics and good citizens; but I would point out that the labour market in respect of the engineering trade is already overcrowded. I represent a constituency in which there are many engineering works; and I know  that, both in my own electorate as well as in other parts of the Commonwealth, we have highly-skilled men in all trades. I hope that the Government will see that Australians are given an opportunity to show that they have the ability to do this work. </para>

                        <para>.- I wish to indorse the remarks made by the honorable member for Melbourne Ports. In the case of an absolutely new industry, I could understand one or two leading hands being introduced, so that, under their direction, our own men could carry out the work of fitting up the machinery ; but, at the present time, there are out of employment some of the most highly-skilled mechanics in Australia, and they are, unfortunately, competing to-day with what is known as the general labouring class. Do the Government intend to flood our already overcrowded labour markets? </para>

It is generally conceded, however, that, both in the matter of the quality and the quantity of their work, there are no workmen who can compete with Australians. Since we have well-qualified men in our own community, I hope that the Government will not bring out others unless, as I have said, it should be found necessary to introduce a leading hand or two because of their special knowledge of a particular class of work. There is very little that the Australian, blessed with his great initiative, cannot master and carry out. lt has been said by some of the most expert men in the engineering and other trades that Australians seem to be the most readily adaptable of men. </para>

                    <para>There is only one other matter to which I desire, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker,</inline> to refer, and that is that I wished this morning, when a point of order was raised, to ask <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> a question in regard to a ruling that he gave. I understand that early in the session, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> ruled that, although Ministers were within their rights in declining to answer questions,, honorable members would be in order in continuing to ask them. I wish to know whether the ruling given this morning overrides that decision. </para>
                    <para>I trust that the Government will bear in mind the protest made against the importation of mechanics, that the Treasurer will not abolish the 10s. note, and that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> will not rule honorable members out of order when they desire to ask questions. </para>

                        <para>. - I was just as surprised as the honorable member for Melbourne Ports was when I heard that these electrical mechanicians could not be obtained in Australia. The Commissioner, however, advised the Department that he called for applications in Western Australia, and did not receive one. He stated that he had the same experience in Melbourne. </para>
