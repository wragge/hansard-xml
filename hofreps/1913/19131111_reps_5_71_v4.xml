I call upon the honorable member for Barrier to withdraw the reflection, which I heard him make on the Chair. It is not competent for other business to intervene until the honorable member has obeyed  my direction. </para>

            <para>- I desire to speak on the question of privilege which has been raised. I take it that one of the privileges which, for some considerable time, has been handed down to us, is that of discussing questions of privilege raised by honorable members. The Prime Minister has taken exception to certain remarks which are alleged to have been made by the honorable member for Ballarat at some meeting in that city. In the first place, I submit that the Prime Minister should have come here armed with a copy of the newspapers in question, and should have given us the names of the printers or publishers, and thus have complied with standing order 285. But that is not the point that I desire to take in relation to this matter. I wish rather to know the position that the Prime Minister himself occupies in this connexion. He has done much more than has the honorable member for Ballarat. He has gone round the country telling the people that he can practically command your vote, sir. </para>

If you do not, I have done with the matter. </para>

In the circumstances, therefore, it seems to me that he has opened up a debate arising out of a matter of privilege in which I, as  Speaker,  have no power to intervene. </para>

          <para>A much milder offence than this - directed against the  Speaker  by a member at a public meeting, was informally brought before the House by a question addressed to the chair. The  Speaker,  in his reply, explained the nature of the offence which had thus been committed against the House by the member&#39;s conduct towards the Speaker; and the member made, in consequence, an apology in terms that averted the consequences of the offence. Subsequently, however, the same member published in a newspaper a letter which contained a repetition of the same offence against the  Speaker.  The House thereupon, having heard the member in his place, resolved that the letter was a gross libel upon <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> deserving the severest condemnation of the House, and that the honorable member be suspended from the service of the House for the remainder of the session, or for one calendar month, whichever should first terminate. </para>

              <para>- The standing order requires that when a member rises to a point of order, the  Speaker  shall give a decision. It is true that, in practice, a debate has sometimes been allowed if the  Speaker  has not made up his mind, but not when he is prepared to give a decision. I wish to point out a misconception which I think exists in the mind of the Prime Minister in regard to what he actually did. When he rose he said, &#34; I want to direct your attention &#34; to certain things. I asked the honorable member then whether he desired to raise a matter of privilege. At that moment several members were interjecting, and there was, as usual, unfortunately, some confusion. The Prime Minister later said, &#34; I propose to direct your attention &#34; to something in a paper. I asked the honorable gentleman once or twice whether he proposed to ask a question or raise a matter of privilege, and he distinctly stated that he desired to raise a question of privilege. I had already noticed what had appeared in the papers, and I was familiar with the proceedings under such conditions; and it was my intention, had he put a question, to have asked the honorable member for Ballarat whether he had stated what was attributed to him. But the Prime Minister is mistaken, or I am - I am not sure -which, but one of us is mistaken - as to whether or not he asked a question. According to my memory, he did not ask a question affecting privilege, but raised a matter of privilege by directing my attention to some reflection on myself. In this case, may </para>

              <para>- I had some doubt in my mind at the moment in giving my ruling, which, as I stated, I gave with some hesitation at that time; but it seems to me that the whole trouble has arisen from a wrong procedure in the beginning, or, at least, from what I believe to have been a wrong procedure. If this matter had been Drought up in the form of a question to the  Speaker,  everything would have been perfectly in order, but it was not brought forward in that way, according to my memory. The attention of the  Speaker  was directed to something that had appeared in the papers, and this was done as a matter of privilege. The only point, however, to decide now is whether this is a question of &#34; privilege suddenly arising,&#34; as provided in standing order 283. I do not know that this is a matter of privilege that has suddenly arisen, but it is certainly a matter of privilege in regard to which this is the first opportunity any honorable member has had of bringing it under the notice of this House. But the proper procedure was to bring it under the notice of the House by a question addressed to the  Speaker. </para>

            <para>- So far as this debate is concerned, yes. I pointed out that the debate is irregular. I think it would be irregular in any case. There must be some sort of motion before the House, because standing order 284 provides that- </para>

          <para>Before a point of order can be decided, it must be stated, and before a question of privilege can be decided, a substantive motion must be submitted for the decision of the House. In this case, it has not been done, nor, in the circumstances, at this stage, unless a motion is made, can the matter be decided. Before a motion of that kind can be moved, an opportunity must be given to the honorable member for Ballarat to have his attention called to the matter, and to be heard. </para>

              <para>- I submit, as a point of order, that an altogether irregular matter, brought up in an irregular way, cannot become a matter on which any honorable member can be interrogated. Before any interrogation can be put te any honorable member, there must be something regularly before the House. I submit, therefore, that you cannot proceed in the matter until you have something regular before you, in accordance with the Standing Orders and proceedings of the House. </para>

              <para>- The Prime Minister certainly did conclude, at a later stage, by asking me what I proposed to do in the circumstances. The more correct form would have been for him to ask me if my attention had been directed to the report, rather than to make a statement directing my attention to it ; but that is only a difference of form . I will now answer the Prime Minister&#39;s question about what I propose to do. My attention having been directed to a report of an alleged speech by the honorable member for Ballarat appearing in the newspapers this morning, I ask the honorable member if he has been correctly reported ? </para>

            <para>An accusation of partiality in the administration of the closure, directed against the  Speaker  by a member at a public meeting, was informally brought before the House by a question addressed to the Chair. The  Speaker,  in his reply, explained the nature of the offence which had thus been committed against the House by the member&#39;s conduct towards the Speaker; and the member made, in consequence, an apology in terms that averted the consequences of the offence. Subsequently, however, the same member published in a newspaper a letter which contained a repetition of the same offence against the  Speaker.  The House thereupon, having heard the member in his place, resolved that the letter was a gross libel upon <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> deserving the severest condemnation of the House, and that the member be suspended from the service of the House for the remainder of the session, or for one calendar month, whichever should first terminate. </para>

              <para>- In regard to the point of order involved in the honorable member&#39;s statement, I point out that standing order 285 refers to statements made in newspapers, that is to say, statements made by the newspapers on their own authority. This is a different matter altogether. We are dealing with a report of something which the honorable member for Ballarat is alleged to have said at a public meeting. In accordance with the practice of the House of Commons, I now ask him whether he is correctly reported as having made the statements attributed to him in the newspapers. </para>

              <para>- T point out to the honorable member for Ballarat that if he did make the statements attributed to him at a public meeting-, he has been guilty of a gross abuse of the privileges of the House. No honorable member is entitled at a public meeting to reflect upon the House as a whole by making charges of the kind he is alleged to have made against the  Speaker  in the newspaper report which has been referred to. An honorable member who does so, commits a grave breach of the privileges of the House, which the House is entitled to take action upon if it so desires. I do not know whether the honorable member did make the statements attributed to him; but if he did, may I draw his attention to the fact that all fair-minded people, and all persons possessed of any sense of decency, will estimate at its true value any charge made against a public man, who, owing to the position he occupies, has his hands tied behind his back, and is not able to reply in the same way. I ask the honorable member, therefore, again, in his own interests, to say whether or not he did make the statements attributed to him. </para>

              <para>- I rise to a point of order, and you, sir, have a right to ask an apology from the Prime Minister for proceeding with the reading of his motion after I had risen. My point is that the Prime Minister can move a motion only by leave of the House. He could move a motion on a question of privilege, but he has not said that he moved this motion as one of privilege. He moved it without making any statement of the kind. Unless he moves on a question of privilege, the motion cannot be dealt with now. Let him do the right thing. He first said that the matter to which he drew attention was one of privilege, and then he denied that it was. Now he is trying to take action in some other way. Unless he moves as on a question of privilege, the motion must be out of order. </para>

The Prime Minister has practically told the House that this is not a question of privilege, and therefore cannot move his motion without notice if he says that it is not a question of privilege- </para>

That is what I am trying to get honorable members to understand, but I am not allowed to state a question without being interrupted, and there are jeers when I complete my interrupted sentences. The Prime Minister asked a question affecting the privileges of the House, and any action that lie has taken by way of a motion must have been taken on a question of privilege. If it were otherwise, the motion could not be received. The motion is one affecting the privileges of the House, as it has arisen out of a question of privilege. It is therefore in order.

              <para>- I submit that the onus of proof rests on the accusing party, and not on the defendant. Before the Government take drastic action, I appeal to honorable members who have any sense of fair play in their composition, whether any evidence has been adduced today to warrant this motion, especially in view of the Speaker&#39;s statement that he was perfectly satisfied with the explanation made. He merely warned honorable members against uttering such things as had been alleged, but not proved. Are they, in such circumstances, going to vote to suspend a representative of the people from the service of the House for the rest of the session? Let the Prime Minister, if he desires to take action, comply with the Standing Orders. Let the Government make a statement, produce evidence from the newspapers, and give the name of the editor and the printer, and then the matter can be dealt with at a later period. But to ask us to suspend a member without producing a scintilla of evidence in justification of the motion, is bordering on the ridiculous. I take it that justice has not yet forsaken the Chamber. </para>

              <para>- Order ! Will honorable members on both sides maintain silence? It is not for the  Speaker  to say whether the House shall take action or not. The  Speaker  may express his own view on the matter, and his own personal feeling, and the hope that the House will not take further action; but he cannot prevent the House taking action if it so desires. I did not direct the  Clerk  to read the statements, because I thought that the matter probably would be allowed to drop. Out of consideration for the honorable member for Ballarat, I preferred personally to take that course. The Prime Minister, however, has intimated that he, being in charge of the business of the House, is not prepared to let the matter go at that; and I have no power to prevent him from moving a motion; but, before it is submitted, I will direct the  Clerk  to read the report in the newspaper, and again ask the honorable member for Ballarat the question which I put to him. </para>

        <para class="block">Ballarat, Monday. - Speaking in the Australian Workers&#39; Union Hall last night, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McGrath,</inline> M.H.R. (Labour), said that it was probable that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas&#39;</inline> motion that the  Speaker  no longer possessed the confidence of the House would not be allowed to come on for discussion, as the Government had the ordering of the business-sheet. Therefore, he wanted to say what he would not be allowed to say on the floor of the House.. The  Speaker  had lost the confidence of members. There was good reason for the motion. &#34; We have,&#34; he added, &#34; absolute proof that the  Speaker  has deliberately altered a &#39; Hansard &#39; proof. The proof showed that the third reading of the Loan Bill was not carried, according to his own words, and he altered the pro of to make it appear in  Hansard that it was carried.&#34; The  Speaker  was acting in a biased manner, and was proving himself a bitter partisan. </para>

              <para>- On a point of order, sir, I understood that, at the suggestion of the Prime Minister, you ordered the  Clerk  to read the report for the information of the honorable member whose conduct is impugned, and that you were about to ask the honorable member whether the report correctly represents what he said. I submit that, until that is done, the debate cannot properly go on. </para>

              <para>- I had previously asked the honorable member for Ballarat whether the report in the newspaper was true, and he indicated that he could not say whether it was true or not until he had seen it. The point of order is quite correct. Instead of calling on the honorable member for Gwydir, I should have again asked the honorable member for Ballarat that question. I now ask him again if the report in the newspaper, as read by the  Clerk,  is correct ? </para>

              <para>- Order ! The question I asked the honorable member for Ballarat was in accordance with the practice adopted in the House of Commons in similar cases, and I read distinctly the procedure followed there. It is a matter of courtesy to an honorable member to give him an opportunity of offering an explanation or making a retraction or an apology before action is taken. I accorded to the honorable member for Ballarat an opportunity; he has not availed himself of it, but has walked out of the chamber. </para>

              <para>- When I was interrupted by the Attorney-General, I was just about to remark that the whole position hinges upon the truthfulness, or untruthfulness, of the statements which are alleged to have been made by the honorable member for Ballarat. If, after proper investigation, the statements reported to have been made by him in the newspapers prove to be untrue - seeing that they reflect on your honour, sir, and upon the dignity of this House - we shall then have something like a basis upon which to ground a just decision. But if, after proper inquiry, those statements are proved to be true, if it be established that the things which are alleged to have been done have actually been done, it would be a travesty of justice to call upon the honorable member to withdraw and apologize. If it can be proved from the records of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> that the statements attributed to the honorable member are true, it is plain that he had justification for them. Before any action is taken by this House, I submit that a thorough investigation should be made, and <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> should be called upon to produce its proofs, in order that we may see whether the honorable member - if he did make the statements credited to him - had any ground for doing so.

              <para>- I wish it to be clearly understood that honorable members upon this side of the Chamber are quite as jealous of the rights and privileges of members of the House, and of the dignity of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> as are honorable members opposite. Unless due regard be paid to those rights and privileges, no Parliament could exist with any decency or respect for itself. But I object to the Prime Minister attempting to get this House to pronounce judgment upon insufficient evidence. I do not think that there is an honorable member opposite who, if he were a member of a jury, would convict any prisoner in the dock upon evidence such as that upon which we are asked to convict the honorable member for Ballarat. If all that is required to procure the conviction of an honorable member is the publication of a statement in a newspaper, I say that this House will be acting in flagrant opposition to the basic principles of British justice. You, sir, showed almost from the beginning of these proceedings that you are not in any way malicious or revengeful, because you held out the olive branch, and said, in effect, that the matter having reached a certain stage, you hoped that it would not be proceeded with further. You affirmed that, on account of the honorable member for Ballarat being a new member, and probably unfamiliar with our procedure, some leniency should be shown to him. But what do we find the Prime Minister doing? In that revengeful mood which has characterized his actions so much during this session, and with a desire to reduce the number of members upon this side of the House - by methods which are not creditable to him - he has sought to reduce the minority against him by tactics- </para>

The effect of the action of the Prime Minister will be to diminish the numbers upon this side of the House, and thus secure what he probably could not secure in the ordinary constitutional way.

              <para>- I withdraw it. I was going to say that the action of the Government, in this instance, will do them very little credit in the minds of decent people. When the electors learn that, by these means, they are seeking to thwart the representation by honorable members upon this side of the chamber, with a view to augmenting their own majority, they will visit them with condign punishment. An attempt is being made to impeach the honorable member for Ballarat for some statements which have been published in the newspapers. Surely the honorable member has a right to prove his case ? I ask the Attorney-General whether, if he were a barrister representing a prisoner, he would allow that prisoner to be  convicted  upon such flimsy evidence? Would he ever dream of permitting a prisoner to go from the dock to gaol upon the kind of proof that has been adduced here? </para>

              <para>- Whilst resting, I have been thinking of the manner in which this question of privilege has been engineered by the Prime Minister. The honorable gentleman rose, first of all, to ask a question, but was informed that an honorable member, as we have frequently been told by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> is not in order in asking a question referring to a newspaper report. He was then asked whether he proposed to raise the matter as a question of privilege, and he agreed to do so. But, having got in what he had to say, he did not conclude his statement, as the standing order requires, by submitting a motion. Subsequently, when the matter was debated, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> said that he understood the Prime Minister rose, not to ask a question, but to raise a question of privilege. The Prime Minister then reiterated his statement that he had raised it in the form of a question, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> had ultimately to take his assurance that he had not done what we knew he had done, and done more than once. </para>

              <para>- You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> had to take the Prime Minister&#39;s assurance as to what he had done. The honorable gentleman raised the question as a matter of privilege, and it had ceased to exist when you, sir, advised the House to let it drop. It was then resurrected without any definite motion or question of privilege being submitted. It was resurrected as a new matter having nothing to do with the question of privilege. It was brought before us by the submission of a bald motion, whereby the Prime Minister sought to expel from this House a certain honorable member for a limited or an unlimited period, as the case may be. The whole procedure has stamped upon its face something more than fair play or justice to honorable members. It does not bear the imprint of conduct such as we have a right to expect from a man holding the high and honorable position of Prime Minister of the Commonwealth. The Attorney-General now tells me that he will explain why we should convict the honorable member for Ballarat on the meagre evidence that has been put against him. </para>

The charge that has been made is one which, if true, cannot well be minimized.

I do not think any honorable member will dispute that on its face it is not only libellous, but a gross breach of the privileges of this House, as well as of the  Speaker.  Then there are the other words accusing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> of being a bitter partisan. They are strong enough to be characterized in any way honorable members please. But the gravamen of the charge, as I put it, is that some one who presides over this House is said to have deliberately and fraudulently altered a <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> proof. </para>

              <para>- But the word used by the honorable member was &#34; wilfully.&#34; I hold that no term but &#34; fraud,&#34; and &#34;the grossest fraud,&#34; could describe such an action if the accusation were true. No House, not to speak of any Government, could pass by such a statement and retain its self-respect for a moment. I invite honorable members to consider what was done in the House of Commons in a case which does not appear to me to have been as strong as this is. We are told in <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> that there was an accusation of partiality in the administration of the closure levelled against the  Speaker  of the day. That was serious enough in itself. But in this case we have that accusation - the accusation of being a bitter partisan in the application of the closure - made against the  Speaker,  and added to it a statement of gross misrepresentation of the proceedings of the House on his part. What was done in the minor case in the British House of Commons to which I have referred ? We are told that the honorable member concerned was called upon to make a statement in the ordinary way from his place in the House, but that in the meantime he had made an apology which averted the consequences of the offence - </para>

          <para class="block">I shall refer in a moment to the matter of procedure and proof. Having heard the member, what did the House of Commons do? Did it give him a further opportunity to withdraw and apologize or to retract the language that he had used ? Did it do as does this motion, which gives the honorable member an opportunity at any moment, after it is passed, to reinstate himself in the House by withdrawing and apologizing ? Nothing of the kind. The House of Commons vindicated its own honour by declaring that the member should be suspended for the remainder of the session, or for one calendar month. </para>

              <para>- The House of Commons has never sought for evidence of the character which is produced in a court of law - that is, evidence on affidavit or from witnesses called - except in the case of inquiries on private Bills, where there is a Committee authorized for the particular purpose of taking evidence to determine certain facts. What is the practice that has always been adopted in regard to proof ? Of course, if the honorable member for Ballarat says that the words were uttered, but they are true, we shall know how to deal with him. Honorable members say that there is no proof that the words were uttered; but the practice which we are following here is that which has always been adopted by the House of Commons, whose practice we are not only allowed, but directed by the Standing Orders to adopt in cases for which our own Standing Orders do not provide. The practice is that laid down by <inline font-style="italic">May,</inline> and it does not require, in any case, evidence on oath to be given in the House, either by  affidavit or otherwise, in support of any statement made. What is done in all cases of contempt is to call on the person who hae committed the contempt to appear at the bar of the House, if he is not a member, or to call upon him, if he is a member, in his place to admit or deny the allegation made against him. <inline font-style="italic">May,</inline> 11th edition, page 89, after dealing with various matters in regard to privilege, says - </para>

            <para>It is the present practice, when a complaint is made, to order the person complained of to attend the House, and, on his appearance at the bar, or, if a member, in his place, he is examined and dealt with according as the explanations of his conduct are satisfactory or otherwise ; or as the contrition expressed by him for his offence conciliates the displeasure of the House. </para>

          <para>That has been the practice, and the only practice, in these matters which can be found to have been adopted, and any other course is impracticable. What has been done here? The  Speaker  has had read a report from one newspaper, and two other newspaper reports have been read by myself, and these, though not identical in language, are identical in substance, in representing the honorable member for Ballarat to have made this extremely defamatory and libellous statement. The honorable member has himself been called upon to say &#34; yes &#34; or &#34; no &#34; as to the accuracy of the report, and he has declined to do so. In thus declining, he has left the House to form its own estimate, which it must form, as to the truth of the report. </para>

          <para class="block">Those quoted words were not in the original <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> proof, but were added; and I criticised the position very severely, as I claim I had a perfect right to do, in view of the refusal to permit us to discuss it in Parliament, and of the fact that the motion of the honorable member for Barrier has been put lowest down on the business-paper. It was not a matter of going outside and criticising a gentleman whose hands, as the  Speaker  said, are tied. I tried to criticise the position in this Chamber, but I was denied the opportunity of dealing with the motion of which the honorable member for Barrier had given notice. I dealt with the statements made, but, as to my exact words, I have not much recollection. I say, however, that neither the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> nor the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> had a reporter present, and, therefore, neither newspaper could know what I said. </para>

              <para>- The position is, that, after I had stated the motion to the House, the Prime &#39;Minister asked me for the notice of motion, saying that he had made a mistake in mentioning October instead of November. The honorable gentleman made the correction, and I intended at that moment to draw the attention of the House to it, but the honorable member for Wide Bay asked to see the motion, and I handed it to him. Under these circumstances, the matter temporarily escaped my memory until I happened to overhear a question bearing on the matter. And then I remembered that it had been altered. In the circumstances, when a motion has once been stated from the Chair, any alteration made in it should be made with the consent of the House. Of course, any honorable member may move to amend it. </para>

              <para>- I think it has been the practice of the House. At any rate, it seems to me that a very peculiar position could arise if, after a motion has been stated to the House, and the House 13 in possession of it, the honorable member moving it could make material alterations that might altogether alter the character of the motion. If an alteration is made in one case without the consent of the House, then in every case alterations could be made, and a motion, when put from the Chair after debate, might be entirely different from that submitted from the Chair at the outset. </para>

              <para>- Time after time it has been pointed out in the Chamber that those who produce newspaper clippings, or anything of the kind, must vouch for the accuracy of the reports they produce. I am not troubling much about that particular point, but I ask where a position like the present will lead us if those who produce these reports are not asked for any evidence or proof? It simply means that if this practice is permitted to develop, the majority may expel, one after another, the whole of the minority. The old order of procedure has been entirely reversed; the practice has been entirely altered. It was the practice laid down that before any one could propose to act in the direction now suggested, they must furnish evidence of the accuracy of the reports they produced, but here to-day no one is asked to furnish the least proof of the accuracy of the statements contained in these newspaper clippings. Simply on the basis of a newspaper report, and without producing any evidence whatsoever of its truth, it is proposed to take certain action against an honorable member in this Chamber. There never has been a time in the history of this Parliament when, acting upon newspaper assertions, half the members of this House could not have been expelled in the same way. </para>

              <para>- The Attorney-General has referred to the practice of the House of Commons. I venture to say that he cannot produce any authority to show that this power has ever been exercised in the House of Commons, except during a most corrupt period in its history. Certainly it has never been exercised in normal times and under normal conditions. The honorable member for Ballarat has not covered himself by the privileges of Parliament in order to defame any person; but he mounted a platform and made a clear and definite statement, which the Attorney-General says is defamatory and libellous. If it be defamatory and libellous, then the  Speaker,  or any honorable member inside the Chamber or outside, can have recourse to the Courts of the country to secure a proper remedy. It is because they do not believe that the courts of law can provide a remedy, because they are not too sure that there is anything defamatory or libellous in the matter, that they take action in the Chamber. In fact, they seek a remedy here because they think they cannot secure it in the courts of the country. The honorable member for West Sydney asked the Attorney-General what proof Ministers had, and what it was upon which they hinged their action. The reply was that it was in connexion with the accusation that the  Speaker  had altered the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report. The Attorney-General also said -o that the honorable member for Ballarat should not have said anything against the  Speaker  unless he was sure of his ground, that the honorable member ought to have had some facts or evidence before saying anything against the integrity of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline> Yet here the Attorney-General has the audacity to take action against the honorable member for Ballarat without a tittle of evidence. All they do is to take a newspaper report and present it to the honorable member for Ballarat, and ask him to say &#34;yes&#34; or &#34; no &#34; as to its accuracy. Why ask him to say &#34;yes&#34; or &#34;no&#34;? If they are sure of their ground - if they are sure that the honorable member for Ballarat has committed some offence against the privileges of the Chamber, why the need to ask him such a question? But they ask him the question because they propose that he should become his own executioner, and give them some justification for their action. Their only reason for asking him the question was that they might get some assurance for the action they proposed to take, and which they would take against every member of the Opposition on the slightest provocation. It is not the dignity, nor the honour, nor the privileges of this Chamber that they propose to uphold; it is their majority they seek to maintain. What would have been thought of us, sitting on those benches during the last Parliament, if we had seized on newspaper reports and taken the utterances of the honorable member for Parramatta and others - if we had - abused the power and authority with which we were invested by the votes of the people of the country, and had accused honorable members of the then Opposition, one by one, on questions of privilege, and expelled them from the Chamber without the slightest tittle of evidence or truth, simply acting on some newspaper reports - in which they were alleged to have said something which was an attack on the privileges of the House ? Why, the whole country would have howled with indignation. I do not blame honorable members on the Government side, but their good sense and good taste must be in revolt against this proceeding. We have in the Chamber to-day what we had ten years ago, a resurrection of that spirit of hostility, coercion, subjection, and tyranny that, once invested with power, will brook no opposition. To honorable members sitting behind the Government I say, &#39;&#39; Beware ! We live only for a day. The tables may be turned, and you may find that to-day you are utilizing a weapon that may be to-morrow utilized to the injury of every member of the Chamber.&#34; I hope the honorable member for Ballarat will stand solidly to his position, and that he will be charged distinctly on evidence. I hope that before he is expelled from his position as a member of the Chamber we shall know upon what evidence that action is taken. I appeal to honorable members sitting behind the Government not to let passion and prejudice carry them away. I say to them, &#34; Be very careful that you do not commence a course that, from Parliament to Parliament, will be injurious to ourselves as individuals, and injurious to the best interests of this country.&#34; </para>

            <para>.- After listening to the violent tirade of the honorable member for Bourke, I think a reply should be made to him. It appears to me the honorable member has threatened us on this side of the House, and has said that we should not record&#34; our votes in favour of what we think proper to maintain the dignity and honour of Parliament. </para>

              <para>- Certainly I withdraw it if the honorable member for Bourke did not intend to threaten honorable members on this side. I accept his assurance that he did not. Members on this side should maintain the dignity and traditions of the House in every way, and we resent such charges as were made against us by the honorable member for Bourke, dancing about the floor as he has been for the last few minutes. The honorable member made the most extraordinary statements that I have ever listened to. He asked why the Attorney-General suggested that the honorable member for Ballarat should be asked if the statements were correct. I take it that, in all fairness to the honorable member for Ballarat, the honorable member should be asked if he did, or did not, make the statements. He should not shelter himself in the way that he did. He said that, so far as he knew, there were no reporters of the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> or <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> present. What does it matter to this House whether there were reporters present or not ? If the honorable member for Ballarat made these statements believing there were no reporters present, and thinking that they would not come back to the House, his conduct is all the more reprehensible. The whole question is, &#34; Did he make those statements, or did he not?&#34; I hear the honorable member for Bendigo interject that there is no proof. I have been waiting with some interest on this very important question - the procedure and practice on which in the House of Commons has been put before the House by the Attorney-General - for the legal lore of the honorable member for Bendigo to assist the House; but all that he has, so far, contributed to the debate is an interjection which is not of much use to us. The honorable member for Bourke said that members on this side were dragooned into supporting the Government in this matter. He asked why the question was put to the honorable member for Ballarat.  It  is put to him, following the procedure of the House of Commons, and it is only a fair thing that it should be put to him, in order that he may have an opportunity of saying whether the report is correct or not. In his remarks, and the honorable member for Bourke has confirmed it, the honorable member for Ballarat said he did make certain statements. Apparently, the honorable member for Ballarat was speaking so wildly the other night that he did not know what statements he made, and now, when he is charged in this House, he will neither father them nor deny them. </para>

              <para>- I can hardly expect the honorable member for Cook to be  a  man at any time. The honorable member for Ballarat does not seem to know, judging by the statements he has made to the House to-day, what he said at Ballarat the other night. If he believes that the report is substantially correct, let him tell the House so; if he does not agree with the statements as reported, then his plain duty is to tell the House that he does not approve of them, and that he did not intend to reflect on the  Speaker.  As a matter of fact, I think that, in this case, the ordinary legal proof is not required. The honorable member has an opportunity of saying whether the statements which he is charged with making are correct or not. If they are correct, then the House knows how to deal  with them. If they are not correct, let the honorable member say so, and that will be the end of them. </para>

            <para>.- It is distinctly refreshing  to hear the honorable member for Indi, who, I understand, is a member of the legal profession, assert that, in a case of such magnitude and importance, involving the question of whether an honorable member shall or shall not sit in this Chamber, and represent his constituents, as they desired that he should, when they elected him, legal proof is not necessary before we eject that member from the Chamber. Really, one is astounded to find that that honorable member, despite his knowledge of the law, is prepared, without proof, to vote with the Government to turn a member of this Chamber out of it, and refuse to allow him to represent his constituents. How would you cauterize such conduct, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> were you on the floor of the House ! I venture to believe that your sarcastic reference to the honorable member would be such as to make him curl and hide himself for ever and a day. May I remind the honorable member, who seeks now to prove another honorable member guilty upon a newspaper report, that only a few weeks ago it was my privilege to draw attention to a report that appeared in the Wangaratta newspaper, in which the honorable member himself was reported to have grossly misrepresented the Labour party, notwithstanding that he had the proof to the contrary in his hand at the time. When I brought this forward and read it, the honorable member said he would neither deny nor acknowledge it. He sat in his seat over there and said,  &#39; You have the newspaper, consequently you are responsible for bringing it forward; you can give the proof,&#34; meaning that if proof could not be given other than such as appeared in the newspaper, he consequently could not be deemed to be guilty. The honorable member now speaks about traditions, and honour, and dignity, but when he was indicted for a gross misrepresentation he refused to allow a report in a newspaper to convict him. Why, then, does he now allow a report in a newspaper to convict an honorable member on this side of the House ? Surely that is a fair proposition to put to him ? No doubt his little outburst was congenial to himself, but if he demands that a newspaper shall not convict himself, he is guilty of something underhand if he wants to convict another member on like evidence. Let me remind the House that it is a most serious thing to eject a member from this Chamber, because by doing so you tell 16,000 <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> electors of the Commonwealth that they shall not for the time being be represented here. You are, therefore, doing more than merely ejecting a member; you are practically insulting a whole constituency. I ask that this shall not be done for party motives, merely that one side or the other may have a greater majority than it has at present. I ask that before it is done they shall bring such proof as will be reasonable in the minds of every <inline font-style="italic">bond -fide</inline> citizen, such proof as can be substantiated here, and also satisfy the court of public opinion. If we wait for that to be done, it seems to me that the honorable member will not be ejected. I heard an outburst from the honorable member for Indi about the honour, and dignity, and traditions of this Chamber. Let me tell the honorable member what the traditions of the last three years were, when the Labour party had a substantial majority in both branches of the Legislature. We allowed every member of the Opposition the full and free right of speech. We allowed every member to properly represent his constituency, and to give utterance to what he conscientiously believed was right. On no occasion did we seek to close the mouth of any honorable member, no matter what advantage he was taking, in our opinion, of the Standing Orders. Those were the traditions of the last three years, notwithstanding the majority we had in both branches of the Legislature, and we were successful in that period in passing much legislation of national importance. If honorable members have any regard for the traditions of the House, it would be well for them to give the Opposition an opportunity to speak as they think fit, so long as they obey the Standing Orders. The Attorney-General occupies an extraordinary position. He has brought forward the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper to prove that something was said by the honorable member for Ballarat. </para>

              <para>- I am dealing with the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> for the moment. During the current session, and only a few weeks ago, the Attorney-General submitted a copy of the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper, and characterized  it as &#34;a mendacious liar.&#34; Nothing could be more stinging or cutting than the words which the honorable gentleman used to describe the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> when it suited him. It was, at the time I refer to, a mendacious liar, but now that it suits him to think otherwise it is a paper on the strength of a report in which he &#171; is prepared to turn a member out of this Chamber. An honorable member on the other side is not guilty because of a report in a newspaper, and an honorable member on this side is guilty because of a report in the same newspaper. The <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> is a mendacious liar when it refers to the Attorney-General, but to-day a report in that newspaper apparently justifies the honorable gentleman in an effort to expel an honorable member from this Chamber. Could we have greater inconsistency? To submit a report appearing in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> or any other newspaper as a sufficient justification for turning a member out of this Chamber is going to an extreme which I am confident the people of this country will not submit to when they properly understand the position. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member has been prejudged. We point out to honorable members opposite that they are unable to prove the honorable member guilty, and then, with charming innocence, they actually ask the honorable member to himself say that he is guilty. If he were to cry, &#34;Yes, I am guilty,&#34; then they would punish him, if they could, or force from him some abject apology. Before he has had an opportunity to explain, and in the face of the admission of honorable members on the other side that they have no proof of his guilt, the Government submit a motion which may result in his removal from this Chamber. In the case quoted from the  proceedings of the House of Commons, the offending member was remove&#39;d only after he had repeated his offence, and after he had actually written the offensive words. He did not say them in the heat of debate, and they were not due to the excitement of the moment when a man is making a big speech to his constituents. The member in question sat down calmly in his office, or  somewhere else, and wrote out, and published, his offence in the newspapers. You, sir, and honorable members opposite, know well, but, unfortunately, the public of Australia do not know, that, even after the offending member of the House of Commons had repeated his offence in the way stated, he was again given an opportunity to explain his conduct. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member has been prejudged. He has been adjudged guilty before he has been allowed to speak, and without an atom of proof other than a reference to a statement appearing in a newspaper, which has been characterized by the Attorney-General as a mendacious liar. The honorable member is to be removed if he does not favour honorable members on the opposite side with an abject apology. Let us consider the course which was followed in the House of Commons in the case which has been quoted. It appears that an accusation of partiality in the administration of the closure was directed against the  Speaker  by a member of the House of Commons. </para>

              <para>- Apparently, in 1904, there was a case of a somewhat similar nature. In the case dealt with by the Attorney-General, and on which the Government base their action, an honorable member had accused the  Speaker  of the House of Commons of partiality in administering the closure.  His  offence was brought before the House; the  Speaker  explained the nature of the offence which had been committed against the House and the offending member made an apology in terms which averted the con sequences of his offence. He was evidently given an opportunity of speaking and of saying whether he had or had not been guilty of the offence. He must have admitted that he was guilty in some way or another, and, subsequently apologizing, escaped the consequences of his offence. But the question of his suspension arose afterwards, when, after making his apology to the House, he repeated his offence in a letter to the party press. Here, before the honorable member for Ballarat admits that he has said anything, and before he is given an opportunity to discuss the matter in any way whatever, a resolution is submitted for his expulsion for the session. </para>

              <para>- Having heard the member in his place, and the member having, evidently, acknowledged the repetition of the offence, and having refused to apologize in any way, the House of Commons then, and only then, proceeded to take the action which has been referred to. Is this House justified in taking the action now proposed on the first occasion, and without proof of any description? The reference to <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> seems to have been hurriedly read, and the procedure overlooked, when it is claimed that the case referred to was on all fours with the case that has arisen here. In the case referred to punishment was only meted out to the offending member when he had offended a second time, and had cheerfully acknowledged his offence. There is no acknowledgment of offence on the part of the honorable member for Ballarat. As a matter of fact, the honorable member has not had a full opportunity to say whether the reports of his speech appearing in the newspapers are correct or otherwise. </para>

              <para>- Is number 1, 2, 3, or 4 to be relied upon, and are any of them true ? Suppose an honorable member feels in his heart that he has some justification for making statements, we have not to consider the particular words used, because he might have conveyed precisely the same meaning in different words. Each man chooses the words&#39; with which he is most familiar, and does not necessarily use them with a complete knowledge of their finer meaning. What may appear to some a comparatively mild statement may appear to others as being very pointed. Let us look at this question from the point of view, not of numbers, but of justice. This is the first statement in the report which forms the basis of the charges laid against the honorable member for Ballarat - </para>

              <para>- That is not so. Had he been allowed to speak to the motion of which notice was given, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> does not possess the confidence of the House, he would have been able to say things reflecting on the  Speaker.  In discussing that motion, he could have made statements which could not be made in the ordinary course of debate. As to the remarks made at Ballarat - supposing the report to be correct - the honorable member made them when smarting under a sense of injustice, because his rights and privileges as a member had been taken from him by an unprecedented use of the Standing Orders. To continue the quotation from the report - </para>

            <para>There was good reason for the motion, namely, that the  Speaker  had lost the confidence of members. We have absolute proof that the  Speaker  has deliberately altered a <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> proof. The proof showed that the third reading of the Loan Bill was not carried, according to his&#39; own words, and he altered the proof to make it appear in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> that it was carried. </para>

          <para>That is the charge reported to have been made against the  Speaker  by the honorable member for Ballarat, to which the Attorney-General has added the word &#34;fraudulent.&#34; If the right of free Speech was recognised in this Chamber, and if there was opportunity to discuss the motion of want of confidence in the  Speaker,  of which notice has been given, might it not have been possible for the honorable member for Ballarat to bring proof of his assertion, and would honorable members say, if he proved it to the hilt, that he should be removed from the Chamber for having made it? Are they going to take the responsibility of removing from the Chamber a man who proves to the hilt a charge that he has made ? Honorable members opposite will dare a great deal in their sudden and temporary accession to power, but I doubt whether they will go so far as to say that a member should be removed when he proves to the hilt a charge that he has made. The Attorney-General presupposes that there is no proof, and is consequently prepared to condemn the honorable member, but we have the clearest proof that the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker&#39;s</inline> remarks concerning the third reading of the Loan Bill was added to by someone. And the addition gives to the report a complexion differing from that which it would otherwise have had. Under these circumstances, are honorable members prepared to vote for the suspension of the honorable member for Ballarat? Let them compare the original report as transcribed, not by the representatives of party newspapers, but by the official reporters, who have no party to serve, and no ends to gain in this matter, with the report that was allowed to go forth to the public. If they do so, they will find that words were added to the remarks of the  Speaker,  and that those words give a different complexion to the report. </para>

              <para>- When the House adjourned for dinner, I was endeavouring to deal with that phase of the motion which necessitates the bringing forward of proof, my contention being that honorable gentlemen on the Ministerial side will not be justified in voting for a motion which is based on a newspaper report, of whose accuracy they have absolutely no proof. I take it, at present, that honorable gentlemen are desirous of being fair. I take it that they will not lightly throw an honorable member out of his place ; that they will not lightly disfranchise the Ballarat constituency; and I take it that, in general, they will agree that the representatives of constituencies should be given the right of expressing their opinions to their electors, even though, in doing so, they should come near to dealing with the  Speaker  himself in that capacity. It would be a serious matter if the conduct of the  Speaker,  being such as even a majority of the House desired, the minority were not to be permitted to express their opinion in respect thereof. I quite agree that it would not suffice for any honorable member to go outside the Chamber, and make serious reflections on the conduct of the  Speaker,  or even on that of honorable members, without notice being taken of his statements. At the same time, honorable members will not desire that the right ot criticism, fair and reasonable, and the right of expressing an opinion in keeping with conscientious beliefs, shall be denied. For that, indeed, would be creating a serious situation, and curtailing a liberty which Australians in the past have prided themselves upon. T submit respectfully, that it would be going much farther than the constituencies in general would really desire. For, if I understand my fellow countrymen aright, they will maintain, at all costs, the right of free speech; and the right of any of their representatives to express in public the views that he honestly holds. </para>

              <para>- And it will not suffice for even this House, with all its traditions and all its powers and privileges, to take that right away from any citizen. I was contending that this motion must turn on the question of whether there was any justification for the honorable member for Ballarat using expressions of the character he is reported to have used. I take the interjection of the honorable member for Hume as indicating his trend of thought - that if the statements alleged to have been made by the honorable member for Ballarat are true, or substantially true, then there was justification for the making of them. I ask the Attorney-General, I ask honorable members on the other side who have not yet made up their minds, whether, if those statements are substantially true, it must not follow, in keeping with the interjection made just now, that the honorable member for Ballarat had justification for making them. If he was justified in using those expressions, will honorable members be justified in removing him from the Chamber? Will they be justified in depriving his constituents of his services here, and depriving him of the right of criticising what is going on in connexion with the affairs of the country? Before we adjourned for dinner, I said that, as regards the first part of his alleged remarks, which read as follows, </para>

              <para>- Because the Government had practically said to him, &#34;You shall not discuss the motion,&#34; for they have put it at the bottom of the business-paper. Every honorable member conversant with the ordinary procedure of Parliament knows that the placing of a motion there means that the Government did not intend the honorable member to discuss it. Consequently, having been prevented from discussing it here, where he should have been given the right to discuss it, and in the proper place, he had some justification, I put it to the honorable member for Hume, in taking the complaint to his constituents - to his masters. </para>

When the present question was raised, the newspaper report was not read, although it was a matter affecting the privileges of the House; but, subsequently, after a motion was moved, I directed the  Clerk  to read the words on which the motion before the House was founded. </para>

              <para>- The Bill was not read a third time, and, therefore, did not pass this Chamber in the proper way. In these circumstances, it was not the duty of the  Speaker  to add words which made it appear that the Bill had been read a third time, and had passed this Chamber. I, therefore, submit that there was justification for the honorable member for Ballarat drawing the attention of his constituents to this matter. After all, he was merely telling them what transpired in Parliament. And who have a greater right to know what takes place here than an honorable member&#39;s constituents ? Will honorable members opposite, because they have a majority for the moment, say that the honorable member shall be removed from this Chamber for the remainder of the session merely because he is alleged in a newspaper to have done what he conscientiously believed to be his duty? We know full well that our constituents cannot rely on the daily newspaper reports, and if, in addition, they cannot rely on the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reports, in the name of God, who has a greater right to explain to them what has taken place here than has an honorable member? </para>

          <para class="block">That is the newspaper allegation. That is the charge which honorable members opposite make, but which they are unable to prove. The words are emphatic, if they were used. But, after all, the Prime Minister himself in other words has said precisely the same thing. He has intimated to the public that the  Speaker  is a partisan. He has intimated to the public that he knows how the  Speaker  is going to vote. He has intimated that he will retain his seat, and score on a particular motion, because of the vote of the  Speaker.  If he, as a bitter partisan, is acquainted with the way in which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> is going to vote, then he must be equally culpable - if culpability there be with the honorable member for Ballarat.

In other words,. he acknowledged that he had made a statement charging the  Speaker  with being about to give a party vote. He admitted that he had no authority to make it. If, then, the honorable member for Ballarat has made a statement to the effect that the  Speaker  is a partisan, he is but following the example of the Prime Minister. Is he wrong in following that example? I am not charging you, sir, with being a partisan, but when the  Speaker  has to come down and vote for his party, his action removes him from that high and exalted atmosphere in which we love to see him. </para>

The question before the Chair is, first, whether the honorable member for Ballarat made certain statements in regard to yourself, and, secondly, whether he was justified in making them. It appears to me, therefore, that the whole of your conduct during your occupancy of the Chair is under review, and I would respectfully suggest that you are limiting the field which should be open to honorable members, if you rule that your conduct must not be reviewed in any way. </para>

              <para>- There is another matter to which I desire to call attention. When our present  Speaker  was nominated for the Chair, there was absolutely no opposition to his appointment. We could have opposed him. There were 37 members on each side, and we could have demanded a division, with the result that the  Speaker  would have had to vote himself into the Chair. We refrained, however, from doing so. Quite apart from party considerations, honorable members of the Opposition unanimously said, &#34; The  Speaker  must go into the Chair in circumstances in keeping with the highest traditions of his office. As far as is humanly possible, we will free him from any atmosphere of partisanship. We will refrain from taking any exception to his appointment.&#34; We desired to clothe him with a strict and punctilious impartiality, and, as far as was humanly possible, we did so. The proceedings of the House have come now to this - that in certain circumstances, because of the state of parties, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> is forced to vote. The very moment that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> votes in Parliament, that moment he discloses his hand, and comes down, so to speak, from his exalted position of impartiality. </para>

            <para>. - We have been told during this debate that if this motion be carried the electorate of Ballarat will be disfranchised. If it should be disfranchised, that, of course, would be a matter for regret, but if it were disfranchised because of any act of its representative, that would be a matter for which this House would be in no way responsible. It would be for the honorable member himself to explain away that act. The honorable member who has just resumed his seat, like every other honorable member of the Opposition who has spoken, did not attempt to justify an accusation of this kind being made against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline> That fact stands undoubted. The newspaper which has been handed in contains a report of what every one admits to be one of the most serious reflections that could possibly be made against a  Speaker.  The reflection is contained in the paragraph </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>There was good reason for the motion. &#34;We have,&#34; he added, &#34;absolute proof that the  Speaker  has deliberately altered a <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> proof. The proof showed that the third reading of the Loan bill was not carried, according to his own words, and he altered the proof to make it appear in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> that it was carried.&#34; </para>
          <para class="block">One has only to turn to the <inline font-style="italic">Votes and Proceedings,</inline> which are kept by the officers of the House, to find that on the motion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Cook the Bill was read a third time. </para>

              <para>-  I meant to say that he ordered the newspaper report to be read. The report was read, and the honorable member was asked whether he had anything to say. Points of order were then raised by several honorable members of the Opposition, and, whilst these were being discussed, the honorable member for Ballarat, for some reason or other, left the chamber. He came back again, and his attention was once more called to this very matter. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> said, &#34; I give the honorable member for Ballarat precedence over all others if he wishes to make a statement.&#34; The honorable member made a statement. And what was the nature of it? He said, first of all, that no reporter from the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> or the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> was present at the meeting in question; but he did not say that a reporter from the third newspaper quoted - the Ballarat <inline font-style="italic">Evening Echo</inline> - was not present. That, however, is not the point. The question to be determined is whether or not the honorable member used the words attributed to him. He was asked whether he did or did not; and to that question he had an opportunity to say &#34; Yes &#34; or &#34;No.&#34; But we know what his answer was. He still has the right to state to this House whether or not he used the words complained of. It is, therefore, idle for honorable members opposite to try to evoke sympathy on his behalf on the ground that he has had no opportunity to explain. He has had two or three opportunities, and it is still open to him to be heard. </para>

              <para>- Honorable members opposite treat this matter as if it were that of a criminal standing; his trial. The honorable member for Bendigo interjected this afternoon, &#34;Should a man be compelled to come into this House and incriminate himself?&#34; That is the way the position is put by tne Opposition. The honorable member for Ballarat is a member of this House, and&#39; every member is responsible to his fellow members for what he says. The House, in dealing with one of its own members, does not proceed upon the principle that he is a criminal. It rather proceeds upon the principle that he is an honorable man who, if he has made a statement, will have the manliness to rise in his place, and either stand by it or withdraw it. In dealing with a case of this kind, we do not proceed on the principle followed by a Court in a case where a man is being prosecuted for larceny, or some petty offence. Then, again, honorable members opposite ask, &#34; Where is the proof that the honorable member has made this statement? He may be guilty, but you have to prove him guilty.&#34; </para>

He was asked in this House whether or not he made it, and we all know what reply he has made. Honorable members of the Opposition now say, &#34; But you have to prove that he made this statement.&#34; I propose to show that the procedure adopted in this case is the accepted procedure in the British Parliament, and the practice and procedure of the House of Commons are the prae&#39;-ice and procedure of this House.

              <para>- That is so. The honorable member was not called upon for an explanation, as the matter was passed over. On the 4th July, 1893, the same procedure was adopted in the House of Commons. The report states that &#34; The said paper was delivered in, and the letter complained of read.&#34; In yet another instance - 7th July, 1893 - the newspaper was delivered in. The report states that &#34; whereupon the said letter,&#34; which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Chronicle,</inline> &#34; was again read.&#34; There has never been, to my knowledge, a case in the House of Commons where legal proof has been required, or where the procedure has been such as if the member were being prosecuted for a criminal offence. The House of Commons has in each case appealed to the member&#39;s honour, and has given him an opportunity to explain whether or not he did that which was alleged against him. That is the position of this House to-day. The House is appealing to the honorable member&#39;s honour, and is inviting him to say whether or not he used these words, which undoubtedly reflect seriously upon the position of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> and are of such a character as to compel the House to take action. I have quoted these instances to show that we have adopted the proper procedure. </para>

          <para class="block">If the honorable member be suspended, his period of suspension will depend entirely upon his own good judgment and common sense. If the motion be passed to-night, he will be able to come in to-morrow, to express his regret for having used the words complained of, and to apologize to the House for his conduct. If he does so, then, by the very terms of the motion, the whole matter will immediately lapse. I wish now to refer to only one other point. The honorable member for Adelaide, in one of his moments of self-righteousness, said,  &#39; What a magnificent precedent we set during the three years that we were in office. There was no application of the closure, nor was any member suspended.&#34; It was the conduct of the Opposition for those three years that made that record possible. I do not suppose that, in the history of responsible government, there ever was a Government that received such courtesy, attention, and assistance from the Opposition as did the late Administration. What I regret is that honorable members opposite do not adopt the traditions of that Opposition, because, if they did, it would be better for the dignity of the House and the progress of public business. Before I sit down, I desire to make a technical correction in the drafting of the motion, and I move - </para>

            <para>. - There are two most important principles at stake; one is the freedom of speech, and the other the basis on which our Constitution and liberties rest, namely, a fair trial for every person against whom any charge is levelled. In this House, and in the country at the present time, there is a most extraordinary state of affairs. The honorable member for Darling Downs, in reply to a statement by the honorable member for Adelaide that the Labour party, during its three years of office, had never used the &#34;gag&#34;said that no Government was ever confronted with an Opposition such as confronts the present Government - that in the history of responsible government there never was an Opposition like the present. With that observation I entirely agree. There never was an Opposition, which, in the face of such provocation, remained, as we have done so, supine. If we take the history of responsible government, as made in the mother of Parliaments, and contrast the scenes that have occurred there with the proceedings in this place, under such provocation and disorder as we have had these last few days, we can compare with satisfaction this calm and orderly array with that tumultuous and huddled mass of men, fighting and struggling, as they are borne out of the chamber. Such scenes have been known in the House of Commons on far less provocation than we have had. But, happily, we have never seen them here. However, I shall not waste time in dealing with what has been done in other Parliaments. I wish to say at once that nothing the Opposition have done in any way excuses what the Government have been guilty of. The Government have done what they have done without provocation, excuse, or justification. </para>

          <para>The charge levelled against the honorable member for Ballarat is that on Sunday last, in the course of a speech in his constituency, he made some statements in regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> including a criticism of the Speaker&#39;s fairness, to the effect that he was a biased  Speaker,  that he had altered <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and that he did not possess the confidence of the House. For making those statements, it is proposed to expel the honorable member for Ballarat from the House for the remainder of the session. That is to say, it is proposed to deprive some 40,000 electors of this State of the privilege of being represented here at a time when parties are evenly divided in the House, and in the country. What is proposed to be done to-night cannot be divorced from the consequences of the act, and from the circumstances that surround it, and give rise to it. I have never myself said anything against the occupant of the Chair - either against yourself, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> or your predecessors. </para>

I think, however, that it is quite unnecessary to put the amendment now, because the amendment and the main question may very well be discussed together. The amendment is not in issue at all, and it is not proposed to have two debates - the matter is too important. The amendment has nothing to do with the principle involved, beyond impressing honorable members with the serious nature of that principle. </para>

              <para>- As I was saying-, I have never made any reference to the previous occupants of your office outside the House other than I should make inside, and I &#39; have never criticised the  Speaker  in such fashion as to merit his censure. But, nevertheless, the  Speaker,  as such, is no more immune from criticism than anybody else. The honorable member for Ballarat has made some charges, and he was perfectly free to make them. The charge against the honorable member is that he made statements against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline> Whether his charges be well or ill founded - whether he has exercised his right of speech to a point degenerating into licence - is a matter of opinion and for consideration ; but that he had a right to speak as he thought fit, there is no sort of doubt whatever. The honorable member for Ballarat, as a representative of the people, is entitled to say here what he thinks of the Government, of any public business, and of yourself, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline> But he has been denied the right to say here what he thinks; and, as reported, that is the reason he gave for saying what he did at Ballarat. It is asserted now that the honorable member had no right to say what it is alleged he said. Why? Any citizen could have said the same thing. There is not one citizen in Australia, other than a member of this Chamber, whose right to go  to Ballarat, or anywhere else, and say what the honorable member is reported to have said, would be called in question. </para>

          <para class="block">It has come to this, then, that a representative of the people, privileged to enjoy rights and opportunities that are not granted to the ordinary citizen, is not only denied those privileges that belong to him as a member of this House, but is also denied the ordinary rights and privileges of a citizen - amongst them the right of free speech. Now, what did he say about you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker?</inline> He said that you were a &#34;biased&#34;  Speaker.  That may give you offence; it may even arouse the ire of honorable members who sit on the Government side of the Chamber : but surely it is a charge that can be made ? What is there, in the very nature of the language, in a statement that the  Speaker  is biased that warrants the expulsion of an honorable member? Are we just hearing for the first time that there are persons occupying judicial or presidential chairs in this Parliament or elsewhere who are biased ? Have we not heard of biased Judiciaries? Has it not been declared by the supreme tribunal of this country that a citizen was at liberty to say with impunity that one of the High Court Judges was biased and a creature of the Labour party ? The High Court dismissed the point with contempt when its attention was directed to the fact that a newspaper had said something against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins much stronger than anything said by the honorable member for Ballarat against you, sir. </para>
          <para>The charge preferred against you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> by the honorable member for Ballarat, falls under three heads - that you are biased; that you altered <inline font-style="italic">Hansard;</inline> and that you had lost the confidence of the House. As to the first charge - that you are biased - it is a matter of opinion, and you cannot control opinion. Nor, indeed, the expression of opinion. Are you going to say that if I think you are biased I may not say so ? Are you going to say that if I think that any decision of yours is wrong I may not criticise it, provided I do so in a personally inoffensive way? What does a charge of bias amount to? From the very nature of things man is prone to err and unconsciously lean in one direction or another? As to the second charge - that you deliberately altered <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> - that, of course, is a question of fact, and it is susceptible of proof or disproof in the usual way. There is, on page 2789 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> a statement made by yourself that the third reading had not been carried, and you made a correction in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> in which you said that you ordered the  Clerk  to correct the procedure because at the time there was such disorder as to warrant, in your opinion, a departure from the strict form necessary and proper in such circumstances. The statement made by the honorable member, therefore, was not technically inaccurate. As to the third charge - that you had lost the confidence of the House - what does that mean ? It is a mere matter of opinion. Only last week, the Leader of the Opposition said that the Government had lost the confidence of the House, and that was not regarded as an insult, though it was regarded as an excuse for an action which is without parallel in this Parliament, and, so far as I know, in any other Parliament. Therefore, the charges made by the honorable member for Ballarat, if they were made against you, were charges that are to be met and treated in the way in which all charges are met and treated, first of all by having a statement of them, and then by requesting the person charged to say whether he admits having made the remarks complained of; and whether, if so, he considers them true. </para>

              <para>- The reference to the honorable member for Ballarat was a belated one. The charge was levelled, and the whole force and vehemence of the criticism of honorable members were behind it long before it was considered desirable to submit the matter to the honorable member who was charged. But why this startling departure from the settled practice? There are two persons now being tried in the House. The honorable member for Ballarat is being arraigned because he made a charge against the Speaker; and, with deference to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> you cannot escape from the tribunal either; because the charge alleged to have been made against you by the honorable member for Ballarat is being heard, is being tried, and will be tried . As to the general propriety of such motions, it is alleged that this is being done only because it has reference to a charge against the  Speaker.  We are told that if it had been a charge against any other honorable member no notice would have been taken of it. I submit it is a charge which only  incidentally has relation to the  Speaker,  and that the real gravamen of the charge is that it is an attack upon a member of one party by the other party, where both sides are so evenly divided that the  Speaker  is carrying on the government of the country. If, on the Government side of the House, there was an overwhelming majority, this charge would mean nothing - it could mean nothing in the very nature of it - it would be a mere personal attack on the  Speaker  that might properly be resented; but, when democratic government rests in the hands of one man, he can never hope to escape criticism; nor should he escape it if he merits censure. In such circumstances such a charge takes on a very different complexion. This charge is one levelled at that freedom of speech and right of criticism which are the two great principles underlying representative government. If this motion- is carried it will be competent for the Prime Minister to rise to-morrow or some other day and stop my mouth, or the mouth of some other honorable member, for saying some other thing to which he takes exception. In this country, and under this form of government, which we call Democracy, a man should be allowed to say anything he pleases providing it does not create disorder, is not blasphemous, and is not personally offensive, and is couched in decent language. Subject to that, speech is free, and the attempt to fetter speech by any other means must inevitably destroy the very base upon which democratic government rests. </para>

          <para>I come now to the attempt to bolster this charge by precedent. The Attorney-General says that the House of Commons is able to guide us in the matter, and the Minister of Trade and Customs quoted some cases in support of that, and we are told that in the House of Commons the honorable member charged was not even heard, but was condemned and suspended for the remainder of the session, the presumption being that conditions there were exactly the same as they are here. That is quite inaccurate. In one of the cases quoted, that in 1887, the member for the Camborne division of Cornwall, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Conybeare</inline> had made a statement outside Parliament to which very strong exception was taken. It reflected upon the fairness of the Chair. It had to do, I understand, with the closuring of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Conybeare.</inline> It was a very natural thing. </para>
          <para class="block">The member had been closured, and he objected and went to his constituents and said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> was biased, and so on and so on. He was called upon in the House to apologize, and he did so in these words - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>And, again, I say that if, at a public meeting, in the heat of the moment, I said anything that could possibly convey any erroneous impression that 1 intended to reflect on your conduct and authority in the chair, I can only say I am sorry for it, for I had no such intention. I spoke on Saturday with a full consciousness of the gravity of the situation. I felt it to be my duty to express my opinion, however inadequately, on, the present position of affairs ; and, with the explanation which I have now offered, I humbly submit that I did not transgress my duty in saying what I did say on such a grave constitutional crisis. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">If you call that an apology and withdrawal, you must be very easily satisfied. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Conybeare</inline> said he was sorry if he offended the  Speaker,  but he saw no reason to regret what he had said, and that what he had said was fully justified in the circumstances. </para>

              <para>- I come now to the following year, when the same gentleman was again charged with the same offence. Lord Randolph Churchill moved that he be suspended. I want to trace the procedure of the House of Commons that is used as a cover behind which honorable members are now taking shelter for the method pursued by them. There is a fundamental distinction to be drawn. First of all, Lord Randolph Churchill asked leave of the  Speaker  to address a question to the honorable member who was charged with the offence. Having obtained leave, he then asked the honorable member charged whether he was the author of a letter complained of which had appeared in the press. The member charged admitted that he was the author of the letter. That was the foundation of the proceedings - first of all the proof that the charge was true, and was admitted to be true by the member charged. The letter was then read, and it certainly went very far beyond what the honorable member for Ballarat is alleged to have said on Sunday last. It accused the  Speaker  of being biased; it said that the member had been treated unfairly, and that he had only spoken for a quarter of an hour, &#39;when he waa closured, &#38;c. The next step after the reading of the letter was to move that the member be suspended from the service of the House. Remember that this was his second offence within one year. The member was asked if he had anything to say. When he had said what he had to say, he was asked to withdraw. Then the  Speaker  explained the whole of the matter. He pub his side before the House. Please note this, sir : The charge was made in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Conybeare&#39;s  letter; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cony</inline> bear e was asked, &#34;Did you write that letter?&#34; He said, &#34; I did.&#34; He was then asked if he had anything to say in reply, and he made a statement. Then <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> was asked if he had anything to say. At any rate, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> said something. He justified what he had done. Here we see a vitally important distinction between the two proceedings. In the one case the foundation was the admitted authorship of the article. The member was then charged. He pleaded to the charge. The  Speaker,  who was presumably offended, then made his case clear, and afterwards the House debated the matter. The  Speaker  said that he did not wish to speak with any heat nor to import any kind of passion into the controversy, and then he went on to relate the circumstances, after which the matter was discussed. During the discussion, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gladstone,</inline> perhaps the greatest parliamentary authority of our time, said it was highly inconvenient to call in question the conduct of the  Speaker  except in a regular and formal manner. But <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gladstone,</inline> although he held, as I hope we all do, that it is very undesirable to have to criticise the  Speaker  at all, recognised that, for proper cause, he may be criticised like any other person. This point needs special emphasis. I most strongly protest against this gratuitous and wholly unwarranted assumption that the action, the conduct, and. utterances of the  Speaker  may not be criticised, discussed, or censured. The thing is absurd. The highest judicial tribunal in this land is, very properly, not beyond criticism. Parliament itself, whose ceremonious and formal mouth-piece you are, sir, is not beyond criticism ; and the public may say of this Parliament collectively a hundred times more than it was alleged that the honorable member for Ballarat said against you, and the people cannot be punished for so doing. You cannot formulate an indictment that will include a whole nation. It is alleged against the honorable member that he said you were biased; that is not by any means unusual in those holding judicial and presidential offices, as I have said; that you altered <inline font-style="italic">Ilansard,</inline> technically, you admit it; that you have lost the confidence of the House; I do not think it is saying too much to say that you have lost the confidence of half the House. In those circumstances, what has the honorable member for Ballarat said for which he is to be punished in this way ? Excepting that he has said it, perhaps, without those extenuating phrases that a man naturally weaves into his speech when he speaks at length, how has he offended ? They have taken three or four phrases out of the honorable member&#39;s speech. They have published the engraving without the frame. They have taken two or three things out of their context, and upon this the Prime Minister, because it has offended his nobility, because some one has dared to criticise him and his work, dared to criticise you, who were at one time his colleague, and are now the  Speaker  of the House, asks the House to take this most extraordinary action. - You were the proper person to take notice of this, and, had you taken notice of it, I should have been one of the first to ask the honorable member for Ballarat to withdraw it, because, after all, whatever opinions we may have, while you are the  Speaker  of this House, we must- always endeavour to pay you that respect your position deserves. I have not the slightest quarrel with you as an individual, but I claim my right, and shall exercise it to the last ditch, to criticise anything you do or any other person does,&#34; in this Parliament or out of it, in spite of all the endeavours honorable members on that side may make to close our mouths. They have, no doubt, seized upon this pretext to endeavour to persuade the public to overlook their action on Friday last, which will remain unforgotten  to the end, in spite of all they do. Standing by itself, it is a monument for decent men to avoid. It is a pillar of flame which will light them to destruction. I recall the Fusion, and what they did, and I know what became of them. </para>

              <para>- The present Government have the advantage of the honorable member&#39;s advice, which, I think, will be remembered in the political graves of every one of those who take it. This charge ought never to have been made, and it is the first time that such a charge has been made against any member of this House. The pretext is, on the face of it, perfectly inadequate; the alleged cause is ridiculously disproportionate; the proposed punishment not less so. The honorable member for Ballarat exercised his right as a citizen. He went down to Ballarat and made a speech; if any one is aggrieved by it, the law of libel and slander remains. Let them proceed under that. No jury would give a verdict in such a case, as the Attorney-General knows. Thank God that in this country we can say quite a number of things yet without being hamstrung or &#34;gagged,&#34; and I hope we shall go 011 doing it. If honorable members put out the honorable member for Ballarat because he lias done that which he had  every right  to do. they will have assured till the end of time that the honorable member for Ballarat will remain the honorable member for Ballarat. If I were the honorable member, and had such a margin as he had, instead of the very comfortable one that I got, I should be very glad to think that my enemies had done this thing for me. It was said by some one, &#34; Oh, that&#39; mine enemy would write a book&#34;; but the prayer of the politician should be, &#34; Oh, that mine enemy would suspend me from the sittings of Parliament because I have said what the honorable member has said.&#34; </para>

              <para>- I feel sorry for the Attorney-General. I deeply regret that a man of his capacity and reputation should sink so low. I hope the House will reject the motion. I hope that every member will vote according to his conscience, and not vote for the motion merely because the Prime Minister tabled it, or because he does not agree with what the honorable member for Ballarat said. That has nothing to do with the question of whether we should suspend a man because he said something with which we do not agree. Honorable members should note that point; it is vitally important. Even if honorable members disagree with the honorable member for Ballarat to the very uttermost; even if they say his speech was an error of taste, of judgment, intolerable, going to the extreme, they should not suspend him or expel him, because he has the right as a free citizen of this country to exercise the right of free speech. I cannot believe for a moment that the honorable member had any intention of being personally offensive to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> because if he had, I feel sure that you yourself would have taken exception to it. I hope you will put this matter fairly to the House. I hope you will put your side of the case, because you cannot sit entirely unconcerned in a matter in. which you are so vitally interested. Although the Prime Minister has brought the matter up, you are so closely associated with it that your opinion  ought to be given to us, so that we may take advantage of your counsel and know your mind in the matter. I hope the House will reject the motion with a majority that will show the Government that the House is still in favour of free speech, although it may not agree with the  speaker  and his utterances. </para>

May I take this opportunity of again pointing out that all the trouble we are now involved in has arisen from disorder on the part of the House itself, and as a result of the difficulty in which the  Speaker  has been placed as a consequence of disorder in not being able to secure the attention of the House, and to make his meaning clear to honorable members. It is grossly unfair to the occupant of the Chair to be placed in such a position. I must ask honorable members to try to accord to me the consideration to which any occupant of the Chair is entitled. The standing order dealing with the closure reads - </para>

            <para>.- I am very glad that the Prime Minister apparently does not propose to immediately move that the main question be put. If honorable members will try as far as possible to dissociate themselves from a party view, we may be able to come to some decision which will be acceptable to all parties. Every one who has been watching the proceedings in this House for the past month or so must sympathize very greatly with the  Speaker.  I very frankly confess that, in my opinion, you, sir, have tried to do your level best to be impartial. I am well aware of the difficulty that any occupant of the Chair is in, even when the predominant party in the House has a large majority; but the position of the  Speaker  when parties are evenly divided is difficult in the extreme. In my opinion, the honorable member for Ballarat had some reason for what he is reported to have said, if he did say it; and I make that statement without in any way desiring to reflect on your conduct as  Speaker. </para>

To put you in that position would be to put you in a position which no other  Speaker  or  President,  so far as 1 know, has been in, and would be most unfair. The  Speaker, President,  or  Chairman  of an assembly is an umpire, and the rule is that he shall vote always for further consideration.

The Prime Minister took a most extraordinary course in regard to a motion of censure. Every other such motion moved in this House has been debated, from start to finish, without any interruption such as was made when your attention was drawn to standing order 119. That standing order says that all motions not disposed of within two hours after the meeting of the House shall be interrupted, and Orders of the Day called on. It is the application of that standing order that has given rise to all the trouble. The Attorney-General and the Prime Minister approached you, and drew your attention to the standing order, asking you to interpret it literally, according to their reading of it. These are the words of the standing order - </para>

You said &#34;I shall interpret the standing order literally,&#34; and you interpreted it literally as far as the word &#34;interrupted&#34;; but, when the Leader of the Opposition asked you to interpret the latter portion of the standing order literally, and allow the House to say whether the debate <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> the motion of censure should be continued, you said, &#34;No; I cannot agree to that, because the practice of the House is that the fixing of a day for the resumption of the consideration of a motion, or the moving of a motion for the continuance of its discussion, must take place within two hours after the meeting of the House.&#34; If the standing order means anything, it means that, after two hours have elapsed, the House shall order what is to be done with the motion before it. I quite admit that the practice, has been to deal with motions, other than censure motions, in one way or another within the two hours ; but that is not required by a literal reading of the standing order; and, in your interpretation of the standing order you made, I think, a mistake. </para>

              <para>- I do not mention these matters in order to reflect on you, because I honestly believe that you&#39; have tried your level best to do your duty impartially, and the trouble that has arisen has been due to the conduct of honorable members on the one side or the other, and I include myself if you wish. The honorable member for Ballarat, not having had experience in the chair, may take another view; but I ask whether you ought not, under the circumstances, to give him a chance to modify or withdraw his statement. He said that you had altered <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> or that <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> had been altered at your direction. We have seen to-night how much importance you attach to the alteration of the wording of a motion. You refused to allow the Prime Minister to substitute &#34;November&#34; for &#34; October &#34; in his motion until the House had given him leave to do so ; but it has been proved, without question, that the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report of your remarks about the Loan Bill has. been altered. </para>

              <para>- Strictly speaking, if the  Speaker  finds that a motion has not been put, or that a Bill has not been read a third time, he ought, even at the risk of delaying the proceedings, to mention that fact, and let the House make the alteration. Possibly, sir, a serious thing has not been done in your having that alteration made, but I do appeal to you that when the honorable member for Ballarat found that the alteration had been made, he was justified in saying so on a public platform. And if he believed that you were acting in a biased way because you had taken an extraordinary action with regard to the motion of no confidence, I think he was entitled to say that on a public platform, and should not be deprived of his seat in the House for the rest of the session. I want to come to another point, and that is with regard to the newspaper. We are adopting to-night a practice which is quite contrary to your ruling. When the honorable member for Maranoa, the other evening, drew attention to the fact that the Prune Minister had accused the Leader of the Labour party of being guilty of a &#34; dirty trick,&#34; you refused to allow the newspaper to be even read, and you gave this ruling, on page 2713 - </para>

              <para>- There is the fact, sir, that you have disallowed the reading of a newspaper, and now honorable members opposite are called upon to vote for the expulsion of a member, for that is practically what it means, on a newspaper report. If honorable members vote, as they have voted during the past week or two, they are likely to vote as a body on this motion. I appeal to them that they ought to take a different view, and to try to look at this proceeding from the standpoint of a man outside of the House. They have seen a motion of no confidence taken out of the hands of the mover, and postponed indefinitely on the ground that there was nothing fresh in it. That may be a very easy method of dealing with a question to a Prime Minister who is prepared to adopt that attitude. But I think honorable members ought to make this allowance for the honorable member for Ballarat. - that never before in the history of this Parliament has such a thing been done, and never, I think, in the history of the Parliament, has the  Speaker  given an instruction that <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> be altered or added to. </para>

              <para>- I have no doubt that most honorable members, if they find they have used an expression that is not perhaps quite parliamentary, and do not want their constituents to be made aware of the fact, alter that expression. But this is a somewhat different thing. The Attorney-General will see that there is a statement put in <inline font-style="italic">&#39;Hansard</inline> that the Loan Bill was read a third time, whereas as a matter of fact it was not, and <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> has been altered to that extent, and the honorable member for Ballarat said so at Ballarat. </para>

              <para>- Honorable members can only make up their minds as to what they are going to do in this matter. I have my idea of what the public will think of it. They know that there are thirty-seven members on each side here. They know, too, that one honorable member on. this side was suspended to-day, making the numbers thirty-seven on one side and thirty-six on the other. Does the Attorney-General propose to try to increase his majority by bringing down a newspaper report for the purpose of getting a member out of the House - a newspaper report which I believe would not have been taken notice of by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> but for the action of the Prime Minister ? </para>

              <para>- Order ! I think that at this stage the House might, perhaps, permit me - and I think it is due to myself - to say a few words, on account of the number of statements that have been made; otherwise I intend to call upon the honorable member for Werriwa. I intimated to him that I would like to have the opportunity of saying a few words to set a matter right which is wrong altogether, and which has formed the basis of a portion of these accusations. The statement contained in the report which has been read, and which is, therefore, in the possession of the House, is that - </para>

            <para>The  Speaker  had lost the confidence of members. There was a good reason for the motion. &#34; We have,&#34; he added, &#34; absolute proof that the  Speaker  has deliberately altered a <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> proof.&#34; </para>

          <para class="block">Let me take that statement first. The fact that the  Speaker  has altered an uncorrected <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> proof is not an evidence that there is anything wrong. That is a right which belongs to, and is exercised by, every honorable member of this House. No uncorrected galley-proof of any honorable member&#39;s speech has any right to be quoted without the authority or consent of the member concerned. An uncorrected <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> proof of one honorable member&#39;s speech should not be in the possession of any other honorable member without his consent. An uncorrected proof of the Speaker&#39;s decisions or remarks has no more right to be in the hands of a private member than has an uncorrected proof of any honorable member&#39;s speech to be in the hands of another private member. Indeed, it is more important that an uncorrected proof of the Speaker&#39;s decisions should not find its way into the hands of a private member, because those decisions are embodied in a permanent record for future reference, and will be quoted as precedents. Therefore, it is imperative that the  Speaker  should go carefully through his unrevised proofs and make necessary corrections in order to make his meaning clear, or even to make emendations and additions where omissions occur. This has been the right and the practice of Speakers in every Parliament that has ever existed. Not only has it been the practice of the presiding officer of the House, but of every private member of it. I do not know how an uncorrected proof of my remarks, which, I understand, had not even been seen by the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff themselves before it was quoted in this Chamber, came into the possession of an honorable member. </para>

              <para>- I accept the honorable member&#39;s statement. The  Speaker  has a right to exercise the privilege of revising his <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> proofs, just the same as has any other honorable member; and if he is to be denied that right, then every other honorable member must be denied it; and, in such circumstances, no honorable member would be permitted to receive an unrevised report of his own speech to enable him to make his own corrections. He would, also, be exposed to the risk of having errors iu his speech made the subject of subsequent accusations against himself. It will be seen, therefore, that, in exercising the right of emendation, I merely exercised a right which is exercised by every other honorable member. When I examined my proofs, I saw that certain words to which I had absolutely given utterance in this House, were not included in the report. </para>

              <para>- Order ! The honorable member has no right to say that. There is the record of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> which has not been interfered with by anybody. It is also borne out by the official record of the proceedings. I know what was done perfectly well, because I called for order until really my vocal chords were severely strained in an endeavour to bring members to order. At the time, the leaders upon either side of the House were engaged in a heated argument, across the table, and I then put the question to. the House, &#34; That the Bill be. now- read a third time.&#34; I called out in the usual way, &#34;For the question say &#39;Aye&#39;; against the question say &#39; No &#39;,&#34; and I declared that the &#34;Ayes&#34; had <inline font-style="italic">i%</inline> That is what is meant by the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report saying, &#34; Question resolved in the affirmative.&#34; I did not tell the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff to put that in. They heard it. They must have taken notice that the question had been decided, and, as a matter of fact, an. honorable member upon the Government side of the House, after it had been decided on the voices, interrupted .the argument between the leaders upon either side of the chamber, and said something to the Prime Minister, which I caught. That something was to the effect that the third reading had been carried, whereupon the Prime Minister rose immediately and moved, &#34;That the question be now put.&#34; That is reported by <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> We have the statement in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> proof - </para>

          <para class="block">It was here that the proceedings were interrupted, and my attention having been called to the fact- that the Bill had not been read a third time, I interrupted the motion for the adjournment of the House, and directed the  Clerk  to read the Bill a third time, he having, meanwhile, drawn my attention to the fact that that formality had not been complied with. It was because I had directed him to read the Bill a third time that it was necessary for me to .make the alteration or addition in the words I have mentioned. In the circumstances, I directed the  Clerk  to carry out the decision of the House, and to read the Bill a third time before I put the motion. The uncorrected <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> proof which I have in my hand shows that very clearly.

          <para class="block">The rest of the report does not affect the point at issue. The main point is that I did not alter a word - not even a comma - of the report in regard to the question of putting the motion for the third reading to the House. The motion for the third reading of the Bill had been carried on the voices, but the formality of giving effect to the decision of the House &#34; That the Bill be now read a third time &#34; had not been carried out by the  Clerk,  and I directed him to repair that omission, as already explained. That fact had a right to be recorded in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> But this is not the only charge contained in the statement. The further charge is made that - </para>

            <para>The  Speaker  was acting in a biased manner, and was proving himself a bitter partisan. The proof of that was the Speaker&#39;s ruling on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook&#39;s</inline> point of order that the want of confidence motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition should be treated as private members&#39; business. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">In regard to that charge, I wish to say that, so far as I was concerned, there was no question of partiality involved in the matter. I had simply to carry out the Standing Orders as I found them, and I acted conscientiously in the discharge of my duties. I would remind honorable members that the honorable member for West Sydney when speaking particularly emphasized the point that I had to carry out the Standing Orders as they were. If I had departed from the Standing Orders I should have laid myself open to justifiable attack in the House for having done so, but I did not. Motions of no confidence have not previously been interrupted in this House in a similar way because the point has not been raised, owing to the usual automatic suspension by the decision of the Government not to proceed with other business pending the decision of the House on the no-confidence motion. But, in this case, the Government intervened, and said they would go on with business. Then there is in this statement another implied charge - </para>

              <para>- Quite so. It is admitted also, I think, that some honorable members did not hear a word of what transpired. Owing to the disorder that was taking place it is manifest that very little could be heard, but when we find that the Clerks of the House have absolutely entered on their records the statement that the Bill was read a third time, and when we find also that <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> states that the motion was put, I think we are entitled to accept the statement that it was. So much having been made clear, does not the honorable member for Ballarat recognise that, whatever mistake was made, the charge of falsification of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report entirely disappears? </para>

              <para>- The honorable member will see, on the admission of the late  Speaker,  that the statement he made is not correct. The honorable member may think it is correct, because he never heard one side of it, but if he says his statement is correct, I presume he -will not dispute the accuracy of the report in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> or the <inline font-style="italic">Argus.</inline> The honorable member is  chairman  of directors of the Ballarat <inline font-style="italic">Evening Echo</inline> Newspaper Company. A reporter from that newspaper was present at the meeting at which he made this statement, and furnished a report of his speech to the paper, so that there is probably no doubt whatever of the correctness of the statement. </para>

              <para>- There is no getting away from the fact that Parliament Is a Court of the highest record - that it is the chief Court of the country. No member is responsible in any other Court for any remark he makes in the House; and, consequently, when he is outside, and makes remarks about Parliament, the House has to take notice of them if they reflect on the honour and integrity of members. There is no doubt that the statements of the honorable member do constitute a charge against the honour and integrity of the House, inasmuch as they convey that the House is guilty of keeping in place a  Speaker  who has been practically guilty of fraudulently altering the records. </para>

              <para>- Nothing of the sort: and I cannot expect the honorable member to appreciate the distinction that lies here, though I should expect a school boy of five or six to understand it. It is a very wise provision that enables this House to sit as a Court on honorable members. The Labour party voted for a law which gave &#163;700,000 odd to certain big sugar-planters and mill-owners; and, supposing I had gone about the country charging them with having been paid &#163;100,000 to pass that law, ought I not to have been charged in this House? </para>

              <para>- The honorable member will never find me making such charges. He may find me expressing  a  desire to know why honorable members act in such a way that, if they were in America, they would be charged with having been paid large sums for voting; but I have never said that honorable members have received money for doing such a thing. No authority but Parliament can call such statements in question. There has been attached to the statements of the honorable member for Ballarat an importance that any one who knows the honorable member would not attach to them. We know that the Labour party have not attached much importance to what the honorable member said ; and the honorable member fcr West Sydney and the honorable member for Adelaide have made various explanations which tend to show, in the first place, that the honorable member was not responsible for what he said, and that, if he did say it, nobody ought to believe it or take any notice - therefore, that the House ought to take no notice. </para>

If it is the case that the honorable member has been misreported, I hope that he will see that all the reports in the press are corrected immediately. If he now says that he did not say this, he is trying under false pretences to secure a sympathy which he does not deserve. One honorable member has urged that it will strengthen the position of the honorable member for Ballarat, and put him back in Parliament for many years to come. By pretending something, the honorable member is striving to get the votes of the electors in Ballarat in years to come. </para>

              <para>- It certainly appears&#39; that honorable members on the Government side of the House are the guardians! of the honour of the House at the present time, because, judging from the remarks of one or two honorable members, all sense of what is due to the honour of the. House seems to have been lost sight, of to a great extent by them. I urge the honorable member for Ballarat to withdraw his statement. If a member is named for using unparliamentary expressions, and persists in his conduct, and does not withdraw, practically the . whole of the House votes against him. It: is the same in this case. I consider that, . if the &#34;honorable member for Ballarat . does not withdraw his statement now that it has been brought to the attention of the House, not only members on the Government side, but practically the members of the Opposition also should, vote against him, unless he adopts the usual parliamentary procedure, and apologizes to the House for what he has said. </para>

              <para>- I was just pointing out that surely, in regard to two of the statements made, the honorable member for Ballarat had the assurance of the  Speaker  himself. The  Speaker  pointed out that in the noise certain words were not heard by the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff. The Clerks of the House, who are close to the  Speaker,  were able to hear, but the two <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> men, who were further away, did not hear them because of the yelling that was going on. Surely those who were near the  Speaker  are permitted to say what they heard. I suppose there are millions of people who have never heard anything said in the House, but it does not follow that it has not been said. An honorable member who did not hear what was said from the Chair would not contradict the Clerks of the House, who noted on their records what was said. </para>

To pretend that there was a falsification for other purposes, when the only question is whether these words were uttered or not, is to mislead the public into believing that something was done that was not done. The whole question turns on whether those words were read, and those were the only words that were necessary to complete the third reading. </para>

              <para>- As the honorable member saw, the closure was being put on all these motions, and the vote would have been just the same as it was before - 26 to 14. So that, again, the honorable member for Ballarat conveyed a wrong impression to the public when he led them to suppose that there was anything else involved but the matter of the reading of these words. For an honorable member to make charges against the  Speaker  or the House itself in such circumstances is to make a grossly incorrect statement, and I cannot understand any man who has any belief in himself, or any respect for the House, pretending that what happened was a serious infringement of the rights of the House, It can only be done for purposes that I hardly care to describe in the House, but if I were outside on the platform, I should criticise them in a very marked manner. The honorable member for Adelaide said that the Labour party, when in power, allowed the right of free speech, but that was only because the forms of the House were never abused by honorable members of our party like they were to-night, when, although it was only a slip of a word as between October and November, the Opposition actually divided the House, and wasted the time of the House. </para>

              <para>- Of course, I have no hesitation in withdrawing it. One of the very first things that all honorable members ought to learn to do is to withdraw unparliamentary expressions, otherwise any House of debate would become a bear garden, and the only man to be listened to with any respect would be Jack Johnson, or some other person of that sort. I make one last appeal to the honorable member for Ballarat, and if he does not accede to it, I shall have no hesitation in voting for the motion, because his action will show at once that he intends to try to get an advertisement out of it, and I, for one, shall not attempt to prevent him. </para>

It might be inferred, when I spoke about having directed the  Clerk  to read the Bill a third time, that the  Clerk  had been neglectful of his duties. I did not intend to convey that impression, because, as a matter of fact, it was the  Clerk  himself who called my attention to the omission of that formality. </para>

            <para>.- The honorable member for Werriwa has made a speech of some importance, and containing a great deal of unintentional misrepresentation. On his misstatements he founded a declaration that the honorable member for Ballarat would be able to go to his constituents, and say that he had wasted a day. Does not the honorable member know that the statement on which he founded that assertion is an absolute error ? </para>

He said that one positive statement that a member did hear was worth ten negative statements that he did not hear. Notwithstanding the fact that there had been twenty positive voices in support of what I have said, and only the honorable member&#39;s voice opposed to it, he still maintains the position he took up. He applies his rule in one way to one case, and in another way to another case, as it suits him. Is that the course which the honorable member proposes to follow in this Parliament, when he assumes a virtue above that of all other honorable members? The honorable member lectured the honorable member for Ballarat for not rising in his place and immediately apologizing to the House for what he had said of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline> He suggested that, because the honorable member for Ballarat did not do so, he was seeking kudos. </para>

              <para>- May I point out that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> was again in error in his general statement in saying that proofs of rulings by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> were never sent out in this way before. The very opposite is the case. Until the receipt of my last <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> proof it was always the custom for a ruling of the  Speaker,  given in the course of a speech of an honorable member, to be included in the proof of the speech sent to the honorable member who made it. That is a matter about which we need not argue at length. There is, I understand, among the records of this Parliament every proof that has been sent out and returned. The evidence is, therefore, awaiting inspection to determine whether my statement in this connexion is correct or not. Honorable members know that it is correct. Until the receipt of my last <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> proof it was invariably my experience that the rulings of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> were included in the proof of the honorable member&#39;s speech in the course of which they were given. How would it be possible for any honorable member to correct his proof of a speech dealing with a point of order unless he saw the actual ruling of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> or of the  Chairman  of Committees? Do honorable members deny that what I have stated has been the practice up to last week? I am sure they do not. That is another special plea put forward to buttress the case against the honorable member for Ballarat, and it is not correct. The honorable member for Ballarat made only one charge. </para>

              <para>- I am not alarmed about that. That hardly enters into the question. When the Attorney-General was speaking he endeavoured, to the best of his ability, to arouse the passions of honorable members on his own side by suggesting the heinousness of the offence committed by the honorable member for Ballarat. I asked the honorable gentleman if he would be good enough to say which of the three charges laid against the honorable member for Ballarat constituted the major offence. The Attorney-General said that the principal offence committed by the honorable member for Ballarat was that he charged <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> with having fraudulently - the Attorney-General put that word in himself - but we may leave it out and say that he charged <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> with having deliberately altered a <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> proof. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member for Kennedy raised a question at the time, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> admitted that the honorable member&#39;s statement was quite correct, but the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record was something different; that is the material point. When there is no difference between member and member, or party and party, a correction is of no importance, but when a <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> proof is corrected in regard to a material statement of fact about which there is a difference of opinion, not merely between one member and another, but between one party and another, it is a serious thing: When <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> is altered, it would be wise for the presiding officers to take the earliest opportunity to inform the House about it. How can you guarantee and protect one member against another if that is not done? There ought to be absolute good faith between the presiding officer and the House, and between one member and another, when error arises. My complaint at the present time is that the House was not taken into the full confidence of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline> That has been the cause of all the trouble.. I do not think that the two charges made by the honorable member for Ballarat are material; they do not seriously reflect on you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline> There must be some amount of discussion of a free and open kind in the country. I do not care about reflections on presiding officers, because I do not think that it is wise to make them, even when there is justification for them. But on the main issue I. say that no serious charge has been proved against the honorable member for Ballarat. He spoke on evidence that was before him, which he absolutely believed, and which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> has now pointed out was not absolute evidence. He had a proof in his possession in which he absolutely believed. Knowing him as I do, I know that, having been present when the incident occurred, he believed that he was stating the absolute truth regarding the facts. </para>

Because if he could have moved in another way there would have been no open, free debate, in which the facts could be put before the country. &#39; Having- nine-tenths of the newspapers at their service to present their views of the case, they would have prejudiced the facts in the  minds of the people. There will be a different story told to-morrow, if an honest report about the proceedings is published. The members of the Government have attempted too much. They have attempted to punish the honorable member for Ballarat with expulsion for an innocent offence. </para>

In moving for the suspension of the honorable member for the rest of the session they acted with an exaggerated idea of the necessities of the case, and made it absolutely impossible for the honorable member to get a reasonable opportunity of correcting any mistakes he- had made, or withdrawing any reflection he had cast on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline></para>

              <para>- There is another phase of this question which has not been mentioned before, and that is that the newspaper on which the charge is based was not published on the day after the gathering at which the honorable member is reported to have made the statement. There are daily newspapers here which pride themselves on their early and accurate news. I think it is to-day&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> which accepted as authoritative a report of part of an address made by the honorable member for Ballarat, and that is one of the large daily metropolitan newspapers. The honorable member for Adelaide dealt with what the Attorney-General thought about the reports in those newspapers. I am not dealing with that phase of the question. I am dealing with a phase which shows that it  wa3  quite possible for a reporter to have produced an exaggerated report - he had to do it - which would enable the Government, for party purposes, to make an unfair attack on the honorable member. </para>

              <para>- The report in - the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> was handed to the  Clerk  to read, and that is the only evidence of publication on which the Government and the House can found a charge. If the honorable member for Wannon wishes to hit at the honorable member for Ballarat, not on evidence before him, but on the prejudice which is in his own mind, nobody can prevent him. But no honest minded man would do such a thing even to a criminal. Why did the Government choose the newspaper that came out with a report two days after the event? They chose that newspaper, I presume, because the language of the report gave them the largest pull over the honorable member in their desire to humiliate him, to degrade him, and to oust him from the House for a particular period. Having said so much on that point I think that the Government would be well advised if they withdrew the motion. </para>

              <para>- I say to the Prime Minister and to honorable members on the other side that the honorable member for Ballarat had warrant in the official evidence of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> for the statement he made, but I have said again and again, sir, that I do not agree as to the charge laid against you. I want to emphasize that point.

              <para>- With that exception, 1 think that the honorable member can really plead that he was doing what he considered to be a public service in making the statement he did. But, in my opinion, he had not evidence to warrant him in saying that the  Speaker  did so-and-so and so-and-so, any more than he had evidence to justify him in saying that the Prime Minister did so-and-so and so-and-so. He had the evidence of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> proof, and it would have served his purpose equally well to say, &#34; It has been said and reported so-and-so; it has been reported otherwise later, and the report has been amended in such a way as to alter the whole position and misrepresent what took place.&#34; Had he confined himself to that, I think that no exception could have been taken to his statements; and, in that respect, he was distinctly in error. I think, too, that the error of attacking the  Speaker,  particularly in accusing him of doing certain things, is the only justification for a motion of this kind being moved. </para>

              <para>- I will come to that point. The justification for the honorable member&#39;s subsidiary charges is that a motion on the business-paper states exactly the same thing, in practically the same language. That motion may be right or wrong, according to the views of honorable members; but there is a statement made by the honorable member that, in his opinion, the relationship of the  Speaker  with the House is not, to put it mildly, viewed favorably. An honorable member is quite entitled, surely, to use outside the same terms as can be used inside in dealing with the conduct of the  Speaker,  or the conduct of a Minister. </para>

              <para>- I will not pursue that phase of the question any further. In my opinion we shall do violence to the best traditions of Parliament if we carry the motion which has been submitted by the Prime Minister. I do not say that because its effect may be to provoke reprisals when other Governments come into office. If I have the privilege of being in another Parliament I will not countenance any such motion for any such offence. It is subversive of the principles of representative and responsible government. It has been brought forward because of the bitter feeling which exists, and not as the result of calm judgment. If  carried,  it will impose an undue penalty on the honorable member for Ballaratevery honorable member in his own heart recognises that - and I have no doubt whatever that it will not have the effect which its mover desires it to have. I trust that it will not be pressed to a division in the form in which it has been submitted to the House. </para>

To that question I received no reply.

              <para>- At question time, during the past five months, the honorable member for Capricornia has brought forward newspaper reports upon which he has based charges against the Government. He has gone back twenty-five or thirty years to rake up charges against the Prime Minister. If honorable members opposite can base their attacks on the Government upon newspaper reports, why should we not rely upon the reports of two leading newspapers in Victoria, as well as on that of a provincial newspaper ? </para>

              <para>- I withdraw unreservedly. The honorable member for Bourke said that when the honorable member for Ballarat made these charges against you, sir, it was your duty to bring an action against him for libel. The statement, however, was made only on Saturday or Sunday last, and it is not for you to be going all over the country raking up reports of the kind. I take it to be the duty of the House to maintain the dignity of the Chair, and to protect its occupant. This matter has been brought before the House, which is the highest tribunal in the land, and we have a right to settle it ourselves, and to maintain the integrity and dignity of the Chamber. </para>

            <para>. I wish to preface my remarks by stating that I intend to follow a lead which you yourself, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> gave us last week. I desire to distinguish between the honorable member for Lang and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline> Whatever I may have to say to-night - and I am sure the same thought is in the mind of every honorable member who has spoken, or who holds any opinion in regard to this matter - I wish it to be understood that, so far as the honorable member for Lang is concerned, we entertain for him personally the highest respect. Any remarks we may make are directed towards you in your official position as  Speaker,  and not in your private capacity as an individual. Every honorable member realizes what a serious thing it is to impugn the honour or to question the integrity or impartiality of the  Speaker,  because, after all, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> occupies a position that must appeal to the House generally. Every honorable member must rely upon him to do that which is fair and reasonable. We on this side especially have to look to you, sir, to protect us, and to secure to us the full exercise of our privileges in the House. Honorable members on the other side, being in the majority, can well look after themselves. But unless <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> is going to protect the minority, to secure to every member of the Opposition his rights and privileges, and to secure to him also an opportunity to exercise those rights and privileges, without restriction, then we are in a very bad position indeed. I listened very carefully to your explanation to-night in regard to the charge of having altered the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report, and I regret that you should have thought it necessary to make such a laboured statement. The fact that you did make such a long and heavy explanation unfortunately conveyed to my mind the idea that there was some support for the argument and the charge that had been made against you. I confess that, until you spoke, sir, I did not think there was much in the charge. I was inclined to think that the honorable member for Ballarat had made an exaggerated and unnecessary charge against you. Your own explanation, however, convinces me that there was some ground for the statement which was made. I listened with something like amazement to your own admission to-night - an admission which I find is corroborated by the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report - that you put the motion that the Bill be read a third time while the House was in a state of disorder and uproar. The <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report distinctly states that honorable members would not come to order, and then it goes on to say that the question was put while the House was in that condition. A more pitiful admission of weakness on the part of a  Speaker  I never heard publicly made. That the  Speaker  himself should admit - and I say this with great regret - that he put such a motion while honorable members would not come to order, is pitiable. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> has repeatedly refused - and I commend him for his action - to go on with business until honorable members have come to order. Why did he not take up the same attitude on that occasion? I regret that I was unable to be here, and that, therefore, I cannot speak with any personal knowledge of the matter; but your own statement to-night, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> has convinced me that the honorable member for Ballarat had justification for his statement. I cannot imagine that the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reporters could have neglected to hear or see that the  Clerk  had read the Bill a third time. The  Clerk  had to stand up in the ordinary way, and read the words, &#34; A Bill for an Act to authorize the raising and expenditure of the sum of &#163;3,080,000 for certain purposes.&#34; We are coolly asked to believe that the  Clerk  could stand up and read those words without the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reporters either seeing him or hearing him. I decline to believe that. I decline, therefore, to believe that the Bill was read a third time, notwithstanding <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker&#39;s</inline> own statement to the contrary. I say that with very great regret. </para>

              <para>- Thank you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline> As to the charge in regard to the partisanship of the  Speaker,  it is peculiarly fitting that the Prime Minister should be the man chosen to introduce such a motion; and this, because of two things particularly. The first is that the Prime Minister himself was the first in this House to degrade the Speakership by making it a political position. 1 have previously from my place here entered my protest, and expressed my objection to the attitude of the Prime Minister, in the early stages of this Parliament, in going around to meetings, and on every public occasion, referring to the  Speaker  as a political partisan. He repeatedly referred to the fact that the  Speaker  was going to vote in a certain way - that the Speaker&#39;s vote was a pocket vote that he held entirely at his disposal. I do not know whether it was because of the protests from this side, but it was very evident, or manifest, that some influence had been brought to bear on him, because these statements in regard to the Speaker&#39;s position suddenly ceased. Although the Prime Minister has not referred to the matter since the protests were made, the fact that he himself - I do not know that any other member of his party did so - took the position that the  Speaker,  whose fitness he proclaims, was going to be a party man - a political partisan- </para>

To that extent he placed himself out of order, and while on his feet he shouted out some reflections on the Chair and some words which he had no right to use. </para>

I did not hear them, but, whilst the division was proceeding, the honorable member for Melbourne Ports rose in his place, which he had no right to do, and persisted, although I called him to order several times by the name of his constituency. I could not ask the honorable member for North Sydney of my own volition to withdraw words which I did not hear him utter. Although I saw him standing, I did not hear what he said, but, without being asked to do so, the honorable member has already withdrawn, and expressed his regret, and acknowledged that he was in the wrong. That was the proper thing for him to do. I now ask the honorable member for Melbourne Ports to withdraw and apologize for disregarding the authority of the Chair. </para>

            <para>. - So far as you and I, sir, are concerned, I do not think it necessary to say that personally I have the highest admiration for you, but I wish to say that the Government, or those who hold the reins of power at the present time in the Commonwealth by a fluke, are carrying on a course that can only reflect discredit upon themselves. That is a matter which I might hail with pleasure, but they are publishing to the world the fact that in Australia a Government that holds possession of the Treasury bench by one vote are willing to maintain their position by performing any atrocity that it is possible for politicians to perform. </para>

              <para>- I withdraw the atrocity. That puts me in mind of a drill instructor in the army whom I knew when a youngster. He was an old martinet, something like the Prime Minister, and one of the men whom he was drilling asked what would happen if he were called a scoundrel. He said that the man would get the cells. &#34; Well,&#34; the man asked, &#34; what will happen if I think that you are one?&#34; I think it just the same. The people of Australia have to take their information of our proceedings from the reports appearing in the various newspapers, and I ask honorable members opposite if they think that it is a fair and square deal that the members of the Opposition should have to put up with one-sided reports. We do not object to the criticism of the newspapers, but later today the newspapers will publish their accounts of what has taken place. They will inform the people of Australia that the Government have used their majority to insist that this Parliament shall be conducted as it ought to be conducted. They will fail to tell the people that the Government, taking advantage of yourself, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> as the majority, have expelled a member from the House so that they can carry on any corruption they like, without calling on you to vote for that particular corruption. </para>

              <para>- I was sent into this House by the electors of my division to carry out certain promises that I made on the hustings. Finding here a Government who are reactionary in every sense of the word, the members of which, at every tea meeting, pleasant Sunday afternoon, and other gatherings that they attend, endeavour to make it appear that we on this side are retarding legislation, I wish to place it on record that we are not doing so. The Government have only a chance majority, really no majority at all. Therefore, every effort of ours is legitimate when we try to prevent them, not from placing on- the statute-book legislation which would improve the condition of the people, hut from wiping out legislation introduced by the Fisher Government to bring about a better state of affairs in Australia. We have done nothing to retard legislation of a beneficial character, but we have tried to prevent the Government from doing what is detrimental to the people of Australia. I feel that what we have done is warranted by the action of the Government, led by the Prime Minister, which will be a standing disgrace to them so long as Australia is a nation. </para>

            <para>. - Yesterday morning&#39;s newspapers contained reports of some very interesting speeches delivered at a civic function in Melbourne on Monday night. The Governor-General favoured the gathering with one of his brilliant and interesting speeches, and, altogether, I read the account with considerable pleasure, especially the references to the great development here, and the future possibilities of the continent. In addition to the Governor-General, His Excellency the Admiral, and the Inspector-General of the Commonwealth Forces, made interesting speeches. When I read the newspaper accounts it occurred to me as peculiar that the representatives of the Navy and Army should have precedence of the Prime Minister. That I regarded as a reflection on the Parliament of the Commonwealth. I have no particular regard and love for naval and military preparations, which, as I have previously said, I look upon as an unfortunate and regretable necessity. But after what has taken place during this sitting, I think that not only should the representatives of the Navy and Army take precedence of the Prime Minister, but that there are a large number of individuals in the country who, if honorable conduct and reasonable behaviour is to count, are entitled to take precedence of him. </para>
