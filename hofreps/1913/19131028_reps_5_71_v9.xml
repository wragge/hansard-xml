                        <para>- A statement appeared in one of the newspapers some time ago to the effect that the Ministry has definitely abandoned the idea of having Government freezing works in the Northern Territory, and has entered into negotiations with a private company for the establishment of such works. I shall be glad to know if that statement is correct. </para>

                        <para>- The idea of establishing freezing works has not been abandoned, although, as the honorable member for Barrier will see, the sum of £25,000 does not appear on the Estimates. For some time past I have been trying to ascertain whether an English company will establish freezing works at Port Darwin. There was an idea of establishing works at Wyndham, with the possibility of having two within a short distance of each other. I have had negotiations with an English Company of high repute, though I cannot say yet whether they will end in the establishment of freezing works at Darwin. If these negotiations should fail, there are, I believe, other companies and firms ready to discuss the question. </para>

In other words, is it the policy of the Government not to put up the works as a Government concern? </para>

                        <para>- I did not say that. I said that on taking office we found such a condition of things that when the draft Estimates were presented, they were very much inflated, and "we had to take off some millions. I am -quite aware that at the time of the late Government leaving office, the end of the financial year, there had been no Estimates considered; but I do not know that that helps my honorable friends in the slightest degree. In the first place, the draft Estimates ought to have been submitted months before that time. </para>

Is he aware- having had five years' experience in a State Government, and one year'sexperience, at least, in Commonwealth Government - that all Estimates when sent in by the Departments are generally about 20 or more per cent. above the commitments for the year? And, further, does he wish the people or this House to believe that he is making a statement based on his experience, when he says that the draft Estimates were such that he could not prevent great additional expenditure being incurred at the present time? </para>

A proposal to appoint a Royal Commission to inquire into the conduct of the recent general elections was carried in this House, and I understand that it is the intention of the Government to appoint such a Commission. Many members of the Opposition refrained from offering a protest against that motion because we had been, so to speak,, challenged by Ministerialists regarding the conduct of the recent elections.

                            <para>- I take the opportunity, once again, to point out that, properly speaking, I should not have allowed the question by the honorable member for Yarra. I have pointed out on previous occasions that it is distinctly out of order to ask further questions arising out of replies given by Ministers to questions already asked, unless the object of the further question is to elucidate an answer already given. It is not in order to follow up a question with further questions based on the answer given, and thus probably give rise to something very much in the nature of a debate or dialogue. The matter must not proceed further in the form of questions and replies. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. Our proposals will be dealt with in detail in the usual way during the consideration of the Estimates. There is nothing out of the ordinary in this Bill to which to direct attention, except that the measure makes no provision for an advance to the Treasurer, because I rely on the passing of the Appropriation Works and Buildings Bill this week. That will provide money for the carrying on of the works, and buildings, and will unburden the Advance Account. Of course, if there should be delay in the passing of tha measure, I shall have to come to Parliament soon for an advance for the purpose of making payment for works that are now being proceeded with all over the country, but I do not anticipate the necessity for that. So far as my memory serves me, it is not usual for a Government to ask for Supply before it is wanted. The Supply for which I now ask will be imperatively necessary on Friday, and from. Tuesday to Friday is a good time to allow for the passing of a Supply Bill through both Houses of the Parliament. During my experience in Western Australia, the consideration of a Supply Bill rarely occupied more than an hour, the forces of the Opposition being directed to the criticism of the Estimates-in-Chief, not to the discussion of Supply Bills. Unless there are special grievances, it is very seldom that a Supply Bill takes long to pass in any Parliament. Grievances have to be ventilated, but as practically the whole of last week was devoted to the discussion of grievances - grievances which, no doubt, to honorable members opposite, were considered very real - the subject ought now to be nearly exhausted. Believing that to be so, I ask my honorable friends to give a speedy passage to this Bill. </para>

                    <para>.- I appreciate the terms and manner in which the Treasurer has asked for a month's Supply. I understand that some amount remains to the credit of his Advance Account, but not very much. It is a compliment to him that anything is left, because he is a good spender. He asks that the Bill may be passed practically without discussion. No doubt, grievances have been voiced very freely of late, but the head of the Government, and others on that side, take good care by misrepresentations outside, of the most gentle and cut-throat kind, to mislead the public as to the position of the Commonwealth finances, and as to the financial administration and policy of the late Government. I asked the Prime Minister to-day whether certain statements attributed to him by the press, reflecting  on  the action of the previous Government, and expressing his belief as to what that Government would have done had it been returned with a majority, were true, and he affirmed that they were. It was an outrage for him to assert that this party would break its pledges to the people. He had no warrant for doing so, and has no evidence that we have ever broken our pledges. The honorable gentleman's statement was a gratuitous insult to the Labour party, though quite in keeping with his general conduct outside. The honorable gentleman made the statements to which I refer at Parramatta, in connexion with the opening of a Liberal Institute, in which, according to the report, he has a personal interest, having taken £100 worth of shares. </para>

                        <para>- It is like the Prime Minister to blow hot and cold in this way. The Attorney-General, if he were at the head of a Government, would no more think of throwing the responsibility for the Estimates on to his predecessors than of cutting off his head. The responsibility for Estimates lies with the Government that brings them in, otherwise they have no standing. Apparently, this "Government is prepared to remain in office on any terms. Ministers justify their increased expenditure, which will be more than we expended in our most fruitful years, by draft Estimates prepared by the Departments on the usual lines of  excessive  expenditure. The Prime Minister said - </para>

                        <para>- In solemnity, perhaps not, but in fact, yes. In no instance have we, as a party, gone against our pledges to the country. No new taxation was proposed, and no new taxation would have been imposed, and the attempt of the present Government to raise a new and fresh issue would in another sphere be characterized by the proper term, and the people who continue to make use of such statements, without evidence, would undoubtedly be put outside of ordinary decent society. That is just about how the matter stands. But what is behind the general statement that the previous Government had expended very much more during their term of  office than  did the Deakin Government in 1909-10? There is no comparison between that year and the years 1910-1911, 1911-12 and 1912-13. The expenditure on new works in that period, the amount of new social expenditure, the increases in the invalid and old-.age pensions, the maternity allowance, the gradual growth  of  the Public Service, the increase in the remuneration of State employes, and the very large expenditure on defence, exceeding anything in previous years, show clearly the reasons for the increase. Had the present Government been in office, would they have refrained from expending the money that was available on such enterprises of the Commonwealth ? Did not the Liberal party, did not the Prime Minister himself, whilst sitting in Opposition, did not the honorable member for Gwydir, and others, during the years prior to the expiration of the Braddon section, point out how the various services of the Commonwealth were being starved, - as regards public works and equipment, and the payment to employes? Immediately the money was available the previous Government took every proper step to get the works carried out on national lines. We did more. We not only avoided the raising of loans for defence, but accumulated a surplus amounting to 10s. lOd. per head, which was handed over to the present Government. They have mopped up that surplus. They speak of cutting down our expenditure, but they have increased the expenditure. </para>

                        <para>- The matter is a little technical, and it easily lends itself to the tactics of the Prime Minister in public. But the facts are admitted by the Treasurer, who understands that we started from the same day as did the agreement between the States and the Fusion Government. </para>

                        <para>- I need not pursue the matter further. The Treasurer now admits clearly that we carried out our pledges to our electors. We said we did not object to the payment of 25s. per head for a period, but we did object to a provision for the payment of that amount being embodied in the Constitution. Before and during the election, I stated that if we were returned we would pass a measure providing for the payment of that amount for ten years. That proposal was carried out to the very letter. We agreed to all the principles embodied in the agreement, including the special payment of Western Australia. </para>

                        <para>- The States got, and are getting now, an amount exactly in accordance with their agreement, and, if it is to be altered, it can only be altered by the Government. It was passed by the previous Government. If there is any risk, it will probably lie with this Government. But that was not the charge which was made against us. The charge was that we had taken from the States payment for six months, which the Fusion party would have given them. There is another of the misrepresentations which it is very easy to make and publish abroad, but so hard to refute. I have stated before the difficulty under which we, as a party, labour through having no central press to publish our statements of fact. It is only by continuous iteration and reiteration that we can hope to catch up to a set of statements that are contrary to the facts. I have figures showing comparisons between the proposed expenditure of the present Government and the expenditure of the previous Government. The figures show that our Administration was even more economical and more careful than the present Government indicate by their Budget proposals. I will content myself by making a general statement. We under-spent our revenue, whereas the present Government are already over-spending. Our commitments would not have been in excess of our financial position had we retained office, and the gratuitous statement, first given out as a fact, but now modified by the Prime Minister to a solemn opinion that he entertains, that if we had been returned we would have imposed other taxation, must be greatly discounted by honorable members in the House, and by people who know the honorable gentleman outside. I wish to offer my congratulations to the ex-Postmaster-General on the reply made by the Postmaster-General to a question asked to-day by the honorable member for Parkes regarding wireless telegraphy. The answer was that while the Minister did not think it wise to give the opinion of the expert, he indicated clearly that the Government were advised that they had a good defence to the action. The previous Government took a political risk in employing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Balsillie.</inline> I was greatly responsible for choosing him in London. He is a comparatively young man, who happens to be an Australian. He received his first training in Brisbane. Subsequently he visited other parts of the world. He is undoubtedly a skilful man, and well worthy of the salary which we pay him. The late Government had to accept the responsibility- </para>

                        <para>- The denunciation was very complete. I have only spoken to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Balsillie</inline> twice since he came out here. But I believe that this continent is better equipped with wireless than is any other country in the world, and all this has been accomplished within the brief space of two years. I think that we have reason to congratulate ourselves upon what has been done in this direction. We have wireless communication all round Australia, and we are in touch with the Antarctic and also with the East. Tt is only a matter of a very short time when our internal communication will be aerial, too. I invite the Government to give attention to this aspect of the matter. In my judgment, the great cost of constructing telegraph and telephone lines to the remote portions of Australia will be avoided in the near future. With the development of wireless telegraphy and wireless telephony, we shall be able to send messages from the sea-board inland, and from inland to the sea-board. It has always been a trouble with our remote settlers to secure speedy means of communication. T hope that this phase of the question will not be lost sight of by the Government in the general turmoil of party politics. In conclusion, I join with the Treasurer in the hope that the passing of this Supply Bill will not be needlessly delayed. The right honorable gentleman is unfortunate in that his colleagues behind him take good care that political controversy shall not be allowed to rest, and whilst statements are made which are wilfully misleading, it necessarily follows that they must be answered on occasions like the present. </para>

But I wish to say a word or two to the Prime Minister regarding certain remarks which he is reported to have made the other day. He is alleged to have declared that the late Government neglected their duty by failing to revise the Tariff in the direction of imposing sufficiently high protective duties on articles which are coming into the Commonwealth, to the detriment of Australian industries. </para>

                        <para>- There is no earnestness in that interjection. The Prime Minister has  preambulated  over tins country addressing  banquetting  gatherings, and has1 spoken not merely with two voices, but with many voices. On one occasion he stated that the Government were determined to get their programme through, and that they would not put up with very much from the Opposition. Loud cheers greeted his statement, because his hearers thought that if he did not get his -.programme through,, he was going to face the music. </para>

                        <para>- Of course, a large winegrower who can take a trip to the Old Country, stay away for twelve months, draw his  parliamentary  salary, and be returned again to this House, can afford to say anything. These interruptions, I am sure, are for the purpose of occupying my time. I repeat that the Prime Minister on one occasion declared that he wanted to pass certain legislation. But on another occasion he said, " I think it is time Australia had a rest from legislation, don't you?" Then his Conservative hearers cheered again, and in effect said, " Yes, we think we want a rest from legislation." This audacious freetrader, who voted against every proposal to give increased protection to Australian industries, actually had the temerity to attend a meeting the other day,, and to blame the late Government for not having revised the Tariff with a view to giving those industries further protection. </para>

                        <para>- Of course, it is said that a man can go a long way in politics if he has a good hide. I am sorry, indeed, that we are not now dealing with the Tariff. I regret that it has been referred to the Inter-State Commission, because I believe it will be a very long time before we have an opportunity of revising it, and of dealing with the £78,000,000 worth of imports which annually find their way into the Commonwealth. These figures evidence the extent to which our imports have grown. There are many unemployed in our midst, and there are many industries that require further protection. If I were asked, "' How do you judge that protection is required in Australia?" I would refer to the amount of revenue we receive by way of import duties. When 1 .learned that our imports had assumed such enormous dimensions, I would not bother about sending out a long list of questions, such as the. Inter-State Commission have sent out to manufacturers. I would accept the fact that we annually import £78,000,000 worth of goods from- Japan and other cheap labour countries, as the strongest possible evidence that Australian industries require more protection. I invite the attention of honorable members to the list of questions which have been forwarded to manufacturers by the Inter-State Commission. </para>

Now, a man may be able to answer those questions, but he would have to do so in a spirit of hope. The next question asked is, what proportion the cost of labour bears to the total factory cost of the finished article imported or made in Australia ? Fancy asking an Australian manufacturer to answer that question '. </para>

                        <para>- Then the manufacturers are asked to say what countries at the present time are most successful in the manufacture of the article for the Australian market, and to specify, if possible, the wages paid in such countries in the industry referred to, and give their authority. Are the manufacturers supposed to search the Public Library in order to ascertain the wages paid in the various countries throughout the world ? If a manufacturer were to come to the Parliamentary Library, which is supposed to be one of the most up-to-date, and ask for the <inline font-style="italic">Japan Year-Booh,</inline> he would find that the latest obtainable there is five or six years old. The next question that is asked is what is the ruling freight pelton on the article from the countries mentioned ? How is a manufacturer to get his work done if he has to run round and inquire from the shipping companies the freights from various countries? Indeed, it is doubtful whether he would get the information from the companies. Further, he is asked to say what proportion the freight bears to the total landed cost, but not the duty paid in Australia. Perhaps there is not much objection to the request for the information as to the capital proposed to be invested in land, buildings, and so forth; but the manufacturer is called upon to say whether the article is being manufactured, or partly manufactured, in Australia, and to give the names and addresses of the manufacturers. What did we appoint an Inter-State Commission for but to investigate such matters? The members of the Inter-State Commission are men of considerable capacity, and we pay them reasonable salaries, and give them a staff that costs several thousands of pounds a year. </para>

I desire to remind the Prime Minister of what he had to say the other day about the formation of a combination in the Old Country with £50,000,000 capital to fight trade unionism, and to tell honorable members that I have a list of some of the prominent men who contributed. </para>

We know what the rate of wages will become if trade unionists become divided, and the employers can bargain with what they call free workers. It is time we took up the attitude that we will not allow goods into Australia, at the preferential rate, from the Old Country, unless they have been manufactured at a fair rate of wages. If we countenance the sweater in the Old Country, we disadvantage the trade unionists there as well as trade unionists in Australia. Nowadays we are making rapid strides with trade unions everywhere, and unionism is not confined to the legal profession, of which the honorable member for Parkes is such an ornament. The article in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> is of such an unkind character that I thought I would write to Messrs. Bryant and May, and Messrs.

                <para>Dear <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Higgs,</inline></para>
                <para>I have your letter of 23rd inst., and am only too pleased to give you the information you desire. </para>
                <para>It is clear that the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> article must have been written under some misapprehension, for it is incredible that a journal which has always been so fair and favorable to Australian manufacturers should now seek to damage one in which so many Australians are employed under ideal conditions. I have not thought fit to answer their charge, which, if it can be taken seriously, amounts to one of " bluffing for higher duties." Exactly how much there is in this you shall judge for yourself, and I would further have you know that all our assertions are fully borne out by the books of the company, which I undertake shall be exposed unreservedly to the Tariff Commission when appointed. </para>
                <para>Great Britain is our worst competitor, because of the 50 <inline font-style="italic">per cent. preference.</inline> (Could there be a greater anomaly in a Tariff which, in the main', gives a 5 per cent. preference to British goods, and in only a few rare instances rises to 10 per cent. and 12½ per cent. ?) </para>
                <para>When this absurdity was first enacted the Swedish companies combined to establish a factory in England, with the express intention of catering for the Australian market - and that alone ! We do not know how much of the work is actually done there (we think very little, except dipping and packing; the boxes, or, in any case, the splints for matches and skillets for box-making are cut and shipped from Sweden), but we <inline font-style="italic">do</inline> know under what labour conditions that work is done. Only last month the employes of the Anglo-Swedish concern at Barking were out on strike, and, from their statement, it appears that they had been asked to work on the average fifty-five hours per week for the magnificent remuneration of from 16s. to 22s. The day workers' money is from 3½d. to 4d. per hour, and this class of work is performed in many instances by men who have wives and children to support, and they are asking for½d. per hour increase ! In our factory the hours are forty-eight per week, and the wages average, for men, 45s. to 66s. per week; and for girls, £1 to 45s. The lowest wages paid in the factory are to a few young girls, beginners, who have a minimum of10s.,but who are on piecework, and can earn up to twice that amount if capable. There are very few boys in the factory, and the average age of the girls would be in the neighbourhood of eighteen to twenty years. I have said above that the conditions are ideal, but we particularly want you to satisfy yourself on that point, and I should take it as a personal favour if you and a party of your friends (political or otherwise) will do us the honour of a visit. Ladies will be most welcome. You have only to give us a couple of days' notice, and we can promise you an extremely interesting afternoon. There is nothing in Australia at all like the wonderful machinery used here. </para>

Wood match making in Australia does not pay, and we can prove it to the satisfaction of any impartial person - as we did, in fact, prove it to the expert accountants sent here at our own request by the ex-Minister of Customs. Fortunately, the profits of this company do not depend on the manufacture of matches, wax or wood. We have arrangements" with British and foreign makers - and we have never concealed the fact - which enable us to <inline font-style="italic">import</inline> on the most satisfactory terms, and such dividends as we have been able to declare in the past are entirely due to this branch of our business. Under an effective Tariff, which ensured the goods being made in Australia, such arrangements would have no force, and we should forego that portion of our profits; but Australian labour and other Australian manufacturers would be corresponding gainers. We are now persevering with the manufacture of wood safeties because both parties in Parliament have definitely declared for Tariff revision, and meanwhile we had rather employ our plant, even at a loss, while we are training our staff against better times; but please do not believe that we are, as has been represented, " in full swing again." On the contrary, we have less than half our wood match plant employed ; to fully man it would require a further 100 hands at least, and even then our output would be quite a small proportion of the consumption of Australia. There would still be lots of room left for other factories, or for importations. Just how '* effective " the present protection is may be determined by reference to the following figures :  - Wood Safety Matches. 1910. - Imports, 18,584 cases; local sales, 1,442 cases; total 20,026 cases. 1911. - Imports, 22.185 cases; local sales, 2,671 cases ; total, 24,856 cases. 1912. - Imports, 27,683 oases; local sales, 820 cases; total, 28,503 cases. </para>
                <para>The quality of our goods undoubtedly gave trouble at the outset, but this has now been entirely overcome, and their merit is recognised by the trade: so much so that we could, if we wished, take orders for many thousands of cases </para>
                <para>So much for " wood safeties," which are the heaviest line, and which are rapidly displacing wax vestas throughout Australia. As to the latter, wax vesta making in Australia has been a reasonably profitable industry for several years past. We never ceased work in that branch. It is a good industry for the direct employment of labour, and immensely important to other subsidiary industries, e.g., our account with one local stearine factory is at least £1,000 per month, and with the local strawboard manufacturers from £200 to£300, and both of these items would be more than doubled under a satisfactory Tariff. They are merely given as instances of how our industry helps others. Of course they, too, only employ Australian labour under Australian labour conditions and rates of wages. As to the conditions in force at our own works, we repeat our invitation, to come and see for yourself. </para>
                <para>Match making carries over a bad reputation from the old days of " phossy jaw." With our process there never has been, and never can be, any risk to the health of those employed. In fact, it is about the healthiest industry of the lot. Again, come and look at our young ladies and judge for yourself. </para>

                    <para>.- I shall take advantage of the second speech allowed during Committee discussions to finish what I have to say on this subject. The honorable member for Werriwa is personally a very nice man, but politically, at times, he goes out of his mind. He asks if I have a brief for the company, a question which gives a clue to his mental attitude when the Tariff was under discussion some years ago, when any one who advocated Protection was, according to him, impliedly guilty of the grossest corruption. The honorable member could not find expressions bad enough to apply to such members. </para>
                </talk.start></continue><para>I have no brief for the company, except the brief which I consider that I hold for every company, and there is nothing marked on the brief, that is, I get nothing for my advocacy of the claims of local manufacturers. But, as an Australian, I consider it to be my duty to try to get good protection for every industry that exists in the Commonwealth, or could be established here. My only reward is the feeling that I am thus doing my duty to my fellow countrymen. </para><para>Some persons take the view that, rather than protect an industry like this, it would be better to pension off those employed in it. That was the old cry of the present High Commissioner in regard to this very industry, and, no doubt, the honorable member for Werriwa, if the embargo on free speech which has been placed by the Government on its supporters were removed, would say something of the same kind again now. It is possible that the labour cost of the production of a given industry may be very small. Complex and costly machinery maybe used to do away with hand labour. If honorable members visit the exhibition now being held in Melbourne, they will see machinery belonging to this very company cutting narrow, ribbon-like strips of wood from pine logs, and will see other machinery making up boxes, shaping matches, and performing many other processes necessary in the match-making industry. I hope that as time goes on machinery will enter largely into all industries, and thus lighten the burden of humanity, doing away, as far as possible, with uncongenial manual toil. The more perfect the machinery, the better it is for humanity, so long as the wealth which is produced is properly and equitably distributed. Employes must receive good wages and work short hours. They must have plenty of money with which to feed, clothe, and educate their children. </para><para>I would not refuse protection to the Australian manufacturers of matches if the labour cost of matches were only 5 per cent, of the total cost of production, because the shareholders live in Australia - certainly the  chairman  of directors does - and the dividends, when they are received, will be spent here on the employment of builders and artisans of all kinds for the construction of houses, and in giving work to tradesmen and to many others. It is better for Australia to have money thus spent here than to have matches imported from abroad made by persons who contribute nothing to the cost of governing the country. It is said that Australia needs population, and she does. When I visit my constituents, I sometimes ask, " Why is it that you cannot hear Madame Melba, or the great lecturers who visit Australia? Why cannot you see fine plays? Why have you not big public libraries and other comforts of civilization?" I tell them that it is because of land monopoly and the fewness of our people. There is not enough population in the country to support these things. We need a large population to make the cost of government as cheap as possible. But we cannot get a large population unless we give adequate protection to our industries. It is useless for our friends opposite to bring hundreds and thousands of immigrants to this country in the hope that they will stay here, because they will not stay here unless there is work for them to do. </para><interjection>

It is of no use to bring immigrants here unless there is good employment for them when they arrive. Just prior to Federation, mechanics were leaving Australia to go abroad, because there was not sufficient work to keep them here. I notice that most extraordinary efforts are being made to bring immigrants here.

                        <para>- I can see that my honorable friend wishes to lead me into a discussion. In many cases a farmer who comes here from Great Britain must get a shock. It is very surprising to an Australian to observe the fields or the farms in the Old Country. At the time of our visit they were covered with a green carpet. Take a British farmer, and put- him on some of the bush lands in any part of Australia, face to face with timber that will take from <inline font-style="italic">£7</inline> to £10 an aero to clear, when, perhaps, he has no money. The treatment of the immigrant is very haphazard. The Western Australian Government give him three days' free accommodation, I believe, and then start him out. If we cannot get farmers, we are getting grocers' assistants, drapers' assistants, clerks, and some mechanics. I believe that members of the engineering trades have come out here, but I am not sure that they have been able to get employment. That brings me back to the necessity for revising the Tariff, With a view to giving scientific Protection. I do not know whether it would be well, at this stage, to sound a note of warning to those who believe in Australia, and desire to see the Tariff revised, that the Government are spending so much money and in such a way that it will be almost impossible to reduce the revenue from Customs duties. </para>

The Government did not want to meet Parliament next year until August, and in the meantime the Treasurer, accompanied by the Prime Minister and, no doubt, by the Minister of Defence, would . have a trip to England, and duly impress &gt;the natives. In all sincerity, I hope that he will be able to get a trip next year, "but I would rather that he should go as an ex-Minister. </para>

                        <para>- I believe, sir, that next time the right honorable gentleman will go to the Old Country as Treasurer of the Commonwealth. Everything points to the fact that the Prime Minister, although he has expressed a desire to pass legislation, wishes to get into recess as soon as possible, and to have a spell. No doubt, he is entitled to a spell, because he has had rather a rough time as Prime Minister, and previously he had a pretty rough time as  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition. He did all the work on the other side, and the burden of stirring up this side is still on his shoulders. He seems to stir us up, I think, more than any other Minister does, and he succeeds very well. I am glad that he has returned to the chamber. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to emphasize the necessity for Tariff revision. The InterState Commission have, I think, gone the wrong way about their work. The long list of questions to which they desire a statutory declaration will in very rare instances be answered. The manufacturers will be prepared to go on and suffer, because they will not be able to comply with the demands made by the Commission. The Prime Minister has seen the error of his ways, and become a real, sincere Protectionist, because he must be that when he charges the former Government with having neglected their duty and with having failed to revise the Tariff to give further Protection to Australian industries. </para>

                        <para>- No; if the Inter-State Commission will bring in a report, we will supply the High Tariff lines. Let nobody be under the impression that the Tariff has gone to the Inter-State Commission. Some people have an idea that the Tariff has become a non-party matter, and that the Commission's report, whatever it may be, may be accepted : but unless the report carries with it sufficiently high protective duties for Australian manufacturers, I, for one, will not support it, but will vote for increased duties. </para>

                        <para>- 1 should like to warn the Australian manufacturer, through the press, that he must not depend upon the Inter-State Commission, but that he should continue to demand from this Parliament a revision of the Tariff, and, above all, he should not be led away into thinking that he is going to get Protection from the body because it is an Inter-State Commission. The moment that their report is laid on the table of this House, the fight will commence, and the Free Traders here will attempt to secure lower duties if high Protectionist duties are proposed, while the Protectionists who are here, if they think that low duties are proposed, will try to get higher duties; so that referring the Tariff to the InterState Commission has not settled the fiscal question. It has to be fought out. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. The party system sometimes seems to be the only workable political instrument, and yet, without a doubt, it has its disadvantages. With the indulgence of honorable members I have been able this afternoon to make a few remarks on the question of Protection uninterrupted by rude howls from the Ministerial ' benches, and I do hope that the Prime Minister will consider my observations. Indeed, I think I shall send him a proof copy of my speech, because he has not been listening to it. I do not know whether he is becoming callous - whether he has arrived at that philosophical state of mind when he imagines that nothing matters. I wonder if he has reached the stage at which he thinks, ' ' If we amend the Tariff, well and good; if we do not amend it, well and good;" and "if we pass the Electoral Bill, well and good; if we do not pass it, well and good " - that is, so long as he is allowed to continue Prime Minister, aud the Treasurer does not worry him too much. I do commend my observations on the question of Protection to him for his consideration. </para>

One of his statements was that our party are in favour of increasing the taxation of the community. That is undoubtedly not correct.

                        <para>- Our party came into office five days before the beginning of the current financial year. So that we had only five days in which to arrest the extravagant expenditure of the late Government. The honorable member for Capricornia has already heard the declaration of the Prime Minister that the Government have endeavoured to put an end to that expenditure, and that, with that object in view, some millions of pounds have been pruned off the Estimates. Our party does not pretend that it is possible to do more than that. Whilst the late Government were in power our taxation increased from £1 16s. per head to £3 10s. 3d. per head. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member has never heard me do the same thing in his tfe. If the side of the importers coincides with that of the people, I rejoice to have been on the side of the importers. The honorable member for Capricornia declaimed vigorously against our volume of imports; but let me remind him that, just in proportion to the increase of our import trade, our manufacturing trade increases. Just as values have increased in the one case from something like £36,000,000 to £76,000,000. in the other case they have jumped from £34,000,000 to £54,000,000. When speaking on this subject, the honorable member did not seem to appreciate that, as a rule, increasing imports mark the increasing prosperity of a country, and that, with that increased prosperity, there is necessarily an increased demand for the manufactures of that country. Nobody can rejoice more than I do at the natural increase in the prosperity of the great manufacturing class. In fact, 80 per cent, of the increased value of manufactures in this country is absolutely independent of any Tariff whatever. </para>

I trust that the time when we shall witness similar exhibitions is rapidly passing away. I hope that honorable members will speak only on behalf of the people, who are their true clients. Our aim should be to cut down taxation. Unfortunately, time after time we find ourselves forced into a position similar to that into which we were recently forced by legislation enacted last year at the instance of the Labour party, under which we were obliged to make up £750,000 of revenue in connexion with the sugar industry. I know that, three or four years hence, some honorable members opposite will begin to talk the other way. It is because they do not realize what they are doing that I feel bound to put them right. I trust that we shall never again witness an honorable member in this House speaking on behalf of a particular client, and urging that it is our duty not to consider the consumer, but to consider the manufacturer. Our duty is to consider the interests of every class of the community, and not those of a particular section. </para>

                        <para>- No doubt the honorable member has heard that argument from men of the mental calibre of the honorable member for Capricornia. I hope that if the question of the Tariff is again brought up, there will be some consideration given to the interests of the great masses of the people. I hope we shall not again have returned to power a political party the members of which are prepared to place first the interests, not of the manufacturing class as a whole, but of the great manufacturers. I do not wish to see the big manufacturer harassed in any way. I look upon him as a desirable member of the community, but I say that he has no more right to make his profits at the expense of some one else than the. worker has a right to work at other people's expense. We do not guarantee the farmer against loss during times of drought, and why should we guarantee the manufacturer against loss of interest on any of his plant by forcing people to buy from him ? </para>

                        <para>- Later on, perhaps; but farmers cannot force people to buy from them. As we cannot safeguard the farmer against drought, we have no right to safeguard the profits of the manufacturer by permitting him to take them from the farmer who suffers from the drought. Farmers, miners, and other producers in this country are selling the whole- of their products in open competition in the markets of the world. They have to pay freight on their products to the other side of the world; yet they are not in the least degree considered by some honorable members. The bulk of the manufacturing class do not come to Parliament for assistance at all. They get as far from Parliament as possible, but the ring and trust men come to Parliament, and they find ready supporters in the members of the Caucus party. Honorable members opposite have devoted their time to talking against trusts and voting for them. </para>

                        <para>- I never voted for it, and would not have dreamt of doing so. The present Minister of External Affairs and I, in 1902, 1903, and 1905, pointed out what the cost of this so-called industry would be to the community, and the injury the legislation then proposed would do to the consumers. I do not wish to hear from the honorable member for Capricornia or any other honorable member opposite any more talk about the party being in favour of the poorer people. They have condemned the trusts and combines from scores of platforms, but they cheerfully voted over £700,000 a year Excise for their benefit in connexion with the sugar business. After that, all their protestations about considering the interests of the people are but idle words. Their words against trusts should be treated as the idle wind. We might ask of them, in the words of Job, " When shall vain words have an end?" The honorable member for Capricornia spoke for a particular manufacturer, and was not able even to say how many men are employed in the industry in which he was engaged. He practically told us that the statement of one manufacturer should outweigh the statements of every one else. There was a time when the spirit of serfdom was so strong in people that when one of the great landlords deigned to speak, they would bow down and grovel in the earth before him. The same spirit would seem still to animate honorable members opposite, and they cannot help grovelling when they hear the voice of the manufacturer. During the whole of their <inline font-style="italic">régime,</inline> the political party opposite increased the taxation of the people. They cannot escape the fact that their very last act was to yield up £700,000 a year in Excise duties on sugar. The public will still have to pay that amount, because, although the duty has now been repealed for over three months, there has not been a drop of one half-penny per pound in the price of sugar. </para>

I hope that we shall hear no more pretences from the members of the Caucus party about their being against trusts. They may talk in that way, but they vote in the other way, and we must judge them by their votes, and not by their speeches. </para>

                    <para>.- For the greatest political humbug to which I have ever listened commend me to the speech of the honorable member who has just sat down. He poses as a great Free Trader, and takes the honorable member for Capricornia to task but he has had to agree to the platform of honorable members on the other side, who are prepared to sink the fiscal issue during this Parliament and the next. Those were the terms of the agreement on which the honorable member secured his election, but at the election he had not the moral courage to say a solitary word concerning them. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member avoided it on every possible occasion. Is it not sheer political humbug for the honorable member to talk in the strain to which we have just listened ? He talks about relieving the people of taxation, and says that the Caucus party have been responsible for wilful, wicked extravagance. Those remarks were received with cheers by honorable members on his own side, but when the honorable member explained what he meant by them there was no cheering. The honorable member said that the wilful extravagance has been in connexion with the defence of the country. We can only come to the conclusion that he is opposed to the scheme of defence now being adopted. He is opposed to universal training. The honorable member is opposed to the defence of the country as carried out at the present time. </para>

                        <para>- That is candid. He assumed that one honorable member speaking from this side voiced the opinions of the Opposition generally, and, arguing in the same way, I should be justified in assuming that the honorable member's statement on this subject is concurred in by every honorable member on the other side. In the old days here, the honorable member for Werriwa was considered a rabid Free Trader, but how has he fallen since? May I congratulate the honorable member on his present associations. The Liberal party, knowing well that the honorable member was not too certain a quantity, had a special platform prepared for him to sign. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member now brings the matter down to a very narrow issue. I always thought honorable members opposite were a Caucus-ridden party, and the honorable member has proved it. It is true there was not a general plebiscite of the electors, but there was a plebiscite of a little section of the Liberal party; and the honorable member himself was so dissatisfied that he threatened at one time to take strong measures; indeed, it was thought he was going to contest the seat in spite of the result of the plebiscite. All this shows conclusively how Caucus-ridden the party opposite are. They dare not speak ; and even a gentleman like the honorable member for Parkes is snubbed when he asks a question - treatment which he dare not resent in the slightest. This reminds me of a cartoon I saw depicting the Prime Minister having his portrait painted by the honorable member for West Sydney, and the former holding the honorable member for Parkes, drawn as a dog, by a string, with the label, "My majority." The majority was so uncertain that it had always to be kept chained up; and the honorable member for Werriwa seems now to be the majority, and has to be kept on a string to prevent him getting away. The honorable member for Werriwa has spoken very emphatically about the taxation imposed through the Customs House; but I did not hear him say anything to the effect that he was going to try to have this taxation removed. Did the honorable member say anything to that effect? </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member does not attempt to tell us how he proposes to relieve the people of this burden, and I am afraid that, when the time came, he would not be prepared to do so. The honorable member has, in my opinion, fallen from grace in this respect. Whether the honorable member likes it or not, the great majority of the people of Australia have declared in favour of Protection; and I regret that he should have made the speech he did this afternoon with the knowledge that he, above all other men, has been obliged to acknowledge the fact. The Prime Minister ought, I think, to have made some explanation of the position he took up the other night in regard to the speech delivered by the Leader of the Opposition. The position is most extraordinary, and 1 do not know to what the press of the country is coming. There is hardly an occasion when we challenge statements by the Prime Minister that he does not say that he has been misreported. Unfortunately, those reports have been circulated broadcast without any attempt on the Prime Minister's part to deny their accuracy. The honorable gentleman does not get up, as a man should, and say distinctly that' he never intended to convey the impression that has been conveyed, but he merely tells us that he has been misreported. That is not sufficient; the country ought to know more. We shall not see three-quarters of a column in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> or the other big metropolitan newspapers to-morrow morning pointing out that the statements reported were not founded on fact, and that a speech had never been delivered by the Prime Minister in the way represented. People must not run away with the idea that these statements are idly made; they all have a purpose. I am prepared to accept the Prime Minister's statement, but the press, in emphasizing the reports, do so with the object of misleading the people of the country as to the alleged extravagance of the late Government. The statement was made that the present Government, when they came into office, had to cut down the Estimates to a very considerable extent, and that had the Labour </para>

                <para class="block">Government remained in power, the expenditure would have, been so great that additional taxation would have been inevitable. Now the Prime Minister does not know anything of the kind; and, in any case, it is only an expression of opinion. I should be quite as much justified in declaring that if the present Government remain in office for another twelve months, they will have to impose an enormous income tax. These statements are all made with the special object of making the public believe that honorable members on this side have only the one wild idea of extravagance. </para>

                        <para>- the honorable member is credited with many wild ideas, and I should not like to say what is the principal one. The object of the newspapers is to get those misstatements scattered broadcast, as was shown at the last election. It was then said there would be a deficit of £1,200,000, although the then Treasurer had stated "from the public platform that there would be a surplus of £2,200,000 odd. The Prime Minister has actually had the audacity to tell the House that he has never read the statement issued by the ex -Treasurer ; but, in saying that, the Prime Minister is not speaking in accordance with fact. He declared at several meetings that he was not going to make the policy speech until such time as the ex-Prime Minister had delivered his policy speech. Day after day the present Prime Minister waited for that speech, and after it had been delivered, he commented on it; and yet he has told us that he never read it. When statements of that kind are made, they ought to be referred to in the strongest possible language. No self-respecting men would remain in office under the peculiar circumstances of today; and the Prime Minister told us that if he could not carry the Government's policy, he and his colleagues, as self-respecting men, would not continue to occupy the Treasury bench. Nevertheless, the Government have accepted the position; like the honorable member for Werriwa, they will accept any degradation - politically, of course. </para>

                        <para>- Do not talk about " eating dirt " ; one member of the Government told us on one occasion that  he had been " eating dirt " for two years. Under the circumstances, it is idle for the Government to tell us what they are going to do in tne way of straightening up the finances. Let them tell us where the wild expenditure has taken place. The honorable member for Werriwa has been candid enough to say this afternoon that in his opinion the extravagant expenditure has been in relation to military defence, and that he objects to £3,500,000 being spent in that direction. I congratulate the honorable member on his candour; and I should like to know where the honorable member for Echuca stands in this matter. That honorable member was going to prove some terrible things a little while ago, when he said that robbery and embezzlement had taken place. Up to the present, however, he has been as silent as the grave. </para>

                        <para>- But what would have been said? The Administration would have been told that they were hanging on to office for the sake of its emoluments. That was said on a former occasion. It was stated that a no-confidence motion was being discussed at length because Ministers wanted the few paltry pounds that they were receiving. We, on this side, have not degraded ourselves by making such statements against our opponents. Ministerialists have told  the people that the Fisher Government spent millions without knowing where a . sixpence of the money was going. The Prime Minister himself made that charge without being able to support it. Such extravagant statements bring discredit on those who make them. All the members of the last Parliament were responsible for knowing where the money was going. Members had the right to make all the inquiries necessary, and no Opposition ever made fuller inquiries as to how money was being spent. </para>

I would like to know what the honorable member for Echuca will do, in the event of the Government taking action against the Millers Combine, in which he is largely interested. Will he resign his seat? He does not tell us. But if he does not get from his Prime Minister permission to speak, I wonder how his electors will take it. They will say, <inline font-weight="bold">"Mr. Palmer,</inline> we never heard from you." </para>

                        <para>- It increased mine by nearly 7,000. The honorable member for Wimmera was a member of the deputation that waited on the Government respecting the provision of the electoral law which requires the signing of newspaper articles published during an election campaign, at which a number of statements were made which are regrettable. One of the principal reasons against the signing of articles was alleged to be that a number of school teachers and bank managers are the correspondents of the big newspapers, and ought not to be compelled to sign their names to the reports and articles which they send for publication. I do not say that these men act in this way from ulterior motives. They may be merely indulging in a hobby. </para>

                        <para>- Ministerialists tried to make their speeches sitting down. Your electors are desirous of hearing from you, young men. Stand up, and express your views. I indorse the statement of the honorable member for Kennedy that Ministers who will remain in office under the present conditions must be very fond of the emoluments of office, or not very particular as to the way in which the business of the country shall be carried on. The Prime Minister, the Attorney-General, and the honorable member for Grampians were recently at Wedderburn, when the Prime Minister declared that " if they could not go on they would go out." That statement was received with cheers, but the honorable gentleman has admitted all over the country that they cannot go on. It was said the other day that, because he had had to struggle  a  long time to get the Prime Ministership, he would be a fool to resign it earlier than he could help. The gallant Attorney-General, when his turn to speak came, said, " The Government would go straight forward with the plan it had mapped out." Then followed more cheers. The honorable member for Grampians said, " Members must stand shoulder to shoulder, never absenting themselves from the debates or the divisions." That was a wonderful thing for him to say, seeing that he was absent all through the last session. It came very badly indeed from the honorable member for Grampians to talk in that way before his electors. While we are prepared to discuss measures submitted by the Treasurer or other Ministers, yet,  as  things are now conducted in this country, the only channel through which  a  member's constituents can find out whether he is doing anything or not is through the medium of <inline font-style="italic">Mansard,</inline> or, if he should have a sympathetic local paper,  through some of its columns being filled with the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report of his speeches. </para>

                <para>Whether the Prime Minister is acting in this way designedly - whether Liberals have had a Cabinet or Caucus meeting - I know not; but I know of nothing which is more calculated to prevent the business of this country being conducted properly than is the behaviour of the Government at week-ends and other times. We would be less than men if we submitted to the provocation that has come from the other side. Quite a wrong impression is being circulated as to the state of the Commonwealth, because the utterances of the Prime Minister are transmitted to the other side of the world, and, in my judgment, do much damage to our great country. If there is any honorable member who ought to select his language carefully, it is he who is supposed to lead this Parliament. I know of no man who has so degraded the position of Prime Minister as the honorable member for Parramatta has done. </para>

                <para>Mr.FENTON. - One would need to go back a long way to answer that inquiry. I complain of statements which have been made from time to time in respect to the finances as they were before the 31st May, and as they are. Take, for instance, what the honorable member for Parramatta said when the policy speech of the Labour party was delivered at Maryborough. Not only then, but previously, he made erroneous statements in respect to the position of the finances. The only thing I regret is that he is not here now. I do not believe in going to a meeting to form a Liberal Institute, or to a meeting at Ryde, or a remote corner of the country to make a statement about a fellow member. Let such statements be made here, on the floor of the House, against the men at whom they are directed. I feel quite satisfied that, in any conflict or argument with his predecessor, the Prime Minister will come off very much the second best. At the beginning of this year, the honorable member for Parramatta made a political speech at Traralgon. He was followed by a special representative of the <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> and I take it that that gentleman would be very careful as to what he allowed to appear in that newspaper, in order not to put in a bad light the political party it backed and the cause he espoused. What did the honorable gentleman tell an audience at Traralgon on the 6th February ? - </para>

When the honorable member for Parramatta was speaking at Traralgon, he knew as well as most members of the late Parliament knew that instead of the Labour Government finishing with a deficit of £1,500,000, they had a surplus then of practically £2,225,000. </para>

                <para>There were 17,000 under the Public Service Commissioner, and, excluding Defence, 23,000 were in the direct pay of the Government itself. </para>

Three days afterwards the report of the Public Service Commissioner appeared, and, instead of there being only 17,000 under the control of the Commissioner, and appointed under the provisions of the Act, there were 29,272. Further, the honorable gentleman told the public that the land tax represented £1 9s. per head, and that is the statement to which the ex-Prime Minister takes great exception. In the light of his recent utterances, with all the particulars at his elbow or before his eye, I almost question whether the Prime Minister has corrected that statements At all events, I have not seen a correction.What an outrageous statement it was for him to say, at Traralgon, that the land tax amounted to £1 9s. per head. </para>

                        <para>- I know that the Prime Minister has said that he corrected the statement, but I have not seen the correction, and would be glad if he would show me the newspaper in which it appeared. The unfortunate feature is that when other misleading statements are made., as they come from a leading politician, they do harm. Of course, such statements are not likely to do any damage where the authority is known to us, but in other parts of the world they are calculated to do considerable harm to the Commonwealth. To show the evil of such statements, let me remind honorable members that at the time they were made by the honorable member for Parramatta, a member of the New South Wales 'Government and a member of the Western Australian Government were at Home, whilst the Premier of South Australia and the Premier of Victoria were on their way to London. For what purpose did those representatives of four State Governments go to the Old Country? They went there to borrow money. In the face of the outrageous and in accurate statements made by the then Leader of the Opposition and the prospective Prime Minister of the Commonwealth, I do not wonder at the representatives of the States not being able to borrow what they required. The honorable gentleman did not show much consideration to his colleagues in the political fight when they were trying to raise money on the other side of the world. The reason why I am making this protest is that practically at every week-end similar statements are made. I think it is about time that the Prime Minister, Cabinetted by Ministers or caucussed by the party, was told to give his tongue a little holiday at week-ends, because, by its use in the past he has certainly done his country no good. On 12th April - that was after the delivery of the ex-Prime Minister's speech at Maryborough - the honorable gentleman said, at Wagga - </para>

                        <para>- There is a change in the seat and also in the man. On the 10th April the honorable member for Parramatta said, at Ryde, that instead of the land tax bursting up large estates and doing other things credited to it, it evidently had not done so, because there were more persons paying land tax now than ever before.  His  statement is absolutely incorrect. It is surprising how, out of the mouths of officials, we can condemn the Prime Minister. It is that circumstance which makes me distrustful when I hear him quoting figures. I naturally wonder if they are as erratic as those which he presents to country audiences. The Prime Minister affirmed that more persons were actually paying land tax now than ever before. Yet we find that, whereas in 1911-12, 14,972 persons paid the tax, in 1912-13 only 14,293 paid it. These figures show a very considerable reduction in the number of taxpayers. Another incorrect statement which he made was that, during the past three years, there was less land under cultivation in the Commonwealth than was previously under cultivation. On this point, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs</inline> is very much opposed to him. According to the official <inline font-style="italic">Tear-Book,</inline> the area under crop in 1908-9 was 9,891,243 acres, whereas in 1911-12 it was 12,107,000 acres, an increase of 2,215,000 acres. </para>

                        <para>- I am here to say - and I can say it with every degree of certainty - that an incoming Fisher Government would never have dreamed of borrowing £3,080,000 in excess of the £24,000,000 which would have been at their disposal from ordinary revenue and the surplus of last year. What did the honorable member for Grampians tell his constituents? Did he not complain that the late Government were pouring millions of pounds out upon a useless project like that of the Federal Capital? Was not that his gospel ? Yet we find that the present Government propose to spend upon the Federal Capital more money in one year than the Labour Government expended in three years. I am certain that the same story will never go down in the Grampians electorate again. Why did not the honorable member assist honorable members upon this side of ,the Chamber in their effort to reduce the vote for the Federal Capital ? </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Gippsland made a mistake upon that occasion, and one which he will yet repent. The Prime Minister realizes that he has done the wrong thing, because he is now endeavouring to throw on the late Government the blame for the ' present * . Budget. But his statement will not be accepted by the people. The Labour party would never have borrowed £3,080,000 when they had a revenue of £21,000,000 and a surplus of £2,650,000. </para>

                        <para>- There is no doubt that the honorable member is Caucus-bound. To-day he has simply to do what he is told. When this Parliament was younger I recollect occupying a seat in the Speaker's gallery, and listening to the honorable member's denunciation of the various Tariff items as they were brought forward.. But to-day we hear none of those denunciations. The honorable member is well developed physically and mentally, and yet he sits there as docile as it is possible for him to be- </para>

                    <para>.- I wish to offer my sympathy to the Treasurer, seeing that Ministerial supporters cause the Government programme to be criticised so severely. . Members of his party who have not the courage to come here and make' statements which can be refuted, adopt the subterfuge of visiting different parts of the Commonwealth and making assertions in a most cowardly way, inasmuch as we have no chance of challenging their accuracy at the time. At public meetings and all sorts of political functions they are in the habit of indulging in declarations which are without foundation, for the purpose of scandalizing the Labour party. Consequently, upon an occasion like the present, we are bound to take the opportunity to tell them that they are not doing the right thing by members of the Opposition. I do not think that they can point to one item in the Government policy which they have attempted to bring into existence. The Ministry have merely brought forward one or two little measures for the purpose of detaining members in this city, and without any hope of passing them into law. They are merely marking time with a view to getting into recess as soon as possible. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member has remained silent in this chamber, although he would have liked to have criticised the Government. He has discovered that they are not carrying out the programme which he advocated during the election campaign, and for that reason he absents himself from this House at different periods. He goes away and remains away for a full week. Why) Because he has no confidence in the Government. He would like to come over to this side of the House, only he is afraid that if he did so he would not get the indorsement of our party. As the honorable member for Adelaide interjects, he remains where he is, in disgust of his own party. The honorable member's first speech this session was on small-pox and vaccination, but he had not the moral courage to support honorable members on this side in their efforts to secure the release of Sydney from quarantine. In the district of Werriwa he advocates the removal of the embargo, but when he is given an opportunity in this House to do something to bring that about, he is not to be found in his place. He has been silenced by his party. The Caucus has brought him to heel, and has told him plainly that if lie abuses the Government he will not secure the indorsement of the party at the next election. The weakness of the present Government is shown by the fact that the Treasurer has come down month after month for Supply. The Government have been in office now for about four months, and, though the Treasurer might be willing to do the right thing, the members of his party compel him to do things which, I am sure, he does not relish. The delay in dealing with the finances of the Commonwealth is not altogether the right honorable gentleman's fault, but is due to the desire of the Government to delay legislation. When the Works Estimates were under consideration, members on the Government side severely criticised a vote of £285,000 towards the establishment of the Federal Capital, although that was one of the best votes on .the Estimates. They are now prepared to vote millions of pounds without hesitation. The party opposite are not prepared to spend the money on the country in a legitimate way, or they would criticise some of the amounts to be covered by the Supply Bill as they criticised the vote for the Federal Capital. The fact is that they are unable to act independently of the party to which they belong. </para>

                        <para>- Some honorable members on the other side have condemned expenditure on the Northern Territory; outright, and if it is as useless as they would have us believe, I should like to know why they are supporting the expenditure in the Territory which is covered by the Supply Bill. We have been told that it is useless to spend money in the Northern Territory, and that unless people are given freeholds of land there it cannot be developed. I do not believe that the Government will ever have the power to grant freeholds in the Northern Territory, but if they are given that power there will be very little land left there for the people of Australia. The American Beef Trust or Swift and Company will secure the whole of the good land in the Territory for the purpose of growing cattle to supply their meat works. I condemn the action of the Government in spending money with the object of fostering the American Beef Trust. I hope that expenditure in the Northern Territory will be for the benefit of the people of Australia. Anything that can be done should be done to  prevent the American Beef Trust securing the land of the Northern Territory. We were told by the Attorney-General that if we could supply him with evidence of the existence of a trust, he would immediately take action against it. I think that sufficient evidence has been placed before honorable members to justify the Attorney-General in deciding that there is a trust now in existence in Queensland. The Government show no desire to prevent its growth. In a year or two it will have grown to such dimensions that it will be almost impossible to check it, and its operations will be felt, not only in Queensland, but throughout the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- They bought the Alligator Creek Meat Works about a month ago. The Government have the power to check this Trust now if they desire to do so. I have said that the Trust is establishing works on the Brisbane River, and has bought two meat-works in other parts of Queensland; but it is generally understood that they have also bought the Ramornie Meat Works, on the Clarence River. Their capital is so great, and their operations will be on such a large scale, that they will be able to drive all competitors out of the market. People are continually writing to members of this Parliament about the Trust, and, although the Government must be aware of its existence, the Attorney-General and the Minister of Trade and Customs seem to be indifferent to the matter. When people throughout the Commonwealth are being called upon to suffer from the operations of the Trust, the members of the present Government, who might check the advance of the Trust now that they have the power, will be called to account for their negligence. I wish to bring under the notice of the Treasurer an abuse of the Maternity Allowance Act by certain hospital authorities. The Lady Bowen Hospital, in Brisbane, is a lying-in hospital for poor women and unfortunate girls. It is supported entirely by public subscriptions, and is managed by the aristocratic women of Brisbane. About two days after a patient in that hospital has got over her trouble, the matron brings a written or printed form to her for signature. Its contents are not read over to the patient, but it is an application for the maternity allowance, and immediately it is signed it is sent on to the Department. When the return letter is received at the hospital, it is opened by the hospital authorities, the order is cashed, and a certain portion is retained without the consent of the patient. A day or two before a patient leaves the hospital she is asked to sign another form, which is not read over or explained to her. This form is a permission to the hospital authorities to deduct a certain amount from the maternity allowance for the expenses of the patient while in the hospital. When leaving the hospital a patient is given only £1 14s. 6d. out of the allowance of £5. That is the kind of thing that is being done in the Lady Bowen Hospital at the present time. The majority of the women who go into this hospital are in poor circumstances, and they depend on the allowance for clothing and feeding their infants after they leave the institution. One woman who was given the £1 14s. 6d. remonstrated with the matron, and received an additional amount. She asked that the money should be put in a piece of paper for her, and it was wrapped up in the envelope in which the Department forwarded the £5 allowance to her. Some immediate action should be taken to put a stop to this abuse. The postman should be empowered to hand the envelope containing the order for the allowance to the patient alone. I hope that the Treasurer will make the necessary inquiries to prevent this abuse in the future. It must have been taking place for some considerable time, because there was talk of it before I came down to Melbourne to attend this Parliament. It is not necessary for me to go into any detail on the financial question. There is no doubt that, with a falling revenue, the finances of the Commonwealth are in a bad way; and the reason is that the people have not the confidence in this Government that they had in the Fisher Administration. Honorable members opposite endeavoured to make out that if the Fisher Government had been in power the finances would have been in the same condition that we now find them; but the financial ideas and ideals of the late Administration were far superior to those of the present Government. It is the financial administrator who is most likely to be a success in politics; and we know that the Liberal party have always been a financial failure, a fact that they are now demonstrating to the people. The longer the present Government remain in office the stronger the Labour party will grow; and if the Government are allowed to go into recess - and we may let them go through - it will make our task all the. easier when the elections come round. </para>

                    <para>.- I should like to say a few words on the question of the reopening of the Tariff and the remarks of the honorable member for Capricornia this afternoon. That honorable member took exception to the questions which the Inter-State Commission propose to put to any manufacturer who desires Tariff assistance; but I disagree entirely with the honorable member in this regard. I feel proud that the InterState Commission are following on the lines I instituted when I was at the head of the Department of Trade and Customs ; and I believe that the steps now taken will place Tariff revision, and the policy of Protection, on a sounder basis than ever before in this or any other country. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know, but I think that the manufacturers ought to answer the questions honestly. The honorable member for Capricornia took special exception to the question as to the proportion of the cost paid in wages. I may say that, notwithstanding the fact that the press did their utmost to defeat me, and circulated a great number of misstatements, they could not show that I had made any pledges or promises that I had not carried out in connexion with the Tariff. The manufacturers are compelled to give similar information for the purposes of the statistical returns, and I do not see where the difficulty lies in giving it to the Inter-State Commission, although the latter, with more power than I, as Minister, possessed, require the information to be sworn to. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to know what the Ministry are going to do. The Government, in their statement, said that it was their intention to rectify Tariff anomalies, and their press supporters, at the last election, said that there were a great many that should be dealt with. At present I am merely taking an opposite view from that of the honorable member for Capricornia, who is of opinion that the Inter-State Commission have gone out of their way in asking some of those questions. We were informed in a Ministerial statement that the question of Tariff revision was to be referred to the Inter-State Commission, and that in the meantime any anomalies discovered would be rectified. We were told during the election campaign by many honorable members and their press supporters that the Tariff is reeking with anomalies which required instant attention; and no one can say that there are not anomalies. What is a perfect Tariff to-day may not be a perfect Tariff six months hence, owing to the alterations in the mode of manufacture here or elsewhere. Last Saturday the Prime Minister, at the opening of some paper-board mills in New South Wales, is reported to have said that since the inauguration of the system of encouraging enterprises of that kind, he had found none deserving of greater sympathy than that. I know that last year I met <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sands</inline> in Sydney, when he asked for some consideration for this industry, and I told him distinctly that I believed it did require some encouragement. If any great proportion of the articles now being manufactured at that factory is on the free list, the fact should receive the attention of the Government at the earliest possible opportunity. In 1911 I brought under the notice of the House about 200 items and sub-items in the Tariff, with proposals to increase the Protection in practically every case, or to make dutiable articles then on the free list. I understand that at this factory in New South Wales it is proposed to manufacture strawboard which was an item considered in the last amendment of the Tariff; and here I may say that, according to my information, unless some Protection is given on paperboard, those engaged in the enterprise will have to come down to making strawboard. However, I find that on the proposal to increase the duty on strawboard the present Prime Minister paired for the lower duty. It is interesting, also, to observe that amongst those who voted for the lower duty, in addition to the Prime Minister, were the present Minister of External Affairs, the Minister of Trade and Customs, the Honorary Minister, the honorable member for Barker, the honorable member for Franklin, the honorable member for North Sydney, the honorable member for Moreton, the Government Whip, and the present Speaker; while the honorable member for Parkes, the honorable member for Echuca, the honorable member for Wilmot, the honorable member for Grampians, and the honorable member for Wakefield, paired in the same interest. The proposal for the increased duty was defeated by the votes of those honorable members. </para>

The newspapers, which support the Government, represent everything to the detriment of the late Government in regard to the Tariff ; but if I were to give a vote like that of the honorable members I have named, I should find the fact starred up with headlines in the news column. </para>

If this mill is making paperboards that are not at present manufactured here, there ought to be no duty, but there ought to be no duty before the article is manufactured, because that would penalize those who use it. </para>

Apparently I' have touched the honorable member on the raw by showing up some of his votes so soon after the alleged Protectionist speech that he made in Sydney last Saturday. I trust that the <inline font-style="italic">Lane Cove Express,</inline> if there is such a newspaper, or any other paper published in his electorate, that gives an account of the function which he attended, will also publish my remarks to show that he voted -against the increase of duty on this item. The ex-Prime Minister to-day drew attention to the account that appeared in both the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of the opening of a Liberal Institute in -Parramatta. </para>

It was stated before the Court, on oath, during the past week by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Packer</inline> that his organization received as much from employers as it did from workers, and this is exactly the same sort of institute which the Prime Minister is -connected with, according to the name which appears in the same paper - the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> - the one account being on the news-of-the-day page, and the other on the cable page. We know that this institute is out to down the workers - to. get the workers to work for less wages - and that the employers contribute to the funds for the purpose of strike-breaking. I hope for the Prime Minister's sake that the organization in Parramatta is different from the one in Melbourne, and that those associated with it will be different, because it is known by every honorable member on that side what sort of people are associated with the Free </para>

                        <para>- In my opinion, no ; and I was slated for that  opinion  by the press which supported the honorable member. They said I was wrong in not bringing forward a whole lot more. If the Prime Minister is to be true to his press supporters, he will find some of the anomalies that they ara anxious to see rectified. The honorable member for Oxley referred to the operation of the American Beef Trust in Queensland, and I should not have referred to this question but for the interjection of the Minister of Customs, who asked how long they had been there. I believe the American Beef Trust, or the Australian Meat Company, as they call themselves in Brisbane, are either erecting or preparing the ground for erecting works. At any rate, they have had a great number of men at work on the Brisbane River for some time. Even though it was proved up to the hilt that the Australian Meat Company are Swift and Company or the American Meat Trust, it would be impossible for the Federal Government to take any action, except, perhaps, under the Commerce Act. As the honorable member for Parkes interjected this afternoon, would we be prepared to set up a different standard for Swift and Company, assuming that it is they, from the standard set up for any other exporter? The only possible means of dealing at the present time with the American Meat Trust, without an amendment of the Constitution, would be under the Commerce Act. The question is whether they would not have an opportunity of an action at law against the Commonwealth for setting up for them a standard different from that set up for other exporters of meat. I have my doubts whether any power that exists under the Commerce Act can be made operative. The company's principal man here, from America is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Malkow.</inline></para>

                        <para>- I have some very interesting matter which I intend to give the House when we come to deal with the question of the Trust, but since the 25th June I believe that the Australian Meat Company, which is practically the American Meat Trust, operating in Australia, has purchased works at Gladstone and near Cairns, and that they have been in negotiation for the purchase of others at Ramornie, in New South Wales. If they have purchased these works, and are shipping meat, there will be an opportunity for dealing with them at those works that there will probably not be at their Brisbane works for twelve months. I hope that if the Government find that the Trust are now operating here - as I believe it will be found, although they cover up their tracks pretty well-they will take every step possible to see that the Australian producers and consumers of meat are not treated as the people in America are at present. </para>

                        <para>- I think that the only power of interference that we have is given by the Commerce Act. The Attorney-General will agree with me that it is impossible to stop the Trust from erecting works in Brisbane, and that it will be impossible to take action against it until it starts to export its products. Apparently the only power that we can use against it is that given by the export provisions of the Commerce Act, and we cannot deal with the Trust until it exports. I understand that it has not yet attempted to ship 1 lb. of mutton or beef from Australia, and it is not likely to do so until the coming season. </para>

                        <para>- It is the first speech I have heard with any argument in it. We had a speech from the honorable member for Capricornia which, however well intentioned, seemed to me a sheer waste of time, the honorable member speaking apparently only to occupy the time of the Committee. The remarks of the honorable member for Maribyrnong amounted to a sort of <inline font-style="italic">post mortem</inline> examination of the speeches made by the Prime Minister before the last election, and reminded one of the well-known saying of Lord Beaconsfield, that "the most effective satire is a majority." Whatever the Prime Minister may have said to the people of New South Wales prior to the last election, the people of Australia returned the present Government to power with a working majority, which has been actually at work for four months; and if it had not been for the systematic obstruction which they have had to meet, it would have worked- to some advantage. I do not agree with the Labour politics of the honorable member for Yarra, nor do I share his fiscal opinions, but he always believes what he is saying, and says it in such a way that one can get a proposition out of him, a syllogism, something that can be taken hold of. Today he dealt at length with the fiscal question. I admit, with the Prime Minister, that the discussion of that question is irrelevant, and more than irrelevant at this time, because the appointment of the Inter-State Commission, with power to report to Parliament on Tariff matters, removes it from the arena until we get recommendations from that body. The fiscal question is practically not <inline font-style="italic">sub judice;</inline> it has been relegated to the Inter-State Commission for report.. I am very glad that it has been so dealt with, because I have always contended that the settlement of a Tariff is a work for which Parliament is quite incapable. When a Tariff is proposed, we are so infested with, and in some cases influenced by, literature from both parties  -in regard to every item, that it is impossible to obtain calm, clear and deliberate discussion. <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> rejoice that the matter is now removed to the arbitrament of a body which will look at it apart from political considerations, and submit its recommendations to Parliament. The discussion of the fiscal question is now at least irrelevant, though, I admit, that the honorable member for Yarra puts his case as well as he could. He criticised the Prime Minister for his more modern utterances on the Tariff, and I rather sympathize with the criticism. I have read some speeches of the Prime Minister, which seem to suggest the possibility of the present Liberal party proposing higher duties. I, for my part, would have no sympathy with such a movement; and I hope that it will not originate with, this party. I am glad to know that the ex-Minister for Trade and Customs approves of the questions which are to be submitted to manufacturers by the Inter-State Commission. On previous occasions, when manufacturers were complaining that they were being ruined, the question which a Free Trader would have liked to ask, in face of the cry of the consumer about the increased cost of living, was, " Is ruin staring you in the face, or are you making so much out of  your  industry that you dare not show your balance-sheet, and only want a higher duty to enable you to make more profit." During the discussion of one of the Tariffs - I do not remember- whether the last or- the one before I brought before the House the case of a hat manufactory of this State which said that ruin was staring it in the face. I happened to get hold of its balance-sheet, and found that its <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> shares were standing at 35s. in the market, and that it was paying a dividend of 10 per cent, to its shareholders and putting by 5 per cent. The series of questions which the Inter-State. Commission seeks- to put to manufacturers in order to. discover whether higher duties, are necessary to enable our industries to hold1 their own is very pertinent. In the past the manufacturer and the politician have been considered, but the unfortunate consumer-, who in the long run has to pay, has not been as much thought of as he should' have been. Some years: ago, when a motion for the appointment of a Royal Commission to investigate Tariff matters was before the House, </para>

                </continue>
                <para class="block">I asked what steps were to be taken to» cause the consumer to be represented, and was told that there need be no fear, as the members of the Commission would look after him. The Commission was composed of strong Free Traders and strong Protectionists, and made no attempt to invite the public to appoint a delegate to show to what extent high duties were affecting the prices of commodities coming under the category of: necessaries. I think that the InterState Commission will fulfil its duty in making suggestions to which we shall have to say "yea" or "nay," and I am glad that the honorable member for Yarra brought the matter forward, because, although not strictly relevant, ifr. is a useful one to have discussed. I' welcome the opportunity to express my opinion, because Opposition members never tire of twitting Ministerialists with being prevented from speaking. For myself, I do not hesitate to say that during the last three months I have not heard any arguments that seemed1 worth answering; the Opposition having done . nothing but talk against, time, with apparently no other  object than  to prevent the Government from doing business. Four Supply Bills have now been before us, and the Opposition have managed to occupy so much time over them that between whiles, it- has been impossible to pass other legislation. The. discussion of the Electoral Bill has. occupied nearly five, weeks. The Bill may contain principles which honorable members opposite, do not like, but some of them, notably the honorable member for Macquarie, have approved of some of its principles. If the Opposition really wish to do business, we should' have and opportunity to come to close quarters in* Committee. They fear that, if we do, the Government will carry some of  the most  salient features of the measure, and place them on the statute-book. We get a little tired of hearing that those on this side are not at liberty to- speak. When you find the whole of- the Opposition coming up, one after the other, as if of a set purpose, in order to. occupy the- time of the Committee, and- saying nothing that is either worth recording or worth answering, they- will understand' that honorable members- on- this side do not, speak because there, is. nothing to be-» said. </para>

                    <para>.- I desire to refer to the export of potatoes from Victoria, as it is a matter of very great interest indeed to potato-growers in this State. Probably honorable members are aware that potato growing is being carried on here practically at a loss. The troubles of the potato-growers have been accentuated by the fact that they are unable to export potatoes other than in new bags. There is no doubt that there is a combine in connexion with the sale of potato-bags, and the price has been raised from 4s. 6d. per dozen to 8s. The very fact that growers are compelled to use new bags tends to make them dearer, because they are not able to use secondhand bags, especially for export. That means to the farmer a loss of from 4s. to 5s. a ton. He is getting here to-day 22s. 6d. per ton for his potatoes, and out of that sum he has to pay about 9s. a ton for the digging, and 9s. a ton for the bags. With the other 4s. 6d. he has to take the potatoes out of the pit, fill the bags, and cart them to the railway station. A farmer in Victoria is practically selling his potatoes to-day in order to get back the money which he has paid for digging them. The position here is a serious one. When we federated it was thought that the Intercolonial barriers would be wiped away, and Inter-State Free Trade established. But if the States are to be allowed to set up what are practically prohibition orders, or to issue proclamations as to how produce shall be carried to them, they will defeat the spirit and the intention of the Constitution. The Attorney-General told me the other day that it was not for him to give an answer to a question I asked. He said it was not for him to declare whether there was anything in my contention that the States were acting contrary to the spirit of the Constitution, but that it was for the potato-growers themselves to take action. Now, that is almost impossible, because, individually, the potato-grower is a poor man, and cannot afford to test this point in the High Court as against a State. It is preposterous to imagine that he could do so. </para>

                        <para>- I intend to deal with that point briefly. Victoria is now practically free from disease, and its potatoes will bear inspection with those grown in any other part of Australia. Not only is our farmer losing money through having to use new bags, but he has to pay three inspection dues. That, of course, is a matter for the State to deal with. Firstly, the farmer has to pay 3s. for the inspection of his farm; secondly, he has to pay 6d. per ton when the potatoes are delivered at the railway station; and, thirdly, he has to pay another 6d. per ton if the potatoes are intended for export. Then, when he sends any potatoes to Western Australia, he is met with another demand. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hogan,</inline> member for Warrenheip in the State Assembly, has told me - and I believe this statement is true - that in Western Australia the charge for inspecting Victorian potatoes is 15s. per ton. I call on the Federal Government to take action in this matter. </para>

                        <para>- Victoria can interfere, and in the interests of our potato-growers it ought to take action to test the validity of the proclamation in the High Court. It is certainly not the duty of anybody else to take that step. I claim that it is the duty of the Federal Government to take action regarding the Western Australian charge of 15s. a ton, for, according to my reading of section 112, the Constitution confers that power. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, we have full power to annul any inspection charge levied by a State. The Attorney-General has just admitted that that is a fair and reasonable construction to place on section 112 of the Constitution. I agree that it was framed to enable the Commonwealth Government to act in case any State Government should try to impose an unreasonable charge. I claim that 15s. a ton is an unreasonable charge, and if it were removed it would mean financial salvation to hundreds, perhaps to thousands, of potato-growers in Victoria. </para>

I do not think there is any doubt that by their action the Government of Western Australia are defeating the spirit of the Constitution.

                        <para>- I accept the Minister's assurance, and remind him that in Victoria it is a matter of great urgency. The potatoes are in the pit, and there are markets for them in other parts of the Commonwealth. The honorable member for Maranoa, for instance, has received a letter stating that in Queensland they could do with any quantity of our potatoes, but that the inspection charges are very severe. More than that, the middlemen there, who have control of the potato trade, will take every care that Victorian potatoes do not reach those who want to use them in the inland towns. When we had the Irish blight in Victoria we were very zealous to protect one part of the State as against another part, so that the disease should not be introduced into a clean part. It was considered quite sufficient then to charge only 6d. per ton, and a very full inspection indeed was made. The Minister can understand that the potato-grower in Warrnambool did not want the blight introduced from Bungaree, or <inline font-style="italic">vice versâ</inline> and insisted that the inspection should be a vigorous one. There can be nothing in the argument which may be put forward by the Western Australian Government that it costs 15s. per ton to make the inspection. </para>

                        <para>- I am very glad to hear that statement, and now the Minister has an opportunity of stopping the Western Australian Government again. I trust that he will treat the matter as one of urgency, and make immediate representations to the Western Australian Government, and, perhaps, to other State Governments, and find out exactly what the inspection charges are. Turning to another question, I have been somewhat surprised to-night at the statements made regarding extravagant expenditure, and after reading the statement of the Treasurer, I candidly admit that, to my mind, the Commonwealth is in a serious position. This year we have to find £27,000,000. Even with our surplus of nearly £3,000,000, we have to borrow £3,000,000 to make ends meet. He would be, I think, a most optimistic member who would say that our expenditure next year will not be £30,000,000. This year we are practically £6,000,000 behind in making ends meet; yet the Government offer no suggestion as to what they intend to do if the Inter-State Commission should recommend the imposition of increased duties. To-day our revenue is £21,000,000, but if we have effective Protection the revenue may drop to £15,000,000. As a Protectionist I cannot see that effective Protection can bring in anything like £21,000,000. </para>

                        <para>- In a speech the other night the Government Whip - the honorable member for Richmond - showed how the expenditure increased under the Labour Administration. I will quote from the Treasurer's Budget statement a very effective answer to his statement. He says that during the last year of the <inline font-style="italic">regime</inline> of the Fisher Government the increased expenditure was £1,383,841. This year the increased expenditure by the anti-Labour Ministry will be £4,135,285. </para>

                        <para>- They left office with a surplus of nearly £3,000,000. The statement of the Prime Minister is a very good argument why we should not pass a Loan Bill. There should be no question about that now. He is practically boasting that the Government do not intend to spend this money, and, therefore, they will not get a vote of mine. </para>

                        <para>- I have remarked this afternoon and evening that the honorable member for Adelaide has interjected to an extent that his interjections, if counted up, would credit him with a very decent speech. There may be some provocation to interject for an honorable member sitting on the opposite side of the House to that of the honorable member who is addressing it, but there is very little justification for an honorable member interjecting when he is sitting upon the same side of the chamber as the honorable member who is in possession of the floor. I hope, therefore, that I shall be allowed to conduct our proceedings in accordance with our Standing Orders. </para>

It is estimated that this year we shall expend £4,000,000 odd on our Naval and Military Forces, £1,000,000 on the construction of the Fleet, £300,000 on land required for defence purposes, and £175,000 on machinery and construction works at Cockatoo Island. In other words, we are going to expend nearly £6,000,000 on defence. I think that the people of Australia will find it impossible to bear this burden. Our expenditure on defence has increased from 18s. 6d. to 23s. per head. </para>

                        <para>-r-l realize that Australia ought to be. defended, but I am very much afraid that a few military  officers are running the Commonwealth so far as the expenditure on defence is concerned. This is going to be a burden that the people cannot bear. This year the increased expenditure on our Naval and Military Forces will be £1,000,000- an increase of 5s. per head. Evidently the Estimates submitted by the military officers have been accepted <inline font-style="italic">in globo,</inline> and we are asked to sanction them. The Government propose to borrow money for defence purposes. If it were not for this vast expenditure on defence, there would be no necessity to borrow £3,000,000. But for that expenditure we would be able to make ends meet. If it be essential that we should expend £3,000,000 more on defence this year we should vote that money, but we should see that it comes from direct taxation. I shall not vote for any proposal under which the workers will pay any portion of that taxation. I recognise that they did enough when they submitted to the compulsory training system. The toilers willingly allow their sons to be trained, and trained under very great difficulties in some cases. I trust that the Prime Minister will lose very little time in looking into two matters which were mentioned here last week. I hope he will endeavour to induce the State authorities to carry the trainees over the railways free of charge. In the constituency of the honorable member for Maribyrnong, the lads have to pay their own fares from Sunshine every time they come into town to drill. </para>

                        <para>- It is very unfair. If the Prime Minister cannot arrange with the State Government to . carry the boys free when they are in uniform, we should shoulder the burden here. I know of some lads in our Citizen Forces who have to lose a day's work in order to attend compulsory drills. They are only in receipt of 20s. or 25s. per week as farm labourers. They have to come from Gordon. They go to Ballarat, and thence to the Canadian Ranges, and they are not allowed a penny to provide themselves with food. They have to stay there the whole day, and they do not get back to their homes until 9 or 10 o'clock at night. 1 asked the officer in charge of them what one lad was going to do for dinner, and he replied, " He must put a sandwich in his haversack." [ said, " That is all right, but the lad gets up very early; the baker calls al his place about twice a week, and the bread will be pretty stale, and he will not bs likely to enjoy it very much at dinnertime after tramping about the ranges." I said then, " What is he going to do for tea?" and the reply was, "He gets into Ballarat at 6 o'clock at night, the train arrives at 7, and it would not be long for him to have to wait. If he is very hungry he can pull up his belt a hole or two." I said that seemed very cruel, and I pointed out that the young fellow would be walking past fish-shops and restaurants, and would smell the steak and onions, and it was not fair that he should be kept without food. </para>

                    <para>.- I rise to direct the attention of the Government to a matter of importance which, so far as I know, has not yet been touched upon in this debate. I refer to the necessity of the Government taking action early to relieve the people of Sydney of the embargo which has been irritating, exasperating, and ruining many of them during the last three or four months. It would seem that, having issued their proclamation putting the 15 miles area of Sydney under quarantine, the Government consider that it would be undignified of them to respond to the appeal of the people to remove the embargo. Assuming that this was a real outbreak of small-pox, which might develop into one of the epidemics of which we have read in days gone by in other countries, there might have been some reason for the drastic step taken by the Government to protect one part of Australia from the spread of an epidemic raging in another. But, although there have been one thousand cases of the illness, there has not been one death, and that is a record for an epidemic disease which is not equalled in any other country in the world. With this evidence before them that this is not a malignant or dangerous form of small-pox, the Government should have realized that their drastic action was unnecessary, and that the penalty they are imposing upon the people of the Commonwealth, and particularly of New South Wales, is unjustifiable in the extreme. By an act of administration the Government have forced thousands of people in New South Wales to undergo vaccination, to subject themselves to serious illness in many cases, and in some cases to follow their relatives to the grave, because of the use of bad vaccine in the early days of the epidemic. Many lives have been sacrificed as a result of the action taken by the Government, and, in the circumstances, one would think that they would not hesitate for a moment to review the whole situation. The Prime Minister has frequently referred to this matter in terms which indicate that the Government do not take a serious view of it. It is all very well to say that they are protecting the other States, but I venture to say that no Government in any other country would have been tolerated so long as the present Government have been if they had imposed so unjustifiable an embargo upon a city of 750,000 people. There are many authorities to-day who hold, as I have held all along, that this epidemic is not small-pox but cow-pox. The fact that no deaths have resulted from it supports that conclusion. But that does not concern the Government, or <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Cumpston,</inline> their guide, philosopher, and friend in this matter. When appealed to, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Cumpston</inline> says that there are still a great many people within the quarantine area who are not yet immune from small-pox. He indicates that he is not prepared to lift the embargo until every person residing within the quarantined area is vaccinated. That is unworthy of any medical or scientific man having the knowledge which <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Cumpston</inline> should have of this epidemic. The press of New South Wales, as well as some of the public men who have been responsible very largely for urging vaccination upon the people, are to-day urging the Government to lift the embargo. The <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald,</inline> only a fortnight ago, having probably received a hint from the people who are suffering financially in Sydney as the result of the embargo, published a leading article quite opposed to the articles it published for many weeks after the outbreak of the disease. It urges the Government now to relieve the city of Sydney from this unjustifiable and undreamt-of quarantine, but the Government failed apparently to recognise the seriousness of the position for which they are responsible. The Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> for weeks urged the people to go into the shambles and be vaccinated, and take into their systems germs from which they may suffer severely by-and-by. This newspaper, with its scare articles, was largely responsible for hounding thousands of people to vaccination, but it has referred in a recent issue to the quarantine embargo as calculated to make the administration of the Quarantine Department the laughing-stock of the world. The Prime Minister has seen a report from a patient isolated at the Quarantine Station at North Head saying that he was well treated, and that everything was all right, and he takes that report as if it were gospel truth. I wish the honorable gentleman were present to listen to a statement which I have here. He is a New South Welshman, and we should at least expect that he would see justice done to the State from which he comes. I have here a list of complaints from patients who have been treated at the Quarantine Station, published in a newspaper that formerly upheld the action of the Government. The information is supplied by the senior partner of a Sydney firm. It is not a nondescript who writes this, but a man whose word can be relied upon, and whose character will stand investigation, but he desires that, for business reasons, his name should not be printed. How many men have had to be vaccinated for business reasons through the action of the Minister of Trade and Customs ? How many employes have been forced to undergo vaccination in order to protect their employers? How many business men have themselves undergone vaccination in order to overcome the prejudices of people created by newspapers and the scare set up by the Federal authorities? This gentleman writes - </para>

                    <para>The sanitary arrangements were unspeakably vile; in fact, there were none at all. The place reeked with filth, and though the attendants did their best, the task was wholly beyond so small a staff. I will just give an instance of how persons suffered through insufficient attendance. When I was well enough to leave I was stripped to have a disinfecting bath, and my clothes were taken away to be fumigated. Well, the attendant who took my clothes away had work to do at the other end of the station, with the result that after I finished my bath I had no clothes and had to sit in a corner for over half-an-hour with nothing round me but a damp towel. How long I would have had to stay like that I do not know, but I managed to get another patient to go and fossick out my clothes. When I got them I lost no time in shaking the dust of quarantine off my feet, I can tell you. </para>

                        <para>- All the bathing in the world would not make the honorable member for Indi clean - politically, of course. In my judgment, the Minister has never comprehended the seriousness of this trouble, nor recognised the injury he is doing. I do not say that the Minister does not care, but he cannot know the number of lives that have been sacrificed on the altar of vaccination, though, of course, he does know that this alleged small-pox has not caused the loss of one life. Yet there are authorities, higher than <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Cumpston,</inline> prepared to show that this is not small-pox, but pure cowpox. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member fancies that he is in a Police Court where he is allowed to take a lot of liberty. If the honorable member is being briefed or . prompted- by the Minister of Trade . and Customs, I am not here to answer queries of the kind. It is notorious that the newspapers, who have been largely responsible, for the scare, have refused to publish communications giving the other side, no matter by whom sent. Many persons, some of them sufferers, have written giving their experiences, but the press has religiously and unjustly refused to ventilate their side of the question; and it is for that reason that the honorable member for New England is so ignorant on the subject. Let the honorable member inquire from the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald,</inline> the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph,</inline> the <inline font-style="italic">Evening News,</inline> and other papers which support his party, how many letters setting forth vividly what this embargo means to the people of New South Wales, have been thrown into the waste-paper basket. The honorable member for Newcastle knows of a person who has been in bed for fifty-one or fifty-two days with erysipelas, claimed by his medical advisers to have supervened on vaccination. But, of course, all cases of that .kind are of no consequence to the Government; they do not care how many widows or orphans may be left because of the scare and a system of vaccination imposed, not legally, but indirectly, by regulation on the <inline font-style="italic">ipsi dixit</inline> of one man. Are the Government really trying to get to the bottom of the matter? The very first thing they should have done was to appoint a body to investigate, and not to rely on one person. </para>

                        <para>-Wise men governed the country at that time, and they resorted to isolation. When small-pox broke out in a malignant form, and people died, the disease was stamped out in one-third the time that the Government have been playing with it on the present occasion. The Government declare that they are not going to take any action while there are any new cases of this alleged small-pox. If the Government keep on their present method it will spell ruin to hundreds of people in Sydney and suburbs, because the cow-pox will continue. The Government shelter themselves behind the medical .officer, or behind the State authorities; but the quarantine area is a Federal area, and the staffing and sanitary conditions are a Federal responsibility. I cannot think that the Minister has ever made any personal investigation, although he has been vaccinated, and ought to consider himself immune. I make another appeal to the honorable gentleman to lift this quarantine. </para>

                        <para>- I accept the honorable member's statement in that form, but I understood him to repeat a statement he made to-night about the number of deaths from vaccination. He drew harrowing pictures of the deaths of persons leaving widows and orphans. These deaths could not be very well due to small-pox, because the honorable member said there were no deaths due to that disease. What was the cause of the deaths of these persons, if the honorable member did not imply that they were due to vaccination ? The natural conclusion from the honorable member's remarks was that those deaths were due to vaccination, or else his words had absolutely no meaning. We know, from the inquiries that I made at the request of honorable members opposite, that the medical authorities in Sydney certified that there had not been a single death due to vaccination. When the honorable member gets official information of that kind from the State authorities who know all about it, he should accept it. </para>

                        <para>- When a man starts a fad, and advocates it all over the country, he calls any official statement which tells against him biased. No one would believe that the State authorities would supply false information to this House. I have the highest opinion of them. These returns are based upon statutory returns based in turn upon certificates of deaths supplied to the proper authorities, and how <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. King,</inline> the secretary of the Board of Health in Sydney, could falsify them by any prejudice in his mind, is beyond me. I do not understand the honorable member's attitude, and that statement of his, when examined, is found to have just as much foundation as his statement of deaths due to vaccination. I am just as anxious as is any other honorable member to know the absolute truth of the matter, and if the honorable member for Gwydir will supply us with information as to any death due to vaccination, I shall be very glad to ascertain the facte. Our only desire should be to avoid making party politics of this matter. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member has constantly, although he knows that some of these matters are within the jurisdiction of the State, sought to make political capital at the expense of the Government. I do not object to the honorable member blaming the Department for anything the Department does, but a great many of his statements have just as much foundation as the one to which I have already referred. He has to-night brought before the Committee a number of statements which have appeared in the newspapers. I can quite understand, as regards these patients, that a person who has been there, and who is in business, not wanting to give his name to the press, but I cannot understand why any patient who has been through the quarantine station, and who has suffered, should not make a statement to the proper authorities in order that the matter may be investigated. Notwithstanding that these statements were anonymous, since they were made I gave instructions that the facts should be investigated, but the difficulty was that the persons who were making them were not there. If any person making them will come forward and supply the name, we shall be only too pleased to have an investigation made, but so far as I know, there has been no foundation for any of the statements made. </para>

                    <para>.- An item appears on the Estimates relating to the Fitzroy Dock. About fourteen blacksmiths and others were put off work there at the end of last week. The reason given was that no plans or details were coming from Melbourne to keep them at work. Do Ministers think that the best and most economical way to carry on the construction of ships is to keep the plans and details in Melbourne when they should know that they are wanted on the spot? It must mean delay, and the Minister should, if he desires to run his Department on business, lines, remove them to where the construction is going on. No business man would keep his plans and details 600 miles from where he was constructing his ships. It is a serious thing for men to be put out of work, and if the plans are not sent over more rapidly than at present, more people will be put off, and this will reflect upon the Administration. I know that the plans and details were kept in Melbourne when the previous Government were in power, but, all the same, the system is a mistake. Everything should be on the spot. It is an island, and all the plans would be perfectly safe. I ask the Treasurer, in the interests of those employed there, that facilities should be given for the men to draw their plans and keep the details in Sydney. </para>

                    <para>.- It is not pleasant for a Minister to suggest that a member is doing something with an ulterior motive when he is doing it honestly in the interests of people who, he feels, are being injured by the action of the Government. The Minister of Trade and Customs has, as is usual when any member of the Government makes a statement, cleared out of the chamber, instead of staying to hear the reply. This is one of the things that show that they have a weak case, and are unable to stand by what they say. The honorable member tried to make out, because I quoted something published under a <inline font-style="italic">nom de plume</inline> in a responsible newspaper, that the information is not to be relied upon. It is the place of the Government, when direct statements are published, to investigate them, especially when they can locate them, as they can the statements I have read to-night. As far as concerns the honorable member's imputation as to my motives, he is welcome to his opinion. I hold just as strong opinions on the other side as to the efficacy of vaccination as, probably, he or <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Cumpston</inline> does, and I am entitled to express them in the House, if I believe that by doing so I shall bring relief to a large number of people who are suffering, and who the great newspapers of the State are declaring today are being unfairly and unjustly treated. The <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> is now calling it an absurd quarantine, and an unjust imposition upon the people, although for many weeks it said nothing. Is it saying this now because the business people of Sydney have had a series of meetings, and have, I believe, notified the newspapers that if they continue to boom this alleged smallpox they can look forward to a material reduction in their advertising contributions? We must naturally look for some reason why the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> have now assumed the position of critics of that which they formerly supported. The <inline font-style="italic">Telegraph</inline> says that the Government are the laughing-stock of the world. Will the Minister of Trade and Customs imply that the <inline font-style="italic">Telegraph</inline> does not know what it is talking about? It has all the sources of information available. It has the key to the whole position; it has its men in and out reporting these cases from day to day; and, with all this knowledge, it is forced to affirm that the Government are making themselves the laughing-stock of the world. ' How can one think anything else, when we know that there is no country in the world where small-pox has existed that has ever done such a ridiculous and absurd thing as the Federal Government have done by imposing an embargo, and all the difficulties entailed thereby, upon the public? The Minister, who tries to undermine the efforts of any one who endeavours to bring relief, says that I referred to the Government. To whom else can I refer? Who else is responsible for the embargo ? Because I have tried from day to day, and from week to week, to impress the Government with a sense of responsibility and wrong-doing, the Minister has had the temerity to say that I have been actuated by political motives. The life, death, and health of the community are matters too important to be the plaything of party politics. I hold, as many others do, that the action of the Government has brought into Australia an evil that is becoming obsolete in other countries. A Government that tries to cure disease by the indirect method of vaccination, when that disease can be dealt with successfully only by isolation, sanitation, and segregation, does not understand the drift of modern medicine and science. The Minister says, " I have made inquiries from reliable sources, and have information based on the certificates of medical men who have attended the patients, and there is not one case of death which is attributed to vaccination." If a public inquiry were held, and opportunity were given to those who know the condition of the victims immediately after vaccination, and from then until the time of death, a different conclusion would be come to. The doctors certify only as to the final cause of death, generally stating it to be heart failure. They do not say what brought about the heart failure. Who would expect the admission from the medical profession that death has resulted from vaccination, when a large number of the members of the profession, whenever a small-pox epidemic breaks  out, make it the excuse to cry, " Vaccinate, vaccinate." Why do the doctors urge wholesale vaccination? Is it because they know vaccination to be beneficial <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> No. It is merely a medical fetish that is now tabooed by the wisest scientists. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister must have known that his charges against me would be replied to, but he nevertheless left the chamber. He attributed my action to quite other than the real causes. Would he say that the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> was trying to make political capital out of this subject? He knows as well as I do that the medical certificates on which he bases the statement that there has been no death as the result of vaccination are certificates giving merely the final symptoms before death, not the real causes which culminated in deaths from blood-poisoning, heart-failure and erysipelas. The doctors do not say what were the primary cause of those terminations of life. But the friends of the victims, who saw them immediately after vaccination, and witnessed their subsequent sufferings and symptoms, could prove that they would be alive to-day had they not been vaccinated. The Minister does not concern himself with that. He is content to accept the certificates of the members of a largely biased profession, who always make a lot of money out of a visitation of this kind. Take, for instance, the doctor who vaccinated a staff - and riot a very large one .either - in a big office in Sydney. It took him two hours and a half, and he lifted 80 guineas for the work. So it is with the doctors who privately have charged from half-a-guinea up to two or three guineas for the operation. But that was nothing compared with the business which was brought to them afterwards as the result of the vaccination. These men were largely interested in vaccination from a financial stand-point, and I know from some of them that nothing but the financial side of the question appealed to them. Yet these are the men upon whom the Minister relies to guide him. I shall continue to refer to this matter so long as the Government continue to be, in the words of the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph, "</inline> a laughing-stock *f the world." So long as they adhere to their present attitude, I shall persist in my effort to prove that that newspaper is right, and that the Government are reckless and indifferent to the appeals which are made, not only from this side of the chamber, but from their own side. What has happened to the honorable member for Werriwa ? He can stand on a public platform, and denounce the actions of the Government; practically he can agree with those who are opposed to the embargo on Sydney; he can help them to pass resolutions, but here he dare not say a word. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member to-day dare not say a word in that direction. Here we have a Government  who are adding millions to the public expenditure in every direction, and "the watchdog of economy " has not barked once - not even howled. When the honorable member was on the hustings, he told the people that every man ought to be in his place, shoulder to shoulder, man to mau, to fight the destinies of this country against " that beastly Labour party." He said that every honorable member ought to be here every day. </para>

                        <para>- I suppose that he had in his mind the address which he delivered when he slated the " beer  sparrers'  and " beer  chewers."  He did not' say anything about the men who drink some of the inferior wines which he makes. The honorable member is always parading as a financial authority and as an exemplar of what a member of Parliament should be. He says that an honorable member should never be out of his place in the House, that he should closely follow every debate, and thoroughly scrutinise every item on the Estimates. The Government Whip interjects. I do not know what the honorable member said, but it cannot be much, seeing that it produces such hilarity on the part of the honorable member for Wilmot. Here is another authority on finance who has not dared to open his mouth in this chamber since the session began. Yet this financial guide of the party now "rushes into the newspapers. He has endeavoured to relieve his feelings by some inimitable laughter. </para>

Home is the last place to which the Government should think of going, considering the progress they are making. Before he goes to bed to-night, I would like the Treasurer to read the leading article published in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> to-day, which was quoted by the honorable member for Capricornia this afternoon. When he has done so he will not say, "Let us get home, but "Let us get to work," so as to lift the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> out of its despondent condition. When the Government lose the support of the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> what will they have left? </para>

                        <para>- Let him raise the embargo, and he will see how silent I will be. But while <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Cumpston</inline> is urging that the other half of the people of Sydney should be vaccinated, I shall not cease to do my duty. No man who understands the circumstances of the case would for a moment dogmatize as to whether this embargo should be retained. A similar embargo has never been imposed in any other country in the world. Surely it is sufficient evidence that not one death has occurred in Sydney, although there have been a thousand cases of alleged small-pox there. Surely it is sufficient to know that there are men in the medical profession who are qualified to judge, and who declare that it is not small-pox at all, but merely cow-pox. Yet the Government only wish to know what <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Cumpston</inline> says. They will accept no other guide. In spite of all the appeals which have been made to them by honorable members, and in spite of the appeals of the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> not to make themselves the laughing-stock of the world, they still remain adamant. All they reply is, " Vaccinate the other half of the people of Sydney, and then we may lift the embargo." </para>

                    <para>. -  I am getting rather afraid of our commitments upon defence, and I am of opinion that it is about time we called  a  halt. In this .Bill I find that provision is made for the expenditure of £300,000 during one month, and it is to be absorbed in " contingencies," " miscellaneous services," and " petty cash." Of course I am satisfied that the Ministry recognise that a halt will have to be called some time in our expenditure upon defence. All over the world Governments are expending more in this direction than they can afford, and we seem to be following in their footsteps. Whilst I am of opinion that it is imperative that we should defend Australia, it seems to me that the Department is expending money without giving us a return commensurate with that expenditure.. We have only to look at the Department to find that it is nothing but  a  seething mass of discontent. I do not know who is responsible for this. Whether the Department is too big for a Minister to handle, I cannot say with any degree of assurance. But day after day I have submitted to me most peculiar anomalies in it. At one time a decision will be given which will suit one man or set of men, and in almost parallel circumstances a different method of administration will be applied to another man or another set of men. That naturally breeds discontent. I do not care in what walk of life a man may be placed, he expects to be treated in the same way as his compeers. I recollect a few years ago when a crisis was created in this House because of the desire of a majority that  a  Commission should be appointed to investigate the inner working of the Postal Department. It was proved beyond a doubt that it was necessary that such an investigation should take place. I read the report of the Commission, and picked out from the evidence the portions in which I was interested. If an inquiry was necessary in the case of the Postal Department, we can say with perfect assurance, that the administration of the Defence Department needs a similar inquiry much more urgently. We have to take into consideration the fact that while the Post and Telegraph Department is an earning Department, the Defence Department is a spending Department. We are paying money for defence as for insurance. </para>

                        <para>- I agree with the honorable member. The men are not satisfied, and no one who gives the matter any consideration can be satisfied with the results from our expenditure on defence. I could enumerate many ways in which we could get a better return for our money. We find one Department overstocked and overmanned, and yet a demand made for more men. We find another under-stocked and undermanned, and no effort made by the sub-heads of the Department can bring about any improvement of the condition of affairs. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. The irregularities in connexion with that Department demand serious attention. I have been, perhaps, more closely associated with the Defence Department than have most of the members of the Committee. My electoral division has within its boundaries most of the branches of the Department in Victoria, and naturally  irregularities in connexion with it are freely brought under my notice. There are dozens of cases which I might every day bring before the Department to secure redress, but I am unable to do so. I believe that the Minister of Defence is earnest in the desire to carry out the administration of the Department properly, but, like every Minister who has preceded him, he is surrounded by a body of officers who are determined that they shall run the show and be the real administrators of the Department. The Minister feels that he is a layman in charge of a highly technical Department, and must proceed with great care. Naturally he does not like to take a stand, if he proposes any departure from the advice of his officials, unless he is very sure of his ground. Rather than create .a position which as a layman he could not maintain, he allows matters to go by the board. That is not a good thing for Australia. From many matters which have como under my notice it has been proved that it is useless to appeal te the Defence Department for information or to have wrongs redressed. If honorable members put questions concerning the administration of defence on the notice-paper, they will find that the Minister in this House representing the Minister of Defence will ask them to be good enough to let the matter in which they are interested stand over until next Thursday. On next Thursday they will be asked to put it off until the following week. Last session I put some questions on the paper to which lying answers were given, and I was put off until Parliament was dissolved. I had to wait until we met again, this year to get answers to questions which I submitted last October. </para>

                        <para>- To some, but not to all of them. If it is thought that I am drawing the long bow, I ask any honorable member to put a question concerning a defence matter on the paper, and he will find that the officials will beat all round the bush, and will not answer the question directly. The Minister seems to be helpless.  His  officials will not report upon a question put to them. I do not wish to particularize any branch of the Department. We know that, no matter how well men are treated, some will imagine that they have grievances. It is an Englishman's prerogative to have a grievance, and we must take a lot of the complaints that are made with a grain of gait. But I say that, no matter how unfairly a man may be treated in the Defence Department, he has to surmount enormous difficulties to get his case placed before the responsible head of the Department, the Minister. He has to follow a course of procedure recognised in military and naval quarters. He must first of all ask for redress from his immediately superior responsible officer.  His  complaint is then passed on to another responsible officer. If the officers are against the man who complains, they keep back his complaint. They pigeonhole it, and it may take years before it reaches any person who can redress the wrong complained of. I charge the heads and sub-heads of the Defence Department with having repeatedly taken this stand against men who have been seeking redress. To mention a particular case, I may say that last October it came to my knowledge that the petty officers and warrant officers who had been brought out from England were receiving 2s. per day lodging allowance, while men who had been in Australia before, and were doing exactly the same work, did nob receive the allowance. It is admitted that that was not fair. The honorable member for Adelaide at the time represented the Defence Department in this House, and I put a question on the subject on the paper, which was answered in a manner that showed an intention to deceive. </para>

                        <para>- This occurred under the late Government. It has become apparent, I think, to honorable members on both sides that when I speak on these matters it is not a question with me of any particular Government or Minister. I trust that the honorable member for Echuca will not treat defence questions as party questions. As I say, I received an answer that was intended to deceive, and I was asked to put off the question for a week. It was further postponed, and Parliament had actually prorogued before I got a reply. I made a complaint, and there was au inquiry ; but it was not until the present Government got into power that I could extract from the defence officials the report, which showed that the men had been treated wrongly, and that they had been paid their back money, putting them on an equality with the imported men. Then there are Australian regulations and British regulations, and  "the military authorities use either that suit them when dealing with the men. There are men here who are receiving one-third more pay than they would in England, while others, doing the same work, ave receiving one-third less than they would in England. It is almost impossible to reach the Minister past the Commandant, or the Commanding Officer of a division, and much more so to get past the Naval or Military Board; and when you do get to him, neither he nor you have time to look into all the details of the many cases that require investigation. The subordinate officers ought to secure a fair and square deal to all ; and, if they do not, and the Minister cannot be reached, then I say that the Defence Department requires an inquiry just as much as does the Post and Telegraph Department. We are asked to vote the large sum of £300,000 for one month, and I point out that while we have, say, a definite sum of £200 down for pay, we have contingencies set down at £2,000, while, with pay at £700, the vague term ' ' contingencies " is responsible for £15,000, and so on. There should be some method of securing that the money shall be so expended as to give a full return, and that those in subjection to the officers and the Boards should have a fair deal. We have always boasted of being able to run our Departments on common-sense and Democratic, or, as the Government would say, Liberal, lines; and there is no reason why we should follow the systems of older countries which are based on militarism. As matters stand, if a mau endeavours to redress a wrong, he finds himself so persecuted that it would have been better for him to have kept his mouth shut. The authorities go so far as to interfere with his social life. I suppose we are all agreed that when a man has done the work he is paid for, how he occupies himself afterwards is a matter for himself, always providing that it is not to his discredit or does not make him unfit for duty; and it is exactly under this latter proviso that the interference takes place. Of course, we have no desire to name the officers who are responsible for this; but if the Naval Board and other authorities will not allow the warrant officers and the rank and file to get justice, names will have to be mentioned, or steps taken to have a full inquiry into the administration. Discontent in the Defence Department is more detrimental to a country than discontent in any other Department. I should like to see a Defence Minister in this House with some power and responsibility. The Honorary Minister has given defence matters much thought, and is quite fitted to take some responsibility in administration. The Minister of Defence does not object to listen to complaints or grievances, but, as a matter of fact, he has not the time to go into the multitudinous matters. It so happens that my constituency is much interested in defence matters. I think the Prime Minister will admit that when he was in charge of the Defence Department, although I worried him a great deal, I was always fair in my dealings with him, and I believe the Government of the day will not charge me with being unfair in any statements I make. </para>

                        <para>- No, I cannot say he was. When I make a statement such as I make to-night, it is only with a view of having the matter thoroughly considered. The Defence Department is a large spending Department, and its outlay is increasing. The Northern Territory or the transcontinental railway is nothing as a sink for money when compared with the Defence Department, yet we in this House, which is supposed to be the superior House so far as the purse is concerned, are utterly at sea as to what is being done in that particular Department. Either we shall have to get a Minister in this House really responsible for the Department, or we shall have to have an inquiry to find out who is responsible, so that the members of the House can go to him with matters that come under their notice. If this is not done, I shall endeavour to get other members who are interested in defence administration and expenditure to join me in taking steps to see that the money is spent in the right direction with due economy and a fair return, and that individuals in the Department get justice meted out to them. </para>

                        <para>- Wherever one goes he hears comments as to the Defence Department becoming a large spending Department. We recognise that we must prepare for defence, but the expenditure must be carefully watched. When witnessing the arrival of the Australian Fleet in Sydney Harbor, one could hear everywhere comments about the magnitude of the defence expenditure, and queries as to where we were going to stop, and whether we were spending the money in the right direction. I trust that the Ministry will consider this matter from both stand-points, and provide the opportunity for honorable members to place matters before them, so that they may get redress as far as individuals in the Defence Department' are concerned, and see how the money is spent. </para>

                    <para>.- If the Government are going to cut £1,000,000 off the Estimates, what are they going to take it from, and why is that £1,000,000 there? Is it to come off the Postal Department? Member after member complains that telephones are needed all over the country, and if the retrenchment is going to take place at the expense of the Postal Department, it will be a very bad thing, and ought not to be allowed. The Prime Minister blurted this statement out the .other night. I know he did not intend to make it, and was afterwards sorry he did make it, because he is evidently troubled about it to-night, or he would not have made the remark he did to the honorable member for Ballarat. </para>

There is no greater offender in that regard than the honorable member himself.

                        <para>- According to the Prime Minister, every one misrepresents him. I have never tried to do so. I have accepted the newspaper reports in good faith, and have based my questions on them. There are one or two matters to which I wish to refer in this debate. For instance, the Postmaster-General, during the electoral campaign, told his constituents that it was a wicked waste to spend money on the Federal Capital - that the Capital should be in Melbourne or in Sydney. He said, too, that the transcontinental railway meant another waste of money. What is the honorable gentleman's present position in regard to those big national questions? I should like to know how the construction of the transcontinental railway is progressing. I understand that the line is not being constructed as quickly as it should be, and I have been led to believe that the saving of £1,000,000 which the Government expect to make this year will be made at the expense of the line. If the Postmaster-General has his way, the Federal Capital expenditure will also be starved. Victorian members should be the last to offer objections to the spending of money on the Federal Capital. They have had their fair share of Federal expenditure. It was anticipated by the members of the first Parliament that the Parliament would meet in Melbourne only for two or three years ; but it has now been meeting here for thirteen years, and will probably meet here for another six or seven years. </para>

                        <para>- I expect to be there soon, and I hope that the Government will not save money in that direction. The trans-Siberian railway was laid at the rate of 18 miles a week; and, seeing that the trans-Australian railway will traverse flat country, offering few engineering difficulties, and with no large water-courses, it ought to be laid at the rate of at least 20 miles a week. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister of Home Affairs went to Port Augusta to see how things were being done there. Just before he went, we heard that the track-layer which had been purchased by the previous Government, was a valueless machine, which had cost a lot of money that had been wasted. The late member for Fremantle told us that the purchase of the machine was a wilful waste of money. But the Minister, on his return, told us that it was the most wonderful machine that he had seen in Australia, and was capable of doing the work of dozens of men. The trouble was that the contr actor who engaged to supply trucks failed to do so, and the machine could not work to its full capacity. Now that the trucks are available, the machine has become the most useful thing that could be obtained for its purpose. I hope that the railway will be pushed on as fast as possible. </para>

                        <para>- That is so; but difficulties are always met with at the start of an enterprise. But now that the work has been started, there is ample money left to our honorable friends to carry it right through. I wish to see the construction of the railway pushed on as quickly as possible. The Government ought to make au effort to push on .with the work, and show us exactly what they can do in administering the Department. They would then be doing a good thing for the people of Australia, particularly those who live in Western Australia. Although, probably, at first the line may not be so successful as we anticipated, still I trust that the earliest opportunity will be taken to push ahead with its construction. There are one or two other matters on which I desire to say a few words. </para>

                        <para>- And it is time that we did away with that loss. It was the policy of the late Government to build a railway from Pine Creek to the Katherine, and to establish freezing works at Port Darwin. I venture to say that the Minister of External Affairs has been told that it is necessary for the development of the Territory that freezing works should be established there. When I was in the Territory, a deputation waited on me, and urged that freezing works should be erected there. My reply was that the Government were quite prepared to place upon the Estimates a sum of money for that purpose; but I desired to know the most suitable site upon which to erect them, and until the Administrator was satisfied on that point, I was not willing to agree to any particular site. At that time the Administrator had been in the Territory only a week or two, and, consequently, was not in a position to say which was the most eligible site. Within a few months, however, he communicated with me to the effect that Port Darwin was the proper place at which to establish the works. In order to develop the Territory, it is necessary, not only that freezing works should be erected there, but that a railway should be constructed from Pine Creek to the Katherine. Had the Fisher Government remained in office, we should have placed upon the Estimates for the current financial year a sum sufficient to cover the cost of erecting freezing works at Port Darwin. In order that no time should be lost in the construction of those works, the Administrator, when lie came south, placed himself in communication with some architects who had had a great deal of experience in connexion with similar works elsewhere. The result was that arrangements were made for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. D'Ebro</inline> to visit the Territory for the purpose of deciding upon the locality where the works should be established, and of procuring plans and specifications relating to same. Upon an important matter of principle, therefore, there has been a reversal of policy by tins Government. If we are to wait "until a private company is prepared to undertake the establishment of these works, delay will be inevitable. Seeing that the development of the Territory depends upon their erection, it is not wise that this matter should be left in the hands of private enterprise. If private enterprise is to be permitted to establish freezing works there, it will take into serious consideration the question of pro/its, and I do not see why the development of a large portion of the Territory should depend upon whether certain persons can make  a  profit or not. If the Government undertook the erection of freezing works at Port Darwin, those works could be carried Oh as a business concern, and made to pay their way, together with sufficient interest on their capital cost. But beyond that there would be no necessity to make  a  profit, because of the direct benefit that would accrue to the people in the way of the development of big pastoral 'areas. I admit that, if every pastoralist in the Territory had a certain interest in the works- </para>

                        <para>- And this is all the thanks I get for it. I feel very strongly on this matter. The Minister administering the Northern Territory is here now, and I would ask him whether the Opposition have been unfair or unreasonable in any of their criticisms of the present administration of the Northern Territory. One reason why they have not is, perhaps, the fact that the honorable member for Angas is Minister of External Affairs, and every member on this side is anxious that nothing unkind or discourteous should be said of him. If another Minister occupied the position, it is possible that he would not have had as easy a time as the honorable member for Angas has had. We have to face the facts as they are. It must be admitted that there is a very powerful Beef Trust in America. The Attorney-General will admit that it is one of the biggest trusts in the world. If only one-half of what we read about it is true, it is a very cruel trust. It is appalling to know that for the sake of dividends it is prepared to ruin thousands of people. .During the last two or three days I have read a number of articles by a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Russell,</inline> a journalist of repute in America, on the subject of the American Beef Trust. I am not prepared to say that everything he has written about the Trust is absolutely correct, but even allowing that he has overstated the case against it by 50 per cent., it is still clear that it constitutes a. big problem in America to-day. I admit that Australia is not America, and whether the Beef Trust has yet started in Australia is questioned. Some say that it has, and some that it has not. I heard <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Trefle,  Minister of Lands in New South Wales, state at a public meeting that the representatives of the Trust had met him, and had asked for certain concessions in New South Wales, which he refused. I understand that they subsequently went to Brisbane, and had started operations there. I do not believe all the cables which appear in the newspapers, but I have seen cables stating that the American Beef Trust has started operations in the Argentine.-- </para>

                        <para>- It may or may not be an English or Australian company, but we have no guarantee that it will not be purchased or come within the scope of the American Trust to-morrow. It is admitted that the Beef Trust in America is stronger than the railway companies, stronger than a great many of the Judges, and stronger even than the Government; at any rate, it was' stronger than the last Republican Government, because, apparently, it gave very large sums to the electioneering funds, amounting, I am told, to some £800,000. I do not think there is much doubt that there are trusts in Australia who are prepared to assist political parties in providing the sinews of war. I did not wish particularly to raise this question to-night, but I think we are justified in asking the Minister of External Affairs why it is that the proposals of the late Government have been turned down. </para>

                <para class="block">Government intended to erect freezing works by arrangement with a private company. I should not have felt so anxious were it not for the final statement in the reply that I received. I asked the Minister whether we would have an opportunity of discussing any proposal or agreement before a final decision was arrived at, and' I was informed that it might not be practicable to submit it before finality. Unless we on this side inform the Minister as to our attitude on the question, it would be easy for an agreement to slip through, and the whole matter to be fixed up before any steps could be taken to improve or alter the conditions. The fact is that the people of Australia are nervous on this question of the meat supply. It represents one of the most important industries, and in later years, particularly in the Northern Territory, may become the most important industry. In developing new country, occupation must first follow along the lines of pastoral pursuits where the land will allow it. You must allow settlers large areas, and give them opportunities to open up the country in the quickest possible way. It is also patent to every one who knows anything of the trend of modern commercial development that refrigeration is playing an increasingly important part in the marketing of food products, not only on land, but by sea. The shipping companies are spending thousands of pounds in experimenting in this direction, and refrigeration is a most important feature in meat works and in the handling of fruit. The Governments of different countries are taking a more and more active part in the question all over the world. The honorable member who preceded me, the ex-Minister of External Affairs, referred to the South Australian Government's action in this regard. The Western Australian Government have also developed in that direction lately, and it is not a new thing in Victoria, where the Government are extending, as rapidly as possible, their cool storage provisions for food products of all sorts. New South Wales and Queensland are also doing the same, yet the Commonwealth Government, who should set the example in commercial development to all the States, are absolutely going back to the oldest and worst methods of providing the accommodation so urgently required. The Minister of External Affairs admitted, in reply to my questions, that a site had been selected for the works at Darwin, and the plan had been prepared. Why, then, did he not proceed with the intention of the late Government to make the works Government works, and so protect the people against any possibility of difficulty in regard to the preservation of meat, or opportunity to store their meat at a satisfactory price? The people of Australia are very nervous on this matter, and have good reason to be. The Meat Trust of America is notorious, not for the way it has served, but for the way it has robbed, the public. There is no question that it has established itself in Australia. It has secured meat works 18 miles from Townsville, and also near Cairns. This is most significant. </para>

                        <para>- The Trust has meat works in other parts of the country, but the acquisition of works in North Queensland can have only one object. It must be patent to every honorable member that it has designs on the northern parts of Australia. There are other places in North Queensland for the refrigeration of meat, "but it is certain that the Trust do not intend to allow competitors to remain in that business any longer than they can help. If anything can be done to eliminate competition and give them an absolute monopoly of the meat-freezing works of Australia, particularly in Queensland, they are going to do it. The only possible protection for the people is not by the encouragement of private enterprise, but by the Government taking a hand. I referred the other evening to the fact that the Governments of the civilized countries of the world to-day are expanding in every direction their command and control of public utilities, and if it is true that refrigeration is playing an increasingly important part in the preservation of food products, it is most necessary that the Government should hold a controlling influence in that direction. The only remedy for monopolies, and the only guarantee against trusts in Australia, lies in the hands of the Commonwealth Government. The States are unable to do effective work in that direction, being prevented by their artificial geographical boundaries from following trusts or combines beyond their own borders. It remains for the Commonwealth Government to protect the people of Australia from every possible influence in this direction. We had an exceptionally favorable opportunity to do this when opening up a piece of Australia for the benefit of the whole people, in order to guarantee the other parts of Australia that that part would not be left open to foreign invasion, yet we have left it wide open to an invasion of a much more dangerous, subtle, and insidious character. </para>

While the Minister of Trade and Customs is seeking information, and the Minister of External Affairs negotiating in regard to the erection of works, damage may be done which it may take years to repair. Honorable members are willing to spend money freely for the development of the Northern Territory, and I think they are agreed that it can be wisely spent there on the erection of freezing works.

                        <para>- Yes; as a member of the Royal Commission which inquired into the fruit industry, I have signed the recommendation that the States should establish export fruit depots and departments, and I think that the Commonwealth should set a good example. A Government representing the whole people can do things more effectively than any other authority. Private interest has always its own ends to serve. Ido not blame capitalists interested in the meat industry in the Northern Territory for wishing to establish big freezing works, but I say that the Commonwealth must prevent the Meat Trust from acquiring a controlling influence in' the Northern Territory. Freezing works are needed, not only for the benefit of the pastoralists of the Territory, but also for the benefit of the residents of the Territory, and particularly of the residents of Port Darwin. We must try to secure for them a supply of fresh vegetables. </para>

                        <para>- Vegetables, like fruit, cannot be grown all the year round ; and in the tropics a fruit and vegetable diet is more to be encouraged than a meat diet. The establishment of freezing works should enable a permanent and regular supply of fruit and vegetables to be provided. The meat that will be frozen there will not be intended for export only. If it were to be frozen only for export, it might suit the pastoralists just as well to travel their stock to the Alligator Creek works, at Townsville, or to Cairns. </para>

                        <para>- It might be as near to that point as to Darwin; but we must have at Darwin refrigerating accommodation for the people of the Northern Territory. Who is going to provide that accommodation if the Government do hot? Can any one imagine that the promoters of the company are going to consider the residents of the Territory? No; they are studying their own interests first and last. I do not blame the company for seizing the opportunity; but I blame the Government who give them the opportunity, especially when we can step in and secure the accommodation which the pastoralists require for export, and which the residents require to enable them to live healthy lives in the tropics., </para>

                        <para>- That is exactly why the Government should establish freezing works at Darwin. They should start at one place, and reach out until they establish freezing works at a dozen places. I was glad to hear the Minister of External Affairs say that it is not a question of cost with the Government. It is a matter of principle, evidently. </para>

                        <para>- I am sorry that the Treasurer has not had a consultation with his colleague, who, only a few moments ago, said it was not a question of money with the Government. They need not carry out the whole scheme now, but they could start in a small way, and then as trade expanded enlarge the freezing accommodation. When the Treasurer tells me that it is a question of cost, which Minister am I to believe? The secret of the whole business is that Ministers are in favour, not of the Government control and management of public utilities, but of private enterprise controlling and managing those things which are necessary for the use and the welfare of the people. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot see the logic of the Minister's position. The Government propose to give away rights and privileges in regard to freezing works at Darwin which they say, under certain agreements, will safeguard the interests of the people. But the fact remains that those who are principally interested in the meat business in Australia to-day are those to whom the interests of the people have been a very secondary consideration. I am sure that the Minister will understand that we, on this side, and, I think, honorable members on the other side, too, are nervous in regard to the meat industry. It is too important to Australia to be allowed to get into the hands of. one' company. No one dare deny that the American Meat Trust is established in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- The policy of the Meat Trust, in every country where it has operated, has been to eliminate competition, and to secure a monopoly of the business. The meat-exporting companies in Queensland to-day feel quite nervous in regard to this matter. Fortunately, most of the companies are strong, but some of the weaker companies are trembling, because they realize that it will be only a few years when they will be wiped out. We are told that the American Trust is not working in restraint of trade now. The tiger does not show its claws all at once. But when the fitting time arrives, the claws of the Trust will be exposed, and then down will go our pastoral industry. </para>

                <para>Mr.FINLAYSON.- The pastoralists are not political friends of mine. They oppose every one on this side, because they think that we are not their friends; but, in a few years, they will learn that those who tried to protect them against monopoly were honorable members on this side. The honorable member for Hume, I am sure, is not fully acquainted with the history of the Meat Trust, not only in America, but in other countries </para>

After the horse has been stolen, they are prepared to lock the stable door. We contend that the interests of the people are of paramount importance. The trouble is that in the erection of freezing works at Port Darwin, the interests of the people are likely to become a secondary consideration. I hope that when the Minister's proposals for the erection of freezing works in the Northern Territory are submitted to us, if we cannot secure the rejection of any private enterprise proposal, we shall at any rate obtain the insertion of some stringent provision which will safeguard the interests of the people. We are anxious to secure a positive guarantee that there shall be no damage done. </para>

                        <para>- There will be no difficulty in the Minister getting private enterprise to establish freezing works at Port Darwin. The only difficulty will be in regard to the conditions which should be imposed upon the individuals who undertake the work. The very provision which would be rejected by a private company would constitute a sufficient protection by this Parliament of the interests of the people. It is because the margin is always in favour of the Government that we advocate the erection by the Commonwealth of freezing works at Port Darwin. Private enterprise has always its own ends to serve, whereas the Government have only one end to serve, namely, the interests of the people. If these works be established by private enterprise, we shall be incurring absolutely unnecessary risks. If our suggestion be adopted, we shall be protected against all risk, and shall be able to give to the pastoralists that protection to which they are entitled. I may tell the Minister that this is not the last occasion upon which he will hear from us upon this matter. There are a few honorable members upon this side of the chamber - especially those who represent Queensland- who will return to it, and I shall give my support to any movement in the direction of challenging the position of the Government upon it. I wish now to make a suggestion to the Prime Minister. There may not be much in it;- </para>

                        <para>- To-night, the honorable member for Melbourne Ports emphasized a matter to which the Prime Minister himself called attention the other day, namely, the expenditure on our Public Service, and particularly upon military and naval defence. There is not an honorable member in this chamber who is not becoming alarmed, not only at the present expenditure upon defence, but at the probable heavy increase of that expenditure in the future. </para>

                        <para>- I am sorry that I have to vote for the increased expenditure, and the real trouble is that I do not see how I can escape voting for another increase of £1,000,000 in this expenditure next year. It is because of the rapidly increasing burden of the expenditure on defence that I offer the Prime Minister what I think is not an unworthy suggestion. It is reasonable to say that as the years go on the danger of war is not increasing. The wisdom, intelligence, and reasonableness of the nations are coming to our aid, and there is less danger of war to-day than there was ten years ago. -The tendency in the civilized countries of the world is stronger than ever it was before towards peace. The nations are realizing to-day more than they ever did before that war and warlike preparations constitute an increasing and unnecessary burden. The suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Winston</inline> Churchill the other day for the reduction of armaments was but a sign of the times. Every country in the world is feeling the terrific pressure of military and naval expenditure. We in Australia are only at the beginning of it, and it is because I believe there is a better way that I speak as I do to-night. This better way is to be found by the nations exercising ordinary common sense. The wars of the future will not be wars of conquest. A statement on the subject appears in to-night's <inline font-style="italic">Herald,</inline> from  President  Wilson of the United States. The wars of the future will arise out of commercial matters. A statement made by the German Emperor some time ago that if the nations continued to build fiscal walls against Germany they would have to be demolished, even if it must be with bayonets, was a very significant statement. We in Australia cannot afford to be on bad terms with any nation. It is our business to develop trade with every country. Nothing is more encouraging or deserving. of encouragement than the expansion of our trade relations with other nations, and especially with the eastern nations, with whom we are more likely to come into conflict than with any others. If we can establish friendly business relations with those nations, we shall have done' a great deal.  Honorable members generally are aware that there has recently been a remarkable interchange of thought and literature between the nations of the world, and this has done more to promote and cement good feeling than anything else that has taken place in the history of the nations. There have been reciprocal visits between different </para>

                <para class="block">British and German parties, journalists, ministers, parliamentary parties, and business men, and these have done more to prevent war between the countries than all the work of the diplomatists, and those responsible for the government of the two countries. I invite the attention of the Prime Minister in this connexion to the work of the Inter-Parliamentary Union. The Parliaments of the different countries of the world are interesting themselves in this matter. They are seeking to check the growing expenditure on armaments, and we in Australia would be wise to take an early and an active part in the promotion of any movement in that direction. I have here a list of the members of the Parliaments of various countries who are identified with the promotion of International conciliation and arbitration for the prevention or settlement of International disputes. Austria has 121 members in this Inter-Parliamentary Union; Belgium, 219; Canada, 165; Denmark, 179; France, 516; Germany, 157; Great Britain, 230; Holland, 108; Hungary, 242 ; Japan, 379 ; Norway, 144 ; Portugal, 150; Roumania, 20; Russia, 141; Servia, 21; Spain, 62; Sweden, 281; Switzerland, 69; Turkey, 69; and the United States of America, 272. The Australian Parliament is invited to take a part in this matter. It is remarkable that while the leading nations of the world are spending £365,000,000 annually on warlike preparations, or £1,000,000 per day, the Inter-Parliamentary Union, with an expenditure of something under £3,000, last year did more to promote and keep peace between the nations than the expenditure of £365,000,000 on warlike preparations by the nations. Realizing this, the Parliaments of the various countries are now voting money, to be expended not only in preparations for war, but for the promotion of peace. The results of the expenditure of £3,000 by the Inter-Parliamentary Union for the promotion of peace have been simply enormous. The chief credit for the fact that the dangers of war have been repeatedly averted during the last few years must be given to the movement for the promotion of peace, to which I have referred. Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Hungary, Norway, Portugal, Roumania, Servia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, and the United States, all annually give grants towards this object. I wish to suggest to the Prime Minister and to the Treasurer - who, of course, is equally interested - that this Parliament might give an annual grant for the promotion of this Inter-Parliamentary Union for the settlement of national disputes by peaceful means. The dangers in Australia from extravagance in the naval and military expenditure are enough to appal even the stoutest heart amongst us. Apart altogether from the danger of the military authorities usurping the rights <inline font-style="italic">Joi</inline> the civil authorities, the expenditure in this unproductive and unworthy direction is a matter that must cause all considerable concern. We are urgently in need of money for expenditure in other directions. There are many miles of territory in Australia waiting for railways, and hungry for development. We are unable to do this work because we are pouring out £5,500,000 every year - and the amount is likely to increase - in preparing for war. By the expenditure of a few thousand pounds we could possibly create such a friendly atmosphere and cordial relations with other nations as to render this warlike expenditure absolutely unnecessary. I notice, by-the bye, that out of a total of £212,000 for contingencies in the Supply Bill now before us something like £40,000 is for the Military and Naval Defence Department. Those contingencies are a very risky thing; but I would forgive the Treasurer a good deal if he could see his way to apply a thousand or two to the laudable object I have mentioned, and so save the country from what I believe is likely to be a burden that will cause trouble not only financially, but in other directions. I should like to refer' to another small matter which has to do with the privileges of honorable members, and this is the first opportunity I have had to do so. We are able to travel on the railways by virtue of our gold passes, and we are also able to travel free on the tramways in Sydney.- I suggest to the Prime Minister that it is time he opened up negotiations with the tramway authorities in the other capitals in order to se cure a similar privilege for honorable members there. If the suggestion has any value at all, it has particular application in Melbourne. We are here trying to serve our constituents, and we have to run north, south, east, and west looking for the Commonwealth Departments. I do not know how other honorable members find it, but the tram fares that I have to pay in Melbourne - and the fares here are not the cheapest in the world- </para>

I am fortunate in having constituents who pay me a considerable amount of attention, and I have a heavy correspondence which necessitates various visits to the Government Departments. So much so, that the business sometimes occupies me the better part of the day. The fares, I admit, may not amount to much, perhaps only1s. a day, or, to some honorable members, perhaps less than that; but, in the aggregate, members' fares must amount to a considerable sum in the year. </para>

                <para class="block">Affairs matter, in regard to which the answers I have received to questions have not been of a satisfactory character. When the Address-in-Reply was under discussion, the honorable member for Bourke made reference to the payment, on 26th April last, by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brookes,</inline> of £500 to the honorable member for Perth. The honorable member for Perth explained in this House that the £500 had not been sent to him by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brookes</inline> personally, but to pass on to the Liberal organization in Western Australia. I can raise no objection to any organization utilizing some of their funds for political purposes, but section 172a of the Electoral Act provides that if any person, trade union, registered or unregistered league, or association devotes money for political purposes, he or it shall send a return to the Chief Electoral Officer within a certain time showing how the money was spent. That is the law. Whether it is good, bad, or indifferent is not for us now to question. The present Government, when introducing their Amending Electoral Bill, made no provision for the repeal of that section, and I take it that they are in favour of it. Seeing that it is part of the Electoral Act, those administering the Act should see that it is carried out. On 5th September I asked whether the Minister of Home Affairs would see that the section was complied with. The Prime Minister replied, " I am very anxious that I should not add to my reputation by acting as a detective." I had no desire that he should do so. All I wanted was that the Act should be made effective. On the 10th September I asked whether <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brookeshad</inline> complied with the section. The Assistant Minister replied, " I am not aware whether <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brookes</inline> has expended any money or incurred any expense which requires a return under the provisions of section 172a." On 12th September, on the adjournment of the House, I asked whether action would not be taken by the Electoral Officer to see that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brookes</inline> complied with the Act. On the same occasion, the honorable member for Maribyrnong quoted from a newspaper a report of a statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Herbert</inline> Brookes, at a meeting attended by the Vice-President of the Executive Council, that, on three occasions during the last week, it was stated in the House of Representatives that he had been responsible for passing a certain sum of money to a member in another State. He wished to state that this was absolutely true. He was proud of it, and hoped to be able to do it again. The Prime Minister, in reply, said he was amazed at the moderation of the amount, as we, as a party, had been referring to £50,000 having been given here and there for political purposes to the Liberal party, and that, apparently, the amount had come down to about £500. He could not understand the bother there was over this paltry sum. I confessed at the time I thought this rather a peculiar reply. Whatever the amount was, we simply asked that the Act might be complied with. The Prime Minister's reply was that he did not think the  Act demanded the statement for which I was asking. The penalty for failure to comply with section 172a was a fine of not less than £100 and not more than £500, or imprisonment for any period not exceeding six months. On 18th September I asked again if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brookes</inline> had complied with the section, and the Prime Minister said, "No; the period within, which returns are required to be lodged has not yet expired." On 17th October, I asked whether <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brookes</inline> had yet complied with the section, and, if not, what was the latest date on which such a statement should be in the hands of the Chief Electoral Officer. The Prime Minister's reply was, " I am unable to answer this question in its present form, as I am not aware that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Herbert</inline> Brookes has taken any action which requires him to lodge a return under section 172a of the Electoral Act." When money is sent to any organization - Labour, Liberal, Conservative, National, or any other - for political purposes, the Chief Electoral Officer should be notified of the manner in which it is spent. This Government claims to be a pure Government, administering the law fairly, without favour to any, and it is therefore strange that no attempt is being made to ascertain how this £500 was spent. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Herbert</inline> Brookes stated at a public meeting, at which the Vice-President of the Executive Council was present, that he had forwarded the money, add the honorable member for Perth has acknowledged that he received it, and handed it Over to the Liberal Association. I do hot question those statements, nor do I suggest that in receiving the money the honorable member for Perth did any- thing wrong. If any one sent me money for a Labour organization, I should not hesitate to receive it, and to forward it. But the electoral law should be complied with, and those who spend money on elections should let the public know how it is spent. I have no objection to trusts, combines, unions, or individuals giving money for political purposes. Any one holding political views has an unquestioned right to spend money to give effect to them. But Parliament has rightly required that the Chief Electoral Officer shall be informed how such money is spent. The Prime Minister, when I referred to this matter, said, " You are kicking up a row now about a paltry £500, when you used to talk about £50,000." There is no doubt that this £500 was sent to Western Australia, but it does not follow that it is the only amount that was contributed to the Liberal funds. I ask the Minister of Home Affairs whether it is the intention of the Government to see that section 172a of the Electoral Act is complied with ? </para>

He mentioned that I had sent a receipt for the money to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Herbert</inline> Brookes, but the receipt was sent by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. David</inline> Forrest, then treasurer of the Liberal League. I think, too, that the honorable member on one occasion made some reference to my bank account; but the money reached me one day when I was in the League's office, being addressed to me, " care of the Liberal League," and I took it out of the envelope, and handed it across the table to the secretary, having no more to do with the matter. </para>

                        <para>-  It would not cost very much to provide this convenience for honorable members during the sittings, tff the House. It must be remembered that country constituencies are very large, and that an honorable member has to spend a lot of time on his correspondence. I realize that fact now more than I used to do, because my division now includes a large portion of a country constituency. </para>

                        <para>- A town constituency is nothing like a country one. In Broken Hill I used to have what might be called a town constituency, but now that a large portion of a country electorate has been attached to it my correspondence occupies much more time than it did previously. I do not expect the Treasurer to give me a definite reply to-night. If he will just say that he will consider my suggestion favorably I shall be satisfied. </para>
