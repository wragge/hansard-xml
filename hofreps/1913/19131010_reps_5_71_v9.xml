It is by no means a new thing for persons who have long resided in a district to be informed that objection has been taken to their enrolment.

I was not present when the Minister's reply was given, but on reading the report of the honorable gentleman's remarks I find that no reference was made to the main point, that the communication was reported to have been sent by a registrar to an organization, asking for its assistance. Will the honorable gentleman make further inquiry, and return to me the newspaper which I quoted ? </para>

                            <para>- I have stated several times in this House that the method of  suppressing  disease within a State is entirely a matter of State jurisdiction. The Commonwealth has no power to dictate what steps a State shall take to suppress disease, but the Commonwealth accepts full responsibility for the way in which it exercises its own powers. As soon as the outbreak of small-pox occurred in ]STew South Wales, Federal and State authorities co-operated with a common end in view. The Commonwealth handed over to the State authorities the whole quarantine station, and agreed to place it at their disposal for the treatment of .patients. </para>

A regulation was then framed, requiring all persons coming from that area to other States to  establish  proof of their successful vaccination. </para>

                        <para>- Three days ago I received the letter to which the honorable member refers. I have not read it, but I have placed it in the hands of the proper authority- the Grown Solicitor- to investigate the facts and report to me upon it. Until I receive that report I do not think it, would be advisable to lay the document on the table of the Library, but probably I shall be prepared to take that course as soon as it is returned to me. </para>

                        <para>. - Honorable members will notice that the amount on these Estimates for Additions, New Works, and Buildings is £3,268,569, but reference to the Budget will show that the total amount of the proposed expenditure under this heading is £3,971,001. There is, however, in the Trust Fund an amount available for the Fleet of £702,432, which has to be deducted, and consequently honorable members are now asked to vote only £3,268,569. Reference to page 232 of the Estimates will show how this sum is made up. There is £300,000 to be paid for the Fleet, £1,122,768 for works under the Department of Home Affairs, a further amount of £1,079,700 under the Postmaster-General's Department, £4,860 under the Treasurer's Department, £692,311 under the Defence Department, and £68,930 under the Department of External Affairs. I have abstracted the amounts which the Government ask Parliament to vote under the heads of Departments, because the Department of Home Affairs, for example, does work for the Defence, Postal, and other Departments. I find that for the Postmaster-General's Department the estimated expenditure for the current year is £1,350,113, as against an estimated expenditure for last year of £1,152,275, and an actual expenditure of £1,086,615. The estimated expenditure for the Defence Department, not including the </para>

                    <para class="block">Fleet, for the current financial year, is £1,234,051, as against an estimated expenditure last year of £1,261,842, and an actual expenditure of £1,129,072. For the construction of the Fleet this year we are asking for a vote of £300,000, as against an estimated and actual expenditure last year of £110,000. Honorable members will understand that the balance of the expenditure for last year, and also the balance of the proposed expenditure for this year, comes out of the Trust Fund. Under the Department of Trade and Customs we are asking for an appropriation this year of £57,752, as against an estimated expenditure last year of £76,083, and an actual expenditure of £51,060. Under the Department of Home Affairs the estimated expenditure for the current financial year is £244,377, as against an estimated expenditure last year of £99,622, and an actual expenditure of £151,460. Under the Department of External Affairs the estimated expenditure for this year is set down at £68,930, as against an estimated expenditure of £62,120 last year, and an actual expenditure of £62,619. For the Department of the Treasury, the estimate for this year for new works and buildings is £13,346. The estimate last year was £27,150, while the actual expenditure was £37,448. The totals, therefore are - Estimate for this year, £3,268,569; estimate for last year, £2,789,092, and the actual expenditure last year, £2,628,274. In regard to the Postal Department, honorable members will see in the report of my Budget speech and also in the Budget-papers that the whole expenditure from all sources this year is estimated at £7,150,275, as against £6,284,053 for 1912-13, so that we propose to spend £866,222 more than was spent last year. The Post Office expenditure provided for on these Estimates is £1,350,113. We also propose to spend £595,000 from loan funds and the balance of the Special Works Account, available from last year, £15,897. This makes a total expenditure this year on the Post Office from all sources of £1,961,010, as against £1,500,309 for 1912-13, and £1,013,524 for 1911-12. All this information is given on page 1788 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> We are providing for telegraphs, telephones, and wireless this year, £1,079,700, as against £835,302 provided last year, so that we propose to spend this year, under the heading of telegraphs, telephones, and wireless, £244,398 more than was spent last year. For post-office buildings, wireless stations, &amp;c, we propose to spend £320,413, as against an actual expenditure, last year of £251,313. In other words, we propose to expend ££9,100 more than Was spent last year. It is not necessary to say any more at the present moment with regard to these Estimates. Ministers controlling the various departments will be very glad to give all information to honorable members as we .deal with the items. Already, in my Budget, I have dealt with most of these "matters under the heading of " Defence Department," " Post Office Department," and " General Expenditure." </para>

                        <para>.- I shall take full advantage of the statement just made that we can discuss any matter in a general sense in the course of the discussion on the first item.  Last  night the Prime Minister made a definite and distinct statement that in dealing with the amendment of the Braddon section of the Constitution the .previous Government dealt with the States differently from what the Fusion Government proposed in their agreement with the States. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Wide Bay is taking a rather wide interpretation of a general debate on this portion of the Estimates. The debate will necessarily need to have relation to additions, new 'works, buildings, &amp;c. I can hardly allow a debate to be re-opened practically on the whole question of the Budget. </para>

                            <para>- I shall not have the slightest difficulty in connecting my remarks with new works and buildings. If it is strictly ruled that they are outside the scope of this debate, I am afraid debate will be restricted. I wished -to take the earliest opportunity of saying that the Prime Minister's statement in this regard was altogether wrong and misleading. The Fisher Government put into an Act the arrangement to return 25s. per head to the States and the other conditions imposed by the agreement entered into by the previous Government and the State Premiers for a period of ten years, commencing from the 1st July, 1910. Under the Constitution it .was impossible for us to make the period apply from the 1st January, 1910. It was impossible for us to pay money to tha States during the first half of the year, and therefore we had to restrict the payment during the first half of the year and demand it in the second half of the year. </para>

                            <para>- That is so, but the actual deficiency was less than you anticipated, and we made a claim for it. We called upon the States to pay this money to the Commonwealth. The Prime Minister is absolutely wrong, and I feel sure that he does not wilfully attempt to mislead the public in this important matter. The States were in exactly the same position on this question as if the people had carried the referendum, with the exception that the Financial Agreement was not made a permanent provision of the Constitution. I hope these remarks will prevent the Prime Minister unconsciously doing his reputation an injustice by again referring to something that is only too plain, and in his reference committing a gross error and misrepresentation of the facts. </para>

                        <para>. - I wish to protest against the item of £285,000 for the Capital site. I do this for the specific purpose of exposing the methods of gentlemen opposite. In South Australia during the election campaign, and for a long time previously, the Fusionists were loud in their declamation of the Labour Government for spending millions on the Capital site. They denounced the proposed expenditure hip and thigh. But now we find that the present Government are providing for double the expenditure that was voted to this purpose by the Labour Government. </para>

                            <para>- Their complaint in New South Wales was that there waa not enough money spent on the Capital site, but gentlemen belonging to the same party when they came into my district in South Australia were loud in their denunciations of the gross extravagance of the Labour party in connexion with the site, while, on the first opportunity they get, they double the expenditure. </para>

                            <para>- When a party appeals to the public it ought to be honest enough to have one voice on one question, and not resort to such a low method of politics as that I have indicated. It should not pretend in one State to be opposed to the expenditure on the Capital site and accuse the Government of spending hundreds of thousands of pounds more than they actually spent, while saying in other States that there was not enough money being spent there. Here we have the evidence. Let me say plainly and straight out that the expenditure proposed in these Estimates is a New South Wales expenditure. They have robbed the other States. </para>

                            <para>- Look at the records of the state of the post-offices. In one part of my electorate there is a building which the Board of Health has actually condemned, yet the Department insist that we must use that place. They cannot find money to spend there, but they can double the expenditure on the Capital site. If you go right through the Estimates you will find evidence of that sort of thing. I suppose that there have been quite a number of applications made for post-offices in places where their erection is justified, but we cannot get money made available for the purpose. This year the huge expenditure is to be increased. Where is all the money going to? It is going chiefly to New South Wales. </para>

                            <para>- The Government are proposing to spend £285,000 on Federal territory. What do they propose to expend on defence and other works ? I asked the Honorary Minister the other day whether the Government intended to go on with the construction of the Naval Base at Port Lincoln. He replied that nothing is to be done there, but the Government can find money to spend on Naval Bases in other parts of the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- In other cases the Government will not take the advice of the same officer. Take the works in Western Australia, for instance. When he did advise the Government to go on with the works, they did not take his counsel; they only took the advice which suited themselves. When we reach the item I shall certainly move for a reduction of the amount. I want to brand the hypocrisy of the party in speaking with one voice in one State and saying something else in another State. The Fusionists ' accused the Fisher Government of having spent millions. The paid organizers for the Senate candidates who went through my electorate said that we were spending millions, and indulging in an extravagant waste of money on the Capital site. </para>

                            <para>- I know that there was a party in power for a number of years who did nothing with the Capital site. When honorable gentlemen opposite go to the country and say that the Labour Government spent millions there, though the actual fact is that they spent only £137,000, they - are playing the game pretty low. </para>

On page 265 of the Estimates for additions to new works and naval works under the control of the Department of Defence I see an item of £98,000 for naval works, including labour and material, and an item of £112,000 for machinery and plant. Whether they are the two items which will cover the expenditure on Naval Bases or not I do not know. </para>

                            <para>- In 1912-13 £200,000 was appropriated, and £172,000 was expended, and in these Estimates we are asked to vote £210,000. That sum, I take- ' it, will cover not only the two Naval Bases I have mentioned, but also other naval works. I should like to get from the Treasurer or the Minister representing the Minister of Defence a definite statement as to the estimated expenditure on those Naval Bases. If I remember rightly, when the Estimates were under discussion last year, according to <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> a definite statement was made regarding the amount to be expended on the different Naval Bases, and I think that similar information ought to be furnished on this occasion. There is another matter regarding which I am seeking information from a purely parochial stand-point. On page 257 of these Estimates provision is made for the expenditure of £5,392 on " wireless telegraph station, Fremantle." I wish to know whether that is an addition to the Applecross wireless station, or whether any further wireless station is to be erected in the Fremantle division? If an addition to the Applecross wireless station is proposed, I would like to know what work is to be undertaken there ? </para>

                        <para>.- I have risen to draw attention to the necessity for more works being carried out by the Post and Telegraph Department in country districts. The Minister has just informed us that the Department is going to expend something like £244,000 more this year. During the time I have been a member of the House I have been accustomed to hear a statement of that kind, but somehow or other the money does not happen to get expended in the country districts. The practice has been to concentrate expenditure on the big capitals and suburbs and overlook altogether the country districts. I venture to assert - and I leave it to honorable members to say whether the assertion is correct or not - that in the country districts a large number of works are approved of, some of them for two or three years, and the statement is made by the Department that owing to the very many works which are approved of it is impossible to carry out a particular work, and it has to remain in abeyance. That is playing with country people. The time has arrived when the Government should take a stand and say that so far as the money will go the works which are approved of in the country districts shall be carried out at the earliest possible moment. </para>

                            <para>- I blame all Governments. I spoke of my experience in the House, and that of course applies to the Government I supported. The day has arrived when the Government should give instructions that country facilities in the way of telephone and telegraph lines should be provided as early as possible. It is all very well for the House to vote large sums for that purpose, but if the bulk of the money is expended in thickly congested areas, that is an injustice to the people who are living in -the more scattered and remote parts of the Commonwealth. Who are the people that mostly require telephonic facilities ? I submit that it is the country people. We should bring the country residents in as close touch as possible with big commercial centres, and with medical men. There are very few electorates indeed which have not good ground to complain in that regard. I heard the honorable member for Gwydir say on one occasion that he had fixed up everything all right for his electorate. He is a very fortunate man indeed if he has done so. I know that other honorable members have been striving for a long time to get absolutely necessary works - works which were  approved of - carried out, and the only answer they can get from the Department is, "Yes; this work will be carried out, but it must stand over and wait its turn," whilst the Department can employ labour in abundance in the big cities I It is not a question of being able to get labour. I anticipate that the Department will not spend the votes which are now being asked for. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly ; and every year that has been my complaint. If it is a question of getting labour and material, that is available; there is no difficulty in getting labour. It is only a question of organizing the Department arid seeing that a work is carried out. What we require is a Government with a back-bone - a Government who will give instructions that works approved of shall be carried out in a reasonable time, arid not allow honorable members to be put off, time after time, by the Department on the ground that a work will have to wait its turn. I know that it has been the experience of other honorable members as well as myself, that, after considerable agitation, a particular line is approved of provided that the persons concerned would contribute a certain percentage of the estimated loss. The people at once set out to raise the money. They send it along to the Department and it lies dormant at the post-office, or ah intimation is sent, *' Do npt send the money along; we will give you the line and advise you when we require the money." If we vote money for the purpose of giving better facilities to country people, we ought to be genuine in regard to the action which is to be taken. We should not vote money year after year with a view of doing certain things, knowing well that it will not be expended, but we should make it obligatory on the Departments to spend the money. That is my complaint in regard to the treatment of country districts. While I admit that our expenditure must continue to expand, I think it is necessary for us to exercise great care in connexion with it. For the first time we find that it is proposed by this Government to provide £170,000 for the purchase of land for postal and telegraphic purposes]' and £425,000 for the construction of conduits and the laying of wires underground, or a total of £595,000, out of borrowed? money. When I say that I do not approve of borrowing for these purposes, <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> may be told' that a precedent was set by the late Government in connexion with the purchase of the post-office site at Perth. In this case, however, we find" that it is proposed to borrow a large  sum  for such a work as the undergrounding of wires. That is a work which you cannot realize upon, and I am opposed to borrowing for such a purpose. These wires after a certain time will have to be renewed, and once we initiate the system we shall go on borrowing for such works for all time. The Postal Department should be allowed to stand on its own footing; it should be worked by itself, and should provide for its own expenditure. The Government, however, instead of dealing with it in a businesslike way, are introducing a system of borrowing for postal works, and the interest on the money raised, instead of being debited to the Department itself, will be a charge on the Federal revenue,, and will have to be borne by the taxpayers generally. A system of this kind once initiated will grow. The Department should pay interest on money borrowed for postal undertakings. The residents of big centres of population will receive the chief benefit from this expenditure, whilst the poor man in the country will have to pay interest on the borrowed money. A block of land is rarely purchased for postal' purposes in country districts. Land required for such a purpose is generally acquired from the State, and where it is necessary to purchase a block in a. country district the price is so low a» to be hardly worth mentioning. In almost any part of the country a block can be obtained for a few pounds. That being so, this £170,000 will be utilized' for the most part in buying valuable property in big centres, while the interest, will be charged against the general revenue. Thus taxpayers in the country who will not get any benefit from this expenditure will be called upon to assist in paying the interest bill. The position- is the same in regard to the proposal to borrow £425,000 to provide for the laying of conduits and underground wires. Country districts will not benefit to the extent of a penny. The Government are initiating in connexion with the Postal' Department a system which we shall live; to regret. They are proposing to borrow in a wholesale fashion to carry out works for which provision should be made out of revenue. </para>

                            <para>- I am prepared to see the Department placed on a sound footing, and conducted as a business concern. I am altogether opposed to the introduction of a borrowing system, which will be a charge against the whole community, in order to carry out works that will be of no benefit whatever to those residing in ' sparsely-populated country districts. Residents of rural districts do not get a fair deal from any Government. Everything is centralized. I am not favorable to the piling up of a huge public debt merely to provide for certain works in the metropolitan districts. I shall not say that these works are unnecessary. On the contrary, I admit that they are. But I object to the borrowing of money for what is really a disappearing quantity - for something which we cannot realize upon, for which you have nothing to show - and the debiting- of the taxpayers generally with that indebtedness. We cannot afford to allow this huge expenditure to go on year after year, while nothing is being done for the country districts. Those who have to pay the interest bill should reap some advantage. If this system is to go on, then I think the Department should be classified, and that we should declare that the people in large centres of population, who reap the benefit of all this expenditure, shall pay something more than country residents who derive none. This Parliament seems to lose sight of the country districts altogether. An expenditure of £2,000 in a rural division is a wonderful thing, whereas the expenditure of £100,000 in a city is regarded as a mere bagatelle. Ever since my return to this House I have been endeavouring in vain to secure the building of post-offices in thickly-populated towns in my electorate. They wOuld not cost more than £800 or £1,000 to build, yet I cannot get them. </para>

                            <para>- I agree with tha honorable member, that if the representatives of the country districts were organized we should probably obtain something like justice for our constituents. Money is provided on the Estimates for certain country works of which the responsible officials have approved, and yet, at the end of the financial year, we find that it has not been  expended. </para>

                            <para>- Yes ; I quite believe that every Treasurer likes to save a few hundred thousand pounds on his. Estimates, and I think that that will be found to be the position of the present Treasurer at the end of the year. A Treasurer comes forward and says, " Here you are! I am going to spend £300,000 more than my predecessors did." But the trouble is that, although the money is provided it is not spent. The country districts can reap no benefit from the Commonwealth services except in the matter of improved postal, telegraphic, and telephonic facilities, and when they cannot obtain the required facilities, although the officials themselves approve of them, they have just cause of complaint. An inspector reports in favour of a telephone line, saying that he believes it will pay, and that local residents, instead of having to travel 20 miles for a doctor, should be able to ring up one. But even after favorable reports have been received we find ourselves no further forward. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member is one of those who claim to take a broad national view of things, but he is never able to see beyond the boundaries of his own electorate. I appeal to the Ministry to do justice to the  country districts, and not to hang up work, after the necessary money has been voted, on the plea that the necessary labour or material cannot be obtained. The Government should issue instructions that they expect money provided for these works to be expended within the financial year, and that the necessary arrangements, particularly in the case of country undertakings, must be made to enable that to be done. Unless such an order °is given we shall find next year that we are still face to face with the position that confronts us to-day. After a Treasurer has carefully considered his Estimates, applied the pruning knife, and submitted them to Parliament, the works for which they provide should be carried out at once. We should take care that the money voted is actually expended within the financial year in carrying out the works for which it is intended. Unless that be done the country districts will continue to suffer injustice. I am sure that if country representatives would only band together they would make the Government feel the weight of their influence, and that we should get more for the rural districts than we have yet been able to secure. </para>

                        <para>.- I agree with what the honorable member for Hunter has said. The matters to which he referred are of considerable importance to country districts. Although it is proposed to expend £11,924 on rifle ranges in Victoria during the current financial year, of that amount £4,221 is a re-vote, so that the new appropriation is. only £7,703. Last year the appropriation was £16,195 and only £6,994, or less than one-half, was expended. The Department of Home Affairs, in conjunction with the Defence Department, should be capable of estimating what can be spent on these works in any year. </para>

                            <para>- That is what we heard yesterday in connexion with the * administration of the Department of the Postmaster- General. Surely there is plenty of labour obtainable. We hear of men waiting for employment. Why cannot their services be used for these works? As to getting material, if the officers are business men they should look ahead more than a month or two. I have been a member of this House for only a few months, but my experience in connexion with public works has appalled me. It was previously my belief that matters that were brought forward for consideration were dealt with in a prompt and business-like way. ~ The Government in its policy memorandum said that it would encourage the rifle clubs of Australia. How better can* that be done than by providing the necessary rifle ranges. Without ranges, effective training in musketry is impossible. In my electorate, ranges that were applied for years ago have, not yet been provided. We get promises of inspection, and reports, but no real advance, is made. The most ordinary requests are deferred in a manner that is unaccountable to business men. Although the sum proposed to be voted this year is not as large as the appropriation of last year, I hope that the money voted will be spent. Promptitude should be shown in determining what ranges will be provided, and steps should then be taken at once to provide them. I trust that ranges will be provided in all important centres to give proper effect to our system of compulsory military training. Turning now to the ad.ministration of the Department of tire Postmaster-General, I again indorse what was said by the honorable member for Hunter. In my short experience, I have brought forward between forty and fifty matters of importance to my constituency, many of them relating to telephone services, but practically no progress has been made in dealing with them, and the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs looks at me with astonishment when I complain of the delay. </para>

                            <para>- For nearly the whole of Australia. I interviewed an officer of the Department in regard to this matter, and told him that I hoped that provision would  be  made for the inviting of tenders from local residents for the construction of telephone lines. He looked at me in wonder, and asked, " What would become of our staff? " Is the construction of necessary telephone lines to be delayed until the staff wakes up ? If the necessary works were pushed ahead, there would be ample for the staff to do, and employment would be given to many others as well. I know of a case in which a deposit was made months ago by local residents who desire a telephone, and the promise was made that tenders would be called without delay. But they have not been called for. I understand now that the department is taking steps to have the line peg-marked, so that we are no further forward than we were two months ago. Another work, the making of some additions to a post-office in my electorate, does not seem to progress at all. Week after week the only reply to inquiries is that the matter is receiving attention. The blame in this case must be attributed to the Department of Home Affairs, which, he claims, was presided over in such a business-like way by the honorable member for Darwin. I hope that the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs will shake up that Department. If the last Minister shook it up, it has gone to sleep again. Perhaps the present Minister will do more, and take less credit to himself for what is done. A large number of country telephone lines should be put in hand, if for no other reason than te make cross country connexions to relieve the strain on the main lines. In many cases messages have to be transmitted over a distance of 200 miles, in a roundabout manner, to pass between places not more than 30 or 40 miles apart. The erection of cross country lines would make this unnecessary, and would prevent the blocking of business which now often occurs. I ask the Government to see that matters are dealt with in a more business-like way, and to push on with the public works - particularly the telephone constructions that are needed - in the country districts. </para>

                            <para>- They put him out of Parliament because he was associated with the wrong political party. Under the redistribution scheme for Victoria, his electorate disappeared, and then he decided to contest a seat for the Senate which he had no chance of winning. The candidates who defeated him had the support of no newspapers, and yet they walloped him right out. . Despite the enormous advantage that he enjoyed of having the support of both morning papers in this city, he did not get a place. He finished fifth or sixth on the poll. </para>

It was- stated that there were items of " contingencies " under which there was an expenditure of ?3,000,000 or ?4,000,000 for which ho account could be given. Certainly it was not the Federal Capital expenditure which was responsible for the defeat of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wise.</inline> Every honorable member will admit that that gentleman was straightforward, and that when he was opposed to anything he did not mind saying so.

                            <para>- I desire to point out that the party with which the honorable member is connected denounced the Labour party in Victoria for spending money on the Federal Capital. The Women's National League, the People's Liberal party, and other organizations, adopted that attitude. Of course we all know that quite a number of people change their names as soon as their true characters are discovered. In much the same way these political organizations come up smiling, say, ^ as the "Reform League." They are found out, and then they alter the name of their organization and pretend .that they are a different body, when, as a matter of fact, they are the same old crowd. All these organizations opposed the late Government because it increased the expenditure upon the Federal Capital to £110,000. I wish to know what they have to say now it is proposed to increase it to £285,000 ? </para>

At the last elections certain persons attempted to make political capital out of the fact that the Labour party had started work at the Federal Capital. It . is the only party which has endeavoured to carry out the compact entered into with New South Wales when Federation was adopted. I remember the Minister of External Affairs saying that he was opposed* to the creation of a Federal Capital outside the present large centres of population. Honorable members opposite, representing every other State except New South </para>

                            <para>- The agreement with New South Wales was entered into prior to Federation and before there was a Federal Labour party in existence. When the first Commonwealth Parliament met, our party in this Chamber numbered sixteen members, who had been returned despite the opposition of every newspaper in the Commonwealth. We have grown steadily, until to-day we are thirty-seven strong. In the Senate we originally had only eight representatives of our party, but to-day we number twenty-nine. The agreement that the Federal Capital should be in New South Wales was entered into by the people of Australia when they accepted our Commonwealth Constitution. When that Constitution was submitted to the people on the first occasion, in the absence of that provision, it was defeated in New South Wales. It was only after the Premiers of the six States had met in this building that it was agreed that New South Wales should have the Federal Capital, and that, at the instance of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner, a provision was inserted in the Constitution that it should not be within 100 miles of Sydney. Seeing that that arrangement was entered into, I propose to abide by it. </para>

                            <para>- I will. The establishment of the Federal Capital in New South Wales was one of the matters in respect of which the Constitution was amended between the holding of the first and second referendums. I am not in favour of going back on the compact that was entered into, and which I believe was instrumental in bringing New. South Wales into the Federation. I do not think it would be fair, especially now that a- certain amount of money has been spent. I believe that the people of Australia have a good asset in the present Capital site. There is a large tract of very good country there, and no doubt the Honorary Minister can give us some information as to what revenue is being earned on the money spent. I should like to deal with the question of lighthouses, but, as my time is limited, I shall deal first with the matter of quarantine, leaving lighthouses for another occasion. When I was Minister of Trade and Customs I suggested that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Norris</inline> should be instructed to make inquiries as to the various diseases with which the people of Australia were likely to come into contact through these diseases being brought to our shores - in order to ascertain how we could protect Australia from those diseases with which, owing to the rapid increase in the speed of the vessels visiting our shores, we are more likely to come into contact, and more particularly in view of the opening up of the Panama Canal. The late Ministry agreed that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Norris</inline> should take a trip to see what was being done in other countries to grapple with this particular problem. On his return <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Norris</inline> furnished a very valuable report, which contains a good deal of information, and maps showing where the various diseases, subject to quarantine, are in existence, such as plague, cholera, and yellow fever," which is a great source of danger now that the Panama Canal is being opened up. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly. I understand that the yellow fever can be transmitted by the mosquito, and that it is possible that the mosquito may be on board a ship at New Orleans, and the larvae, not hatched out until after the vessel reaches Sydney. One of the most important diseases affecting Australia, at the present moment, is small-pox. In the report by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Norris</inline> there is a map of the world showing that the only white spot free from small-pox is Australia; at least it was so at the time this report was prepared. </para>

At any rate, honorable members will agree with me that it is necessary to take precautions to see that small-pox does not become endemic in Australia. It is bad enough to have an epidemic in one spot, but I believe that if small-pox gains a foothold in Australia, the people will suffer. </para>

There were cases quarantined at Colmslie, in Queensland, and in Sydney, and Port Darwin, and we had a measles outbreak in Melbourne - the <inline font-style="italic">Irishman</inline> case. Again, the position of the Naval Base in Cockburn Sound, Western Australia, was not settled. There was a doubt as to whether we would be able to go to Woodman's Point for the quarantine station. It is doubtful whether we shall not have to go to Albany for the principal quarantine station if we cannot get a suitable place in or near Fremantle, having only a small sub-station at Fremantle. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Moreton will see the reason why the money was not all spent last year. We were  hung  up on account of small-pox outbreaks, which prevented the work going on at the quarantine stations in Queensland, New South Wales, and Port Darwin; and we were prevented from carrying out works in Western Australia on account of the location of the Naval Base. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Norris,</inline> in the last page of his report, speaks of " quarantine machinery well distributed on national lines," and he lays out a proper scheme of having first, second, and third-class stations, the first-class stations to be capable of housing 1,000 patients each - I believe Sydney is to have accommodation for 1,100 - and the smaller stations, such as Port Darwin, are to have accommodation down to eight persons. One of the complaints last year was that provision was not made at Port Darwin, Townsville, Thursday Is-, land, and Brisbane for small-pox patients, and that the latter had to be brought all the way to Sydney. The honorable member for North Sydney complained in the House that these cases were a menace to the people of Sydney, and that it was necessary to construct these works further north. The work at Townsville is now going on, and the Colmslie station, near Brisbane, is being erected on a site obtained from the State Government. I wish to know now from the present Minister what is proposed to be done. In the £40,000 they* put on the Estimates this year, I believe Ministers are not allowing enough to protect the people of Australia, lt is most important that we should have effective quarantine. I trust there will be an explanation as to why there is such a small sum provided. </para>

                        <para>. - I agree with the honorable member for Hunter that there is great reason to complain about the way in which the requirements in the matter of country post-offices are attended to. It is suggested that, in a matter of this kind, members representing metropolitan districts are more advantageously situated than are those who represent country districts. While it may be true that metropolitan districts are better served, this cannot be attributed entirely to the influence of metropolitan members, because the trading and commercial interests in the big centres have quite as much influence with all Governments as have members of Parliament. The sections of the community owning property and wealth must always exercise a considerable influence, and these sections are very strong in the big cities. I should like to call special attention to a new policy, or an undesirable extension of an old policy. I refer to the payment out of loan for new works for the Post and Telegraph Department. The sooner this House puts its foot down on that practice the better. This should not be a party question. Honorable members on both sides should be able to come to an agreement that telegraph, telephone, and post-office services, being public conveniences, should be self-supporting.  In the same way, sewerage and water services, as public conveniences, should be conducted on a paying basis. The position is vastly different when we come to deal with questions of naval and military defence, which may be regarded as an insurance against possible danger in the future. I think that the proposal of the Government to construct underground conduits for cables out of loan money should be protested against emphatically. I did not like the tone adopted by the Treasurer when he said that some honorable members would rather not have the work done than have it done out of loan. Honorable members, in this matter, should be placed at no disadvantage merely because they happen to hold a strong opinion that works of this kind should not be constructed out of loan. </para>

                            <para>- I am not anxious to follow the honorable member in the argument about posterity, which may be very interesting addressed to members of the People's party or some of the Liberal organizations. I hope that honorable members will adopt a firm attitude on this question of the class of works which may be legitimately constructed from loan. I wish now to refer to a matter which, in my opinion, the Government have treated in a very cavalier way. I refer to the Sub-Naval Base at Port Lincoln. Some honorable members will say that this is a matter affecting South Australia, but <inline font-style="italic">ibis</inline> an historical fact that the admirals of the British Navy who have been in command in Australia during the last thirty years, and not merely during the last two or three years, have annually taken the vessels under their command to Port Lincoln for gun practice and the  evolutions they  are required to go through under the Admiralty regulations. I should like to ask any man outside a lunatic asylum why the admirals have done this, if it was not because Port Lincoln is obviously the most suitable place they could find for carrying out evolutions of a certain character. This is the place that has been turned down by the present Government. In my opinion, we suffer from too many political minutes in connexion with the work of the Naval Board, and these minutes are not written by the members of the Board who have come here from England. I should not hesitate to leave the matter of the Naval Bases to the experts recommended by the Admiralty. These questions should be dealt with by independent naval experts, and their decision should not be influenced by the  interests of  big cities. If this course be followed, it will be found that what I have said of Port Lincoln is accurate. There is no escaping the fact that every admiral in. charge of British ships in Australian waters has gone year after year to Port Lincoln for the purpose I have stated. All the political humbug, scheming, and. political minutes written by members of the Naval Board cannot get away from that fact, and the conclusion which should obviously be drawn from it. The honorable member for Yarra has referred to the great work done by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Norris</inline> in his report on quarantine. We are being continually told of the tyranny of the Labour party, but there is a new tyranny arising in Australia, and that is the tyranny of the medical profession. The members of that profession would appear to have madeup their minds to run Australia, and, to some extent, they are doing it to-day. The medical profession, no doubt, contains a number of very able and conscientious men. Perhaps about a third of them are scientific men, but to the other two-thirds science is absolutely unknown. I do not propose to go at length into the matter of quarantine for small-pox, bub I should like to say that we have not, in my opinion, sufficient information on the subject to justify a layman in coming to the conclusion that we have small-pox in Australia at all to-day. There is no evidence that we have in the Commonwealth the small-pox which the honorable member for Maranoa and I saw something of in London in the early seventies, when every time a man went out of his house he would see the ambulance coming along to remove some of his neighbours. </para>

                            <para>- I refer to the north end of London, and I am strongly inclined to think that the small-pox of which I saw something in London was a type of disease unknown to many of the members of the medical profession practising in Australia. It was certainly a virulent and fatal disease, and honorable members who saw anything of it will remember how patients were marked after it. They would not recognise it from the photographs which have been shown of sufferers from the disease here. Some of the ablest scientific medical men we have, and not merely medical quacks, believe that the disease affecting people in Sydney is not a pure type of small-pox. Many of the symptoms of true small-pox are absent from the disease in Sydney. Some of them go so far as to say that this is a new type of disease. </para>

                            <para>- Some of them have not seen any cases. But the Minister knows very well that medical men continually consult each other, and that the diagnoses of cases are reported in various text-books, although the cases themselves may have occurred 500 or 1,000 miles away. A scientific medical man, if he is a proper physician, is able to judge by the symptoms, and when such medical men find an absence of the symptoms which were found in the cases in the Old Country, no wonder that they are suspicious as to whether this disease is what is commonly called by the name of small-pox. </para>

                            <para>- I am strongly of the opinion that the pure type of smallpox cannot live in the climate of Australia, and that, no doubt, was the opinion of a good many medical men until the fiat went forth from the union that the present outbreak is small-pox. No medical man dares to go against his own union. Talk of trade unions, sir! The medical men beat the members of any organization I know of as regards loyalty and the way they stick to each other, right or wrong. So long as a resolution on a matter has been agreed to by the union, the medical men are content. The Government ought, therefore, to be doubly careful in taking the opinion of medical men. I am not going to condemn Ministers. Naturally, they say, " We must act in accordance with the expert medical advice." But I would remind them that expert medical advice is divided. It would be well, therefore, for the Government to obtain the opinions of two or three, or four, expert medical men aud compare them . That would enable Ministers to proceed on something like safe ground. I question very much whether they have gone into this aspect of the matter at all. I do not blame them for what they have done. It is very likely that, if the previous Government had continued in office, they might have acted on similar lines. We have to be careful to see that this continent is not run by the doctors. I hail and wish much success to the American faith-healers who are coming here. One of the results of the spread of American faith-healing, no doubt, will be that half of the doctors will be thrown out of work. </para>

                            <para>- That is right. There is no doubt that the most lucrative portion of a doctor's practice is in curing people who are not ill at all. My honorable friend opposite laughs at my remark, but let me assure him that there is a number of persons wandering about Australia who fancy they are ill, when there is absolutely nothing wrong with them. If you can persuade such persons by means of faith to overcome the idea that they are not all right they will not suffer, but the medical profession will. I am not going to condemn the Government absolutely in this matter. Let the Minister of Trade and Customs get the expert opinion of several members of the medical profession and, if possible, also the opinion of a scientific medical man, because I contend that the best men in the medical profession to-day, and those whose services persons value when there is anything wrong with them, are the scientific medical men. Not one-third of the doctors have been scientifically trained, or have any idea of following their profession on scientific methods. I hope that the Government will see if they cannot better safeguard the interests of Australia. There is, of course, one thing which must be remembered. It may be that the New South Wales Government ought to do considerably more than they have been doing. It appears to me that they should have proceeded with considerably more vigour in isolating the cases and the contacts in those portions of Sydney where the population is very congested, and the housing accommodation is a disgrace to a city in Australia. This might be excused and pardoned if it occurred in the older countries of the world, but in a new Country it is simply scandalous. It is up to the Government of New South Wales to do considerably more than they have yet done in stamping out the disease. </para>

                        <para>. - I, as one of the city members, was surprised this morning to hear the line of argument pursued by certain country members. It is wrong that men who represent country districts in a National Parliament should try to bring about ill- feeling between the country and the city. Some of our honorable friends have said  that it was time that a Country party was formed in the House to make the Government do their duty. That was really a threat, but I hope the Government will not be swayed by it. </para>

                            <para>- In the National Parliament we should always be animated by a desire to benefit the whole of the Commonwealth. All that the honorable member for Hunter is out for is to get telephones and telegraph wires for his electorate. He neglects all other parts of the Commonwealth, whereas I take a broad national view. If the honorable member would look at all matters from a national stand-point, he would not concentrate his eyes upon the Hunter electorate. The same remark applies to the honorable member for Indi. He complained that the present Government have not been able to do in four months all the things that he requires to be done in Indi. He complained, too, about having received only an acknowledgment of communications respecting certain cases. And he asserted that the city is receiving all the benefits - the advance of science, the comforts of civilization, telephones, telegrams, and so forth. I have looked through the Estimates in vain for an indication that one work is going to be erected in the whole of South Sydney, but I cannot find a trace of an item. Some honorable members say that the cities are getting the whole of the plums, but I can assure them that we in the city are not getting anything like a proportion of the revenue which we contribute. The honorable member for Indi went so far as to say that the country keeps the city. That is the sort of stuff which country members give to country people when they ever have to deliver speeches in the farmyards. I regret exceedingly that any honorable members should so neglect to take a national view as to try to raise the cry of country <inline font-style="italic">versus</inline> city. Now the country depends upon the city for its very existence. What is the good of men growing anything in the country unless they can send it to the city to be sold? Of what use is it for the honorable member for Richmond to produce butter and milk unless he can sell the articles in" the city ? We in the city are supplying the money. We are employing the people in the country. Yet we find the honorable member for Hunter and others combining to form a Country party to fight the City party. I am really surprised at the attitude of the honorable member for Hunter. </para>

                            <para>- We would import then. I regret very much that hardly anything is provided on the Estimates for the extension of the Sydney Post Office. Any business man who has been there will realize that it is very congested, and is not able to accommodate the public. Visitors have to stand three or four deep at the counter. </para>

                            <para>- I missed that item. In looking through the general Works Estimates I saw that it was proposed to spend £78,000 in New South Wales. I approached the Honorary Minister and also the Postmaster- General on the question of taking possession of some land now vacant in George-street, with the view of extending the General Post Office. Some shops have been demolished, and there is now an opportunity to extend the buildings. Probably the Government will wait until the new buildings are erected, and then they will be compelled to pay for them. Now is the time for them to act if they intend to extend the Post Office. It must be extended. The Government cannot delay the work much longer, because the growth of Sydney is remarkable. I would remind my honorable friends from country districts that since Federation the population of Sydney has doubled, while the Post Office is almost in the same condition. </para>

                            <para>- Cities are centres of civilization .which distribute the comforts and the necessaries of life. As regards the vote for the Post and Telegraph Department, I do not object to a fair share of the money being spent in the country districts, but I distinctly object to any honorable member getting up here and saying that the cities are getting all the money. I represent a large part of Sydney, and I can assure honorable members that not a penny is provided on these Estimates for my district. 1 cannot get anything from the present Government, nor could I get anything from the last Government. As regards the appointment of an Inspector of Lighthouses, I wish to say a few words, as it is a very important matter. Although no money is provided for the erection of new lighthouses, yet the Government have appointed an Inspector of Lighthouses at a salary of £800.  What is he going to inspect ? The Government said they wanted in the position not a mariner, but an engineer, so that he would be able to construct lighthouses. Apparently they are not going to construct any lighthouses, for they have cut down the Estimates. </para>

                            <para>- In the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> notice inviting applications for the position of Inspector of Lighthouses, it was stated that the applicants must have a knowledge of the whole of the Australian coast, and that they must be mariners. Forty applications were received, and that of a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Ramsbotham,  of Western Australia, was recommended. I went through the papers, and found that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Ramsbotham  is not a mariner, but a civil engineer, and that the Public Service Commissioner recommended him because he; had a temperament that fitted him for the position. The man best qualified for the office - the gentleman who furnished the Departments with reports on the lighting of our coast - was turned down, I understand, on account of his temperament. I do not know what temperament is required for the position - whether the Inspector of Lighthouses should have a good, or bad, or a mixed temper - but it was said that the Government proposed to spend a lot of money on the erection of new lighthouses, and that a civil engineer, who would understand such work, would be the most suitable person for the position. I naturally anticipated, therefore, that these Estimates would make provision for the building of several lighthouses on our coast. I find, however, that the amount proposed to be voted, instead of being an increase, is rather a reduction on last year's vote. Why should it be necessary to appoint an Inspector of Lighthouses at £800 a year, with no temper whatever, when there are uo new works to be constructe'd ? </para>

Victorians always talk of expenditure on the Federal Territory as money being spent in New South Wales. That, however, is not the case. We have 900 square miles of territory which, for the most, part, has been given to the Commonwealth by the State of New South Wales, and every penny spent on that territory is enhancing the property of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        matter of fact, provision should be made for ,the spending of £1,000,000 rather than £285,000. A million could be well spent up there. It would have the effect of increasing the population, and so increasing the revenue of the Territory, which in time will be self-supporting. I shall have to speak in parables to the Minister of Trade and Customs, and therefore, by way of a parable, let me point out that if the pioneer legislators of New South Wales and Victoria had displayed the foresight exhibited by this Parliament in regard to the Federal Territory, and had declared that all lands in and around Melbourne and Sydney, within a radius of 15 miles of a certain point, should be permanently reserved from sale, it would not have been necessary for either State to raise money on the London market. They would now be drawing heavy revenues from these city lands, just as the Duke of Westminster derives a princely income from lands in London which he has leased. We have declared that no land in the Federal Territory shall be sold, so that money spent there is really an investment for the benefit of the whole of the people of the Commonwealth. I hope the Minister will consider the  advisableness  of increasing the proposed vote. No item in these Estimates will give a better return. While the Department is at present constructing roads for the use of future generations in the Territory, they are neglecting to erect buildings. These roads will be overgrown with grass before long, unless people are encouraged to settle there. I should like to see our Commonwealth enterprises established there - the Commonwealth Woollen Mills, the Commonwealth Clothing Factory, and so forth.

                            <para>- I thought I should draw the honorable member for Corio when I referred to the woollen mills. If our Commonwealth factories were established there we should have at once an increased settlement, which would augment the revenue from the Territory. While some honorable members may object to the item, I promise the Minister that I shall vote for it. I regret that any honorable member should be disposed to regard the matter from a purely selfish and parochial point of view. The founders of Federation entered into a contract to establish the Capital in New South Wales, and I am sorry that the late Government did so little for the Territory. It is true that they laid down the foundations for handsome monuments, and so forth, but they neglected to erect any of the buildings that will be required. Not one plan for these buildings has yet been prepared. Leaving this subject, I desire to express my regret that the cry of town <inline font-style="italic">versus</inline> country should have been raised this morning, and I hope that we shall hear no more of it in this Parliament. I should like to give a few words of advice to the honorable member for Indi, who referred to the subject this morning. If my young and honorable friend wants this country to progress, then he ought not to try to split this Parliament into city and country parties. </para>

                            <para>- Many things required for public works are constructed in our cities and sent to the country. The joinery for a country post-office, for instance, is usually made in a city. Then, again, I would ask my honorable friends from the country what advantage the farmer would reap from his industry if the men in the cities did not build ships to carry his produce to market. We have elaborate systems of cool storage on our oversea vessels to carry perishable products, and it is the city man who builds them. It is, therefore, a mistake' for any young man entering this House to say, " We must have a Country party." As the representative of a city constituency, I am very anxious to assist in the development of the country on proper lines. My honorable friends who represent country constituencies, when they tell the farmer, " You are the back-bone and the mainstay of the country," have their tongues in their cheeks. They know they are " pulling his leg." Both parties must work together for the development of the country. I agree with my honorable friends that the country needs telephones and telegraphs. But I ask them, how can the instruments, and wires that are needed be obtained except from the cities where they .are' manufactured ? Then they say that all these works should be carried out by contractors. If the contract system were made universal, an -army of overseers would be needed. Without oversight you would find telegraph poles put only a short distance into the ground, and in the first storm half of them would be blown over. I trust that the Government will put a large sum on the Estimates for the construction of lighthouses, because the protection of life .and property on  our coasts  is of paramount importance. I hope, too, that the Honorary Minister will see that greater facilities are provided for the work that has to be done at the General Post Office, Sydney. It is the revenue earned in the cities and large- towns that makes the Postal Department <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> paying concern. </para>

I hope that the vote for. the Federal Capital Territory will be increased. Although it is more than twelve years since Federation was inaugurated, there is not yet in the Territory a permanent building for governmental purposes. I trust that before long applications will be invited for designs for the principal buildings in the city, and that when they have been dealt with there will be no more delay. Every pound spent on the Capital will prove a good investment to the Commonwealth. It is scandalous to say that the money is being spent in New South Wales; it is all being spent in the Federal Territory for the benefit "of the whole of Australia. I trust that the Minister will push on with these matters, and not dilly-dally as his predecessors have done. </para>

                        <para>.- I rise to reply to the remarks of the honorable member for Grey and the honorable member for South Sydney. The latter twitted the honorable member for Indi with wishing to create a Country party, but possibly that will come to be necessary. The honorable member for Grey told us that during the election campaign, especially in his State, Liberal candidates went up and down the country speaking against the squandering of money on the Federal Capital by the Fisher Government. I am opposed to the spending of £280,000 this year on the Federal Capital. If we were to build the proposed city, I do not know where we would get people to stock it. In my opinion, the Government should appoint a Committee to ascertain what lias already been done, and what it is advisable to do in the future, so that we may get value for our expenditure. The main question that we have to consider in regard to all proposals for the expenditure of money is : What value shall we get for it? I agree with the honorable member for Darwin as to the need for proper system in the management of public affairs. Honorable members sometimes say, " You will reduce wages," but I never hear them talk of the need for getting value for the wages that are paid. In my opinion, our methods need to be systematized. Want of system is killing us. We are spending money lavishly without getting a proper return. I should like to see the vote for the Capital reduced, and the money thus saved made available for telephone extensions in the country districts. We deplore centralization. But why does every one strive to get into the towns? Because there are more conveniences and more enjoyments there. Even lads born and bred in the country will not stay there when confronted with the superior attractions of town life. We should, therefore, try to make the country more attractive. I know places within 25 miles of Melbourne to which young fellows have to ride 10 or 12 miles on Saturday night in order to ascertain who won the football match. Telephone communication would keep our people at home more. </para>

                        <para>.- I entirely indorse the remarks of the honorable member who has just resumed his seat in regard to the need for telephonic communication in the country. In my own electoral division there are quite a number of mining centres, and a considerable number of men who reside on selections. These people undertook the hard pioneering work, and I hold that those who go out into remote mining areas make it easy for those who come after them. They receive very little assistance, and many of them remain in these outlying portions of the country for the greater part of their lives. If there is one portion of the Commonwealth which requires to be carefully handled with a view to promoting settlement there, it is the Gulf portion. After all, there are opportunities in the Gulf country, and that is the one portion of Australia above all others which, from a defence point of view, requires protection. We should encourage settlement there by every means in our power. I regret to say that in some parts of the Gulf country population is decreasing. This is a matter which requires serious attention. When the honorable member for Corio spoke of young men who ride 10 or 12 miles to get the result of a football match, and who, if the telephone were available, would probably stay at home, there- was a good deal of wisdom in his suggestion. In the mining centres one never knows when an accident will happen. I have known men who have had to be conveyed 60 or 70 miles in order to receive medical attention. I have known of a man having to be carried 30 miles along a road in order to meet a doctor. In these circumstances, the Government should endeavour to give these outlying districts as much telephonic communication as possible. The constituency which I represent is nearly four times the size of Victoria. lt embraces an area of 333,000 square miles, and there are people scattered all through it. There are some parts of it where telephonic communication could be easily and cheaply established. But when a request is made for the erection of a line, the departmental estimate is usually out of all proportion to the value of the work. It frequently happens that the people interested are prepared to undertake the work for one-third of the departmental estimate! I am glad to say that, during the recent election campaign, I was able, through the medium of privately-erected lines, to get into communication by telephone with my wife, who happened to be in Hughenden, 180 miles distant. I had to establish connexion through a number of sheep stations. Most of these lines are erected along the boundary fences of the runs. </para>

                            <para>- I was. On one side the nearest town was Hughenden, and on the south side the nearest town was Muttaburra. These cheap lines are of considerable value to the general public. A thousand and one things may happen in such remote areas, and it is extremely convenient to be able to get into communication with some distant centre by means of these privately-erected lines. I hope that "the Government will grant as much telephonic communication as possible in all parts of Australia. If they do that, they will be doing good. At the same time, I strongly object to the expenditure upon the Federal Capital being decreased for that purpose. I would like to see the expenditure upon the Capital twice as much as it is at present, because I hold that we shall never have Federation in the true sense of the word until this Parliament is located in its own home. </para>

                        <para>. - It is so long since I had the pleasure of hearing my own voice in this chamber - owing to a monopoly of the public speaking by the Opposition - that I began to doubt whether I had not lost the faculty of speech. The honorable member for Corio and the honorable member for Kennedy have supplied me with two excellent texts upon which to hang the remarks that I propose to make. One of them commented on the very incomplete and extravagant methods which are adopted in this country in carrying out our public works, while the other drew particular attention to the great need that exists for -telephone communication in the rural areas, and to the apparent hesitation on the part of the Government to supply that need. ' I have here an interesting illustration of the  red-tapism  of the Postal Department in regard to the erection of country telephone lines. It appears that a telephone line is required over a very few miles, and that about eighteen months have elapsed since the work was first, brought under the notice of the Department. I have here a letter which affords a typical instance of how systems run. to seed instead of being modified and made practicable by the personal interest which we should get under private enterprise. </para>

                            <para>- I did think that the honorable member had gone out for the day. He is a sort of stormy petrel, who comes here and creates all sorts of discord between honorable members, thus preventing us from getting on with the business of the country. I hold in my hand a letter relating to the telephone lines to which I have referred, which informs those- who require it that the Department has called for tenders for the work and cannot get any. It did not seem to know what step it should take next. Now, I assume that a business man would have tried to ascertain why no tenders were received for the work. One has only to take up the papers which I have here to see that they would absolutely bewilder any ordinary tenderer who was desirous of carrying out a work of that character. But, before I touch further on. this matter, I will mention one instance which recently came under my notice. The case was that of an honorable member who required a telephone line in his district to be run a distance of 14 miles from an office to a race-course. The work was delayed for so many months that the proprietors of the race-course at last resolved to carry it out themselves.' They had appealed to the Department again and again, and, although the Department had done nothing, it was asking the modest sum of £480 to carry out the work. I repeat that it was so long in taking steps to do anything, that the proprietors of the race-course erected the line themselves. Taking Government material for the purpose, they carried it out for 25 per cent, of the price that the Government were demanding. In other "words, they completed for £120 the under - taking for which the Government had asked £480. That is a sample of the way in which work is done by the Postal Department, to-day. </para>

                    <para class="block">Now, we all know the type of men who enter into these local contracts. They are substantial and practical men, who do not possess any great legal knowledge, and they are men who are so impressed with the necessity for being safe, that they will not enter into a contract of a very complex and questionable character. The Department did not receive a tender. Why ? The answer, I think, is to be found in the- papers which I hold in my hand. Here is a contract which is not for a very large sum, seeing that the deposit required was only £45. Yet I find that about twenty-five sheets of foolscap are sought to be made an attachment to the contract. First, we have the tender form. Then we come to a schedule of one page. A paper follows which is called " Details of work in connexion with the erection of a telephone line between Junee Junction and Junee Reefs," and which covers two pages containing eleven paragraphs. We then pass on to " Special conditions and instructions," which occupy three more pages. In order to give the Committee an idea of the sort of microscopic details which are contained in this paper, I quote the following : - </para>

                            <para>- I do not care whether the honorable member listens to me or not. This work was submitted to the public, and tenders were called for, but only one tender was received, and it was ' 1 too high . " So they got another tender, and that was " too high," altliough.it was the only one received. Then they called for fresh tenders and received none at all, and so they came back to the unfortunate parliamentary, representative, who had been agitated by the people, who were wondering why on earth he could not get something done. Then these people turned round and did the work themselves at 25 per cent, of the cost claimed by the Department. One of the great dangers of public departments is that they run to seed. None of the officers have any personal financial interest in the successful working of the Department; no balance-sheet is ever issued to the public to show how much they are losing or making, or whether, in carrying out work departmentally, they are not paying four times the price for which private individuals can get things done. In this case, which can be verified by the honorable member for Indi, we have a case in point. The Government estimate a work to cost £480, which is subsequently done for £120. I do not speak without knowledge or experience. </para>

                            <para>- I had three years' management of the biggest spending Department in New South Wales - the Works Department - and during my term of office many millions of pounds were spent. I found that the Department, in the few years preceding my advent, had so run to- seed in the way indicated by the contract which I have just quoted, that I obtained one of the most practical accountants in Australia to devote some weeks to the Department to see where the work was overlapping; whether it was being properly done, and whether the men were fit for their positions. He was to report generally to me on the best means of putting that Department on the footing that a great business establishment would occupy if it were being managed on economical lines. That led to a great many changes, but did a great deal of good, because it prevented certain officers from trespassing beyond their domain, and prevented the work from overlapping, and also prevented a great waste of public money in carrying out works in an  unbusiness-like  way. Altogether, it practically ventilated the Department, because it got rid of what is constantly growing up in public departments. When a man is engaged with a private firm, he knows that his particular department will be criticised at the end of the year on the work it has done, and on the cost of the work; and it is in his interests to manage the work in such a way that at the end of the year the department will show a creditable result. On the other hand, in a public department, an officer has certain duties to do ; no one ever estimates the cost, with a view to showing at the end of the year how it will compare with the work of other people ; and the consequence is that, very often, the work is done with so much red-tape that it will lead to the result indicated by the case which the honorable member for Indi has brought under my notice. I heartily indorse all that has been said by the honorable member for Kennedy with regard to telephones. There seems to be an impression in the minds of Ministers that telephones are only required for such things as were mentioned by one honorable member - communicating the results of cricket matches or races. I have had a great many cases brought under my notice where it was a matter of' life or death to have telephone communication. Now that the wires are erected along fences, the work can be done so cheaply that there should not be any part of the country where there is a settlement of population that is not supplied with "this great convenience. A telephone creates business. It conduces very much to the commercial activity of the country. </para>

                    <para>I wish now to say a word about the prevalent idea that these things ought all to be done out of revenue. Telephones are a revenue-producing, investment. In many cases public telephones return an extravagant profit on the capital laid out on them. I was speaking the other day to an American expert, and he told me that, in the public companies in the United States, the proprietors were so anxious to have telephones erected for the public that if a new telephone was ordered to-day it would be erected to-morrow. </para>

                            <para>- Imagine, in this country, expecting a telephone to be put up the day after it was ordered. I should expect it to be done on the same day next year. Yet there is a profit standing out. We are told over and over again by the Department that they only keep in hand sufficient material for a certain, time. They do not hold large stocks, and if demands happen to come from different parts of the country for these conveniences, and the stock is exhausted, to have to wait until they import more is not business. The interest on a very large stock of material, out of which the public could be supplied with telephone conveniences, would not be great, and there is no reason why there should not be a large stock on hand to anticipate very large orders. I do not agree with the principle that these works must necessarily be constructed out of revenue. I have had answers to requests from my constituency, where certain telephones were required, to say that the money was not available. We required a little sum of money to put up a public telephone in a public place in a thickly-populated suburb of Sydney, and we were told, in this great country of ours, that there was not the money " available " for that particular telephone, or for a number of others. There should be no hesitation in- getting that money out of loan funds, because telephone construction comes properly under the category of loan expenditure. It is not only a permanent work if it is properly managed from year to year, but it is revenue-producing, and the sooner the Government arrive at the conclusion that works of that sort should be done out of loan money, or that they can borrow money for the purpose if they do not have it now, the better it will be for this country. For years I have urged on previous Governments, and I urged on the present Treasurer eight years ago, that he should utilize loan moneys to build post-offices. In the first place, we buy the land, which is a permanent asset. The mere fact of establishing a post-office on the site gives it an increment which it will maintain for all time; it is of a permanent character; and the moment a building is erected it produces more than sufficient revenue to pay interest on the loan. I remember the Government spending in one year no less than £900,000 out of revenue on post-offices. It is a wrong principle. I have quoted to the House more than once a most able little treatise from one of the annual pamphlets of the Tasmanian Statistician, in which he lays down with proper accuracy the distinction between loan expenditure and revenue expenditure. We know that, in other parts of the world, this practice of paying for permanent or revenue-producing assets out of revenue is considered absolutely wrong. These works should be built out of loan money. The asset passes down to posterity ; the loan should pass down to posterity-. If the work is of a perishing character, and yet produces revenue, it is the .duty of the Government to maintain it, just as they maintain a railway to-day, and to simply charge each generation with the interest on the expenditure, while conferring on each generation the benefit which the establishment of the work brings with it. The telephone system is in a thoroughly unsatisfactory condition. Telephones should be distributed throughout the country, and if the Government have not enough money for them, they should borrow, or take the money out of loan funds for the purpose. I say, further, that the arrangements in connexion with these contracts should be carried out in a thoroughly practical manner. Can it be supposed for a moment that, if a private firm were to employ an architect to prepare a specification to carry out a little work of, say, 15 miles of telephone, he would have twenty or thirty pages of conditions, which, possibly, the country contractor would have to read, and submit himself to, and which, probably, lie could not understand if he had to do it? A practical architect will make out a simple set of specifications, and if he be a well-known man the contractor will be perfectly satisfied that he should be the arbiter in any matter in dispute. Under the system adopted by the Post and Telegraph Department, not only do we find twenty-five or thirty pages of addenda laid down iti black and white, and in the most technical terms; but if the slightest dispute arises, the decision of the Postmaster-General is final. In the erection of very large buildings, and in the construction of railways, although the specifications may be somewhat long, the terms and conditions of contract are of the simplest character. The engineer in the case of railways, or the architect in the case of buildings, is the final arbiter, and as he will be known to the contractors, they can trust him, and there is very little difficulty. In view of what the Prime Minister said the other night as to the great want of business methods in certain branches of the Public Service, I trust that the Postmaster-General will look very closely into the way in which telephone line construction is being carried out. I trust also that the Government will see that, as the honorable member for Kennedy has pointed out, telephone communication will be extended throughout the country wherever there are people willing to pay for the facilities afforded them. </para>

                        <para>. - I wish honorable members to understand that I hold no brief for the Commonwealth electrical engineers. It cannot be said that in speaking on their behalf I am seeking their votes, because their number is so few. But I understand a little about their work, and I must say that I have just listened to one of the most unfair and unjust attacks that could be made upon any body of men. It was most unjust and unfair for the honorable member for Parkes to produce a great number of specifications and conditions, when he should know that they are not provided for the construction of the line, but are submitted for the guidance of the various bodies in calling for tenders. For instance, the conditions with respect to insulators are submitted when calling for tenders. What the honorable member has succeeded in doing has been to show that the work is highly technical, and that it is essential that it should be in the hands of trained engineers. The object of the specifications to which he has referred is to secure that the work shall be carried out properly in order that the public may be provided with a good telephone service. The honorable member would have us revert to the old system of calling for tenders to enable what he would call " the practical man in the country " to take up the work. I have had some of these practical men in the country under my supervision. One of them was left for a little time to himself, and, although the specification provided that the poles must he put 4 ft. 6 in. in the ground, as soon as this practical man got out of sight of the supervising officer he cut 2 feet off the poles, and put them only 2 ft. 6 in. in the ground. Fortunately we discovered some of the  sawn-off  butts in the bush, and we had the line unearthed, with the result that we found that several miles of it had not been constructed in accordance with the specifications at all, and if it had remained in the condition in which it was built the first wind that came along would have blown it across the roads, and, perhaps, brought about loss of life. . We have had a speech on this subject from an honorable member who would not know an insulator from a telegraph sounder. I had one of these gentlemen at one time under me. He had been recommended to me by a lawyer. I put him to work, and he put in a whole day digging one post-hole, whilst in the same time another man on the job had sunk eight post-holes. </para>

                            <para>- No; that work was done under contract, but the untrained man shifted ten times as much dirt as it was necessary for him to do in the simple operation of digging an ordinary telegraph post-hole. I know nothing about the qualifications of the honorable member for Parkes as a lawyer, but he seems to be under the impression that he can become a first-class telegraph engineer after a ten minutes' perusal of the papers submitted to him by a contractor who evidently was not allowed to do as he pleased by the Department. The Postmaster-General must be very careful of what he is doing if he allows contractors to construct these lines. The system was tried in every one of the States before Federation, and was abandoned, because it was not satisfactory. In connexion with one line put up by a contractor which came under my notice, upon inspection of the line we could not understand its enormous resistance, but upon a close examination we discovered that the contractor had cut the wire in every case in tying on the insulators. He had spoiled pounds' worth of wire. This was one of the cheaply-constructed lines such as the honorable member for Parkes would like to see. How long are we to be subjected to such twaddle as that to which- we have listened to-day, from an honorable member speaking of something about which he knows nothing at all. The departmental authorities are to-day working against terrible odds in trying to build up a Department of trained men . They are dreadfully handicapped in their work by the way in which those in authority are influenced by such speeches as that to which we have listened from the honorable member for Parkes. I hope that we have heard the last of this kind of thing. I contend that it would be better to continue the day-labour system for this work. If the volume of work to be done was sufficient to warrant contractors specializing, and keeping a body of trained men to do it, the position would be different, but the honorable member for Parkes proposes that any one should be allowed to tender for the construction of a telephone line, and should be allowed to do practically as he pleases. He referred to an architect in connexion with the building of a house, but if he were having a house built, would he not require to have all the details specified ? What sort of an architect would he be who did not set out all the details? In the same way, an electrical engineer who knew his business would set out every detail for this work, even to the number of nails required in putting the hoop-iron on the poles. This must be done if the work is to be carried out in a substantial and satisfactory manner. The honorable member for Kennedy was all right in what he said, in so far as his remarks referred to the kind of line which he indicated. I interjected while he was speaking that the line to which he referred was not constructed near a city. I wished honorable members to understand that the line must be going through miles of unoccupied country, and was not affected by other lines running parallel to it. If there were other lines parallel to such a line as the honorable member described, it would be useless. Only yesterday, I tried to talk to a  gentleman  at Lara, and I found there was a considerable amount of induction on the line, so that I could only hear about half that this gentleman wished to say. The reason was that there are a lot of lines parallel to the Lara line, which is one of the cheaply constructed lines. It was imperfectly constructed, owing to the lack of engineering knowledge of those who carried it out; or, more likely, want of funds to enable the engineer to construct a metallic circuit. I remind honorable members that, at all events, until quite recently, many requirements such as the height of the poles to be used, are specified in the Act of Par,liament. What I should advise would be the establishment of a zone system of construction. The first zone should include lines in large centres requiring the most perfect construction, such, for instance, as a main trunk line between Melbourne and Geelong, or Melbourne and Ballarat. Such lines should be constructed under the best possible conditions to secure a low resistance. Then, in less thickly populated districts, we could have less perfect lines, and in purely country districts lines could be built much more cheaply, say, for £12 6s. per mile. These would be removed from other lines, and though the resistance might be a little high, so long as one could hear the ring of the telephone, he could speak over it. It will pay us to have skilled engineers to carry out the construction of our lines. I remind honorable members that, even if construction is handed over to contractors, we shall require to have supervising officers. I have walked about with my hands in my pockets for weeks supervising the work of a contractor, and I might just as well, at the time, have been directing the men, and doing something for the wages I was receiving. The honorable member for Parkes has told us that no estimates are submitted, but there is not a telephone line constructed in Australia to-day without an estimate being submitted. An estimate is in every case submitted by the local engineer to the Engineer-in-Chief, who, in turn, submits it to the Postmaster-General. I venture to say that the Department may go so far as to ask the engineer to submit a tender side by side with the tender of a contractor. The honorable member for Parkes was amused by the provision for bracketing, but that was because he did not understand the importance of it. If brackets are not properly used in the construction of a line, the first strain' to which it is subjected may strip it back for half-a-mile. The honorable member may be a brilliant lawyer, but he has demonstrated to-day that he knows nothing of telegraph and telephone construction, or of electrical engineering. I ran a copper line between Hobart and  Paratta  in rough country, as the honorable member for Franklin will know. I had six men working with me, and with those men I did 4 miles of line a day. Untrained men could not possibly have done the work, and they would probably, when insulating, have given an extra turn to the tie wire, and the first frost would break the line altogether. It is necessary to tie the wire carefully on the insulators when straining the line between the poles. </para>

                            <para>- I do not refer to galvanized wire, but to copper wire. Where there are a number of lines in use, galvanized wire cannot be used. With the use of No. 8 galvanized wire, the resistance amounts to 16 ohms to the mile, whilst with copper wire the resistance is less than 8 ohms. The honorable member for Riverina may know a good merino lamb, but there is a great deal of difference between a merino lamb and a telephone line. On looking up this matter, I find that while the honorable member for Barrier and the honorable member for Kalgoorlie were at the Post Office, during the <inline font-style="italic">regime</inline> of the Fisher Government, they constructed more telephone lines in Australia than had any other Government during the previous ten years. More telephones were constructed in the Indi electorate, I believe, than in any other division in Victoria, and, unfortunately, for Indi, and the people of Australia, the people of Indi did not recognise that fact, and turned down a good man who had done much for the district, regardless of his political ideas. Much has been done in Australia. The country people have my sympathy, but I tell the farmer in the country that it is essential for him to have a telephone line in the city working well, if it is judiciously and fairly used. Sometimes, I am told, when a farmer calls on merchant A, and after getting a price says, " I will not take that price," the merchant telephones round to merchant B before the farmer can get there. That is not putting the telephone to the best use, because a price is fixed. It is essential that the telephone system of a city shall be in first-class condition. There is nothing more irritating to a person than to have paid money for a telephone service, and not to be able to hear what a subscriber is saying to him. </para>

                            <para>- It is essential to have a good service. One day a friend of the honorable member and myself - an eminent gentleman in Tasmania - lost £50 in five minutes owing to the defective working of the telephone. A mistake was made in speaking over the line in a business transaction, and it cost that gentleman £50. Had it been a good silent line he could have done the business safely and well. That is why I am anxious to see telephone lines constructed under first-class engineers. I suppose it is because honorable members have to ride in railway trains that they do not suggest that any farmer along the line should construct a section of the railway opposite his farm. </para>

                            <para>- So far as I can gather, the engineers have not been able to get sufficient money to stock material, and so on. The Fisher Government rose to the occasion, and a sum of, I think, £600,000, was voted to enable the electricians of the Department to continue the work. We have still, I believe, an abominable system that compels the Department to employ so many casual hands, and if the Public Service Act is complied with, as soon as an engineer has trained a number of men - they are employed for about six or nine months - they are put off, and new men have to be brought in and trained. Did any one ever hear of such a ridiculous practice as that ? </para>

                            <para>- That may be. Let the men remain in the Department - as casual hands if you like. Australia is not likely to go back. Have we gone back in the construction of telephone lines? Some honorable members seem to have no confidence in the country at all. When an engineer wants a number of men he is asked how many, and I understand, from practical experience, the names and the number of the men are submitted to another gentleman - the Public Service Commissioner - and he, with no responsibility on his shoulders, says how many men may be employed. Once the men are engaged they are handed over to the Postmaster-General, and the responsibility of the Commissioner ceases. Whether the men are capable or not I do not know. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly ; and what is the use of any honorable member saying differently here? The honorable member for Parkes made a great point about borrowing for the construction of telephone lines. Suppose that the Department is about to construct a telephone line with borrowed money. The life of the poles of the line will be about twelve years. It is often said, " Never mind about a pound or two for the cost of that line; the money is coming out of the loan account." But let the money come out of the general revenue, and see how careful one is in framing his estimates. Why ? Because he realizes the responsibility which is on his shoulders. I have known a telegraph line to be constructed with borrowed money and renewed from the same source. Where is our asset in that case ? </para>

                            <para>- That is another matter. Why do honorable members on the other side desire to indulge in the borrowing system ? Because it is a form of government to which they have committed themselves; because they represent a body of wealthy persons. The capitalist has to find investments for his money. If honorable gentlemen on the other side make it possible for the capitalist to get good investments, and they are strong enough over there to make laws that will compel the workers to pay the interest on the borrowed money, they are on top every time. That is why they want to resort once more to the old system of borrowing money; but I think they will find that they have a very hard row to hoe before they succeed in the attempt. </para>

                            <para>- After long study and thought by an engineer, it was found conducive to the life of a telegraph pole to put in it a certain ingredient, which keeps insects from eating it and preserves it. There is only one way of putting in the ingredient, and that is the one which the discoverer intimated to the Department - in other words, to use the preservative faithfully and well. Suppose that the Department sent up country the . ingredient in a tin without any instructions as to its use, a man might put it round the bottom of a pole before the pole is put into the ground. There is a simple instruction as to how to introduce the preservative into the pole. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. I wish to remind honorable members that, all over the world, these engineers are being paid the highest salary which is paid in any branch of engineering. Why ? Because of the technical matters which they have to deal with. The honorable member for Parkes spoke of what was done in the United States, but he failed to tell us that, in Australia, we can get a telephone service for £6, just as good as one for which £15 is paid in Chicago - a cheaper service, for a larger number of rings. </para>

                            <para>- Let the honorable member consider the cost of constructing the line through country where  hundreds of big trees had to be felled to save the line from being interrupted every twenty-four hours. Let him remember the hilly country through which the line had to be taken, and the crooked roads, necessitating the use of about thirty posts to the mile, instead of twenty-five. Again, let him remember the amount of work which had to be done to make it a silent line. Speaking from memory, I think that, by the exercise of his influence, the honorable member has got a metallic circuit for the whole distance. Quite clearly I have heard a lady speaking over the line. If the voice is suitable, one can hear at a distance of 120 miles from the Franklin district over practically a silent line. The honorable member should be the last to complain, because more money has been spent in the Franklin electorate, I think, than in any other district of the same size in Australia. There is a service which enables nearly every fruit-grower in the district to communicate every morning with the market, where he may sell his fruit, and very cheaply indeed. Why is not the honorable member fair? I hope that the Minister will go in for the zone system I have suggested, giving the engineer more freedom, and not allowing so much interference with him by the novice. He is a good man who sticks to his last. Let us all do that, and we shall then have a better system of telephonic communication. Having seen in operation the telephone systems of many countries, I have come to the conclusion that the Commonwealth system, while yet capable of much improvement, is not far behind them. If we give the officers the necessary time and money to make improvements, we shall not have much trouble. The only other point that I desire to make is that it is unwise to stock too heavily. By way of example, I would point out that, nine years ago, the Ericsson magneto telephone, which would ring over an enormous resistance, was regarded as something wonderful, whereas to-day, for city use, it is practically obsolete. Then, again, wires that were used ten years ago have been abandoned. We have also been told that insulators are going to be manufactured locally. What would be said of a Postmaster-General who imported and stocked 1,000,000 insulators, at a cost of 1s. apiece, if it were found a little later that we could obtain them locally much cheaper, and at the same time encourage local industry ? Would there not be a howl of indignation because of his want of foresight ? I hope, therefore, that the Minister will not be influenced to any great extent by the criticism of novices in this matter, and that the Department will not stock goods to the extent that has been urged. These honorable members are doing their best for their constituents, but what we want is to have a little more faith in our public servants. They are not all working merely for filthy lucre. We have in our Departments many capable men who are excellent organizers. A gentleman was brought down here from Queensland some time ago to organize the Postal Department, and I venture to say that no private company doing business in Melbourne to-day is better organized than that Department is under him. </para>

                        <para>.- Although my words will be few, I hope that the subject to which I am about to refer will be regarded as of sufficient importance to demand the serious consideration of the Government, with a view to the remedying of certain evils. I wish to point out, as plainly as I can, what I consider to be the infamous conditions operating in connexion with our various quarantine stations. Our present  Speaker,  together with the honorable member for Franklin, the honorable member for Herbert, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> and I, were quarantined last year at the Sydney station. I am glad that we were, although I regret that what was supplied to me as Australian lymph proved to be New Zealand filth that ought not to have been given to any human being. The life of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> was seriously imperilled by its use, whilst the case of the honorable member for Herbert was also bad. On the other hand, the Manilla lymph obtained from the United States of America Government, and the Japanese lymph, proved to be perfect, and left no bad results. I said, a little over a year ago, that Sydney was standing on the brink of an inferno, and I repeat that statement to-day. We were told when in quarantine that only 1 per cent. of the population of Sydney had been prepared by vaccination to resist small-pox ; and I did not dream then that proof of the truth of my words would so soon  be forthcoming. I think it was the honorable member for Franklin who said, at the time, that Sydney had escaped epidemics of small-pox, not because of the quarantine arrangements, but in spite of them. We know that on a balmy day the germs of small-pox will carry a considerable distance, and that there is practically no distance between the boundary fence of the quarantine station in Sydney and the town of Manly. The postman used to call at the station every day; but I do not want to say too much about the matter. There is only one other point that I desire to make. If three men, one extremely wealthy, another of moderate means, and the third in absolute poverty, were imprisoned for a crime, would there not be a shriek of indignation on the part of the public if any difference were made in their treatment in prison - if the wealthy man were given a good bed and an eiderdown quilt, whilst the man of poverty had only bare boards and a blanket? No one would defend such a system. Then, why should there be any difference in the treatment of first and second class and steerage passengers when ordered into quarantine ? Why should the second class passengers, and those who travel steerage, as well as the sailors and firemen, be treated as they have been by past Governments? I hope the Prime Minister will effect a change. Men and women sent into quarantine are held under restraint purely for the good of the community. They are, for the time being, the guests of the Commonwealth; and, just as we do not differentiate between the rights of citizens over twenty-one years of age, so there should be no difference in the treatment of men and women in quarantine, no matter whether they travel in the saloon or in the steerage. On one occasion, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hugh</inline> Mahon, who, until lately, represented Coolgardie in this House, was sent into quarantine, and was ordered off a plot of grass because he had travelled second class, and the grass plot was reserved for saloon passengers. Our accommodation in Sydney was all that could be desired, but the second and third class passengers were not thought fit to have even decent places to wash in. Russian women travelling in the steerage had to bathe in a bath 2ft. 6 in. long and 18 inches wide, and 15 inches deep - receptacles which had been provided for the washing of clothing. </para>

                    <para class="block">I understand that we have on these Estimates £40,000 in respect of " Quarantine." Last year, £50,000 was voted for that purpose, but only some £27,000 was expended; so that really only a sum of £17,000, added to the unexpended balance of last year, has been made available for improvements. We all recognise that there must be some control over our shipping, and at present I would not do away with the regulation under which the owners of a ship ordered into quarantine have to provision the passengers whilst they remain there. Such a requirement must necessarily make officers careful in the carriage of passengers and merchandise from infected ports. But let the sleeping apartments, the bathing accommodation, and the grass plots provided by the Government be the same for all classes. Those whose only crime is that they cannot afford to travel first class should be treated just as saloon passengers are. Let us have equal privileges, and fair treatment for all. </para>

                    <para>Constable Murphy . . . waited on me to-day, and asked me to file an electoral claim, stating that my name had been removed from the roll. Of course, I refused to do so, and told the constable that my name was on the roll, and that I voted at last election. I cannot understand how my name could be removed from the roll. Because of my position, and the work I am engaged in, I venture to say that I am as much before the public as any man in Brisbane, and more so than .my man in this district. I should be greatly obliged if you would, at your convenience, see to this disfranchisement. I do not want any public fuss made about it, but I do want some explanation and reinstatement without being further harassed. </para>

The methods that are being adopted seem to strike at those who are best known, and who have lived longest in the districts in which they reside. If the purification were directed to the removal from the roll of the names of those whose residence qualification is doubtful, the position would be different, but it seems to be directed to the disfranchisement of persons who have not changed their residence. A large number of complaints have come from persons who have been  residing  permanently for a long time in the same place, and are well known. </para>

                        <para>- It is strange that this wholesale disfranchisement is following on the Liberal Government's announcement that the rolls are being purified. If it is possible for persons like this clergyman to have their names summarily removed from the roll, and their right to vote taken from them, there must be a large number of unknown persons similarly treated. I suggest to the Honorary Minister that the methods of the Department need improvement. </para>

The only instruction that has been issued is that of the permanent head of the Department, the Chief Electoral Officer, that whenever representations are made with regard to an elector having left the district, the local officer shall take independent steps to completely satisfy himself as to the truth of them. The only change that has been made is the adoption of an additional precaution so that the Registrars of the various districts shall not, without independent inquiry, remove names which are objected to. That is the actual fact, and any man who, in view of the official statements that have been circulated, says the contrary, is a man in whom the truth is not. </para>

That responsibility, resting upon him under the Act, the Chief Electoral Officer is discharging without any pressure either from myself or from this Government. I merely wish to say that if the honorable member for Brisbane desires to ventilate in this chamber other statements made to him, either by persons in his own electorate or elsewhere, he ought in common honesty no longer to attempt to fasten the blame for these occasional mistakes on the Government, but ought to recognise that they represent merely the normal condition of things - a condition which has obtained in Australia ever since we have had electoral administration. </para>

                        <para>- No. I have perused the roll, and there is only one person of that name who is enrolled. This makes the objection all the more peculiar. If it were a case of a father and son living in the same locality, I could understand the error. In another portion of my electorate there reside a station master and his family of three, all of whom have votes. The Railway Department of Victoria, having been struck by a spasm of reform, has removed this stationmaster out of the hovel in which he has lived for years to a better residence a few feet away on the same railway ground. Yet he and the members of his family have received a notice that an objection has been lodged to their names appearing upon the roll. Surely the most preliminary investigation of this particular case would have proved that all these persons were located on the same spot. But I rose more particularly to make an appeal to the Prime Minister, who, I feel sure, is in a sympathetic mood. I believe that in many States of. the Commonwealth there are a large number of breadwinners who are out of work, and I hope that the Prime Minister will place his officers in training so that these works may be proceeded with the moment that the Works Estimates have been disposed of. </para>
