                    <para>- I understand that yesterday evening the honorable member for Darwin charged me with having stated that I was an Australian, and a self-made man. I certainly claim to be an Australian, and can substantiate the claim, but neither here nor elsewhere have I ever claimed to be a self-made man. On the contrary, I am proud of my ancestors, and if I do as well in my life-time as some of them did in theirs I shall be quite satisfied. I object to the honorable member, or any one else, putting into my mouth words that I have not uttered. </para>

                    <para>- It is true that I referred to the honorable member for Robertson yesterday, but I did so because, when he first entered the House, and before he had passed through the proper parliamentary refrigeration, he called me a blatant American, though be had never met me. I knew that the words were used in a state of excitement, and I thought that I would wait until he cooled down a bit before replying. Owing to the fact that I was not born here, I cannot claim to be an Australian, but if the important and interesting ceremony of my birth were to occur again I should try to arrange to have i there, so that there might be no trouble about that matter. I understood the honorable member to say that he was made here in Australia, and that he made himself. I added yesterday that I was pleased to hear that he claimed to be a self-made man, because that statement relieved Almighty God of a great responsibility. The honorable member will understand that there is no ill feeling in what I said. </para>

In this connexion I draw the honorable gentleman&#39;s attention to the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> McMillan supported a motion affirming that there was no need for the embargo, and, further, that the Premier of New South Wales stated that there was no need for it. This is a momentous matter, affecting half-a-million of people, and I ask the Prime Minister if he will give consideration to the decisions arrived at. </para>

                            <para>- No. At this stage the honorable member may only ask a question, seeking for information, and in asking a question he may not say more than is necessary to make his meaning clear. On the contrary, a Minister of whom a question is asked is allowed some latitude. He has to give information, and must, therefore, make a statement, but that statement must not go beyond what is a fair answer to the question. </para>

                            <para>- Then it was not an extraordinarily large meeting.I am glad that the meeting was not large, because this is not a matter to be made the subject of popular clamour and appeal. There is no objection to citizens voicing their opinion, but I am glad that there was no attempt at a huge demonstration of the nature of some demonstrations which have been held. The position of Sydney is under very serious consideration, and I hope that my honorable friend will believe that as soon as we think the quarantine embargo can safely be lifted it will be lifted. . </para>

                    <para>.- It is not my intention to . delay the passing of  this Bill since I favour the proposal that the Commonwealth shall take over Norfolk Island. I realize that Australia at present is faced with a large number of obligations and. some very heavy burdens. Amongst these is the Northern Territory, and I was pleased to hear the Prime Minister admit yesterday that in connexion with it we have a very big problem to solve. For three years, whilst the honorable gentleman was in Opposition, he did not seem to think that the administration of the Territory was a very serious problem, but since his assumption of office he has apparently changed his view. Papua is another problem, but the destiny of Australasia, undoubtedly, is that she shall have the predominating influence in the South Pacific. Norfolk Island is not a very large island, and I do not think that its transfer will impose upon Australia a very serious burden. In view of the fact that it is about  200  miles nearer New Zealand than it is to Australia, I should have liked to see it placed under the control of that Dominion, because New Zealand will have to take, and certainly will take, her share of insuring the maintenance of Australasia&#39;s predominating influence in the South Pacific. Apparently, however, the people of Norfolk Island desire to be associated with the Commonwealth, and, that being so, no objection should be offered to this proposal. This Bill seems to embody all to which the late Government were prepared to agree ; but, in clause  15,  there is a proposal to which we had some objection. It was for that reason, indeed, that the Bill was not submitted by us to Parliament. The passing of that clause will mean embodying, for all time, in the Constitution of the Island, a provision that Free Trade shall prevail in respect of goods imported into Australia, provided they are produced in Norfolk Island. I do not know that there is much in such a provision to occasion any concern, but I do not think it wise to place it in the Constitution itself. Norfolk Island is about  600  miles away from Australia, and it might be found advisable at some time or other to do away with Free Trade between the two places. Whilst we were not prepared to embody this provision in the Bill providing for the government of the Island we were ready to submit, simultaneously, a separate Bill declaring that for the time being there should be Free Trade be tween Norfolk Island and Australia, so that if any future Government desired to make an alteration, with the consent of the people, it would be able to do so. The point, however, is not a very serious one, and if, after discussion, honorable members think it well to accept the clause as it stands, I shall offer no objection. </para>

                    <para>.- This clause provides that laws in force in Norfolk Island may be altered or repealed by Ordinance made in pursuance of this Act. It seems to me to give rise to a very important consideration.&#39; In connexion with the Northern Territory, for instance, important questions which should come under the immediate purview of this Parliament are determined by Ordinances instead of by Acts of the Parliament itself. I recognise that Ordinances cannot have the effect of law if the Parliament objects to them, but I should like the Minister to say whether he does not think it would be better to deal with these matters by actual legislation rather than by way of Ordinance. </para>

I would point out that the  power to make Ordinances is vested in the Governor-General in Council, that all Ordinances must be submitted to the Federal Parliament within thirty days after the making thereof, and that the House has complete power of disallowance. I think the honorable member will find that this provision will work satisfactorily. </para>

                    <para>.- I welcome the fact that Norfolk Island is coming under the control of the Commonwealth; but an injustice, unfortunately done to the islanders by the New South Wales Government, &#39;may continue. The islanders were promised that they could elect their own officials to govern them, and that they could hold their houses for all time; but, fifty years after that promise was made by the late Queen Victoria, the islanders were evicted by the New South Wales Government in office in 1906-7, and very unjustly treated. Therefore, I hope that  provision  will be made for a very wide franchise, and that&#39; the islanders will be able to elect their own magistrates, subject, of course, to the appointments being approved by the Commonwealth Government. The plan for the government of the island was originally set out by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Labouchere,  a very wise officer of the Imperial Colonial Office, who said that it was essentially an experiment in land tenure. That experiment was very successful until the Nev South Wales Government interfered too much with it. </para>

                    <para>.- On my two visits it was explained to me by some of the descendants of the Pitcairn Islanders that they were not being treated too well, as the amount of arable land is limited. The. time was when an islander could bring a wife from the mainland and set up a home on a small farm of 20 acres, or, if a sailor landed from one of the ships and married a daughter of the island, they could start a household in that way. I understand that this condition is now changed. The Anglican Melanesian Mission have full possession of 1,100 acres of land in the island. I do not question that, but I regret the mission are teaching the dead Motu language instead of the English the ministers are proud to speak. Is there anything in the Bill that will forbid the aggregation of land in larger quantities than, say, 40 acres of the good rich land, because the Islanders assured me that they could live comfortably on 20 acres of that class of land? The Minister knows clearly that the settlement was established for the sake of relieving the Pitcairn Islanders, and also for the purpose of experimenting in a certain form of land tenure. I do not think a law relating to land is to be found in any other part of the British Dominions similar to that in force in Norfolk Island. I may remind honorable members that the captain of the war vessel who annexed Norfolk Island promised the people, in the name of Queen Victoria, that the buildings left by the military and officials of the convict system would be given to them. They were promised that they would be established&#39; in better homes than they then occupied. I have no doubt that the church lands will be made a proper use of, but I hope that something will be done to prevent private individuals securing an unreasonable area of land, in view of the fact that the total area which can be cultivated in Norfolk Island is very small. </para>

                    <para>. - I may inform honorable members that the total area of the island is only 8,528 acres, and 5,400 acres have already been alienated in freeholds. The grants to the church are freeholds. I have a map of the island here, which the honorable member for Melbourne might like to see, on which the grants to the church, and alienated lands, are shown. As regards the form of land tenure to be adopted, the Bill contemplates nothing more than the taking over of the island under existing conditions, but provides for legislative power, by Ordinance, to frame a policy with respect to land and other questions as matters develop. I do not well see how we could lay down in this Bill details of a policy on land and other questions. The Bill provides for the disposition of the land in accordance with law, and that is the usual form of power provided for in every Constitution. </para>

                    <para>.- I am afraid that it is hasty legislation to pass ten clauses of a Bill in one morning, and that it is necessary I should make an observation or two. The question of a land policy for Norfolk Island, now under review, is a most important matter. When honorable members opposite were on this side, they had a great deal to say against the leasehold system, and in favour of the private ownership of land. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister has explained that 5,000 acres out of about 8,000 acres have been alienated in that way; but it will be for the Government of the Commonwealth to frame a policy for the disposal of the remaining 3,000 acres. This legislation seems to me rather pathetic. It is difficult to deal with such a large question as a land policy in such a small measure. I have very great sympathy with the people of Norfolk Island. I am sorry that we cannot put a sum of money on the Estimates to bring them all over to Australia and settle them on some of the fertile lands of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- I am aware of that; but there are many who would like to come to Australia. The policy of the present Government for the disposal of the 3,000 acres remaining unalienated in Norfolk Island will be to sell the land, or give it away. I admit that there are great difficulties in the way of educating the public as to the advantages which must follow where the lands are retained for the benefit of the people as a whole, instead of being cut up and sold to individuals who, in the course of time, will levy very heavy taxes on those who are without land. I read the other day that it would be possible to buy the whole of the lands of the United Kingdom for about &#163;52,000,000, and it would be a great bargain for the British people to purchase it. </para>

I met a Scottish immigrant who took up land in New Zealand; worked it for a few years, and then sold out. He told me that he was going back to Scotland to buy agricultural land, because he could get it cheaper there than in New Zealand. I have said that it is very difficult to educate the public as to the advantages of the Crown ownership of land. I paid a visit to South Australia some little time ago, and was shown the &#34;Blockers&#34; homes there. Some twenty years ago there was an unemployed difficulty in South Australia, and the State Parliament was induced by the Labour party to purchase some lands in the suburbs of Adelaide. They were cut up into 5 and 10-acre blocks, and leased to the unemployed at a rental of, I think, 5 per cent. on the purchase money. The &#34;Blockers&#34; had to pay, I think,1s. per week for their blocks, whilst &#163;50 was advanced to them to enable them to cultivate them and build their homes. The &#34; Blockers &#34; were doing very well until the land speculator came along, and pointed out to them what a splendid thing it would be for them to get the freehold of their blocks, and then sell out at a high figure. The &#34;Blockers,&#34; who were formerly unemployed, formed themselves into a society to secure the freehold of their blocks. At the elections they fought the Labour party, who were responsible for securing for them this great concession, and won. I believe that in many cases the &#34; Blockers &#34; got the freehold of their blocks, and sold out. I am informed that some of these men subsequently went into business, and are now no better off than they were twenty years ago. I am afraid that this was due to the unfortunate spirit of gambling with which we have to contend in Australia, and which is very hard to eradicate. Sometimes I think that we might do something to eradicate it if we could induce the people to stop gambling, generally in such matters as Tattersalls consultations, for instance. The Labour party were quite willing to make a trial of the public ownership of lands in the Northern Territory, the Federal Territory, and New Guinea, where no very large vested interests have to be dealt with. </para>

                        <para>- What the honorable member says is very true, but that is only part of the process of aggregation that is going on all over the world, not only in connexion with landed property, but in connexion with industries, and does not prove that the private ownership of land is desirable. If honorable members will look at the lists of runs held in Queensland they will find that the pioneer squatters, like the Leslies and others of whom we read, have practically all disappeared, and the leaseholders now are mortgage companies, banking concerns, and other financial institutions. The number of leaseholders in Queensland has been greatly reduced, whilst the aggregation of estates has proceeded. I have confessed that it is very difficult to induce the public to approve of the Crown ownership of lands. I think that we should, so far as possible, make a .commencement in connexion with town lands. I do not suppose there will be many town lots to be dealt with on Norfolk Island, but almost every week town lota are proclaimed in different parts of the Commonwealth, and no provision is made for keeping these lands for the municipalities or the State Governments. _ A very considerable revenue might be gained from the municipal ownership of town lands, which might be leased at very reasonable rental. At present townships are cut- up into small blocks, which are sold to individuals for, perhaps, &#163;5 each. In ten or twenty years&#39; time their value may run up to &#163;500, and in the course of fifty years they may probably be worth tens of thousands of pounds. </para>

                        <para>- No, but it is a convenient peg on which to hang a political hat. We desire information. We are thirsting for it. No University student was ever more anxious for it than we are. Honorable members opposite should give us credit for that. . We do not pretend to know everything. We want to learn. My honorable friend the Minister of Trade and Customs will have had time during the last few minutes to collect his scattered thoughts. I am sure that he must have been confused by the rapidity with which the Committee agreed to nine clauses of this Bill, and we must recollect that the honorable gentleman has also succeeded in putting through another Bill to-day. I wish to know whether the Government have abandoned their ideas on freehold tenure, as they have abandoned so many of their professed principles during the last three months. They were anti-Socialists on the stump, but since their advent to office they have become pronounced Socialists. They are going to establish an Agricultural Bureau to benefit the farmers, and it is quite possible that the Minister of Trade and Customs, the strong individualist and anti-Socialist of a few weeks ago, has abandoned his freehold principles in the case of Norfolk Island. In regard to the 3,000 acres which belong to the Crown there, I say that they should be let at a reasonable rental. </para>

I quite agree with the Minister of Trade and Customs that a Bill for taking over an island is not a proper one in which to embody the details of land tenure.

If my amendment be embodied in this measure, any subsequent Ordinances must be framed in accordance with its terms. That such a provision can be introduced into a Constitution Bill is evidenced by the fact that a similar provision is incorporated in the Northern Territory Acceptance Act and the Papua Act of 1905. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire to enter my protest against the alienation of Crown lands in a new country like Norfolk Island. It is rather late in the history of nations to argue whether it is advisable to start the administration of a country by selling land or by leasing it. Modern thinkers are unanimously in favour of the Crown retaining the fee simple. I am aware that the adoption of this principle is urged in many cases where land has been alienated. I quite realize all the difficulties which hinge upon a change of that sort where vested interests have grown up. Where there is no rental value to speak of, where the future of new country is concerned, there can be no argument against leasing the land in preference to alienating it. It is argued, I know, by many persons that you can get the rental by taxation, but there you are up against a proposition which it is very difficult to handle and involving institutions which have grown up on land values and unearned increment. In a case of this sort, I consider that we are helping settlement by making the way open for the land in the island. If the amendment is carried, discreet leasing, of course, will have to be the order of the day, and the Government, it seems to me, will always have in view this great economic need, namely, free access to the source of all wealth for its surplus population. If, in the early days of this country, we had been careful in that regard; if the world had been as enlightened and democratic as it is today, in my opinion, the fee-simple of the land of Australia would not have been parted with. If the way is kept open for the surplus population to find occupation by the application of very little money, and by energy and ability,  then  the solution of one of our gravest economic problems - the unemployed - is very near at hand. We are well on our way towards that event. I strongly oppose any attempt to alienate virgin land that may come under the control of this Parliament. </para>

I do not consider that there will ever be a large rush of people to Norfolk Island. A number of the men who hold land there in- fee simple have families, and their sons having been born and bred to the one pursuit, will naturally feel inclined to engage in the same industry as their fathers have been engaged in. It would be unreasonable to put a boy on a leasehold area when his father is on a freehold area. </para>

We know that for a large number of years land at Norfolk . Island has been alienated in fee simple, and now that the island is coming under our control, it is proposed, with regard to the residue, to introduce a new system. In my judgment, the time for doing that is not opportune, and, therefore, I hope that the Government will not accept the amendment. </para>

                    <para>.- Whether the area of unalienated land on Norfolk Island is small or large, a very vital principle is attacked by the Bill. The Minister knows as well as any one in the Chamber that honorable members on this side, have almost a fetish on that principle. We intend to maintain the principle which we have hitherto affirmed. It is very unfortunate, I think, that this clause was inserted in the Bill. We thought that the Bill would go through nicely and peaceably, and that we would then go to lunch and spend the rest of the day somewhere else, but we cannot possibly allow this most contentious clause to pass. The principle which is involved in the amendment is spreading. Those who have read the brief summary of the speech made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd-George,</inline> as reported in the newspapers of this morning, are aware that the principle is extending to England. It is evident from that speech that the position there has become so accentuated that a very drastic change must be made in the land policy. I am not complaining as regards the area of unalienated land on Norfolk Island. If the area were of any particular value it would have been alienated long ago. Those who were able to obtain the fee -simple of the 5,400 acres would, if the balance had been worth securing, have obtained it too. I cannot see that an injury will be inflicted upon anybody by deleting the clause. I ask the Minister, at any rate, to postpone the clause for reconsideration, because we cannot possibly allow it to pass in its present form, and must put up a strenuous opposition to it. </para>

                    <para>. - I have no intention of accepting the amendment. Norfolk Island comprises an area of 8,528 acres, of which 5,400 acres have been alienated in freehold. The balance includes 967 acres of reserves, 850 acres of leased land, and 1,311 acres of unused land. Of the unused land, 80 per cent, is said to be of good quality, hilly, and partly covered with heavy timber. The Melanesian Mission has obtained a grant of 1,000 acres, which are used for mission purposes. Practically the whole of the island has been alienated in fee simple. The honorable member for Herbert has indicated that it is simply to enforce a principle that the Opposition have submitted the amendment, and not because it is a question of practical politics or expenditure in connexion with the administration of the island. Incidentally, reference has been made to the principle as applied to Papua; but the two Territories are altogether different. When Papua was taken over by the Commonwealth, it was in the occupation of a large number of natives. In administering that Territory, we have to remember the rights of the aboriginals, and, for that reason, the supreme control is kept, and can be kept, in their interests. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot remember the reasons which were advanced, but I am stating the reason which exists to-day. The theory of the administration of the lands in Papua is that, with the exception of the waste lands, they are for the natives. The native interests have to be regarded. As regards the Northern Territory, the honorable member for Barrier must admit that the provision was put in the Constitution by the Government of the day, of which ho was a member. </para>

As regards practical politics, even if they should pass the amendment, there is only a small area of land to which the principle would be applied. We ought not to introduce the principle into this Bill, as it involves a question of policy. We are framing a Constitution for a territory, and the principle is that in the Constitution we should only define powers, and not settle the question of policy under those powers. </para>

                        <para>- Now the honorable member is letting out the secrets of the Cabinet. Where was the somewhere else ? The honorable member is always giving away these secrets, and then wonders how they get into the press. One of the arguments advanced by the honorable member for Hume and the Minister of Trade and Customs is that so much of the land is already alienated that we should not attempt to enforce the leasehold principle upon the remaining portion. At the earliest possible opportunity we ought to try to preserve the lands that remain. I do not need to quote the speeches of the Prime Minister and other members on that side, particularly the honorable member for Angas, but everybody knows that if there is one problem which is agitating the world to-day more than another it is the freehold tenure of land. </para>

Already this session we have had discussion on the matter, and in the speech which he has just delivered the Minister of Trade and Customs has thrown down the gauntlet again, for he immediately said that the Government will not accept this proposal. We believe the principle is a good one, and that it therefore should apply here as well as anywhere else. </para>

                        <para>- I am quite prepared to make them uniform. It would be a good investment for any Government to resume every piece of land that they could possibly get hold of in Australia. We have only to look around us to see how the value of land has grown. The block of land bounded by Swanston-street, Elizabeth-street, Collins-street, and Flinders-street, in Melbourne, was originally bought for a few pounds, and to-day is worth millions. Even now I do not think it has touched the price that it will ultimately attain. </para>

                        <para>- I am prepared <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> make an exchange with the honorable member at the earliest possible moment. One of the arguments brought up against honorable members on this side in regard to freehold was that they had no stake in the country, and now the honorable member admits that he has none. I remember the honorable member for Darwin saying that he did not believe in the stake-in-the-country business, and telling the story of a goat which was tied to a stake with beautiful pasture all round it. It wound its chain round and round its stake in the country, and practically starved, in spite of the feed all round it. We have the leasehold principle already established in the Papua Act, and it has worked well there. We have in Papua one of the most fertile parts of Australasia, and all I regret is the stupid mistake made by the Imperial Government in not backing up <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> McIll wraith when he annexed the whole of the island. The leasehold principle has been firmly established there, and I have not the slightest doubt will prove very beneficial. </para>

It is idle to believe that people will not settle on leasehold land in Papua and the Northern Territory. If the land is good enough, and opportunity is given, they will soon settle there. </para>

                        <para>- Whether what was said was true or not, Ministers of the Crown should be the last to decry Commonwealth territory. There is a lot of good and very valuable land in the Northern Territory, though there may he other land that is not good, and its settlement would certainly not be retarded by the adoption of leasehold tenure. Australia gets its inland rainfall mainly from the monsoonal rains, which come inland, and, according to their density, spread over the interior of the country. Unfortunately, this rainfall occurs only in the first few months of the year. Even where there is a rainfall of less than 10 inches, good land is to be found. As to Norfolk Island, I do not hesitate to say that, although there may be only a small part of the land still unalienated, we should, as a matter of principle, require that the leasehold principle be applied to it. It is idle for Ministers to say that this is not the time to deal with the question of tenure, and the only guarantee that the Parliament can have that the leasehold principle will be applied is the insertion of a provision in the Bill, making it impossible for any Government to alienate the land in freeholds. Land maybe required for a naval base, or for other Government purposes, but in any case we are fighting for a principle. Ministers have admitted that there is so little unalienated land that it would not matter much whether freehold or leasehold tenure were applied to it, but being in favour of freehold they are resisting our proposal. They do so only to assert that they stand by the freehold principle, because not only is there not much land to be alienated, but much of what there is must be poor land. If the Opposition were to allow the Bill to pass as it stands, we should find the Prime Minister going round the country later, asking, in his melodramatic way, &#34; Where were these champions of the leasehold principle when the Norfolk Island Bill was going through ? &#34; </para>

                        <para>- The supporters of the Ministry would follow the lead of the Prime Minister, saying, &#34;The members of the Labour party did not object to the freehold system when the Norfolk Island Bill was going through Parliament. As a matter of fact, some of them own property in freehold themselves. They will not accept leasehold when they can get freehold.&#34; Personally, I would sooner have leasehold than freehold, if I could get it, but we cannot always get what we should like. I am prepared on this occasion to show my adherence to the leasehold principle by pushing the matter to a division. </para>

                    <para>.- I presume that there will be no difference of opinion as to the advisability of taking over Norfolk Island, but we have got into holts with the Government over the important question of tenure. I am surprised that Ministers should cling in this way to the stupid old fetish of private ownership of land. At one time the Prime Minister uttered truths regarding the evils of the private ownership of land, which are even more obvious to-day than they were when he gave utterance to them. At the present time, the Liberal Government which is in power in Great Britain is fighting to bring about land reform, and, in taking over the territory of Norfolk Island, we have a chance to lay down a principle which will prevent the trouble that has occurred elsewhere, by requiring that Crown lands shall only be leased to those who desire to occupy them. The demand for freehold is made only in the interests of speculation. Money is made by persons who acquire the title to land, and then wait until others, by their expenditure, increase its value. </para>

                        <para>- It is a very common practice. In the cities you see it stated on hoardings that land is for sale &#34; on building lease.&#34; <inline font-style="italic">Bon&#226; fide,</inline> enterprising capitalists desiring city premises have to acquire this land on lease, and build on it at their own risk. An instance of how far this system is pushed has been afforded by the manner in which the Duke of Westminster has managed renewals of leases of his London property. In one case he demanded &#163;1,000 before he would consider the question of renewing a lease, and then required the erection on the land to be leased of a building costing &#163;250,000, although, until the energy of the tenant had increased its value, the land itself was worth very little. Ministers wish to perpetuate the evils of private ownership of land. We know that legally there is no such thing as private ownership, in the sense that there is private ownership of anything else, and the land legislation of Australia, by giving tenant right in improvements, recognises that. Our legislation is based on the well-known theory that the land of a country is owned by its people, even though it may be alienated in freehold. But the operation of the freehold principle is such that it interferes with enterprise and blocks settlement. The man who has secured a piece of land in freehold is able to tax the capitalist who wishes to use it in any way. A perpetual leasehold is as good as a freehold, and leasing certainly gives more encouragement to agriculture. It may be that, even at Norfolk Island, there will be a demand for agricultural land of some kind. </para>

                        <para>- Too few of those who engage in balloting for land do so with the idea of acquiring it to make their home on it. Their desire is to make a profit by selling it. There is too much gambling in land, and the clamour for freehold is due to the fact that it is easier to speculate in land that is held in freehold. The honorable member for Wimmera, who poses as a business man, knows that if he buys a block of land he must debit it with interest on the cost of purchase, and that, if machinery is needed to work it, he must also debit it with the interest on the cost of that machinery. Now, most of those who wish to take up land for rural pursuits are men with little or no capital. Many men without capital are, perhaps, the most desirable settlers that we can get, because they understand how to use the land. To such men, the leasehold system is the easiest. When land is held under lease, there is no need to debit against it the interest charges that must be debited against land that is purchased, and consequently a lower return is profitable. Of course, many persons in the country who buy and sell land do not regard the transaction from the proper bookkeeping point of view. Many a farmer will buy a piece of land for &#163;100 or &#163;200, and sell later for an advance on that amount, saying, &#34; I have made so much profit,&#34; quite oblivious of the fact that he has made no calculation in regard to the interest charges, and that if he had treated the transaction according to the proper bookkeeping method, he would not have made any profit at all. If he had put his money into town property, he might, perhaps, have secured a bigger return. If people dealt with their land according to ordinary business methods, they would soon decide that leasehold was preferable to freehold. We hear men say, &#34; If we have a freehold, we can borrow money from the banks upon that security.&#34; This inordinate desire to borrow, both in respect of private and public business, seems to be characteristic of the Liberals. I do not believe in borrowing. </para>

                        <para>- In South Australia and Western Australia, a man who desires to go on the land is assisted by the State. By means of the Agricultural Bank or the Credit Foncier system, which are infinitely preferable to private banks as a means of helping the man on the land, a farmer can get all that is necessary to enable him to prosecute his industry. There is starting in England at the present time a great movement to deal with the evils of private ownership in land. Landlordism has done great injury to the Old Country. It has kept land out of use. Men have been put off the land in order that it may minister to the mere pleasures of the idle rich and the waster, who is of no use to his country. Great areas in England remain idle, while the people have to import the corn with which to make their daily bread. Gladstone struck a blow at rack.-renting in Ireland. When peasants carried soil on their backs to make their rocky lands more fertile, the private landlord came along and charged, them a higher rental, just as a landlord in this country will increase your rental when you have done something to improve the house in which you live. The failure of the principle of private ownership in land has been proved. It is no longer arguable. The system is such a failure that the State has had to interfere. In this morning&#39;s newspapers, we read that this question is to be tackled in Great Britain. Private ownership in land has produced evils which the State finds it necessary to regulate. In the interests of the people, it is necessary to interfere with private ownership, because of evils which, under the leasehold system, are avoided. The British Parliament has voted millions of money to resume land in Ireland. </para>

                        <para>- That does not alter the fact that this action on the part of the British Parliament shows that private ownership in land i3 a failure, and that it cannot be allowed to continue. In this new country, we have the chance of avoiding the evils of the freehold system. But the Government, in the case of Norfolk Island, are not proposing to impose any safeguards. They are associated too much with the speculators in land. Look for a moment at the big city properties. How have many of our wealthy men secured their independence! Not by their own efforts, but merely by sitting down and reaping the benefit of the unearned increment. The block of land in this city, bounded by Swanston, Collins, Elizabeth, and Bourke-streets, was sold in 1835 or 1836 for &#163;3,600, and to-day it is worth &#163;20,000,000. Have the owners of that property been responsible for the enormous increase in its value ? There may not be an immediate rush for land in Norfolk Island, but I think that the demand we have made is a reasonable one. The leasehold system is much fairer than the freehold system, and under it we shall avoid all the evils of private ownership. I shall not vote for this Bill unless there is inserted in it a clause securing to the people of Norfolk Island the land still unalienated. We may leave to the future the question of making other changes which countries in the Old World have had to face, and which we shall have to face, and are, as a matter of fact, already facing to some extent by the resumption of land. We inherited a great unpeopled country, and yet within a few years the State Governments have found it necessary to pay enormous sums for the resumption of land. Owners of land may barrack for the freehold system, but the people must get rid of the idea that there is something sacred about a freehold, for there is no better title in law than that which a leasehold affords. </para>

                    <para>. - In view of the fact that we have already provided for the leasehold system in Papua, the Northern Territory, and the Federal Territory, I am surprised that the Minister is not prepared to accept the suggested amendment. He is really going back on a principle which this Parliament&#34; has adopted. I believe that this is the first act of the Conservative Government now in power to satisfy those who sent them here, and to show them what they would do if they had a sufficient majority. I hope that it will demonstrate to the people of Australia that they have placed on the Treasury bench men of the most Conservative type. We learn from this morning&#39;s newspapers that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd-George</inline> has said that the great Scotchmen who helped to defeat Napoleon were drawn from lands that are no longer occupied by human beings - lands that have been converted into deer runs to gratify the pleasures of visiting American millionaires. . One American millionaire put hundreds of people off a large area of land in Scotland, which I saw when I was in the Old Country recently. I do not hesitate to say that it is a crying shame that lands used for hundreds of years by the greatest race of people that the wo&#39;rld has ever known - people who have done much to settle new countries - should be dealt with in this way. It is a disgrace that people should be ousted from their holdings in order that the land may be converted into deer runs. It was also said by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd-George</inline> that a man who voted on the Radical ticket or belonged to the Methodist Church would not be allowed to remain on the land that he owned in England. When I was in England, a dear friend of mine took me to the farm leased by his brother, who was paying an enormous rental, and yet had not the right to allow me to shoot over it for an hour or two. The owner of the land comes down with his friends from time to time every year, pulls up the fences, and walks over the crops in the pursuit&#39; of his pleasures. </para>

                        <para>- I shall not say that. The alienation of Crown landa means giving land over to people who do not work. I should not mind people owning the fee-simple in land if they would work that land to the best advantage. The very object of private ownership in land is, however, that you may draw rents and tithes from other people. We have in this Bill a clause which is practically a copy of the Act which gave away enormous areas of land in Tasmania to the Van Diemen&#39;s Land Company, the shareholders in- which have never worked them. Tenant farmers have cleared the land, and made it what it is to-day. As the result of the Land Tax imposed by the Fisher Government, the Van Diemen&#39;s Land Company is now selling its land, and getting from &#163;18 to &#163;24 an acre for it. Was this increased value given to the land by the shareholders in that company? Certainly not. It is the result of the. work of the horny-handed settlers who went there years ago, and some of whom have not enough money to purchase a block, notwithstanding that the company is now offering it for sale on the best terms of which I know. </para>

                        <para>- I am desirous of backing up my argument with something of a tangible nature. That is why I mentioned these lands. They were given away under precisely the same conditions under which the Government now desire to hand over the land of Norfolk Island to private persons. The Treasurer suggests that there would be no settlement on the island if we did not do so, but the very thing that has prevented settlement in Australia is the monopoly of land. If we make land available at a fair and reasonable price we shall always get settlement. That is why I am totally opposed to the alienation of Crown lands. I am totally opposed to the private ownership of land. I believe in the residential lease. While a man resides on the land he should be allowed to work it and get the product of it. The honorable member for Wimmera has interjected &#34; Where is the country where there is leasehold only?&#34; I can reply that New Zealand has done much by the leasehold system. </para>

Recently I met a gentleman who intimated to me that he had supported the Labour party during the last election. After the way in which the gentleman had opposed us when I first knew him I was surprised, and I said, &#34; Why your conversion?&#34; he said, &#34;A son of mine went to New Zealand with a few pounds in his pocket, and the Government immediately allowed him to take up a piece of land they leased to him. He was able to put all the capital he had into stock, or farming implements, and the result is that to-day he is independent. That has completely converted me to your ideas on the land question.&#34; This young man was driven from a country that could support fifty times its present population; he was trained as a farmer, but in his own State he could not get land on which to farm under &#163;20 or &#163;22 an acre. W.  Fl&#252;rscheim,  in <inline font-style="italic">The Commercial Labyrinth,</inline> has pointed out a case in New Zealand years ago where a man put &#163;3,000 into purchasing a piece of land - all the capital he had - and then had to mortgage the land in order to get the capital to stock the farm and buy farming implements. When things went a little bad with him pressure was brought to bear on him, and eventually he lost the lot. Had he been able to get on Crown land, on leasehold terms, and had the whole of his capital been made available for buying stock and farming implements for the improvement of the land, his capital would have been wealth-producing from the start. Our Government in an unfair way seize the present occasion for asserting the principle of freehold tenure. It is essential that Australia should own Norfolk Island. It may eventually become a very valuable asset to us for de fence purposes. I regret that we are not able to make some exchange with France so that we may secure New Caledonia. I regret we do not hold the whole of New Guinea. </para>

                        <para>- Our not holding these lands may be disastrous to us in the future defence of Australia. Later on it may be necessary for the Commonwealth to resume a portion of Norfolk Island for defence purposes. The Government now propose to make it possible for some speculator to purchase land made available upon the Island and hold it for his own purposes, and by-and-by, when some expert we may bring out from the Old Country reports that it is essential for Norfolk Island to be made a base of operations for the protection of Australia, the Government will have to repurchase that land, probably at the enhanced value given to it by an increase in the population on the Island. The Minister of External Affairs has in the past saved great tracts of country in Australia and on the adjacent island of New Guinea from being alienated from the Crown, but now, probably under the pressure brought to bear on them by the wealthy land-holders who sit behind them, and those who sent them into power, Ministers are desirous of asserting the principle of freehold. Good luck to them if they can have it done, but I hope the people of Australia will understand such Liberals as the honorable member for Wimmera. I respect a Conservative who comes into the House in his own colours and says, &#34; I am in favour of the further alienation of Crown lands. I am in favour of defending the right of the capitalist; &#34; but I have no time for a man who poses as almost as good as a Labour man, but will alienate all the land of Australia and hand it over to monopolists. The sooner the electors realize the true colours of the honorable member for Wimmera the better. If we allowed this Bill to go through without a protest we should be going back on the very principle that we enunciated throughout Australia at the last elections. If the Labour party are solid on one question, it is the land question. We realize that land is the fulcrum on which Capital has placed a lever to push the worker down into the wage-slavery in which he finds himself today. The <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> says that this is not an original expression, but I had never read it before I used it previously, and at any rate it is original as far as I am concerned. If access to the land were made easy we should not have the trouble of overcrowded cities and two men looking for one job. Honorable members have noticed the splendid way in which the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> is now throwing open its columns for people to proclaim to the world the state of affairs existing in Melbourne, where we find twenty-three persons living in one house and under the most abominable conditions. It is a shame that such a state of affairs should exist in any country, but it is due to private landlordism, and to the system of giving away lands in freehold. Yet we have honorable gentlemen on the Ministerial side, simply that they may augment their already big incomes and find means of investment for overflowing coffers, willing to perpetuate this system. They do not know what it is to have no roof over one&#39;s head, or what it is. to have to pay a pound for the loan of ten pounds for a month. I heard of a man who urgently required financial assistance, and who had to get a member of Parliament to go bond for him for the loan of &#163;20. That man gave his IOU for over &#163;24, though he was to have the money for a few months only. </para>

                        <para>- Private ownership of land brings about this state of things. Without private ownership the land is no asset. The legal fraternity know that behind the money they lend is the land. That is why these gentlemen wish to perpetuate the freehold system. I have nothing to say against them personally for doing it. The people have the opportunity of changing the existing state of affairs, and if they allow it to continue I have no objection to these land-holders owning the land - so long as they come into the House in their true colours and say that they are prepared to vote for private ownership of land because it enables them to find investment for their capital, and to keep a certain section of the people from earning a living on the land, and force them to work in other spheres of life. But I am sent here to protest against private ownership, and I shall fight against it to the bitter end. This bottling up of the land is altogether wrong. If our friends on the other side of the chamber could get somebody to invent a machine for bottling up the air they would do it, and they would have us gasping like fish out of water and prevented from living unless we paid further tribute to them. There is no more right to private ownership of land than there is to private ownership of air. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Hume has suggested that our purpose is to take their land away from the present owners in Norfolk Island. We have no such intention. Our sole object is to prevent the further alienation of land in the island. I do not know whether honorable members opposite are prevented from speaking on this matter, but, as the representatives of land-owners, they should have the courage to justify the position they take up. I hope they will do so for the enlightenment of the Committee. I have had to go to land-owners outside this Parliament for enlightenment on the question. I went to a great friend of mine, who has done much to mould political thought, not only in Tasmania and Australia, but in the world generally, because the books he has written have been printed in three languages. He is a big landowner, whose property is valued at an amount which just falls short of the taxable minimum under the Federal Land Tax Act. I refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. A.</inline> J. Ogilvy. He is the descendant of a wealthy man, he is a University man himself, and, because of his book <inline font-style="italic">Land and Labour,</inline> is recognised as an authority on the land question. He spent two years in the Old Country considering the question, and returned to Australia still an advocate of the nationalization of land. He puts this matter so beautifully that I cannot help quoting from him. I believe that the Labour party of Australia owe him a debt of gratitude which we can only repay by bringing his works prominently before the people, hoping that they will eventually bear fruit. We may apply what he says to the condition of affairs in Norfolk Island. Speaking of the workers, he makes this statement- </para>

                        <para>- Judging by what I hear of the honorable member&#39;s factories, the nuts and preserved ginger made therein, and the rent-collecting that goes on every week, I do not think he would like to get rid of his. It would be disastrous to Norfolk Island to permit any further alienation of the land there. It is not proposed that any portion of the land so far unalienated in Norfolk Island shall be set aside for parks. The. honorable member for Parkes cannot imagine the common ownership of land. He thinks that everything should be owned by private individuals. If the honorable member had been treated fairly by the present Conservative Ministry he would probably now be Minister of External Affairs, and would have the administration of Norfolk Island in the event of this Bill passing. Somehow he is out in the cold, but he might yet bring sufficient influence to bear to enable him to become the administrator of the land in Norfolk Island. The people there would then have no public parks at all, because the honorable gentleman is totally opposed to the ownership of land by the Government, and he would promptly alienate every acre of land in Norfolk Island. I have referred to the overcrowding in the principal cities of every one of the States of the Commonwealth, and I fear that the same thing would follow in Norfolk Island under the private ownership system. It is a disgrace to fifty years of responsible government in Victoria, and to the Municipal Council of _ Melbourne, that twenty-three persons should be found occupying three rooms in this city. We should have the same thing to-morrow in Norfolk Island if the population there was as dense as that of Melbourne. The honorable members for Parkes and Franklin, becoming dissatisfied with the state of affairs here, might go to Norfolk Island. They might start a big factory there, and we should no doubt have overcrowding of the hands employed in that factory. We should do all we can to prevent this little island getting into the hands of the people who own land but do not live on it or work it. Some of them seek cool lands, in which to escape the hot places here in the summer, regardless of the future. It might be well for some to remain in the hot places, that they may become accustomed to what they will have to put up with in another place. Those who are responsible for the suffering arising from the private ownership of land may have a good time on this earth ; but Heaven knows what sort of a time they will have to put up with in the future. </para>

                        <para>- Might I suggest that, whether the amendment is accepted or not, the Bill is urgently needed. The honorable member for Barrier knows that. I will tell honorable members what we are prepared to do, and I do not think they can ask for anything more. If there is any difficulty about the vote on this question, we will give the Opposition pairs to any extent necessary; but do let us come to a vote, and get the Bill through. This is a non-party measure, except for the one question which has been raised, and if we agree to pairs upon that, what is the use of carrying the discussion on the Bill over to-day. I think I am making a very fair offer. </para>

                    <para>.- It is rather surprising that, at this late hour, the Prime Minister should desire to waive this great principle aside. The honorable gentleman has, in the past, been in the forefront amongst those in favour of the leasehold principle. He is a veritable champion of the principle of leasehold as against freehold. </para>

                <para class="block">Having made such emphatic statements, how can the Prime Minister oppose the amendment ? This little island, which is 5 miles long and 3 miles wide, is one of the beauty-spots of the earth, and one of the most fertile. It is a charming place, which was named after the Duke of Norfolk, and it is rich in cultivation land. Pines grow there 9 feet in diameter, and the pictures iu a book which I have here portray their splendid growth. If there is a little Crown land left there, we certainly ought not to part with it. Up till now, Norfolk Island has been a neglected spot. Although it has been, in a sense, under the wing of the New South Wales Government, little or no care has been exercised over it, and its administration has proceeded in a slip-shod way. As soon as it is known that the Commonwealth is about to take it over, land speculators will rush in, with the result that the land will be given an enhanced value. The Prime Minister has said that this is a small matter, and, therefore, we should not cavil at it. I cannot understand why the Government object to incorporating the proposed amendment in this Bill. If we take over the island, it will be absolutely incumbent on the Government to see that regular communication is maintained between it and the mainland. Communication with it at present is of an erratic character. </para>

                        <para>- Norfolk Island is about 900 miles distant from Sydney, and 600 miles distant from New Zealand. Lying in the ocean between important branches of the British Empire, namely, the Dominion of New Zealand and the Commonwealth, we do not know how valuable it may become to the Commonwealth for defensive and other purposes. We ought to do everything that we can to maintain as much of it as possible under public control. As soon as regular communication with it is established, up will go the price of land there. I believe that the same thing is taking place in the environs of the Federal Capital area. The great works being carried out within that area has enhanced, and will enhance, the value of lands and property just outside the area, and it would not surprise me if speculators have been operating already on lands adjacent to our territory. I do not say that there will be a considerable rush for the remaining lands of Norfolk Island, but there is no telling what may take place. The Treasurer has declared that he has never been averse to selling lands in the vicinity of townships, or elsewhere. I believe that if he had his way in connexion with the Federal Capital area he would sell land there. </para>

                <para> When Lord Loftus was Governor of New South Wales, he paid a visit to Norfolk Island, and submitted certain reports upon it. He spoke of the settlement of its lands, of its occupancy, and of the use to which it had been put. He made a series of complaints against the inhabitants of the island, and affirmed that they were more intent upon whaling and other pursuits than upon putting the lands of the island to their best use. In the book which I hold in my hand, I find the following: - </para>

                    <para>His Excellency will long be remembered for the matter-of-fact truths he enunciated. Since his departure we have been asking ourselves a few questions, and the situation has been freely discussed, the one all-absorbing topic being the probable stoppage of the issue of free grants. The people whom this measure most affects, the rising generation, have, however, taken matters very calmly, and although quiet threats not to do public work were uttered here and there, nothing came of it. A word or two may be offered in explanation of this said land business. It has been the custom here, when a young couple marries, to give them, without conditions, a free grant of half an allotment (25 acres) of land; a girl marrying a stranger getting a quarter allotment, about <inline font-style="italic">tab</inline> acres. During the first year of the occupancy the portion was a whole allotment of about 50 acres. All the immigrants from Pitcairn Island received that quantity, but during the reign of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Young it was cut down to half, and has so remained since. Now,  His Excellency,  taking into consideration the large quantity of land granted, and the small portion under cultivation, thinks, with good grounds, doubtless, that we have too much land to little purpose, find that the free grant system ought to cease; or rather that he can hold out no hope for its continuation. The total area of the Island is 8,600 acres. Of this, in round numbers, about 5,000 acres have been alienated (including 1,000 to the Melanesian Mission), and on this large area less than 180 acres are under cultivation by the community- </para>

                <para class="block">That report, although it is somewhat old, bears out the burden of the argument which has been advanced in this Chamber to-day, that the great evil connected with our system of land tenure is that the land is  not  put to its best use. If it were, there would be thousands more employed upon it than there are to-day. The report proceeds - a small quantity no doubt, but when the means of communication are considered, one which should be judged rather by opportunities than by figures. Another grave factor in this state of things is that a large portion of the people love boating and whaling better than farming. </para>
                <para class="block">That is a pity, because it is true. I was never so enamoured of the island as I am to-day, having read so much about its beauties as portrayed in word-pictures. </para>
                <para class="block">It is  apparently  one of die beauty spots of the world, and the most fertile. At that time the people, instead of indulging in farming and improving the area allotted to them, got more pleasure in boating and whaling than in following farming. The passage continues - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>And many are away from their farms pursuing the more genial occupation during the most critical time of the year. It cannot be said, however, that they are not good boatmen or good whalemen, or that they do not pursue the business they love with great assiduity. </para>

                <para class="block">We on this side are fighting for a principle in connexion with the unalienated lands on Norfolk Island, which, I think, ought to be maintained. If it is a desirable principle to apply to land in the Federal Capital Territory, the Northern Territory, and Papua, surely it ought to be applied to the latest addition to Commonwealth territory. Reference has been made here to-day to a block of land in Melbourne. Honorable members on the other side have spoken of the leasehold principle. I guarantee that if the honorable member for Wannon or the Treasurer were to go and ask the men who conduct big businesses in Melbourne, or Adelaide, or Perth, whether they hold the land in fee simple, they would reply that they do not. </para>

                        <para>- They would. If an inquiry is made of the men who conduct the biggest businesses in and around Melbourne, it will be found that the buildings of a large number of them have been put up on leased land. Now, to show bow an individual or a family can provide a fine living by obtaining private property in land, and to show how harmful it is to the community to allow so much land to get into private hands, let une instance the block owned by <inline font-weight="bold">Major Howie,</inline> in Collins-street, Melbourne. In 1835 his uncle, or father, promiscuously sailed into Hobson&#39;s Bay, and a little later found his way into the Yarra, where he pulled up, and as the crew tied up their small boat he landed. As he was walking up what was almost a creek then running into the Yarra - Elizabeth-street - he heard some persons talking about a Sand sale. He made some inquiries in respect to the sale, and was told that a public auction of town allotments was using held. He went to the auction-room, and purchased four or five blocks, while one block was purchased by another individual for less than &#163;200. <inline font-weight="bold">Major Howie</inline> obtained what, to-day, is a big frontage to Swanston-street, Collins-street, and Little Collins-street. The Howie family have never spent a penny in putting up . a building on the area. All that land has been let on building lease. I admit that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Howie</inline> was out here, I think, about eighteen months ago, and sold about &#163;100,000 worth of land. I wish to tell the honorable member for Wannon that, although the Labour Government were then in power, <inline font-weight="bold">Major Howie</inline> re-invested the purchase money in Australia. He still owns the greater portion of the original block, and he has not put up a brick nor has his money nailed up a weatherboard in connexion with the buildings on the land. Yet you will not find in Melbourne an area which is better built upon or put to better use. The rents are sent out of Melbourne to a landlord who is living in a mansion in Scotland, and having a delightful time. </para>

                        <para>- That is right. The best policy is to allow as many persons as possible access to the land. We want to bring idle hands to idle lands. That is wanted here as well as in other countries. I believe that if we had State lands and State forests, there would be no such thing in Australia as unemployment. It would be a splendid thing, I think, if we had great State areas to which in bad times we could send persons in order to obtain healthy employment and sufficient remuneration to keep themselves and their families. It is well known that big businesses are conducted on leased lands. I am not a bloated capitalist, but I am interested in a building which has recently been erected many stories high on leased land for the purpose of conducting business. That kind of thing is being done every day. With very few exceptions the State is the best landlord, and if all our laws are in consonance with the principles of proper development, it must certainly be the best landlord in the community. Seeing that there is so much land under lease in the Wimmera district- </para>

                        <para>- No. I am pointing out how fallacious it is for honorable members on the other side to protest against the leasehold principle, when many of their chief supporters and themselves have leased lands. I am not saying anything about the farmers leasing their lands, but only stating what is being done. I am pointing out to the honorable member for Wannon that there are farmers, or retired farmers, living in my electorate who have leased to other individuals their lands, which are in portion of the honorable member&#39;s electorate. </para>

I do not intend to use a threat, but I would point out to them that it would be just as well to insert this amendment in the Bill as to have it inserted&#39; in the Senate. Why should it not be done here? The amendment embodies a sound policy. We have seen fit to apply the principle to the land in the Federal Capital Territory. Let us retain, in the interests of the people, the little land that is left unalienated on the beautiful island which we are about to take over. </para>

                        <para>- I understand that the residents of the island, whether native born or otherwise, are anxious that it should be taken over by the Commonwealth. I dare say that the residents, if consulted, would approve of the Commonwealth retaining in its own hands a portion of the island. Later on it may be the policy of this Parliament to retain for the people many of the properties which the Commonwealth has taken over, and work them to the best advantage for the whole community. </para>

                        <para>- The present landholders obtained the fee-simple of their land under a local, or New South Wales, law, and nobody would dream of taking their land without paying compensation. But when we have the opportunity to retain some land for the State, why should it not be done? I am sure that every honorable member would be in a much better position to-day if the pioneers and the originators of land settlement in Australia had decided not to alienate a single acre of land. Australia, to-day, would have been one of the most delightful places in the world, where everybody would be happy, and it would not be necessary from time to time to introduce taxation measures, because revenue would flow into the Treasury, and the whole of the people would benefit, instead of only a few individuals. We, on this side, must be on the right track. We are not only in accord with advanced thought, but side by side with leading legislators in other parts of the world. In Great Britain what is being done by that great man, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd-George?</inline> It is practically a revolution that is taking place there, and one which, perhaps, will avert a worse revolution. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd-George</inline> is a farseeing man, and so are those who are acting with him. They are trying, as far as they possibly can, to lighten the burden of the down-trodden people, and place it more on the wealthy land-owners. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd-George</inline> is on the right track, and will relieve Great Britain, if he passes advanced legislation, of one of the greatest stigmas which have rested on her for years past. The Government of the day are going to take a bigger hand in dealing with the land in the three kingdoms than was ever done in the past. He will, I suppose, do much the same as the Salisbury Balfour Government did in Ireland. He will probably repurchase the lands and give an opportunity to those who have been the tenants of absentee landlords to get their rents reduced. </para>

                    <para>.- I feel compelled to vote for the amendment. Very few honorable members, I think, have any conception of what the future of Norfolk Island is going to be. The adjoining island, Lord Howe Island, is a very pretty place - I suppose one of the prettiest places on the face of the earth - and certainly one of the most interesting island-places to visit. It is held under what is called an occupancy lease, and no land is held in fee-simple. There is no freehold on the island; there are a number of people living on it, and owing to an unfortunate misunderstanding a quarrel arose, due to the fact that they held occupancy leases. Some of those on the island claimed a right to the land by virtue of occupancy, but it was proved they had no right to it, and to-day every person there shares in the products of the island. They are thus very successful indeed. The Government, in taking over Norfolk Island, have done a very wise thing. It will be admitted that fish is a necessary food for the people, and there is no better fishing ground than in the vicinity of Lord Howe Island and Norfolk Island. Soon after the island has been taken over by the Commonwealth, I feel confident the Commonwealth Government will have to resume land to assist the fisheries that will be established there, and also for defence purposes, and cable and wireless communication, because Norfolk Island lies in the New Hebrides route, between New Zealand and Australia. This is a trade route that would be very much used if there was a better survey. In view of these great prospects for the island, it is only reasonable for members to be anxious to conserve a portion of it for the use of the Commonwealth Government and for the people who live on it. We are told that certain lands are still reserved by the Crown. It is essential that the Government should maintain those reserves. We should be failing to discharge our obligations if we did not conserve the commons and other lands necessary to the people. I look upon Norfolk Island and Lord Howe Island as sanatoria for the continent of Australia. At present only one boat runs there, Burns, Philp and Company having the contract. The Commonwealth Government already subsidize a boat for the New Hebrides, and that boat calls at both places. One of the reasons why Norfolk Island is not used for health purposes is that there is no proper place of landing, and the inhabitants have no way of providing it. As soon as a proper place of landing is established, I am sure that a large number of people from Australia will go to the island. The Government, in taking over the island, ought to have made provision for preserving the land for the people, and they certainly should not ask honorable members on this side of the House to violate a principle that has been inserted in every Bill with which the Parliament has dealt when the land question has come up. I am rather surprised at -what has taken place, because the Minister of External Affairs is known far and wide as a champion of land nationalization, while the Prime Minister, whom I have known ever since he landed in New South Wales, has always been looked upon as one of the champions of the single tax. The Acting Minister of Home Affairs, when a deputation waited upon him in August last with regard to land in the Federal Territory, said in reply - and this ought to have some weight with the Government, because, I presume, that a public reply by a Minister to a deputation becomes portion of the Cabinet&#39;s policy - </para>

                <para class="block">There is no doubt that when the island is taken over, aud the Commonwealth assists the inhabitants with facilities for landing, the population will increase, and, as consumers, will contribute to the general revenue. When that happens, land values will rise considerably - and the rise will be greater in comparison than that of land in the cities. The Government would be acting wisely and save discussion if they accepted the amendment, as they cannot expect to get the Bill through the two Houses without this vital principle. The  Minister  of External Affairs, who introduced the Bill, is not present to-day. I do not know if that is because of his views on land nationalization or not. </para>

                        <para>- I have no evidence of the fact, but it was quite reasonable for me to assume that the honorable member felt that he would have to fight against a principle which he had cherished all his life. In the interests of the unborn generations on Norfolk Island, the Government should deal wisely with the land question. The people of Australia are pretty evenly divided on this question, and parties are very evenly divided in this House, and we certainly should not be asked to forego a principle, which it is known throughout the whole of the world, that we uphold. What greater object-lesson on the land question could be found than in the country that we spring from ! Many of us know the hardships, and the cruelty and injustice, that take place there. Conservative as the Home Government may be, it is to their credit that they are doing something to alleviate the misery that exists by giving the masses of the people an opportunity to share in a little of the world&#39;s wealth. We in this House should not be asked to abandon a principle of which -we have raised the flag; for once our party raises a flag, it will defend it to the last ditch. I do not know whether the Minister for Customs .is over-sensitive, or suffering from a sort of brain fever, that he can sit there unmoved and hear member after member pounding at him the doctrine of liberty. I feel sure that my eloquence and determination and honesty of purpose ought to have some weight on his little mind and little brain. It should make him feel that the time has arrived to grant this great concession. All that we are trying to do is to uphold for the  people of Norfolk Island something that they will be proud of, so that there &#39;may be, at least, one portion of the island which they can call their own. Twelve months ago, I endeavoured to land on Norfolk Island, but the sea was too rough, and I landed on Lord Howe Island, and spent a nice time there. I can assure honorable members that, if they went there, they would soon see&#39; what a hardship it would be if one or two persons owned and controlled the land. The rest of the people would be slaves or martyrs to them, and, in the interests of the present inhabitants, as well as of unborn generations, we cannot do better than take effective steps, to prevent the possibility of land  monopoly there. There is no economic writer who does not contend that a mistake was made by the Crown in the past in parting with the freehold of its land, and experience should have weight with us when we are making arrangements for the future. We .should use it to prevent further wrong-doing and injustice. The other evening, the Prime Minister consented to reduce an item in the Works Estimates at the request of honorable members on this side, and I hardly think that the Government will decline to accede to the very reasonable request that is being made to them now, especially since, in another place, the majority cannot be expected to give way on a question of principle. I know that there are members of the Ministry who, if they were independent, would be only too pleased to support the contention of the Opposition that the Crown lands of Norfolk Island should never he alienated in freehold. The adoption of our proposal will not prevent the use of these lands by the people of Norfolk Island; but those who use them will have the Government for landlord, and  every one  knows that a Government is  at  least humane, whereas private land-owners have no other motive than the gaining of profits. I have no quarrel with those who own land, and, had I had the opportunity, I should own some myself, but I have always found it too dear to purchase. We have now an opportunity to give effect to the conclusions of the best political economists, and we should not fail to do so. I am quite in accord with what the honorable member for Capricornia said on this matter. The Labour party came into existence to remove the wrongs of the past, and to prevent &#39;the exploitation and robbery that has hitherto occurred in connexion with land holding. We wish to prevent the occurrence in Norfolk Island of evils that have troubled other places. It matters not to me that the debate may go into next week, and that the Government want to get the Bill through. When we have gone, there will be others to take our places. Our policy and our ideals will not die with us. Others will take up the great work of reform and the advocacy of the humanitarian principles of the party. I cannot understand the obstinacy of Ministers in this matter. If I were outside, I would call it pigheadedness, but I cannot use that word here. Governments are creatures of to-day, and are gone to-morrow, and very often the members of the Ministry are advocating views that are not their own. Nearly half of the present Ministers have at one time or another favoured land nationalization, and the taxing of owners out of existence. I have never gone so far as that, because I have always had respect for present owners. I would, if I could, get the land away from them in as easy a way as possible. </para>

                        <para>- If I could tax them out of existence, I would try that, but every land-owner should be treated justly. As a member of this Legislature, I shall not sanction the alienation of land in fee-simple, and so long as my voice lasts, I shall be found fighting against it. I know that if the Minister of Trade and Customs were free in this matter, he would be only too glad to reserve the Crown lands of Norfolk Island for future generations, who would enjoy the unearned increment that had accrued, if any. He has a golden opportunity now to show the people what he is. The people of Norfolk Island will bless us for the stand we are taking to-day. If they could be present in the galleries, I do not think that they could be prevented from cheering our endeavours to prevent the alienation of the land of the island. If honorable members were inhabitants of Norfolk Island, they know how glad they would feel that members of Parliament, 2,000 miles away, were pleading their cause. The Minister of Trade and Customs has had a legal training, but legal men can sometimes be generous when they escape from the dull life of books and musty legal traditions. I appeal to the Minister to open his mind and heart, and recognise the wisdom of the views of those on this side. If he does that, he will have the satisfaction later of knowing that he did at least one good deed in his life, in preserving for the people of Norfolk Island land which will be theirs for all time. </para>

                    <para>.- Since we are considering the question of land tenure in respect to Norfolk Island, I think it well to place on record a statement as to the area with which we shall have to deal. Of the island&#39;s total area of 8,528 acres, 5,400 acres have been alienated, 967 acres consist of reserves, 850 acres are held under lease, and only 1,311 acres still remain unalienated. Eighty per cent, of the unalienated land is said to be good, but hilly, and parts of lt is heavily timbered. The Melanesian Mission has obtained a grant of about 1,000 acres, to be used for mission purposes only, so that there. is only a very small area involved. It seems to me that if we adopted the policy now advocated by the Opposition we should have in Norfolk Island a conflict of tenures. Our opponents, if they are logical, will agree that we must have either a leasehold or a freehold system &#39;in force on the island. It is absurd to advocate the holding of one &#34; section under leasehold and another under freehold - </para>

                        <para>- I subscribe to the principle that the two systems must alternate. Lands fit for occupancy and development should be held under freehold, but country which can be used to advantage only in large holdings - such, for instance, as pastoral areas over which the Crown might desire to retain certain rights in respect of timber, water, and other public utilities - should be held under leasehold. If the leasehold system possesses the virtue which the Opposition claim for it, how is it that the Northern Territory is not booming? The late Government initiated there the leasehold system, which is so dear to their hearts, but it has absolutely failed to attract population to that part of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- We were told that under the leasehold system the whole Territory was to be revolutionized. We are anxious to secure from abroad land users, and naturally those people are looking about for the best land and the best class of tenure. One of the reasons why my parents came to Australia was that they might secure a bit of land on which to make a home for themselves, and there can be no doubt that thousands of people have come to Australia with the same object in view. While society is so regulated that parents must be responsible for the families they raise, we can never depart from a system under which those parents shall have the right to pass on to their families their worldly possessions. Canada is one of the most recent successes in land settlement, and undoubtedly the chief factor in attracting people to that country has been the offer of the Dominion Government of a small section of land free of charge to every man who goes there. An outstanding fact connected with those who advocate the single tax or the leasehold system is that they are rarely land owners. It is an easy matter to advocate the adoption of a principle which is going to help some one else, provided that you will not have to pay for it. Let us look at the financial aspect of this matter. </para>

                        <para>- In regard to the theory held by the honorable member for Barrier and his party, that the whole of the land  should  revert to the Crown, so that it may be parcelled out under leasehold conditions, may I ask the honorable member whether he has ever conceived a financial scheme for acquiring the land? These matters are best tested by practical experience, and we certainly are not wanting in experience in this regard. The Mallee country in Victoria was first parcelled out under a leasehold tenure. I think that at first a twenty years&#39; tenure was given, but under that system settlement was slow, and conditions of life were hard. At the end of the twenty years&#39; period the State Government granted an extension of seven years, and again the struggle was continued. There are in this House many who will remember the newspaper controversy at that time as to whether or not the Mallee was worth saving. Finally, however, Victorian statesmen, in their wisdom, offered settlers in the Mallee the option of a lease in perpetuity, or the freehold of their land. The honorable member for Kooyong, to his credit be it said, was one of those who, as Minister of Lands in- Victoria, came to the rescue of the Mallee farmers. The users of land should be the best judges of the tenure they desire. What right have people who are not on the land, and who have no desire to go on the land, to lay down the whole of the conditions under which it should be occupied and used ? I am right in saying that fully 90 per cent, of the holders of Mallee areas plumped for freehold, with the result that to-day the Mallee is one of the richest properties in Victoria, and no one would now dream of raising the cry that it is not worth saving. Another instance that can be advanced for the information of honorable members opposite is to be gained from the action of those who support our opponents. We all know the little town of Wonthaggi. The people there are not all supporters of the Liberal party; for the most part they are supporters of those who believe in the leasehold system, and all the other socialistic doctrines so dear to our opponents. For reasons well known to honorable members, the Victorian Government, in order to relieve themselves from a crisis, established a coal mine at Wonthaggi, and they parcelled out the land on the lease system, the miners of Wonthaggi being given the opportunity to occupy some of the leaseholds, and build homes on them ; but they . had not been long in possession of their holdings when they came to the Victorian Premier, a Liberal, to ask him to convert their leaseholds into freeholds. </para>

                        <para>- No; but it shows that Socialists like the principle of leasehold for other people, but they do not adopt it when they take up land. A third illustration, for the information of honorable members opposite, is. to be found in that highly developed socialistic centre, New Zealand. I was pleased to learn that the Norfolk Islanders are in the happy and undisturbed condition described by the Minister of External Affairs in moving the second reading of this Bill. Their history, and the contentment in which they live, makes me feel all the more convinced that the Government will be well advised to leave the islanders in the enjoyment of their present land tenure, and all the other conditions obtaining on the island. </para>

                    <para>.- Had the honorable member for Wannon gone into the history of Norfolk Island, leaving out of consideration the terrible history of the convict time, he would have found they have not always been living in contentment. When a wave of sympathy swept over the world at the condition of the little speck in the great Pacific where the Pitcairn men, women, and children were living on an island that could not provide them with sufficient food, it was owing to one of the most generous acts of the late Queen Victoria, <inline font-style="italic">on the</inline> advice of a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Labouchere,  not the honorable member who represented North </para>

                <para class="block">Hampton in the British House of Commons, that these islanders were transferred to Norfolk Island, and an interesting experiment in land tenure was inaugurated. Had that land tenure continued, the islanders would have been happy, and they would not have been in the state of seething discontent in which I found them when I visited them. But that system was changed. The New South Wales Government evicted these island tenants from the holdings they had been occupying for fifty years. Under their old system, if an islander visited the mainland and took back with him a wife, he was immediately given a small block of land, or if a sailor remained on the island, and married one of the daughters of the island, he also could set up house on a small block of land. I find, from a map in the chamber that, apart from the 1,100 acres held by the Melanesian Mission, the largest single block held is 53 acres, while in the crowded portion of the island the holdings are 5 acres 2 roods 3 perches, 4 acres, and so on. These are very small allotments on which to rear families, but the land should be given to these people, either on leasehold or by Ordinance, that will prevent the aggregation of large blocks. I am sorry to say anything against a church of which my grandfather was a minister, but, out of the total area of 8,528 acres, the Mission of which I speak holds 1,100 acres. </para>

                        <para>- I am told that the Mission is principally used to train preachers to instruct the islanders in a dead language, when they themselves speak the noble British language. They are teaching Motu, because it has more vowels and is easier taught. I do not impugn any religion, but I do impugn the act of certain individuals in taking such a large slice of land from the islanders, to whom it was given by the late Queen Victoria. The government of Norfolk Island was a patriarchal form of government, under which an elective magistrate ruled, but the New South Wales Ministry, finding, perhaps, that crime was not punished as severely as they thought it should be, appointed a Governor. Can any one imagine that this island can afford a Governor? Why were the islanders not allowed to carry on their patriarchal form of government, which produced so much happiness? People talk about the decay of the race. No one who has seen these islanders managing a boat could do that truthfully. I was landed on the island during a storm, on a little strip of beach not longer, than the chamber, and with coral reefs threatening to wreck our boat. No one who saw the firm islander handling, the oar at the stern, and those obeying his command, but would feel the admiration that has gained for the islanders the renown of being the greatest boatmen in the Southern seas. When the Administrator of the New Hebrides required boatmen he found that he could get none better in the world than the natives of Norfolk Island. I have no desire to delay the passing of this Bill, but I must keep the pledge I made to these people. I understand that there are only 1,300 acres of arable land remaining unalienated in the island. The highest point of land, Mount Pitt, with a double peak, is only 1,050 feet above the level of the sea, and I must say that I saw no bad land there at all. It is a fertile little spot. The Norfolk Island pine, which is indigenous to this island, and to Lord Howe Island, named after Admiral Howe, has become known for its value throughout the world, and seeds of this pine are now exported from these islands to other parts of the world. The statement sometimes made that the people of Norfolk Island are decadent was certainly not supported by the fine physique of the boatmen I saw there. I was met there by a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Quinton,</inline> the oldest son of one of the original Pitcairners, and when I returned to the Island, four weeks later, at a meeting the people told me that they earnestly desired to come under the control of the Commonwealth. I therefore welcome this Bill. I offer it no fractious opposition, but I must support the amendment to preserve the land for these people. It would be a great pity that any more of the land should get into the hands of mortgagees or money-lenders. </para>

                        <para>- It is much better that we should prevent the possibility of it ever occurring. The best land law ever known was that of the old Hebrews. They did not allow the land ever to be sold in perpetuity. I maintain that the lands of Norfolk Island were a gift to the people from Queen Victoria. I cannot forget the noble words of the captain of the man-of-war in offering to provide the Pitcairners with land and better homes on Norfolk Island than they had on the island of Pitcairn. In spite of his offer, some of the Pitcairners desired to be left on Pitcairn Island, and their sincerity was proved by the fact that after they had been settled on beautiful Norfolk Island forty of them returned to Pitcairn. The captain of the man of war assured these people that they would be given for their homes the buildings which had been occupied by the military and civil officials who had conducted the convict settlement at Norfolk Island. When the honorable member for Wannon says that to secure the best results people must be given the freehold of land, I ask him to consider the position of affairs at Hong Kong, where, with the exception of a few blocks alienated in very early times, there is no land privately owned. Hong Kong is the only Tree Trade port in the world to-day, and the only place where the public revenue derived from the land, is increasing every year. </para>

                        <para>- It is because every enhancement of the value of the land goes to the Government. Hong Kong is an island, and its acreage can only be increased by reclamation. When any land is reclaimed it is cut up into blocks, a moderate rent is placed upon the blocks, and they are offered on lease of seventy-five years, with the option of renewal at a revised rent. The right to lease them is put up to auction, and the choicest blocks are secured by the payment of the highest bonus. Buildings are erected according to approved plans, and at the close of the lease of seventy-five years there is a new valuation. Honorable members can understand that the value of these lands vastly increases by the massing of population, and it is because all that enhancement of value is retained by the Government that the revenue of Hong Kong is relatively greater than that of any other place of which I have heard. The year 1907 was a sad year for Norfolk Island. That was the year  of eviction. I am satisfied that the Commonwealth Government would never have done what the New South Wales Government of that day did. I am glad that the island which is the heritage of the Pitcairners is to be brought under the more beneficent rule of the Commonwealth. If the Government, at the last moment, will accept the amendment which has been moved, they can have this Bill, and Ministers must be aware that there will be no objection raised to the amendment in another place. I make a final appeal to the Prime Minister to provide in this Bill that the 1,300 acres remaining unalienated in Norfolk Island shall not be parted with, but shall be retained for the benefit of these descendants of the mutineers of the <inline font-style="italic">Bounty,</inline> who talk the language of their fathers, with the soft accent of their South Sea Island mothers, and it is the sweetest English I have ever heard spoken. </para>

                        <para>,- I desire to call attention to the necessity for establishing a testing station for explosives. This subject has been previously discussed here, and the Prime Minister, I understand, is favorably disposed towards my proposal. Since the matter was last before us, the cost of explosives has again been increased, with the result that the workmen in the mining districts are feeling the tax very severely. Yesterday they appointed a deputation to wait on the Minister of Mines in New South Wales, requesting him to undertake the erection of a testing station at once. In reply, the Minister stated that for a considerable time he had been endeavouring to get a testing station erected. He considered that it was a Commonwealth quest on, and had written to the head of the Commonwealth Government, on behalf of the Government of New South Wales, stating that, if the former would undertake the work of erecting a testing station for explosives, his Government, would pay a proportion of the expense. He added that he had been waiting for some time; but, up to the present, no results had accrued. Will the Prime Minister give this matter his early attention? We are all anxious to prevent any risk of mines giving off dangerous gases. We do not desire to witness a catastrophe here similar to that which was experienced recently in Wales. That is why a testing station should be established. In the absence of such a station, the manufacturers of explosives in the Old Country can charge any price they choose for their explosives in Australia. We have an industry in our midst which is capable of manufacturing explosives that give off no fire whatever. It can supply a good article to the miners at a less cost than is charged for the imported article. 1 wish to know if the Prime Minister will give this question his early and earnest consideration. </para>

                        <para>.- I shall not occupy the time of the House very long, because we have had a rather lengthy discussion to-day. We have had a most instructive debate, and have done good work, considering that it is Friday. I was rather dissatisfied with the reply of the Prime Minister to a most important question which I put to him this morning. I asked him whether he proposed to proceed with the Electoral Bill before he receives the report of the Royal Commission which is to be appointed to inquire into the alleged defects of our Electoral Act. The Prime Minister declares that he is an economist, and, if he is anxious to save the public funds, he will surely await the report of the Royal Com mss ion before he wastes the time of the House in passing a measure which may require to he amended later on. What is the idea of appointing a Royal Commission to investigate this matter, if it is not to enable us to embody its conclusions in an Act of Parliament? </para>
