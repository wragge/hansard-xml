                    <para>- In the absence of the Honorary Minister, I wish to know from the Prime Minister whether it would not be possible to have cheap leather covers supplied with the pocket book of Commonwealth statistics that has just been issued to members, and the issue of which I first suggested in this House a little time back. These books are likely to be very much used because of the valuable information that they contain; but the present covers are too flimsy, and wear off almost immediately. A cheap leather cover should not cost more than about &#189;d. per book; it would not be necessary to print anything upon the cover. </para>

                                <para>- Well, this boxer, the boy claims, dug his fingers into the boy&#39;s neck, screwed his arm almost out of its socket, until he cried out with pain, and punched him in the face twice, and knocked him on the ground. The boy was almost stunned. When he got up, he said that he would summon his assailant, and was then struck such a brutal blow that, he says, &#34; it sent me clean over, and now there is an awful lump on my face.&#34; I ask the Prime Minister to ascertain whether there is any truth in those statements, and, if so, whether the punishment alleged to be inflicted on this boy was in accordance with the regulations. </para>

                            <para>- If the facts are as alleged, and there is no other side to the case, the officer responsible ought not to remain in the force a minute longer. At the same time we know what some boys are. Certainly it looks as if there had been bad blood between the officer and the. boy. The matter requires looking into, and I promise the honorable member that it will be looked into. </para>

There are certain provisions in the regulations for adequate discipline, which would be observed by the officer except, of course, under emergent circumstances, but I hope my honorable friend will not get it into his head that all the boys who have to be drilled are angels and all the officers brutes. That is not the case. </para>

I know the honorable member is always sympathetic towards the man whom Robert Blatchford called the &#34; under dog,&#34; and the man who is always so sympathetic for people who need sympathy is sometimes apt to let his heart run away with his head. It is a good fault, but I hope the honorable member will not carry it to excess. </para>

                            <para>- I cannot. The engraver of the Commonwealth notes was kind enough to make a die, and engrave the plates in his own time for the printing of these stamps, but the Treasury Department will not allow him to strike off more than 1,000,000. If he were permitted, he could continue to print these stamps at the rate of 1,000,000 per week. The Treasury Department is having dies prepared, so that further stamps can be printed by the electro process, which is the process employed for the printing of the old issue. In my opinion, the stamps produced by the steel-engraving process are much superior to the others. </para>

                    <para>- Will the Prime Minister take into favorable consideration the advisability of issuing an order, at this time of the year, in reference to the boys who are now detained in camp for not putting in enough drills, allowing them to go home for the Christmas, holidays. I have received letters, from some mothers of these boys asking if this can be done. It would be an act of courtesy to grant, their request. </para>

                        <para>- Is the Prime Minister aware that, according to the Home Affairs Department, Schedule No. 16, there are sufficient sleepers at the Kalgoorlie depot to build 140 miles of the Transcontinental Railway, and sufficient rails to build about 120 miles of the line,, which material, according to the capacity of the track-layer, should keep the work going for four or five months ? Owing to the fact that Western Australia is really losing money by the transport of the material, would it not be wise on the part of the Prime Minister, before cancelling the contract, to look carefully into these matters, so that the Commonwealth may not have to pay more later on for sleepers for this railway? </para>

                        <para>- The Government are anxious to insure a continuous supply of sleepers for the construction of the Transcontinental Railway. Everything depends upon that. The men are there, and contracts are to be let, I hope ; but it will be impossible to do anything of the kind unless we can guarantee a continuous supply of material. In that respect we are in the hands of the Western Australian Government, to whom the honorable member has committed us for good or ill. </para>

                            <para>.-It was my intention to raise this question during the consideration of the Estimates relating to the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department, but, in pursuance of an arrangement to deal with the Estimates within a certain time, they were put through so hurriedly that I had not an opportunity to do so. It is necessary, perhaps, to explain that there are two kinds of stamps, the steel-engraved, which are valued by philatelists, and those printed . from zinc plates, which are known as utility stamps. The steel-engraved stamps are the more costly to produce, but, whilst they are better to look at, and, from the  stand-point  of the philatelist, are preferable to the utility stamps, the general public do not care whether they are supplied with the one or the other. I am somewhat inclined to philately, so that if I had followed my own personal predilections when I held office as Postmaster-General, I should have decided to issue the steel-engraved stamps. But, from the point of view of pounds, shillings, and pence, it was believed that only the utility stamps, which had been issued in Australia for many years, should be printed, and that was the decision of the late Government. In America steel-engraved stamps are issued, and I believe, although I am not quite sure, that they are also issued in Great Britain. The present &#39; Postmaster-General has seen fit to print 1,000,000 steel-engraved stamps. It was announced that the issue would be confined to that number, and the announcement is sure to appeal to philatelists all over the world. I do not wish to say anything unkind, but it seems to me that the downright ardent philatelist must be something in the nature of a crank. </para>

                                <para>- That, perhaps, would be a better term to use. This issue of 1,000,000 stamps has been taken up, not by the general public, but for the most part by philatelists. It was recognised that there would be a general rush by these people, and in order to meet it the Postmaster-General directed that no person should be allowed to purchase more than six at any one time. The honorable gentleman&#39;s desire was that &#171;these steel-engraved stamps should be distributed as far as possible among the general public, but nearly the whole issue has already found its way, I venture to say, into the hands of the philatelists. I am not complaining of this, because, as a matter of fact, I have a little corner in these stamps. A number of my parliamentary friends were good enough to buy the maximum number allowed to be issued at a time to any one person, and to hand them over to me. In Melbourne there is only one place where these stamps can be purchased to-day. They were available at that place a little while ago, but after the question put to the Minister / on the subject it is possible there has been another rush, and that even the supply there has become exhausted. I inquired at the General Post Office yesterday, and was told that these stamps were not available. An inquiry that I made at another office met with the same reply. The objection  that I take to the Postmaster-General&#39;s action is that he may do the same thing again, with the object of making a profit for the Department rather than of serving the public interest. The question of whether the steel-engraved stamp or the utility stamp should be issued is a matter of policy for the Government to decide. If the Postmaster-General is a philatelist, he may urge that only steel-engraved stamps should be issued, but if the rest of the Government are not philatelists, then, like some of my colleagues in the late Ministry, they may prefer the cheaper issue. The question as to which class of stamp shall be issued should be settled, however, once and for all ; otherwise we may have f  further  issues of steel-engraved stamps, not for the public use, but simply to enable the Department to make a profit. If such a course of action were adopted and continued, it would reduce Australia to the level of some of the South American Republics. In South America there are some Governments who continually issue fresh designs, in steel engravings, and very attractive in character, merely for sale to philatelists; and I feel sure there is no one in this House who would for one moment desire to see the Commonwealth adopt such a policy. </para>

                                <para>- I should be sorry, indeed, if Australia started to raise revenue through the Post Office in such a way. Those who have any acquaintance with what I may call the craze of stamp collecting, know that stamps become very valuable after they have been issued for some time. Only a few days ago, in a tram, a friend of mine asked me whether I had in my collection a certain Victorian stamp. </para>

                                <para>- I admit that. I told my friend that I had not an actual stamp, but only a copy of it; and he then informed me that when he was some seven or eight years of age, he found a trunk full of old letters&#39; belonging to his grandfather, and that nearly all the stamps on the envelopes, as he remembered quite clearly, were the particular issue to which lie referred. &#34;Unfortunately, he threw away the stamped envelopes; but had he retained them he would now have been able to obtain &#163;25 each for the stamps. Stamps have a regular price in the market like any other commodity, and the fact that the Postmaster-General stipulated that each person should only be able to purchase  sixpennyworth  of the new issue shows that he fully realized that the philatelists would get to work. I understand the Postmaster-General to say that the Treasury will not allow him to have the die in order to print any more of this new issue. My own opinion is that we ought to definitely decide, as a&#39; matter of policy, whether a &#39; certain stamp is to be issued and continued, or whether only a certain number are to be printed. In regard to our Post Office we ought to have a high ideal; because no country with any respect for itself would issue stamps merely in order to make a profit over a brief period, and then introduce a fresh design with the same object in view. I do not suggest, or think for a moment, that this was the idea actuating the Postmaster-General; but I hope that we shall not have a similar occurrence. Whether a stamp be from a steel engraving or merely what is known as a utility stamp, it should be issued <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> for postal purposes. </para>

                            <para>.- I take rather a serious view of the statement of the Postmaster-General, not because he decided to issue only 1,000,000 of these stamps, but because of the uncertain manner in which he informed us that he is unable to print any more, as the matter is in the hands of the Treasurer. The language that the Postmaster-General used as to the plates being cut by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harrison,</inline> the head of the Australian notes printing office, left the impression on my mind that the plates belong to that gentleman as his private property. </para>

                                <para>- I am glad to hear that. If the plates are not private property, they are the property of the Government of Australia, and, I venture to say, the property of the Postmaster-General and &#34;no other. They may, for practical  purposes, be temporarily in the hands of the Treasurer, but they are in no sense the Treasurer&#39;s property. The Postmaster-General has not been so clear on this occasion as he usually is. Speaking generally, the honorable gentleman is perfectly frank in everything he says and does in the House; but in regard to this matter, he has not been so definite as I should have liked him to be. He must know whether he set out to print 1,000,000 of these stamps, and no more; and, if he did, he should have taken the necessary precautions to insure that the issue did not fall into the hands of monopolists - shall I say? - on both sides of the House, or of other people &#34; in the know.&#34; </para>

When the late Government were in office, certain alterations in the stamp design were made. &#39; These have been disapproved by the present Government; but I am not going to discuss that phase of the question. I understand from one of my colleagues that, immediately those alterations were made, great buyers sent for, I think, about &#163;250 worth, not of the new issue, but of old unused stamps. What would they not give for a new issue of a limited number? I am given to understand that an issue of 1,000,000 mean&#39;s about one stamp for each active philatelist. Why, there are members of the community going about with pounds&#39; worth in their pockets; and I think that this is grossly unfair. I agree with the honorable member for Barrier that there should be no truckling in connexion with the printing and issue of our stamps. </para>

                                <para>- Does the honorable member think that a few privileged people, because they have early information, should be able to get hold of quantities of these stamps - that they should be able to send Tom, Dick, and Harry twice and three times to various&#39; post-offices, and obtain stamps before the general public know of the issue? Is that the way the administration of the country is to be carried on ? What chance, under such circumstances, has an outsider to get even one stamp ? He will have to buy it from the dealers. The honorable member for Eden-Monaro surely sees that a public statement should have been made in this Chamber immediately the Government arrived at a policy in the matter. There should have been no communication of information, privately or otherwise, to any particular person. Immediately it was hinted by the Postmaster-General that he might print more stamps by the steel-engraving process, the honorable member for Parkes interjected, &#34; And break faith with somebody?&#34; With whom? </para>

                                <para>- I do not know whether the public is under that impression, but we cannot complain of those who seize lawful advantages. What 1 ask is, How did certain persons get early information ? I am speaking on behalf of the general public. There may be persons living in the interior who are as keen philatelists as any members of this House, and they have an equal right with others to purchase Government property that may rise in value. </para>

                                <para>- That the Postmaster-General ought to have had a policy when he started to print these stamps. I asked him at the beginning whether the stamps were to be printed from steel plates, or by the ordinary electrotype process, and he said that he intended to print from steel plates. He could not have done better than get <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harrison</inline> to engrave the plates, -but he had no right to assume, as he did to-day, that these plates were not under his control, or, rather, that he cannot get the stamps printed at the note printing office when he wishes. To give an evasive answer to a question was not like the honorable gentleman. If he has determined to print only 1,000,000 stamps by the steel-plate process, he has no more need for the plates now that the stamps have been issued, and, for the honour of the country, he should have them destroyed, because faith should be kept with the philatelists who have purchased the -stamps. Whatever difficulty may have arisen has been due to his want of frankness in stating that the issue was to consist of 1,000,000 only. When I questioned him from time to time on the subject, suggesting that there would be a loss by printing from steel plates amounting to about &#163;3,000 a year, he did not give the slightest indication that he intended to print only 1,000,000 stamps by the steel-engraving process. It was then that he ought to have been frank. Stamps have no special interest for me, except as I might like one or two to give to children, but I think that the Postmaster-General has made a mistake. I know that he had no intention of getting any advantage for himself or his friends, hut there has been a lack of frankness, for which I am sorry. </para>

                            <para>. -  I had, perhaps, better tell the House the history of these stamps. - Some time ago designs were called for an Australian stamp to replace the stamps of the various States. The kangaroo design was chosen, but it was not the design that won the first prize. I thought that the design that had won the first prize was a better design, and when I came into office I inquired whether it could be used. The designer said that he did not think that any one in this country could engrave the steel plates needed to reproduce it, and that a good stamp could not be obtained in any other way. I ascertained, however, that the engraver of our bank notes is one of the most expert stamp engravers in the world. He engraved most of the stamps used by the British Government, and has engraved stamps for other countries as well. I saw him, and he said that he would be very pleased to cut a die and to engrave the necessary plates, but that the design needed modification to bring it within the compass of a stamp. He modified the design accordingly, made a die, and engraved the plates. The finest stamps in the world are those that have been printed from steel-engraved plates. I thought that Australia should have a stamp which was as well engraved as the stamps of other leading nations, such as the United States of America. The engraver told me that, with a Hoe machine, he could produce  1,000,000  a week. I asked the Treasury Department to allow him to do this, but the Department objected, saying that the Commonwealth Stamp Printer was producing the stamps of the kangaroo design, using what is known as the electro process, and that there was not the necessary machinery for printing stamps by the steel-plate process. After a great deal of trouble, however, the Treasurer let me have  1,000,000  stamps printed with a machine that is being used for the printing of bank notes. I made no bargain with any one - neither with the public nor the stamp dealers - as to the limitation of the issue to  1,000,000.  All I stated was that the first  1,000,000  stamps issued would be steel-engraved. If the Postal Department had the machinery - which it has not, the control of the printing of stamps being in the hands of the Treasury - we should continue printing from the plates. The Treasury Department has purchased two more Hoe machines, but I am informed that they will be used all through the coming year for the printing of notes, because at present the notes cannot be printed fast enough. There would be no difficulty in getting the stamps printed if we had the necessary machinery. I propose to keep the die and the plates. There has been no bargain with philatelists or others to limit the issue to  1,000,000.  The stamps were not issued by the Department for the purpose of making money. There was no premium charged. The man who bought a stamp, a philatelist, or any one else, got the value for his penny. . I was not keen to see any one making a corner in these stamps, and retailing them to stamp collectors. I understand there are exactly  1,000,000  stamp collectors in the world, so that if each got one of these first million, there would be just enough to go round. The Leader of the Opposition said recently that it would cost  &#163;5,000  or  &#163;6,000  to print these stamps by the steel-engraving process. The actual extra cost of printing them is  &#163;420  per hundred million. </para>

                                <para>- About  550  million stamps of all classes. The issue of Jd. stamps is very close to that of the Id. stamp, probably in the proportion of three to five, but stamps of higher values are not used to any great extent. With an issue of  550  million stamps per annum, there would probably be  300  million penny stamps issued, costing the Commonwealth  &#163;1,260  per annum above the cost of the ordinary electro-printed stamps. I do not think the people of Australia will grudge paying  &#163;1,260  a year to have a stamp that is a credit to the Commonwealth. Philatelists are good judges as to the quality and value of a stamp, and they give credit to any country that issues a good one. In the United States there are six different variations of red for the stamp that corresponds with our penny stamp. Any tinge of red is authorized by the Berne Convention. I would like to issue some of these penny stamps with&#39; a crimson colour. I had a few printed in that colour; but, seeing that the Treasury would only allow us to have 1,000,000, I took the best I could get. If I had my own way we should have nothing but engraved stamps in circulation, and not what are known as utility stamps. I do not think the Department has done anything unfair, either to the philatelists or the public. I was aware  that there  would be a rush for the first issue of 1,000,000 stamps, and therefore I tried to keep them out of the hands of stamp dealers, and make a fair distribution to the public. That is why I issued the order that no person could buy more than six at a time. </para>

                            <para>.- I do not think that the Postmaster-General has answered the point that I raised. He has been arguing that a steel-engraved stamp is better than what I term the ordinary utility stamp. I admit that it is. It is only a question of pounds, shillings, and pence, whether the Government issue a utility stamp or a steel-engraved stamp, though I understand from the Postmaster-General that it costs more to issue a steel-engraved stamp. I consider the estimate of &#163;420 per 100 million stamps rather low, but we can accept it, and it is merely a question of whether that &#163;420 is money well spent in having a steel-engraved stamp. To have a steel-engraved stamp may be better, but it certainly does not bring a single penny of additional revenue to the Post. Office, and it is a question of the Postmaster-General, or the Treasurer, or the Government, or Parliament, saying whether that extra money shall be spent in order to issue a better stamp. I would like an assurance from the Postmaster-General that in future he will not issue stamps of any design, whether they be steel-engraved or utility stamps, unless he intends to go on issuing that particular design for that particular stamp. We understand from him that he is now somewhat in a dilemma, inasmuch as the Treasury have prevented him from doing what he desires to do. </para>

                                <para>- Decidedly. That is my point. If you send out a limited issue the stamps get into the hands of philatelists. Some South American Republics like that sort of thing, as there is a certain profit in it, but we in Australia have not come to that. I spent a couple of very pleasant hours with a State Governor who takes a keen interest in philately, and he showed me a stamp with a market value of &#163;50, though its face value was probably not more than twopence. There happened to be some little flaw discovered in the stamp when the first fifty were issued, and the issue was recalled, so that those fifty became very valuable. </para>

                                <para>- It was the honorable member for Parkes who said that the Postmaster-General would be breaking faith with the public if more than 1,000,000 steel-engraved stamps were issued. The mere fact that a person could not buy more that sixpennyworth gave that impression, rightly or wrongly. I have never heard of a limit being placed on any particular issue of stamps in Australia previously. Has the honorable member for Perth heard of any Postmaster-General announcing an issue of stamps, and a person asking for a shilling&#39;s worth not being able to get more than sixpennyworth ? </para>

                                <para>- There was a time when post-offices would issue a particular stamp for a particular purpose. When the present Prime Minister was Postmaster-General in New South Wales, and money was required for a certain hospital, he issued a very beautiful1d. stamp for1s., and a 2&#189;d. stamp for 2s. 6d. The difference between the1d. and the 1s. and between the 2&#189;d. and the 2s. 6d. went to the hospital. I do not think the issue was a great success, because philatelists will not put stamps of that kind in their collections; they will collect only stamps legitimately issued for postage purposes. In this particular case there must have been an impression somewhere that the issue was to be restricted, probably arising from the statement of the Postmaster-General that no one could get more than six. This is the first time they were issued, and I hope, the matter having been brought before the Postmaster-General, that such a thing will never occur again in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- We are quite willing to receive applications for the stations; and, as far as possible, the Department will inspect the sites to see that they are suitable. The idea is to erect &#39; wireless stations ahead of the existing telegraph lines. I cannot say at present&#39; what the rates will be. It will depend on the cost of running the stations. I do not want to run them at a loss. </para>

                        <para>- That is a matter to be argued out hereafter, but I regret that the States- were not . consulted before a Bureau of Agriculture Bill was brought before the House. It was said by the Prime Minister, who introduced the Bill, and by many of those who have given it very enthusiastic support, that the bureau is created to do something that the States are not already doing. The States are making investigations on the scientific and research side as well as on the practical side. I believe most of that work can be better carried out in a Federal Department, but it would have been best to consult the States in order to induce them, if possible, to relinquish some of their important functions to the Federal Agricultural Bureau. It is not possible for the Federal Department to undertake experiments on an extensive scale throughout Australia without the States co-operating with it by placing land at its disposal. We  are hampered in that important direction. It has been constantly stated that the Bureau of Agriculture in the United States has been carrying out very great functions. We know it has, because it has enormous powers of administration. The reason is that in the, early days of Federation in the United States, after the first nine States federated, the whole of the public estate became the property of the Federal Parliament, with the exception of territory in Texas, which came in afterwards. In fact, in the whole of the States which afterwards came into the Union, now numbering nearly fifty, the public estate became absolutely the property of the Federal Government. The result was that they instituted a Department of Agriculture, not only to carry out research work throughout the United States, but also to do important administrative work which is now carried out here by the States in connexion with their inspection laws, by the Railway Department to a large extent in the construction of new railways, and by the Water Supply Departments in the building of large dams. </para>

                        <para>- I am not condemning the Bill; I am prepared to support it. I represent a constituency which is vitally interested in this important question, and I am not going to be deprived of my right to speak. I hope the Bill will become law this session, but I trust at the same time that the Government, before they create a new Department, and incur new expenditure, will at once enter into communication with the various State Governments, in order to make this a thoroughly effective Bureau of Agriculture - a bureau that will take over hot only the research work carried out by the States at present, but also certain administrative work now done by them. I have travelled all over Australia as a member of the Fruit Commission, and the question of uniform inspection is, I know, of vital importance. That is a function which might be undertaken by the Bureau of Agriculture. There is also the question of the export of produce-, such as butter and fruit, and other perishable products. These are matters that could be brought under uniform inspection and uniform laws. There is a conflict of opinion throughout Australia respecting the class of fruit that should be sent to the different parts of the world. We cannot get two officers <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> agree on a definition of sound fruit. </para>

                        <para>- We are not justified in piling up. the expenses before every effort has been made to get the States to relinquish some of their functions. If the States point blank refuse to do so, it will be the duty of this Parliament to exercise its constitutional functions in order to carry out work of an Australian character. The Government must enter into serious and close negotiations with the States in order to obtain for the bureau the power to regulate the export of produce, and create a uniform system of inspection. We also want the States to hand over, to a large extent, to the Federal Parliament that valuable experimental and research work which is- being carried out in every State Agricultural Department. Some of the finest experiments in regard to wheat-growing have been carried out by the States in South Australia and Victoria. I believe that by co-ordinating the work, and having a uniform character of literature issued from the one Department for the whole of Australia, we can minimize the expenditure and do even better work. This is the proper Parliament to exercise research and experimental functions. We are piling up expenditure, and additional expenditure will be incurred by the creation of this Department. Duplication is going on in all directions. It occurs in the compilation of statistics, the making of land tax valuations, and in other matters where we should be able to avoid it. I say at once that we should pass this Bill, because the Federal Bureau of Agriculture can do much of the work to be allotted to it better than can any </para>

                <para class="block">State Department. But it will be necessary for the Government to confer with the States, with the object of inducing them to relinquish some of the more important functions which their Departments of Agriculture are now individually exercising, in order that unnecessary expenditure may be avoided, and the success of the bureau thoroughly assured. I hope that before the Bill is brought into operation the Government will do their best to induce the States to hand over to the. Federal Bureau certain functions which it can exercise quite as economically as any State Department, and far more effectively from the point of view of Australia as a whole. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for Oxley was called to order last night for declaring that the Government were not sincere in their desire to push on with this Bill. Had he gone into its history he could have shown that, on 4th September last, the Address-in-Reply to the Governor-General&#39;s speech, and the want-of-confidence motion following upon it, were disposed of, and that on the following day this Bill was introduced. It was the first Bill to be introduced by this Government, and it has remained on the business-paper ever since. </para>

                        <para>- We had to deal with more important work, and I am glad to say that we got a lot of it out of the way. We passed legislation which we considered to be more important than is this measure, and, notwithstanding the Government and their majority, not one line of that legislation has been repealed. Had we remained in office this Bill would have been introduced, and I undertake to say that it would not have been left on the stocks, but would have been carried. The honorable member for Wannon said that the bureau was designed to teach the agriculturists how to make two blades of grass grow where only one had grown before. It seems to me that this Bill is to do something more; that it is designed to make two carrots grow where only one grew before, and that these carrots are to be dangled before the eyes &#34;of country electors, whom honorable members opposite wish to gull. </para>

In the absence of the Minister of Trade and Customs, this Bill was introduced by the Prime Minister. At the close of his speech, I, as ex-Minister of Trade and Customs - and the Department of Trade and Customs will have to administer this measure - asked for the adjournment of the debate in order that I might have an opportunity to study his remarks. It was a perfectly fair request, but the Prime Minister objected that the Government were going to push on at once with the Bill. They have pushed on with it so rapidly that on this, the last day of the session, it remains  unpassed.  Honorable members opposite have complained that duplication takes place in connexion with the preparation of Federal and State statistics, and in making land valuations for Federal, State, and municipal taxation purposes. They have urged that the States should be asked to assist us in our desire to avoid any overlapping in connexion with the Federal Bureau of Agriculture by handing over to the Commonwealth certain powers now exercised by them. Are they likely to do so? </para>

                        <para>- We adopted the Victorian standard, which was 15 per cent. ; but the State Governments objected when we applied that standard to butter for export. They said, in effect, &#34; We shall have one standard for butter to be consumed by our own people, and another standard for butter to be used oversea.&#34; Then, again, I would remind&#39; the Committee of what happened in connexion with our decision to inspect meat for export, because of the trouble that had arisen oversea with regard to the presence of nodules in beef. It was absolutely necessary that something should be done,, and at our request Professor Gilruth undertook certain work, which could not. have been done better even if this Bureau had been established. </para>

                        <para>- The investigations are being continued by that Institute. I think we are all in favour of steps being taken to rid our beef of nodules. In order to get our beef into the British market, it is necessary to remove practically the entire brisket; and something like 70 lbs. of meat out of every carcass has to be sent to the. digesters, where it is converted into tallow. The State most vitally interested in this matter objected, to its inspectors acting for us, and the Commonwealth had to appoint inspectors of its own. In all the other States the work is being done by State officers, and the Commonwealth is paying &#34;for- their services. Unless the Government can arrange to avoid overlapping, I am afraid&#39;, that this &#39;bureau will prove &#39;a &#34;very&#39; costly one. Money will flow like water down a. hill- in connexion with research work. </para>

This is one of the matters that would have come within the purview of the Bureau of Agriculture if a bureau had been in existence. Since Professor Gilruth went into the question of the worm nodules certain investigations in connexion with diseases have been carried out at the Institution of Tropical Medicine at Townsville. By the way, the worm nodule is more unsightly than harmful. </para>

                        <para>- No. His work is purely that of the laboratory; and it would be well if honorable members, who are interested, visited this institution, which is one of the most up to date in the world. It has only recently been built, and advantage was taken of experience gained elsewhere. I take it that when the Bureau of Agriculture is instituted it will take over certain of the work now being done by the Commerce Branch, and also some of the work now being carried on at Townsville. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so, but I desire to pay a tribute to men who are not here to-day, but who had much to. do with -the original proposal to institute a Bureau of Agriculture. The question was first raised in June, 1901, about six weeks after the Federal Parliament met, by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Quick, then the member for.Bendigo. </para>

We know that there is no limit to the expenditure when scientific men begin research with the knowledge that the public purse is behind them. Of course, in many cases, the money is spent most effectively. </para>

                    <para>. - The success or failure of this Bill will largely depend on the cordial co-operation of the Commonwealth and the States; and it would be deplorable if that cooperation were absent. The vast possibilities of a Bureau of Agriculture cannot be fully realized, even in a discussion such as this. The Bureau of the United States is an object lesson which shows what can be done by concentrated research, particularly in regard to agriculture. There the expenditure is something like &#163;3,750,000 per annum on scientific research work, and some of the reports issued are of the utmost value to the whole world. </para>

                        <para>- I think it is desirable that the Bureau should grow gradually, but there ought to be at least two or three of the very best men engaged at once. In the Mother Country, where something like&#163;500,000 per annum is spent in this connexion, the principle adopted is to endow universities and intrust special work to selected professors. There has been a marvellous metamorphosis, almost startling in its character, in regard to methods of agriculture. The rule of reason is supplanting the rule of thumb; and any country, such as our own, which looks forward to vast cereal exports must avail itself of the highest scientific knowledge of the day. My only reason for rising to-day, however, is to refer to the remarks of the honorable member for Bendigo, who raised some doubts as to the constitutionality of the measure With those doubts I personally do not agree. </para>

                        <para>- If the arguments of the honorable member for Bendigo are sound, we are wasting time in discussing this measure, because he seems to have grave doubt as to the power of the Commonwealth to make appropriations for the purposes of an Agricultural Bureau. I asked him whether, as a lawyer of experience, he would take the responsibility of stating the opinion that the Commonwealth has no power to do this but he would not say yes. Consequently his expression of doubt was a mere beating of the air. But we have the right to satisfy ourselves that what we are proposing to do is constitutional, and therefore I shall proceed to examine the honorable member&#39;s suggestion. He argues that the Commonwealth&#39;s powers of appropriation are shut down to the purposes set forth in section 51 of the Constitution. If that were so, we should be in a serious position so far as the State exigencies which from time to time arise are concerned. In support of his view the honorable member said that our Constitution is more limited in this respect than that of America. There are two replies to be made to him. The first is that I claim we have a general constitutional power of appropriation, altogether apart from the provisions of section 51; and the second that we have also an incidental power contained in that section. As to the general power of appropriation, section 81 provides that - </para>

                <para>My honorable friend may suggest that the words &#34; for the purposes of the Commonwealth &#34; are limited by the words &#34; in the manner and subject to the charges and liabilities imposed by this Constitution.&#34; They are limited in this way to some extent: When it says that the revenues of the Commonwealth may be appropriated &#34;for the purposes of the Commonwealth in the manner and subject to the charges and liabilities imposed by this Constitution,&#34; that, I think, means that our measures must be originated and appropriated in accordance, for instance, with such provisions as sections 53, 54, 55, 56, and 83, and that regard must be had to the charges imposed on the revenue, such charges, for instance, as the payments to the States under the Braddon provision. We have general powers of appropriation so long as the appropriation is made in accordance with the method provided by the Constitution and subject to its charges and liabilities. That view is supported by all the leading American authorities, and in this connexion the American Constitution is practically the same as our own.

The ho&#39;norable member for Bendigo endeavours to meet this argument by con-  tending that the powers of the American. Constitution are wider than those of our Constitution. I differ from him. The American Constitution may be somewhat wider in respect of eminent domain, but, broadly and generally, our Constitution is, if anything, the wider. The eighth clause of the American Constitution empowers Congress - to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises, to pay the debts, and provide for the common defence and general welfare of the United States.  :Chat is a limited power of taxation; but our Constitution contains no such limitations.

                        <para>- There is; but by our Constitution we are not limited by words of the kind. We have complete power in that connexion, whereas the words in the Constitution of the United States of America imply a limitation. But the point I was trying to make was that, in order to get over the fact that there is already in existence in the United States of America a vast Bureau of Agriculture, and in order to get over the authorities to which I have referred, and the fact that, for exigencies of State, it is a most common and ordinary thing for the Congress to appropriate for agricultural and other, what we might call outside, purposes, the honorable member for Bendigo said that the Constitution of the United States of America was wider than ours, and provided that appropriation might be made for the general welfare of the community. There is no such specific term in the Constitution of the United States of America. The general welfare provision is only included in the power of taxation, the power to appropriate for the general welfare necessarily being a corollary. However, there is a limitation in the Constitution of the United States of America. Of the two Constitutions ours is the wider in this regard. I think I have made it clear that, first of all, under our Constitution, we have a general power of appropriation. </para>

                <para class="block">We have, therefore, full and complete incidental powers to deal with all the subjects set out in section 51  -  trade and commerce with other countries and among the States, quarantine matters, and so forth. The Minister of Trade and Customs,  in  the memorandum to which I have referred, very succinctly set down our present constitutional powers contained in section 51, in regard to which we have all the incidental powers of jurisdiction and legislation, and on page 7 of that memorandum the powers of the Commonwealth, with regard to the establishment of a Bureau of Agriculture, are capably summarized as follows:--. </para>
                <para>Moreover, the power to organize such a Department is incidental to the grant of the various specific powers under the Constitution. Under section 51, sub-section (i.), Parliament under its powers of trade and commerce may appoint officers to inspect both imports and exports of agricultural products and stock. Under subsection (iii.), Parliament may grant bounties on the production or export of goods, and accordingly may appoint expert officers to give advice as to the growth and production of various agricultural and pastoral products. In pursuance of the power to deal with Quarantine (sub-section ix.), expert officers must of necessity be appointed. Under its Navigation law, the Commonwealth -may make provision for the regulation of the carriage of stock, and may also. deal with other matters of a similar nature. The power to deal with meteorology includes the power to furnish special reports for the use of those engaged in the primary industries (subsection viii.); and under. the Post and Telegraph and Telephone Services (sub-section v.) the means of distributing this information are under the control of Parliament. Moreover, in the power to deal with mail contracts the Commonwealth may make provision for such matters as cold storage. The officers appointed to the Statistical Department (sub-section xi.) may collect information dealing with production and land settlement; and under sub-section (xxvii.) the power to deal with immigration implies the power to collect and furnish all such information of the industries of Australia as may be of assistance to induce immigrants to come to Australia. The power to leal with External Affairs (sub-section xxix.) enables the Commonwealth to appoint agents abroad who may act on behalf of the primary producers of the Commonwealth. Moreover, in connexion with the power to deal with Customs and Excise, necessary officers may be appointed to furnish such advice and information as may be required. Finally, the Commonwealth has complete power to legislate for territories under its control. </para>
                <para>Possessed of all these different powers, the Commonwealth may organize the members of the Public Service into a department and utilize their services on behalf of those engaged in the primary industries of Australia. </para>
                <para class="block">I agree with that summary of our incidental powers, and I invite honorable members to closely examine the Bill, and they will find it does no more than cover these. Even adopting the argument of the honorable member for Bendigo, that we are confined to the powers within section 51, the enumerated incidental powers, to which I have referred make it quite clear that the proposed functions to be delegated to the Bureau of Agriculture are all incidental powers to the enumerated powers given to the Commonwealth by section 51. I hope I have made it clear to honorable members that there are two answers to the contention of the honorable member for Bendigo. Firstly, our general power of appropriation; secondly, under section 51, the incidental powers to the enumerated powers set forth under that section. </para>

                        <para>- I shall come to that later. I understand the contention of the honorable member for Kooyong to be this: that if we pass a Bill for a cer tain purpose, we are entitled to appropriate moneys to carry out that purpose. That is to say, we have full powers of appropriation. If the contention of the honorable member is correct, then there was no need for the late Government to bring down their referenda proposals, because all that was sought to <inline font-style="italic">be</inline> done under their Bills could have been done without any amendment of the Constitution, and we could have made the necessary appropriation to carry them out. As for the maternity bonus, it is recognised that we had the power to give away the&#163;5 for a specific purpose; but the weakness of the matter was that we had no power to deal with the details of it. I did not hear what the honorable member for Bendigo said, but, as he is most cautious in giving opinions, I have no doubt that he had good reasons for what he said, and that what he said was right. </para>

                        <para>-I can understand his taking up that attitude towards such a subtle matter, but the honorable member for Kooyong left the impression that he had stated clearly that the Bill before us was unconstitutional. However, I did not rise to deal with that question. Honorable members opposite profess to  be  very anxious to have this Bill passed; more particularly the honorable member for Wimmera ; yet when the honorable member rose to speak, the first words  he  uttered were to regret that the Government had not consulted the States, and later on he regretted that the States had not been taken into the confidence of the Government. He also mentioned a number of things upon which the States should have been consulted. If one-tenth of what the honorable member for Wimmera said is correct, the Bill should not pass; but I am not prepared to go as far as the honorable member. I think such a Bill as this should be of considerable value to the people of the Commonwealth. In a country like Australia  we  cannot have too much research. Another &#34; farmer&#39;s representative,&#34; the honorable member for Kooyong, said that the agricultural industry was probably of more importance than any other; but there are other industries which seemed to be brushed aside by farmers&#39; representatives - big industries which the Bill will benefit very materially, and which are just as important as agriculture. I refer particularly to the cattle and sheep industries. Research work is necessary for those industries. While I admit that agriculture is of very great importance, the cattle and sheep business is also important, if not in one sense, more important. </para>

                        <para>- Those figures show the importance of the pastoral industry. A good deal of research work is required in connexion with&#39; cattle, notably as to tick and other diseases, while the sheep fly, and other troubles that affect sheep should be inquired into. Coming down to bedrock, agriculture is the most important because the cities could not exist without it. I regret that the honorable member for Wimmera did not allow this Bill to pass this morning. It should have been through by now, if honorable members had really desired to pass it. It  has merely been thrown on the table of the House with a sort of intimation to honorable members that they can have a good time with it. If that is the idea that the Government have of dealing with this very important measure, it is a very wrong one. The way the Department of Agriculture in the &#34;United States is carried on sets an example to the world. I have seen a number of the specimen copies and little packets of seeds that they send out to Australia. All they require from whoever gets a packet is a little note to say how he succeeded in the production of the plants. They keep, I understand, an accurate record of results. To show how important this Department of Research is, or what is thought of it in other countries, I may mention that when travelling, I met a doctor who had been out in Australia for some considerable time. While here, he collected no less than 23,000 different specimens of Australian insects- bugs, as the Americans call them - for scientific purposes. We have done nothing of that kind in Australia. Many other countries have better collections of Australian specimens of this kind than we have ourselves. All these things will have a very material effect upon future developments in relation to pests. In the circumstances, this Department, if properly carried on, can be of great benefit throughout Australia, but . I deprecate very much this attempt to belittle what is being done on many of our agricultural farms and colleges. They are doing  splendid work, and I should regret it very much if this Bill were to interfere with them to any extent. I do not know whether the different institutions are going to be allowed to overlap. If so, it will not be a good thing. There may be some matter that affects the whole of the States, and, in such circumstances, it would probably be best to have it investigated by the Federal authorities. There are conditions in Queensland, particularly North Queensland, that are totally different from those in other parts of Australia. That work would be better done locally than we could ever hope to do it in Melbourne, or at the Federal Capital. It is only of late years that the fly among sheep in Queensland has become so bad. A few years ago it was never heard of. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; but it was never known before in Queensland. It is not so bad in North Queensland as it is in the southern part of that State or in New South Wales and Victoria. We know the damage the tick pest caused a few years ago, and now we are led to believe that, after all, it is not the tick, but a parasite on the tick, that caused all the red water and other trouble which led to the loss of so many cattle in the northern part of Queensland at that time. These are things that can be inquired into. It was known for years before we had any real disease that the tick existed in the Northern Territory. Look at the amount of money spent in Queensland on the tick business. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pound</inline> is still retained there in connexion with that and other matters. </para>

                        <para>- He is one of the best. To show the amount of money spent in relation to tick, a Commissioner was sent to Texas and other parts of America and to Africa in order to try to find a remedy. It might be Letter for the Commonwealth to undertake all that sort of work, which should be done on the spot if possible. Another subject for investigation is the grub which appears in the cane in Queensland. I do not think it has been found even in the northern portion of New South Wales, and certainly not to any great extent in the southern part of Queensland. The bureau can do good work, especially where specific conditions require special inquiry. That work can be better done on the spot than from any central office. I hope, whatever is done in relation to the Bureau of Agriculture, that it will not be confined merely to experiment* in the central office, because, if it is, it will be of very little use. No doubt a kind of museum of specimens will be kept in the central office. </para>

                        <para>- That is the difficulty we are going to experience here, not merely because the trained expert cannot be obtained for one particular branch, but owing to the fact that the Australian climate varies from the tropic down to the temperate zone. AH these climatic and geological variations have a tendency to affect stock or plant life in different ways. We must be very careful in the circumstances; but the Bill will involve the expenditure of a large sum of money. </para>

                        <para>- When the honorable member reads his speech to-morrow, he will very much regret that he ever made it, because that is undoubtedly the only interpretation that could be put on it. The Bill is a good and wise one, and when it is put into force I trust that the Government of the day will not stint the expenditure of money required for experts. We cannot have too many of them, and we should get the best we possibly can. If we are not prepared to do that, we should not go on with the Bill. I am sure that we shall always be prepared to pay a decent remuneration to those who are likely to serve the Commonwealth in this direction. </para>

                    <para>.- One would naturally expect that an Administration which from many public platforms has declared that it intends to restore responsible government and to institute a <inline font-style="italic">regime</inline> of sober finance would be prepared to put before us some facts as to the probable cost of the Bureau of Agriculture which they propose to establish. We find, however, that they are not ready to do so. Can the Minister of Trade and Customs, by way of interjection, tell us now, within&#163;50,000, what expenditure the passing of this Bill will involve? The honorable gentleman remains silent. I suppose that, since he has a number of farmers in his electorate, he thinks it will be useful for him to be able to say that he was instrumental in the passing of a Bill to provide for a National Bureau of Agriculture. Before long, however, the farming, as well as every other section of the community, will pay greater attention to the question of high finance. We are too ready to spend millions of money without due regard to the taxpayers&#39; interest. </para>

                        <para>- Everything depends on whether or not the services to be supplied by the bureau are already being given to the people by State Departments. When I asked the Minister whether State services would not be duplicated he answered that my question was based upon inaccurate information. He has told us that we shall want only three or four experts; but, if I may adopt the language of the Prime Minister, I think there has been too much shuffling on his part. A paper which he presented to the House shows that the cost of the United States Bureau of Agriculture in 1905-6 was &#163;1,435,198. </para>

                        <para>- It is most inspiring to read of the achievements of United States statesmen in various Departments, but we are entitled to have something like reasonable information as to the expenditure to which we shall commit the country if we pass this measure. The Bill having become law, the Government may appoint a scientist to organize the bureau, and, no doubt, he will not have very much regard to the question of cost. Most scientists are so wrapped up in their work that money with them is quite a secondary consideration. On the other hand, the Government may obtain the services of a man who is not so much a scientist as a financial expert, and the Prime Minister may tell him that all that is necessary at present is to appoint a couple of experts - one to deal with the prickly pear pest, and the other with bitter pit. But the bureau, having once been established, it will not be long before numerous appointments are made, and we shall find ourselves face to face with an expenditure of probably &#163;100,000 per annum in connexion with it. In reply to the Minister&#39;s statement that I was wrong in asserting that the Federal Bureau would duplicate work now being carried out by the State Departments, I would point out that in an official memorandum issued by him we have the statement - </para>

                        <para>- With characteristic obstinacy, the Prime Minister insists upon having his own way. I think it necessary to point out that he is proposing under this Bill to override the States, and really to bring about the unification of various governmental powers in Australia. In his official memorandum, the Minister of Trade and Customs refers to the desirableness of establishing experimental stations. I read only the other day a comprehensive account of the various experimental farms in Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland. The Minister of Trade and Customs has told us that he is going to have four experts attached to the bureau. </para>

He tells us in his report that the direct control of the experimental stations already existing must be retained by the States, but that the Federal officers can co-operate&#34; with the officers- in charge of experimental stations in order to carry out any further or special experiments that, from a national stand-point, may be necessary. He goes, on to say that the &#34; co-ordination of work and the prevention of unnecessary duplication might also be effected&#39;.&#34; &#34; Coordination of work &#34; is a very fine phrase ; it is nearly as good as that &#39; &#39; blessed word Mesopotamia.&#34; It seems to be al-  most  admitted that there will be  duplication.

Honorable members seem to forget that a State like New South Wales or Queensland comprises a territory larger than that of some of the European States; indeed, I believe that New South Wales is larger than Germany. Yet, because in New South Wales there are only 1,250,000 people, and in Queensland about 600,000, there seems to be an idea that those States are not worthy of our consideration. These States are too big and important to have their interests overlooked by this Parliament; and we have to be very careful in our relations with them. </para>

                        <para>.- The conduct of the Minister of Trade and Customs reminds me of a man I once saw on a show ground in Queensland, who, after apparently dropping three sovereigns into a purse, offered to sell the purse and its contents for &#163;1. When, however, the unfortunate purchaser examined the purse in a quiet spot, he found that it contained only three coppers. The little  lecturette  which the vendor gave was pure bluff, and so I regard the observations of the Minister on this Bill. Honorable members may look in the Prime Minister&#39;s dictionary for a definition of &#34;bluff.&#34; The Prime Minister, who, apparently, has not given due consideration to the measure, has told us that we shall require four experts for this bureau, men of the highest and best brains, to conduct the research work. I have pointed out that the States are spending well on to &#163;500,000 per annum on their Departments of  Agriculture; and now the Unificationist Prime Minister introduces a proposal for a bureau for the acquisition and diffusion amongst the people of the Commonwealth of information connected with agriculture, dairying, horticulture, viticulture, live-stock breeding, and forestry. The Minister of Trade and Customs has been trying to make the House believe that this is a measure of no consequence, except to establish the nucleus of a Federal Bureau of Agriculture. What can we think of a Minister who can do such a thing? Honorable members from the country, even if they are Liberals, must have some sense of proportion. This bureau is to consist of three or four experts; and yet it has to acquire information for dairy farmers, pastoralists, stock-owners, vignerons, and so forth. </para>

                        <para>- There is a difference, I think, because, while a stock-owner may only have a few head of cattle, a pastoralist is understood to be a squatter king, who has vast flocks and herds, and who, of course, is looked on with great respect by people who have their bump of reverence very largely developed. I dare say there are some people who rather look down on the little stock-owner. And this reminds one of what was said by Walter Besant, when he told us how the poor match-seller, who sold by the box, was despised by society people, but how the man who sold matches by the million was a person of high position, able, I suppose, to acquire a title if he only paid sufficient into the funds of the dominant political party. What does the Attorney-General think of the speech of the Minister of Trade and Customs in introducing this measure ? </para>

                        <para>- Yes; even though there might be duplication. The Minister says that there will be no duplication. Has he then forgotten the work that is being done in the States? Has he forgotten Gatton College, the Kamarunga Nursery, and the education respecting cotton, tobacco, fruit, and cane-growing, the management of stock, and a host of other matters which is given by the Queensland Agricultural Department? Is it not monstrous that the Ministry should use its majority to force through this Bill at the end of the session, to the exclusion of measures of more immediate importance ? </para>

                        <para>- Yes, and a motion condemning the  Speaker.  Is Liberalism going to raise the people from poverty by wasting money in the duplication of services, and employing Commonwealth officials to do what is being well done by State officials? What has the Minister to say against the work that has been done in Queensland ? He represents the Darling Downs, one. of the finest districts in the world. The only fault I find with the district is that it returns him to Parliament. I would have no objection to the proposal if the Government intended to confer with the Governments of the States, to ascertain what branches of this work they are willing to hand over to the. Commonwealth as being better undertaken by the Commonwealth than by the States individually. </para>

                    <para>.- I should not have risen had it not been for some remarks which fell from the honorable member for Capricornia. I understood him to say that the money which will be needed for the proposed Agricultural Bureau should be expended on old-age pensions.&#39; I rise to point out that if we do not make money, we cannot distribute it. The Bill is calculated to help to increase production, and thus to make more money available for old-age pensioners. The time is arriving when we shall have to seriously consider our financial position. We cannot go on distributing money as we are doing if we do not increase our production. The proposed bureau is eminently calculated to assist in the increase of production. Five years ago the exports of Australia exceeded the imports by oyer&#163;25,000,000, but last year the excess was only a little under &#163;817,000. We cannot allow this diminution of exports to continue, especially in view of the fact that we have to pay nearly&#163;12,000,000 a year in interest. Should our exports continue to diminish, we shall land ourselves in grave financial difficulties, and when an honorable member wishes to divert money from the producing interests, it is time that a protest was raised. Surely, we all are in favour of maintaining our present standard of living, but to do that we must increase our production. According to the New South Wales Government Statistician, the railways of the State, which are its biggest earning Department, return only 4&#189; per cent., and the State Treasurer recently borrowed&#163;2,000,000 at a little over 4¾ per cent., the actual cost to the State being &#163;5 2s. 6d. per cent., the highest rate of interest paid for forty years. It is impossible to maintain the present high standard of living when we are borrowing money at a rate of interest which even our most productive lines will not return; and when so much money is being diverted to lines which are nonproductive the danger is increased. </para>

                        <para>- New South Wales has been borrowing at an exorbitant rate of interest, mainly because the financiers of the world do not hold the Government of that State in sufficient esteem to lend them money at a reasonable rate. But that is not the point. I have said that our most productive spheres for the expenditure of public moneys are railways, but, in New South Wales, these are not returning more than 4&#189; per cent.; and, seeing that a great proportion of the money we have borrowed is spent upon nonproductive lines, those that are productive must be called upon to pay 9 per cent. The honorable member for Capricornia now tells us that he wishes to divert money from a productive source and spend it upon things that are nonproductive; but I would point out that, unless we go on spending our money on  works which are productive, and so in- creasing the produce of the Commonwealth, it will be impossible to keep up our old-age pensions, our defence system and our high standard of living. It is time honorable members opposite looked the financial position squarely in the face. It is beyond all reason to think that we can go on borrowing money, and put it into non-productive channels, at the same time maintaining our high standard of living. If the honorable member for Capricornia wishes to endanger the defence system, old-age pensions, and our present high standard of living, he is going the right way about it. It is high time some of us went upon the platforms of the country and pointed out exactly where this sort of expenditure is going to lead us. </para>

                        <para>- There would certainly be no harm in asking the States to co-operate with us, but I believe that the interests of the Commonwealth are paramount over those of the States. I am not ashamed to state my view upon this matter, and even if I am called a Unificationist it does not hurt me, be cause I believe, as all true Australians must believe, that the interests of the Commonwealth are paramount over the interests of the States. However, let; me say, in conclusion, that if honorable members urge the Government to divert money from productive works, and use it in non-productive channels, there will be grave danger to things they support or pretend to support, and that it is absolutely impossible to carry on at the present rate if they wish to maintain the present high standard of living. </para>

                    <para>.-I would not have spoken had it not been for one statement made by the honorable member which I desire to correct. I quite favour the establishment of this bureau; but, at the same time, I agree with the attitude taken up by the honorable member for Capricornia that, before this measure is put into operation, there should be some understanding with the different States. We all realize that the States have pursued this matter of agricultural research for a number of years past, and it would not be wise to have a clashing of interests. Both the Commonwealth and State Parliaments have certain provinces to which they can adhere. The States have already directed their attention to certain lines of research, and we should not do anything to clash with their work. In this way we can minimize expenditure. But if we are to maintain a Federal Department doing work already attaching to the State Departments, there will be a duplication of expense which the taxpayers, whether they be State taxpayers or Federal taxpayers, must bear. Duplication of effort should be unnecessary. The honorable member for Robertson made it appear that by going on as we are the old-age pensions and the defence system are likely to be endangered. He pointed out that the Government of New South Wales have borrowed money for what he termed unproductive works, and he said that they had borrowed &#163;2,000,000 at 4¾ per cent., which, after paying all expenses of brokerage, and so on, really meant &#163;5 2s. 6d. per &#163;100; but the statement of the honorable member that the high rate of interest was due to the financial world not having a sufficiently high opinion of the present New South Wales Government is absolutely without foundation, because the rate of interest has gone up everywhere. The Treasurer of New South Wales was able to make a statement recently, in which he showed that he was able to borrow money cheaper than the Treasurers of other States where there were Liberal Governments in power. The honorable member&#39;s statement that the Government of New South Wales had increased the cost of the railway system by having to pay a higher rate of interest is absolutely without foundation. If the railways in New South Wales return 4&#189; per cent. over working expenses, and more than that has to be paid in the shape of interest on the money borrowed, the honorable member has only two courses to advocate - either to cease the work of building railways to develop the country, or to cease borrowing. But, as the honorable member is in favour of borrowing money, he must pay a high rate of interest, because he could not get it at any cheaper rate than the New South Wales Government are now paying. So there is no room for complaint upon the part of the honorable member. I agree with him that it would be better to have increased exports; but the Bill before us has no bearing on the matter of exports, except that it makes provision for dealing with pests, and improving seed, and other matters affecting agricultural pursuits. </para>

                        <para>- In that way the Bill will be a benefit, and for that reason we approve of it; but to bring in the matter of New South Wales borrowing money, and to endeavour to make the people believe that we are paying more interest because of a Labour Government being in power in New South Wales, is all beside the question. As a matter of fact, the Government of New South Wales are getting their money on better conditions than any other State. I am in accord with the Bill; but I hope that the Government of the day will consult with the different States before putting it into operation, in order to ascertain what is being done in certain directions, and thus avoid clashing. We ought to undertake work that is not taken in hand by the different States-work that will be of advantage to Australia. In this way we may, at the close of the session, do something which will meet with the approval of the people generally. The Government will be ill-advised in carrying out work now undertaken by experts in the States, thereby increasing the expenditure and quite unnecessarily duplicating the number of people engaged in this work. According to the Commonwealth official statistics issued by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs,</inline> thenumber of sheep in 1911 was 93,000,000. Though the number in 1912 fell to 83,000,000, we still maintained the same export; we practically maintained the number of sheep exported, though we had a reduction of no less than 10,000,000 sheep during the year. I merely rose to answer the honorable member. Railway construction is beneficial. The people in the country desire that we should develop it, and in that way bring population ; and we cannot carry out railway construction unless the money is borrowed on the best terms available on the money market at the time; the rates upon the railways being fixed in order to get sufficient return to recoup the cost of borrowing and the working of the lines. To that extent the Government of New South Wales have been very successful. I understand that the average rate of interest is not much over &#163;3 15s. per &#163;100, while, according to the honorable member himself, the railways return 4&#189; per cent. over working expenses. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable member for Robertson must know that rates of interest are not governed by New South Wales or Australia. A man may sometimes be so saturated with prejudice that he may say something that is dangerous to the well-being of the country. The rates of interest all the world over depend on the acuteness of the demand for money. At present there is a demand everywhere for money. Those countries which were at war have come into the market, and they are now in New York trying to borrow, and they are willing to pay 6 per cent, or 7 per cent. Brazil wants $60,000,000, the Argentine is in the market, Canada is also still in the market trying to borrow for the extension of the grand trunk railway to the north of the Dominion. The result is that these countries are paying 5 per cent. In fact, the other day Japan was paying 6 per cent. in New York, and China pays 6&#189; per cent. I have just picked up a copy of the <inline font-style="italic">New York American,</inline> in which I find the following in regard to the money rates governing the national exchange of the world - </para>

                    <para>.- I can assure the honorable member for Darwin that we are not decrying our States. It is not the intention of the Government to give effect to this measure without first consulting the States. This is a very important matter. If we did not want it passed it would not be on the business-paper. We are not in the habit of putting up placards for the people. We are in the habit of submitting legislation to this House in order to have it passed. The honorable member for Hunter had placed in his hands by the Leader of the Opposition a little booklet, marked at a particular page. That was right enough. I have no objection to the use of statistics in this matter, but they should be used in a logical way. I understand that the interpretation placed upon the decrease in sheep was that it was caused by the drought and other things. The decrease was not due solely to the drought. It was due to the phenomenal export of lambs for that particular year. Every one knows that when you over-export your lambs you naturally reduce the number of sheep in the Commonwealth. That is borne out in the next column of the same page - page 31 - with regard to the production of wool. While the actual number of sheep in the Commonwealth had decreased by 10,000,000, the actual decrease in the wool export was&#163;33,000,000, or only&#163;3 per sheep. It must, therefore, be evident that the greater cause of the decrease of the number of sheep is the export of lambs, which were never shorn at all. Statistics show that the value of lamb and mutton exported increased in that particular year. </para>

                        <para>.- I think this group of Bills relating to referendum proposals has been discussed, as a whole, on one or two occasions, because they all refer to alterations of the Constitution to enable this Parliament to deal with certain matters with which, under the decisions and guidance of the High Court, we are declared, to be incapable of dealing at the present time. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The Constitution has, in the main, worked fairly well. When the contest between the Bill-&#34;ites&#34; and the antiBill&#34;ites&#34; was going on before the Constitution was put to the people, after being approved by most of the Parliaments, each side put its views strenuously. The Bill-&#34;ites&#34; regarded the &#187; Constitution as so good that it ought not to be defeated. The anti-Bill-&#34;ites&#34; thought it far better to wait for a more comprehensive measure, which would give the Federal Parliament sufficient powers to protect the whole people. . I took the  view that the Bill was too good to be set aside, and against the wishes of the majority of my own party, I took the platform in favour of its acceptance. In our own State, by the aid of the gold-fields, and especially of the north, we were able to carry the affirmative. The States as a whole carried the Bill in the affirmative, and the affirmative vote,( in the main, was given because the Bil&#39;, contained a provision enabling the people to amend, the Constitution as they thought fit from time to time. That provision has been put into effect three or four times. On the first occasion it was used for merely a nominal amendment of the Constitution, which was approved of. On the second occasion the proposal was for the acceptance of the Fusion&#39;s Financial Agreement, which was defeated. It was put into operation for the third time id 1911,  when  the Labour Government appealed to the people to give the Commonwealth Parliament larger powers to make laws with respect to trade and commerce, corporations, industrial matters, railway disputes, trusts, and the nationalization of monopolies. The six proposals were embodied in two measures, and only two questions had therefore to be answered by the people. The voting on that occasion was as follows: - Constitution Alteration (Legislative Powers) Bill 1910: For, 483,356; against, 742,704; or 39.42 per cent, for the Bill, and 60.58 per cent, against it. Constitution Alteration (Monopolies) Bill 1910: For, 488,668 against, 736,392, or 39.89 per cent, for, and 60.11 against. It will be seen that, on that occasion, there was an enormous majority against both of these proposals. Believing, however, that they were in the best interests of the people,&#39; the Government decided in 1912 that they should again be submitted to the electors. The present Prime Minister and members of his party declared that it was &#34; a piece of cheek&#34; on our part to propose to re-submit to the people questions that had been turned down by such a large majority less than two years before. Notwithstanding their criticism, we submitted them at the last general election, and the voting upon them, as shown on pages 39 and 40 of the <inline font-style="italic">Statistical Returns</inline> presented to the House on 24th September last, was as follows : - Constitution Alteration (Trade and Commerce) Bill 1912: For, 958,419; against, 982,615; or 49.38 per cent, for, and 50.62 per cent, against the Bill. Constitution Alteration (Corporations) Bill 1912 : 960,711 for; against, 986,824; or 49.33 per cent, for the Bill, and 50.67 per cent, against it. Constitution Alteration (Industrial Matters) Bill 1912 : For, 961,601 ; against. 987,611; or 49.33 per cent, for, and 50.67 per cent, against. Constitution Alteration (Railway Disputes) Bill 1912: For, 956,358; against, 990,046; or 49.13 per cent, for, and 50.87 per cent, against the Bill.

                            <para>- The honorable member for Wannon is misinformed about something he has gathered -from some irresponsible source, which has nothing to do with the point now under consideration. A question of this kind must always be a national one, and need not necessarily be made a party matter. The proposals which we made were not at all popular. Had the present Government been in power - the so-called Liberal Government - it would have taken care not to put before the country any unpopular proposal. The business of the Fusionists is to try to find out first of all what the people are most likely to accept, and then to go as near as possible to giving them what they want, regardless of whether or not it is right. That, however, is not the attitude of a party which has the true welfare of the country at heart. Our determination is to put the right thing before the people, regardless of whether or not it be popular. But for that, we should not be here. We are here, not because we advocate popular things, but because we advocate that which is right. And thus, although our proposals were turned down by a majority of something like 250,000 votes at the referendum in 1911, we submitted them again in May last. I come now to the honorable member&#39;s point. </para>

                            <para>- Such arrogant assertions are hardly worthy of notice. Let me give the honorable member an actual fact in answer to his mere assertion. I was at Port Said when the result qf the first referendum reached me. The exact figures were put before me, and I was asked by a representative of Reuter&#39;s what I had to say in regard to them. I replied at once that the questions we had submitted were of national importance, designed to conserve the interests of the people, and that it would, therefore, be the duty of the Government to put them as often as possible, whether  they  were popular or not, until they were carried. That statement of mine was published at the time, so that the honorable member will see that it was with us a question, not of popularity, but of doing the right thing. Had the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Parkes and one or two other stalwart men of his day been deterred from carrying on the campaign for Federation by the sneers and gibes in which many indulged as to the reasons which influenced their action, there would have been no Federation to-day, and the same jeers and . sneers will be indulged in at the expense of those who try to enlarge the powers of the National Parliament, so that the interests of the people may be conserved.&#39; When the Federal Constitution was drafted, there was no thought of trusts, combines, and monopolies ruling the great republic of America. When the people of Canada asked the British Parliament for a Constitution of their own, did th-3y appeal for a Constitution like that of the United States of America ? They did not. The preamble of their Act asked that they should be given a Constitution as nearly allied to that of Great Britain as possible; and this was done in the light of experience of both forms of government. Unfortunately, we commenced the campaign for a Federal Constitution for Australia at a time when the cry of triumphant Democracy in America was very popular; and we fell into the error of choosing the Constitution of the United States of America as a model. Our Constitution has, in my opinion, been a partial failure from the first, and it has failed precisely where it is most allied to the American system. The United. States Constitution is a monument to the intellectual ability of the men who framed it. At that time, however, who could have said that a person living in one part of the world would be able to dictate the business of another part at the antipodes? It was then absolutely impossible. At that time the means of transport and communication were little better than in the time of the Phoenicians. Travel by sea was possible only on small sailing craft driven by the wind, and on land there were only the fleetest horses. What is the position to-day ? A man may sit in a room in America, Europe, or Asia, and control great industrial and commercial concerns by the touch of a button, and his servants obey his will just as directly as if they were in the same room. It is by this means that trusts, combines, and monopolies are able to do great injury, and to practically rob the people, while under our Constitution, we, as a National Parliament, have no means of prevention. The Attorney-General and others will tell us that the States have sovereign powers, and can deal with these matters. </para>

                            <para>- I am not defending anything of that kind. I take it that any man holding the views expressed, and, I believe, still held, by the Attorney-General, must be prepared to support certain alterations in the Constitution. I am one who places no limit on the extent of the alterations that can be made. I do not think a democratic people need be afraid of the National Parliament - a Parliament which stands alone on this great continent as a reflex of the will of the people. In every State the Upper House is either a nominee House or one elected on a privileged franchise; and how any one calling himself a Democrat can tolerate such a state of affairs I cannot understand. Yet the one Parliament, which must be a reflex of the opinions of the people, is shorn of the powers necessary to protect those who brought it into existence, and who have from time to time to elect it. Let me deal with the arguments that have been used by our opponents as against the Labour party who are practically the originators of the extension of the powers of the Commonwealth. The opposition was not to the enlargement of  the powers of the Commonwealth; the argument was one of prejudice, and consisted in the contention that the powers were asked for by the Labour party for the purposes of the Labour party only. At the same time, our opponents knew that the appeal, if successful, would still leave in the hands of the electors the determination, from time to time, of the policy to be carried out by the Government and the Parliament. If the people returned members who were opposed to the exercise of the larger powers, then the policy they represented would prevail; on the other hand, if members were returned favorable to the larger powers, the will of the people would be observed. I direct attention to the fact that for the last five years this Parliament has been passing legislation approved, some of it, by the people at the general election, and yet that legislation has been declared unconstitutional by the High Court. I am not complaining of the action of the High Court in interpreting the Constitution as they find it. It is its duty to interpret the Constitution, and it is our duty to accept its decisions; but we should avail ourselves of every opportunity presented to amend the Constitution in a proper way. I cannot hope to be successful in asking the Attorney-General and the Government to pass these Bills this session, and to submit them to the people at the earliest convenient date. I do not think the Government are likely to accede to such a request; but, at the same time, it would not, I think be a. serious departure from even the principles of responsible government if they were bo debate, and&#39; even alter, if they chose, propositions of the kind submitted from either side of the House. I understood, from a personal remark made by the Prime Minister across the table, when the House was sitting the other night, that he is not favorable even to a vote being taken on these Bills. I do not know why. </para>

                            <para>-Most of the machinery that is necessary to ameliorate the conditions of the workers, to protect the employer, and to prevent the people being despoiled by trusts, monopolies, and combines is withheld from us in the absence of the necessary power in the Constitution. Have honorable members read the statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins the other day in regard to the difficulty of getting a common rule for the protection of workmen? The learned Judge pointed out that Victoria alone, of all the States, has no Workmen&#39;s Compensation Act, and, shrewd jurist as he is, he finds this an obstacle in allotting the value of labour. A builder&#39;s labourer, for instance, is subject to the same risks in Victoria as a builder&#39;s labourer in New South Wales, but in the latter State, if he meets with an accident or a fatality, compensation is awarded under Act of Parliament. In Victoria there is no compensation. </para>

                            <para>- The point is that Victoria is the only State in Australia that has not had, until recently, a Labour Ministry. South Australia took the lead in this regard, and in Queensland, where there was the first Labour Government in Australia, a&#39; Workmen&#39;s Compensation Act was passed. This shows clearly that the protection of the toiling masses, and even of the employer and the capitalist, is better looked after under a Labour form of government than under any other form. </para>

                            <para>- As I explained earlier in my speech, it is a characteristic of Liberalism to put all its goods in the window - to display anything likely to attract a vote - but matters are very different when the time for action arrives. How can a party which has enjoyed the sympathy, support, and smiles of trusts and combines - which has employed their munificent gifts for party purposes - afford to attack those organizations here? I am not speaking of what I do not know. Have honorable members read the evidence given by the Queensland Premier,. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Denham,</inline> in the course of a defamation case in the Brisbane Courts? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Denham</inline> there said that he had received &#163;2,000 from nowhere in particular as a contribution to the Liberal funds used in fighting the referenda proposals, and that &#163;2,000 more, with other donations, was promised conditionally. Are honorable members aware that the receipt acknowledging this gift, donation, or windfall, was drawn up in such a way as to conceal the identity of the donors? Are they aware that these funds were used, and I presume rightly used, for party purposes - to defeat the referenda ? On that occasion money was poured out like water to prevent a national Parliament having national powers. But nothing in the world can stop this movement - nothing in the world can prevent an enlightened democracy from granting those powers as soon as the proposals are laid before the country. Every day, or at least every month, there is fresh evidence of the need of larger powers; and the sooner they are conferred the better it will be for us all. </para>

                    <para class="block">Council decisions in regard to the powers we have to deal with monopolies. What the legal position is I do not know, and I do not know that the Attorney-General knows. I have had the privilege of consulting Attorneys-General, and the permanent officials of the Department, and I know that they do not know, or, if they know anything, it is that they do not know, although it is their business to enlighten laymen like myself as to the legal position of the Commonwealth. Nobody knows what our powers are. But should we not know ? If the country is in danger, should we allow any doubt to exist as to whether we have the right weapon with which to protect it? Every one admits that trusts, monopolies, and combines are here, and are doing injury to the people, and that this Parliament cannot protect the country. Should there be any quibbling as to whether this, that, or the other thing is the law, when it is within the power of the people to make the law clear and definite ? No one has expounded the position better than the Attorney-General, who has said that, if all the States joined together, they could not, because of their divisional boundaries, deal with trusts and combines. Under the chequer board system of government, it is easy for the rogue to prosper, and difficult for the honest man to exist. As it is not possible to have a discussion on each of these measures separately, I should like to move the second reading of all these Bills in one motion. </para>

I told my electors that I considered the carrying of the referenda proposals more important than my return for Wide Bay, and I say now that it would be better for the people of Australia that these Bills should become law, to give to this Parliament the constitutional powers that it should have, than that we should all be returned after the next elections. </para>

                        <para>.- In seconding the motion of the Leader of the Opposition for the second reading of these Bills, <inline font-style="italic">in globo,</inline> I am reminded of a worthy citizen who, at a church meeting, said, &#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> before I vote for this motion, I want to know who this <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Globo</inline> is.&#34; I express my regret that to these six measures for the alteration of the Constitution there has not been added a seventh, to give to the people the referendum and initiative. No other country in the world is . so Democratic as Australia. Even the Conservatives on the other side have advanced beyond the English ideas of conservatism. If we had the referendum and initiative, the six Bills now before us would not be necessary. I speak with knowledge, because I have lectured on the referendum since 1891, when I say that, if the people had the power, as in Switzerland, where 1 per cent. may set this machinery in motion, or in regard to an alteration of the Constitution,1 per cent., there would be legislation dealing with trusts. As I told a gentleman acting for the Standard Oil Trust of America, &#34; You may boast that you can buy the Parliament of Australia, but even if you could command a majority here, you could not buy the whole nation. That is what the Australian franchise means.&#34; The progress of the referendum idea in the Great American Republic is something unique. Last year, 12,000,000 persons voted for it. Ohio, where the population is 4,726,000, voted for it in September last; Washington, with a population of 1,141,000, in November; and it has been carried also by Nebraska, with a population of 1,192,000; Idaho, with a population of 325,000; Wyoming, with a population of 145,000; Wisconsin, with a population of 2,333,000; Nevada, with a population of 81,000; and Indiana, with a population of 2,700,000. This question can be approached without party bias. The greatest political minds in Great Britain within the last thirty years - the great Gladstone and the Marquis of Salisbury, the Conservative leader of Great Britain - supported the referendum ;  and in America it has been supported by William Jennings Bryan, Woodrow Wilson, the  President  of the United States of America, and ex-President Theodore Roosevelt. Over110 different cities have the referendum and the initiative, and&#39; many of them have the recall. The States that have the recall, which is the logical outcome of the referendum and the initiative - the power of the people to recall a Parliament, a Ministry, a member, and even a Judge acting against their wishes - are Arizona, Seattle, Los Angeles, Maine, Minnesota, Oregon, and Pennsylvania. The last-named State adopted the recall in 1776. If we had the initiative and referendum there would be no need for these Bills. The voting on the two occasions on which these proposals have been submitted to the people of the Commonwealth show that they will be carried on the third submission. It is no strange thing in the political history of Switzerland to have even a democratic measure refused - sometimes two, three, and, in one case, five times; but ultimately the people will have their way. In reply to the statement that the referendum might do injury, I cannot do better than quote the words of the wise old boatman of Lucerne, who, when asked a question by the Minister representing the United States of America at Berne, said &#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, if</inline> a King or an autocrat governs a country, he will govern it for the benefit of himself, his family, and his immediate surroundings. If an oligarchy governs a country, its members will govern it for the benefit of themselves, their families, and their surroundings. But if a Democracy governs a country such as Switzerland, which has the right of altering or amending its Constitution at any time, even should that Democracy pass a law injurious to a community, the effect would soon be understood, because the community would suffer, and, having the power to reverse what it had done, it would quickly use it. </para>

If he objects to the referendum, let him vote against it. But while it is a plank in the platform of the Labour party it is the duty of honorable members to try to make it the law. I hope the Governmentwill follow the lead of Democracy in this regard, and bring in the necessary measure. If they do so, it will come down to a practically unanimous House, and be adopted immediately. I appeal to the Attorney- General. In the past we have had many fights, and I have not the slightest doubt he has memories of political warfare that he regrets, just as I have; but he knows that the Government live simply on one vote. If they have regard to the &#34; shadow before,&#34; the result of the recent elections in New South Wales must show them how insecure their tenure is. Therefore, why cannot they follow the trend of democratic thought, and bring in a big measure like this. They would thus enable both sides of the House to share in the eulogium that must follow the passing of it, and show the people outside, who send us here and pay our stipends, what splendid work can be done by a Parliament combined in one great democratic line of thought. If the Government are wise - I do not say if they desire to dish the other side, to use Disraeli&#39;s expression - they will have the support of the strongest fighting journal we have in Victoria, which, after many years, has been converted to this view, and they will also have the support of every Democrat in Australia; and why they are timid about touching the matter I do not know. At all events, I hope they will consider it during the recess, and if, after mature consideration, they think it right that the people of Australia should have the power of controlling legislation introduced in this Parliament, they will be wise in introducing the referendum and initiative. But if they do not, and during the recess from any cause one of their supporters should lose his seat, and another party should come into power, they will have lost a glorious opportunity, just as the Attorney-General, when he had the power to curtail the powers of the Legislative Council in Victoria, failed to grasp that opportunity. He did alter the Constitution of the Upper </para>

If the Government would have sufficient common sense to bring down a Bill, I should welcome it gladly; but if they do not, the people outside will condemn them.

Government stand in their way, will sweep them into the oblivion they deserve. I throw this out simply as a hint in the dying hours of the session. I do not know that there is anything so deserving of inquiry during the long recess as the matter of the initiative and referendum. </para>

The Attorney-General may not know that this man got two members of the Commonwealth Parliament, the two he wanted. When the House sought to compel the Standard Oil Company to tin their kerosene in Australia, the proposal was beaten by two votes. Those two men are out of Parliament to-day, and I am glad of it. I know this as certainly as I know that the Attorney-General has money in his pockets. </para>

                            <para>- I know that the Attorney-General has money in his pockets, although I would not dare to swear it in a witness-box. That is just the difference between certain knowledge and evidence. The learned member who represents Parkes knows that I would not dare to say in a witness-box - though I know it as certainly as I know the Attorney-General has money in his pockets - because I could not prove it, that these two votes were obtained, and the Standard Oil Company got their way without having to buy the Australian Parliament. If the people had the referendum and initiative there would be no Meat Trust here as it is in Queensland to-day. It tried to establish itself in New South Wales, but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Trefle,</inline> the Minister of Agriculture, to his eternal credit be it said, prevented it. What can we do against the wonderful power of the money of these trusts? One thing only. It is possible to use. the money power to buy even a Cabinet. Not for one moment do I think there is the slightest suspicion of it, but it is possible, when we are fighting against millions. It is possible even to sway a majority of this House. But it is not possible to buy the whole of the people. That is why I say we should have the referendum and initiative. The Fiery Cross in the Highlands would be nothing to the cry that would ring through the length and breadth of our land, and there would be no difficulty in getting 45,000 signatures compelling the Government of the day to put a question before the people. If the Government cannot accept the other six suggestions, then let us join and give the people the power of the referendum and initiative. Thus the Government could show that during their tenure of office they were not afraid to trust the people by giving them the power which all democratic thought is wishful the people should have. There are twenty-two States in the United States of America that have this power. If we divide the United States by a line, all the western States but two have it, and on the eastern side six of the older States have it. We have this example, and we can follow also the splendid lead of Switzerland. Therefore, I hope the Government will carry this proposal into law, so that the people may be dominant. </para>

                        <para>.- I desire to confine my remarks to the question of the alteration of the powers of the Commonwealth in regard to industrial matters. During the last election a great deal of stress was laid upon the necessity for industrial peace, and much political capital was made by our opponents, because of the fact that within the previous three years while the Labour Government were in power, there had been a certain amount of industrial strife. The responsibility for the whole of that industrial strife was placed upon the Labour party and upon the Labour Government, whereas the Labour party stand for the best form of industrial legislation - legislation which makes strikes unnecessary. If the absence of that legislation leads to industrial strife, the responsibility does not rest upon the Labour party. There are certain restrictions under the Constitution placed against the Commonwealth Parliament passing the form of industrial legislation we desire. The Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act of 1904 gave the  President  of the Arbitration Court power to make a common rule, but the High Court decided that the section of the Act providing for the common rule was unconstitutional. Nothing would tend more to bring about that industrial peace so ardently advocated by many people as the fact that the Arbitration Court would have power to give effect to a common rule. Unions recognise the great difficulty of approaching the Arbitration Court. It is not a question of bringing three or four employers before the Court. Under the existing Act, in certain industries, it is almost necessary to bring 500 or 600 before the Court. </para>

                            <para>- Under the existing law unions might have to bring anything from 100 to 1,000 employers before the Commonwealth Arbitration Court to get an award. Under the original Act the intention was that if a union took a case to the Court it was only necessary at &#34;first to take there about ten or fifteen employers. Having obtained a decision from the  President  of the Court, the union within a certain time could apply to have the conditions fixed in the original award made the common rule. Once the common rule was brought into operation it practically applied from one end of Australia to the other, to all those persons employed in that particular form of industry; but, as the result of the appeal to the High Court, that section of the Act was declared to be <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires.</inline> Had the Bill dealing with industrial matters submitted to the people at the last election been indorsed by them, this Parliament would have had full power to pass whatever industrial laws it might deem necessary in the interests of industrial peace. During the elections we were accused, as a party, of practically stirring up industrial strife as between employer and employe; but, as a party, I say we stand for industrial peace, although not at any price. We believe that, by bringing into operation a sound form of industrial legislation, industrial peace is possible, but under the hybrid system of industrial legislation operating in Victoria to-day, and even under the system provided for in the Federal Arbitration Act, industrial peace in our community is almost impossible. We were told during the elections that, if the proposals of the. Labour Government, for the alteration of the Constitution, were successful, the Labour party were determined to wipe out of existence the system of Wages Boards now operating in Victoria, a state&#39; ment which was made, not only from the platforms of Liberal candidates, but also by the Victorian press. While we have advocated giving increased powers to the Arbitration Court, we have never, at any time, stated that it was our intention or desire to interfere with the Wages Board system in any way. We recognise that there are many thousands of workers in our community who have received many and great benefits from our different systems of State industrial legislation in operation throughout Australia to-day, but we have to recognise that the tendency of all great industrial organizations is to become Federal in character. While we admit the great benefits given to thousands of workers by the Wages Board system, or by the Arbitration Courts, we say, as a party, that it is impossible for any State Wages Board, or State Arbitration Court, to deal with the conditions of such large Federal organizations as exist in Australia to-day. No State Wages Board can deal with the conditions of the seamen of Australia, or of members of the Australian Workers Union. The same&#39; thing applies to many others employed in manufacturing industries. One of the objects of our Protectionist policy is to protect the manufacturers of Australia against the unfair competition of manufacturers in other parts of the world. Under our Constitution this Parliament has no power to differentiate between State and State. While we bring into operation a system of Protection to put the whole of the manufacturers of Australia on an equal basis of competition, we know that under the State system of industrial legislation it is quite possible for the manufacturers in one State to have an undue advantage over the manufacturers in another State. In these circumstances, when the whole of the manufacturers of Australia are &#60; placed upon an equal basis of protection by the Commonwealth Tariff, it is only right and just that the whole of these manufacturers should be placed upon an equal basis of competition, so far as legislation is concerned. No State form of industrial legislation can place our manufacturers upon an equal basis of competition. Those of us in the industrial movement in Australia to-day say that, if you want industrial peace between the employers and workers, or even satisfaction as between manufacturer and manufacturer throughout Australia, the only possible way to secure them is by adopting an effective Federal system of industrial legislation. Before that system can be obtained, the difficulties that confront the  President  of the existing Arbitration Court must be removed. No one can speak with greater experience regarding those difficulties than the Attorney-General and the honorable member for Bendigo. I remember that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins on one occasion said he had to wade through a Serbonian bog of technicalities in carrying out his duties under our existing legislation. I believe that if it is possible for this Parliament to enact laws that will give the people of Australia industrial peace, we are doing something that will be in the interests of our people as a whole. From the inception of our movement our party has absolutely stood for industrial peace, &#39; but we are not going to have industrial peace unless you give to the bodies that deal with industrial disputes full and absolute power. While I have always advocated the extension of powers to this Parliament with that object in view, it has not been with the intention , as stated by the press of Victoria and by the opponents of the Labour party, of injuring or defeating the State system. It is only so that we can have a form of legislation suitable to deal with the great organizations of labour that we know exist in Australia to-day, and which are absolutely federal in character. Under our State laws - and I speak with some experience, as I have had the honour of sitting on a Wages Board in Victoria for something like twelve years prior to ber  coming a member of this House - our Wages&#34; Boards carry out their duties under many difficulties and restrictions. There is also an Industrial Appeal Court in operation over them. It is rather peculiar that those who are always condemning our party because we are  stirring up industrial strife, and who claim to be advocates of industrial peace, are, on investigation found in our Victorian Assembly and Council voting and using their influence to weaken the form of our industrial legislation. The Wages Boards have not the power that they should have, but that is not the fault of the State Labour party. The Industrial Appeal Court has been the cause of industrial strife, but it also was not brought into operation by the State Labour party. The same thing applies to our National Parliament. We have had  a  Government in power which have utilized all their opportunities and strength to bring into operation a form of legislation to create industrial peace, and not industrial strife. Their object was to allow the workers to approach the Court and obtain satisfactory conditions without being compelled to go on strike. We have been condemned  as a  party for creating industrial strife, and yet any person who goes to the trouble of making inquiries as to our actual attitude and the trend of our movement must, if unbiased, admit that from the very inception of our political movement, for the last twenty-five years, we have been trying to bring about a  form  of industrial legislation that will make it absolutely unnecessary for the workers to strike to better their conditions; yet, when it is a question of appealing to the people to alter the existing Constitution, so as to give the National Parliament additional powers, in order that they may carry that form of legislation, our object in asking for those powers is ignored, and the electors are told that our one object is to maim and wipe out of existence the form of industrial legislation in operation throughout Australia to-day. That is not the true position. We, as a party, desire industrial peace, but industrial peace with honour; and I have consistently urged that the best  Way  for the workers to obtain industrial peace is to approach the different Courts, or Boards, that we have .in operation to-day. I listened with attention to the Attorney-General when he was speaking a few days ago on the question of preference to unionists. I do not know whether the honorable gentleman Has ever given consideration to the fact that practically every decision given in the Federal Conciliation and Arbitration Court to-day gives preference, not to unionists or fair employers, but to the individual who is  prepared to sell his labour under the ruling wage, and to the employer who is always, looking for the lowest form of labour. That is the position under the existing: law, since any decision given by the Court is binding only upon the employers who are respondents in the case, and upon the workers who are members of the claimant organization. The employer who does not employ a union hand is in no way bound by any decision given by the Court. The position is, therefore, that our existing industrial legislation gives preference to the employer who &#34;does not employ union labour, and preference to the individual who will not join an organization to improve his own conditions. It does not give that individual the preference to secure a higher wage, it merely gives him the right to offer his labour at a lower rate than that fixed by the Court. This phase of the situation so far as I am aware, has not been mentioned here before. The difficulty can be overcome only by bringing into operation once more that section of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act which provided for the common rule, and which was declared by the High Court to be unconstitutional. If it were in operation today, an award of the Court, on a second application by the organization which had obtained it, could be made binding on all employers and employes engaged in the industry throughout Australia. Until we have obtained power to secure uniform conditions of employment, allowance being made for the difference in the cost of living and certain other conditions - and until we have in operation industrial laws that will bring the; conditions of t he different workers in the several States on. something like an equality - we can never hope for that industrial peace for which a great number of public men are always&#62; clamouring, but which, as public men, they do their best to block. I come now to the position of the rural workers, which has been receiving a great deal of attention from public men and the press of Australia. Under the existing law,&#39; the rural workers&#39; organization, in order to obtain something like an effective award from the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court, would have to bring before that tribunal some hundreds of employers. Honorable members will recognise, therefore, the difficulty in the way of any organization representing such au industry securing- an award that is likely to bring in its wake industrial peace. It is the duty of this Parliament to make its industrial laws effective if it is really sincere in its desire that industrial peace shall be obtained. My right honorable leader drew attention to the fact that certain proposals which we submitted to the people at the last general elections were defeated by only a small majority. Amongst .those proposals was a measure providing for an alteration of the Constitution to enlarge the power of this Parliament to deal with industrial matters.- If carried, it would have given this Parliament full power to bring into operation an effective system of conciliation and arbitration. &#39; It was defeated by a very small majority. But how was its defeat brought about? Was it defeated by an intelligent, educated vote ? By no means. In saying this I do not wish to infer that the electors of Australia are not intelligent. I mean rather to infer that an elector, however intelligent, cannot cast an intelligent vote unless he has before him the actual facts upon which he is asked to express an opinion. Our electors were -sufficiently intelligent to be able to decide this question as between our opponents and ourselves, provided that the actual facts were placed before them. But the real facts were obscured. We say that we want industrial peace, and if the whole of the facts had been placed before the people at the last referendum as to the reasons which actuated us in asking that the Commonwealth Parliament be given increased power to legislate with respect to industrial matters, I am confident that that proposal, with others, would have been carried. If it had been accepted we should have had absolute power to bring into operation a system of industrial legislation which would probably make strikes in the future almost unnecessary. It was defeated, however, because the true facts were not placed before the people. Imagine any newspaper, which desired to retain the respect of the people, publishing leading articles like those which appeared in the Victorian press, telling the farmers that if the Constitution Alteration (Industrial Matters) Bill were accepted by the people, the&#39; Labour party, on their return to power, would at once pass a law compelling every farmer to dispense with the services of his sons and daughters; that the law would* declare that preference must be given to unionists, and that since his sons and daughters were not members of the Rural Workers Union he would &#39;be compelled, under the law, to dispense with their services. That statement appeared in a Victorian newspaper, and was only on a par with many others that were published day after day, not only in Victoria, but in other parts of Australia. In view of the fact that our proposals, despite these damaging statements, were defeated by only a small majority - in one case by a little over 8,000 vote&#39;s - we may reasonably conclude that, when they are again submitted to the people, the small minority against them will be converted into a substantial majority in support of them. I speak as one who has been actively engaged for some time in the  industrial movement in Victoria, as secretary of a trade union, and as a member of a Wages Board. In the latter capacity I learned how the powers of the delegates were restricted, and how the law itself prevented us fixing conditions which would have insured industrial peace. As a trade union secretary I was the first to take a case before <inline font-weight="bold">.Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins in the Federal Arbitration Court. In that case the Attorney-General appeared on the one side and the honorable member for Bendigo on the other. I am able to speak from practical experience of -the difficulties which the unions have in reaching&#39; the Court, and to show that, when they do reach it, the time of the  President  is occupied in dealing, not with the questions in dispute, so far as wages and conditions of labour are concerned, but with technical questions of jurisdiction. I know of an organization which went into the Court, and was represented by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Duffy,</inline> and the honorable member for Bendigo, while the Attorney-General was on the other side. The arguments extended over weeks, and, in the end, the members of the union had presented to them a bill of costs amounting to something&#39; like &#163;3,000, although their conditions were not altered, or even considered, by the Court. The whole time of the Court was taken up in dealing with questions of jurisdiction. We cannot hope for industrial peace under such conditions. We need to have a Federal Court that can deal with the great system of federal organization that has sprung up. We want an equal basis of competition as between manufacturers in each State, and that equal basis of competition can be secured only by uniform industrial conditions operating in the different States. Those uniform conditions in turn can be brought about only by full power being given to this Parliament to pass industrial legislation, and those full powers would be obtained if the people accepted one of these measures. I believe that, on the next occasion that a reference is made to the people, that Bill will be carried, and when full powers to pass industrial legislation are conferred upon the Commonwealth  Parliament, industrial peace, as we advocate it, will be, for the first time, within the near view of the people of Australia. </para>

                    <para>. - The Senate, while accepting the position of the Government that there ought to be an option to construct the railway by day labour or contract, has amended the proposed clause as shown in the message. As the Leader of the Opposition knows, it is the invariable practice of the &#39;Government to include a provision of this kind in all contracts ; but the amendment of the Senate imposes the statutory duty to set the conditions out in the schedule to the contract.

The honorable gentleman has not, I think, had the experience that some of us have had of living in remote parts of Australia.

                        <para>- We are dealing now with the Northern Territory, and, to my mind, only the Government can undertake this work. Obviously the Government will know what work is proposed at a particular period, and how many men will be employed. They will also know the requirements of the men better than the men do themselves, and could easily ascertain the value of the goods sold and delivered. I am with the Senate in the principle of the amendment, but I think it might have gone further and added the cost of distribution, as well as the Port Darwin price. </para>

                        <para>- The question was not brought up in the same way, and the transcontinental line is not in the same category as the line under discussion. In all probability, in point of accessibility, the Northern Territory is more remote from the cities of Australia than any other country in the world. There is an extremely small population to provide for there at present, and labour of all kinds is very costly; and the difficulties of transport, together with the time that purveyors would have to wait for their money, would add enormously to the price of the goods. The Government, however, would know exactly what was required, and could provide reasonably for any given period. Arrangements could be made with a merchant or merchants of Darwin, and the goods could be conveyed to the workmen. </para>

                        <para>- In my opinion, the amendment does not conflict with common sense or good government. Whether the men engaged in constructing the proposed railway are working for a contractor or for the Government, they must live, and should be enabled to live as human beings. They must, therefore, be supplied with all necessary food, clothing, and the comforts of civilized life. Who will supply these things? The men ought nob to be in any uncertainty as to the supply, nor should they be left at the mercy of a few storekeepers in a place so remote that there will be little or no competition. The Government ought not to lose anything in this transaction, and, therefore, I say that the cost of distribution should be added. The amount charged should allow a margin sufficient to protect the Government against loss. The Prime Minister is never tired of advocating co-operation for the protection of the individual against the attacks of combinations. Well, the Government will be in a position to co-operate with these men. The Attorney-General, in opposing the Senate&#39;s amendment, is acting against the. declared policy of his party. </para>

                        <para>- Then they would escape political punishment,, of course, and the Crown could not be mulct in damages in any action brought against it. But should we be afraid of expressing our opinion in statutory form ? The Attorney-General has gone a long way beyond his ordinary political views when he says that the Government will look after these men as far as that is practicable and possible. I shall have to call for a division against the motion, unless that will discover the want of a quorum. </para>

                        <para>- I understand that the Government declines to undertake the responsibility. But the Government would know what contracts had been let, where the men were likely to be employed during any period, how many were being employed, and what stores they would need; and the men would be infinitely better off if supplied by the Government than if left in the hands of private storekeepers. The honorable member for Kooyong knows that it was a complaint against certain employers that when the Wages Boards increased the wages of their employes, they raised the rents of the houses in which these employes were living, and thus got back more than the additional amount which they had to pay out. </para>

                    <para>. - In my opinion, there is no need for this provision. Do honorable members think that the present Ministers are a callous-hearted set of brutes, who do not care how the men may be treated ? We have had control of the construction of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta line during the last five months, and there has been no trouble. It is the duty and obligation of every Government to see that men employed under difficult and exceptional conditions, such as those under consideration, shall be treated as well as they can be treated. We shall take care that means are adopted to prevent the men from being subjected to injustice. </para>

                    <para>. - Our business is at an end, and it only remains for me to say that I hope honorable members, in the recess, will enjoy to the full all that may come to them in the way of surcease from anxiety, trouble, and care, and may recuperate their energies, which have been exhausted in the work of the session. We are under- many obligations, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> to you, as the presiding officer of the House, for the way in which you have conducted our proceedings. However strenuously our political battles may be fought, we must all believe in our hearts that you have done your best to keep to the high levels set you by your predecessors. Personally, I have to acknowledge that I have been kept strictly in my proper place under your care and control, and I hope I have submitted with becoming humility to the discipline. We all must feel, sir, that you have done your duty diligently, ably, faithfully, and impartially. We owe much also to the  Chairman  of Committees for his patience, industry, and ability that have led to the facile conduct of the affairs of the Committees. The officers of the House are always with us; Ministers come and Ministers go, but they, like the brook, go on for ever. &#39; We hope, I am sure, that that &#34; for ever &#34; will mean, at any rate/ many years to come. We owe much to their assistance and their ready help in time of need. To their courtesy, unfailing and untiring, and to their urbanity and diligence, we are indebted more than we know for the proper conduct of the business of the House; and I make my acknowledgment to them here and now. To our good friends of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> Staff, headed by the &#34;Friend&#34; of man, we owe a great deal; and, altogether, I think we do not sufficiently remember how the organized forces of the House patiently, silently,, and ably keep the wheels of our machinery going with as little friction as: possible, and with a maximum of efficiency. I hope honorable members will&#39; believe me when I wish them, and  particularly  the Leader of the Opposition, a Merry Christmas and a very Happy New Year, and all the good fortune that the world may bring to those who try to do  their duty, as I am sure my right honorable friend tries to do his.  I hope . that when we meet again it will be with renewed vigour, and with patriotism unabated, to do the best we can for this great country of ours. </para>

                    <para>. - I join with the Prime Minister in this valedictory of the first session of the fifth Parliament, which has been the most tragic of any since the commencement of the Commonwealth. I trust that never again, within the space of one short week, shall we see two of our members struck down in their prime. I agree that all concerned have done their best according to their lights, and if that best sometimes has fallen short of what we would desire or expect, it is only in the nature of things in the proceedings of every deliberative assembly. I join with the honorable gentleman, too, in offering my congratulations to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline> It is incumbent on every member of the House to give you all the help, and to show you all the consideration possible, and this I have endeavoured to do. In any position that I may occupy, you may depend upon my assistance in conducting our proceedings according to the rules that have been framed for our guidance.  I do not wish to strike a jarring note, but I should fail in my duty, and should leave a false impression on the minds of honorable members, if I did not say that, placing the  most  favorable construction on everything done by Ministers, I feel that the suspension of the honorable member for Ballarat was mistaken, and based on grounds on which it cannot be sustained. The matter is no longer controversial, the penalty imposed having been paid. What was done was done by the head of the Government, not by you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> and I am not, therefore, reflecting upon you in mentioning the incident. I join with the Prime Minister in conveying the thanks of this party to the  Chairman  and officers who have guided the procedure of the House, and to the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff, to whom we are all greatly indebted. To them I offer my personal congratulations for the manner in which their duties have been performed. We are exceedingly fortunate in the staff that was formed at the beginning of Federation. The representatives of the people who come from every part of Australia can be sure that their utterances will be turned &#34; best side out with care,&#34; if I may so express myself, by the official reporters, who, while giving a truthful record of the speeches delivered, are creating a permanent record worthy of this National Parliament. Knowing the wear and tear of Ministerial work, and the drain upon the physical energy of the occupants of office,. 1 trust that Ministers will find in the? recess opportunities for much-needed rest, and recuperation. While we must often,, in the heat of debate, strike hard, I trust, that the good personal feeling which exists between us, notwithstanding our political differences, will always remain unimpaired, and that our proceedings; will be characterized by that dignity which is the pride of the Legislature of the Mother Country. From honorable members generally I have received many courtesies. The honest expression of opinion is always to be respected, and adverse criticism is sometimes more helpful than friendly support. In conclusion, I echo the wish of the Prime Minister that we may all enjoy a merry Christmas and enter upon a happy New Year. </para>

                    <para>- Before we disperse for the recess, I wish to express my appreciation of the kind remarks regarding myself and the conduct of business since I have occupied the position of  Speaker,  which have fallen from- the lips of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, speaking, I take it, on behalf of their respective parties. I thank the House for this expression of confidence in me. There can be no two opinions about the arduous nature of the work we have had to perform. It is unfortunate that the electors are apparently so evenly divided in their political opinions .that neither political party has a majority in this House without counting the occupant of the Chair. I happen to be that, in some respects, unfortunate individual, and thus occupy a position unprecedented in the history of this Parliament. I can, however, honestly and truthfully say that I have endeavoured, with what ability I possess, to act impartially in the discharge of my duties in the Chair. No one can do more than his best, and notwithstanding my shortcomings, I have tried to do that. I am indebted to the Clerks at the table for their cordial assistance, and express my appreciation of the efficient manner in which the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff, the Serjeant-at-Arms, and our officers generally have performed their duties. I trust that the recess may afford both Ministers and members an opportunity to recuperate after their labours, and that we may all return next session with renewed vigour our personal friendship, notwithstanding our political relations, remaining undiminished. In the meantime, I wish all a merry Christmas and a happy New Year. </para>

                        <para>Brisbane, Thursday. - The Minister for Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White)</inline> said to-day that he had signed 512 certificates of exemption as provided for under the Sugar Cultivation Act, permitting aliens- to engage in the sugar industry. No one had received an exemption certificate unless he had resided in Queensland for over 10 years. Some of the applicants have been 30 years in the Slate. Many of them were Hindoos (British subjects) and kanakas, who had been exempt tinder the Federal Act of r002 </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>I am quite sure that Hindoos and kanakas exempted under the Act of 1902 are not exempt under the agreement into which we entered with the Queensland Government. The fact that 512 aliens have been given certificates of exemption is, in my opinion, a very good beginning towards the reintroduction of coloured labour into the sugar industry. I very much regret that almost as soon as we have given the State Government control of the industry we should be compelled to pay, in respect of sugar produced by 512 aliens, the same amount that we pay on sugar produced by white labour. Protection was originally granted to the sugar industry on the basis of the employment of white labour, but, apparently, with the best of intentions, a breach of that policy has been committed. I have no hesitation in saying that from my own knowledge of the industry, and I am satisfied that, if this practice should be developed to any material extent, it will be fatal to the best interests of the industry, and to the northern portion of the continent. </para>

                        <para>. - I hope that it will not be taken amiss if, in the closing moments of the session, I venture to offer a few observations on what I consider to be a subject of much importance. I allude to an attack made in a leading article, published in yesterday&#39;s issue of the <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> upon a great Judicial Officer of the Commonwealth - a Judicial Officer who, I am sure the House believes, has discharged his functions with impartiality, and has brought to bear - upon them all the wealth of his great learning and his diligence. This article, in my view, amounts practically to an accusation of bias against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins. In order to maintain that position I propose to quote one or two short passages from the article. </para>

Impartial and scientific observers of the work done by this learned Judge in the Australian Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, however, have expressed complete belief in his impartiality. Words of  commendation  have been uttered in that regard. &#39; Some observers have remarked that he has made statements which might ruffle the feelings of employers, but that, in the result, his awards have been fair, that they have been made after a complete consideration of all the facts and circumstances, and that no fault can te found with them. Persons who have been opposed to the claims of the unions, and others who have had to&#34; advise them and to conduct their claims in Court, have also expressed the view that  His  Honour, in the result, has done nothing that is unfair or which could be attributed to partiality towards one side or the other. </para>

But I should like to  remind the honorable member for Bendigo that in inviting a discussion on the Judges who are engaged in discharging ordinary judicial functions, or functions of a legislative character, he is entering upon ground that is not likely to lead to any useful result in this House. The Courts possess all the necessary authority to deal with criticism which goes so far as to be dangerous to the administration of justice. They have the power to do that in the most complete way and to protect themselves. </para>

                            <para>- In no case where they are exercising judicial functions is it advisable that this House should be made a theatre for the discussion of these Judicial Officers. It is quite true, as I was about to add, that rightly or wrongly it has become the policy of this Parliament, and of other Legislatures, to invite Judicial Officers to perform functions that are really not judicial, but are more of a legislative character. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins, in a celebrated case, himself pointed out that his duties were really more legislative than judicial. I refer to his remarks in the Harvester case. Such criticism cannot go on without evoking criticism in the press and elsewhere on both sides. We know, though I am not going to refer in detail to this, that there are other Judges engaged in similar work who have evoked much more rancorous criticism than any read by the honorable member. It would be wise to let the Courts defend themselves in these matters; because, once we introduce debate in this House, we naturally invite discussion on both sides, and this, in my opinion, it is very desirable to avoid. </para>

These exemptions having probably been granted on humanitarian considerations, I dare say some of them will be only temporary. The Queensland Government are just as anxious to keep this industry white as is this Parliament, and they will honour the contract. </para>
