                        <para>- I should hardly think so. The estimated increase in the Post Office revenue is, I am glad to say, being realized. Altogether I think that the prospects ahead of us are good, in so far as the revenue is concerned, and there is no reason to be other than sanguine that the year will end very much better than it has begun. In a few days we shall be discussing the Estimates-in-Chief, when there will be opportunity for dealing with all the items of expenditure, and I hope, therefore, that we shall not take very long over this Bill. I trust that honorable members will treat it, as Supply Bills have very often been treated - in my experience, to a large extent - as a formal matter. We require Supply by Friday, which is pay-day, so that there is every reason why I should urge as much expedition as honorable members can give to the passage of the Bill. I may also add that Christmas is near at hand, and that we are getting towards what we call the "going-home time," especially those who have been away from home for many months. I think I can say for every one that we have had a very arduous session, and I hope the fixing of a going-home time will be facilitated. It is becoming very urgent with some of us. Therefore, I hope that this Bill will pass very quickly, and also that we shall be able to come to an amicable and satisfactory arrangement by which we can bring the business of the session to an end. </para>

                    <para>.- I think the time has now come when the Standing Orders Committee could very well revise our Standing Orders. I think they should be revised from time to time. The Constitution is necessarily revised from time to time; there are frequent discussions with" that end in view; and in the same way I think the rules and practice by which the House is governed should from time to time be revised by our Standing Orders Committee. I would draw particular attention to standing order No. 1. which says - </para>

                <para class="block">The Standing Orders Committee, I think, should be asked whether there is any need' for that standing order to continue. Asa Parliament, we have been in existence for over twelve years, and I consider that the House should be absolutely a law to itself in regard to all matters of procedure. There are many other reasons why this standing order should be excised, but I shall deal with only one at this sitting, because I quite agree with the Treasurer that we should hasten the passage of the Supply Bill to-day, and I do not intend to lengthen the debate upon it unnecessarily. The environment of the British House of Commons is quite- different from the environment of this House, and it is possible that, in carrying out our standing order No. 1 to the very letter, and even in the spirit of the House of Commons practice, it may be used tyrannically, unjustly, and unfairly. It is within the range of- possibility, and even probability, that, in a House of seventy-five members, with two great parties in the country, the time may come when the parties will be evenly divided on the floor of the House. It might even happen in the British House of Commons, with its 675 members, although the chances of the great parties in England being equally divided on the floor of the British House of Commons are not as great as they would be in a House of seventy-five members. We can very easily imagine that, on the floor of this House, the two sides may be evenly divided, and if ever that should happen, it might lead to almost an <inline font-style="italic">impasse.</inline> The Government might be blocked to some extent in the carrying out of what they deem to be the business of the country, "and, on the other hand, if anunscruplous Government were returned - we can imagine such a state of things - they might attempt to do something, or bring in some procedure of the House of Commons in order to remove some honorable member from the House so as to enable them to carry on business. A member of this House might very easily come, almost unknowingly, athwart some rule or procedure of the House of Commons. A member of this House might know every, rule and regulation a:nd standing-' order from No. 2 to 410. We- might all be able to understand every one of them, but unless a person is a student of political history, unless he spends a- good deal of time in so doing - and" amidst all the difficulties and turmoil of politics to-day it would be difficult for most of us to spare the time - he cannot expect to fully master the rules, practices, and procedure of the: House of Commons. A member might know every one of- the rules and procedure of the House, and do his best to conform to them, but unknowingly and unwittingly he might breaks some of the rules and procedure of the House of Commons, and the Government, having a majority, might possibly take' advantage of the fact. It is not impossible to imagine that some member of this' House might, go outside, and, at a public meeting, make some reflection on the  Speaker  of this House. A member of the House of Commons might do it. There have  been two cases in recent times in which members of the House of Commons did go to public meetings and reflect upon the impartiality of the  Speaker.  One of these I happen to know something about. He was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Conybeare,</inline> who represented in the House of Commons the constituency in which I was born. When member for Camborne he reflected at a public meeting on the  Speaker  of the House of Commons, and, under the rule? and procedure of the House, he was summoned to the House, and it was necessary for him to apologize, failing which he. would be suspended. I believe that he was actually suspended. More recently, during the Coronation time, while some of our members were in England, a Labour member of the House of Commons questioned the impartiality of the  Speaker  at a public meeting in London, and action was taken in his case in the House of Commons the next day. I can imagine that some member of this House might possibly go outside and reflect upon the impartiality of the  Speaker.  If that happened I think that, before we could deal with him absolutely on the same lines as are followed in the House of Commons we ought to take into consideration the position in which the  Speaker  of the House of Commons is placed, and his environment. I am indebted to a book in our Library, written by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Edward</inline> Lummis,  which deals with the Speaker's chair for very interesting information about the  Speaker  of the British House of Commons. He says - </para>

                <para class="block">I do not know that those statements apply to the  Speaker  of our House, and I do not think that the general idea in Australia is that we should attempt to fling around, even the ablest and most distinguished and impartial of our Speakers, the divinity that doth hedge a king. It is laid down as an essential in the House of Commons that the  Speaker  should dissociate himself absolutely from party politics. It is the invariable custom that he should not be opposed if he offers himself for re-election as  Speaker,  although there is nothing in the rules or Standing Orders of the British House of Commons to say that he shall not be so opposed. To show how strongly that custom has been observed, when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gully,</inline> a Liberal, was elected  Speaker  by eight or eleven votes, while a Liberal Government were in office on the retirement of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Peel,</inline> it was said by the Conservatives and Liberal Unionists at the time that if return 3d to power after a general election they purposed running a candidate of their own party. They came back from the general elections with an overwhelming majority, yet they did hot remove <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gully</inline> from the Speakership, and he was re-elected. Further, it is not the practice to oppose the  Speaker  when standing for re-election in his own constituency. Immediately a member has been made  Speaker  of the House of Commons, both parties agree not to oppose him. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harry</inline> Graham, in a very interesting book dealing with the House of Commons, says - </para>

                    <para>On 22nd July,  1813,  at the prorogation of Parliament,  Speaker  Abbott, took it upon himself to deliver at the Bar of the House of Lon ls a lengthy  party harangue on the subject of Catholic emancipation. This frank exposition of his private political views roused the indignation of the Commons, who took an  early  opportunity of expressing their disapproval of his conduct. Not even his friends could condone his action, and in April of the following year a resolution was moved in the House of Commons gravely censuring him for his behaviour on that occasion. For several hours he was forced to listen to criticisms and abuse from both sides of the* </para>

                <para class="block">House, and though, as a matter of policy, the resolution was not carried, the Commons, in the course of this debate, proved beyond doubt their determination to secure the impartiality of their Chairman. </para>
                <para>That they succeeded in accomplishing their purpose may be gauged from the conduct and character of Abbott's successors. So divorced from all political prejudice is the modern  Speaker  that he does not deem it consistent with his position to enter the portals 'of any political club of which he may happen to be a member. Even at a general election he steers as widely clear of politics as possible. It is not, indeed, usual for his candidature to be opposed at such a time - though an exception was made as recently as 1895, when  Speaker  Gully was forced to contest Carlisle - and, though he may appeal in writing to his constituents, he is not supposed to touch, in his election address, upon any political questions. </para>
                <para class="block">The position is different in Australia. When the  Speaker  of the House of Commons leaves the Chair, it is considered derogatory to his dignity that he should reappear in the House as a private member. Provision is therefore made for his being raised to the peerage, and receiving a pension of £4,000 a year upon his retirement from that office. All this is done in England in order to remove the  Speaker  from the conflict or exigencies of party politics. In Australia, however, the  Speaker,  not only of this House, but of any Legislative Assembly, may be opposed when he seeks re-election to the Chair, and he may also be opposed when he seeks re-election to the Parliament. Speakers in this country have often been opposed. I suppose that no Parliament in Australia ever had a more gifted and distinguished  Speaker-  than this House had in the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Holder, and I think that we owe a lot to the fact that we had such a gentleman in the Chair in the early history of the Commonwealth. But, notwithstanding his distinguished ability, he was opposed when he sought re-election to this House, and opposed, I admit, by a Labour candidate. Then again, at the last general election the honorable member for Kennedy, who at the time held office as  Speaker  of the House of Representatives, was opposed by a Liberal candidate. I need not read any of the details of the contest, but I have no doubt that my honorable friend, when fighting for his seat, dealt with all the planks in the platform of his party, and fought his opponent as strongly as he was able to do. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; and I feel quite confident that at the next general election, whenever it takes place, the present  Speaker  will be opposed. Gentlemen holding office as  Speaker  in some of the Legislative Assemblies of the States have been defeated on an appeal to the constituencies. For instance, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. F.</inline> G. Mason, who was  Speaker  of the Victorian Legislative Assembly for a number of years, was defeated at a general election while holding that office, and the same fate befell <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cowley,</inline> who was  Speaker  in the Queensland Legislative Assembly. The position of the  Speaker  of the House of Commons, it must be freely admitted, is absolutely different from that of the  Speaker  of any Legislative Assembly in this country. Honorable members who have held office as  Speaker,  in this House, I believe, have sometimes attended meetings of their respective parties. Without violating any confidence, I think I can say that the honorable member for Kennedy, when he held office as  Speaker,  occasionally attended a meeting of his party. I believe that I saw him at least on one occasion present at a meeting of his party. </para>

But it was recently reported in the press that the present  Speaker  of the House of Representatives attended a meeting of his party in Sydney, and expressed the hope that circumstances would tend to a double dissolution. I do not object to any  Speaker  attending a meeting of his party. </para>

                        <para>- I hold that if we are going to deal with the  Speaker  of this House as the  Speaker  of the House of Commons would be dealt with, then we should have here the conditions that apply in the House of Commons in regard to the occupant of the Chair.  Speaker  Lowther was a member of the Conservative party before he was elected to his present position. At the present time a Liberal Ministry is in office in Great Britain. What would happen if  Speaker  Lowther were to attend a party meeting in England, and express the opinion that the Welsh Church Disestablishment Bill ought not to be carried, or that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Carson was perfectly justified in pursuing his present line of conduct? Would not the Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Asquith,</inline> propose in the House of Commons next day that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> should be relieved of his responsibilities? But, according to a newspaper report, the Prime Minister of Australia stated at a meeting at Wangaratta that he would be able to fall back upon <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker's</inline> vote in the case of a very important division. I am not objecting to the use of such words by the Prime Minister. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable gentleman will not do so, then I shall believe that he made the statement I have attributed to him. If it were possible for the Prime Minister to attend a public meeting and say, " I can depend upon the casting vote of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,"</inline> no fuss would be made in this House. But if, in the House of Commons, parties were equally divided, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Asquith</inline> attended a public meeting, and said, " There is a vote of censure pending, but we have the vote of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> to fall back upon," I venture to say a perfect pandemonium would be witnessed on the following day. In my opinion, it is very necessary that we should have this standing order excised and that we should be a law unto ourselves. As cases crop up, we should deal with them. Simply because we have not the same environment, it is not wise that we should fall back upon the rules of any Parliament - even those of the Mother of Parliaments, with all its traditions and history, of which every person born in England is so proud. Those traditions, because they relate to a civilization which is hoary with age, are inapplicable to a Parliament which is throbbing with the first pulsations of life. </para>

                    <para>.- I desire to say a few words in reference to the New Hebrides. I hold in my hand a communication from Messrs. Kerr Bros., of New South Wales, who complain that no rebate of duty is allowed on the produce of British settlers in the New Hebrides unless it is forwarded by the steamers of Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company, which is the only Australian shipping company trading with the New Hebrides. Personally, I do not think any advantage is to be derived by Australia from endeavouring to encourage settlement in the New Hebrides by granting a rebate upon produce such as maize, which is grown by cheap labour, and which comes into competition with the produce of Australian farmers, who are taxed to pay the expenses incurred in endeavouring to settle the New Hebrides. I would like the Minister of Trade and Customs to take this matter into his consideration. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>I am also in receipt of a letter from Messrs. Kerr Brothers, in reference to a debate which was originated in this House by the honorable member for Maribyrnong. It is a communication which was sent to the public press of New South Wales, which, I think, ought to appear- in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and to which, I think, a reply should be made. I presume that the persons who are affected by it will be able to reply to it. It reads as follows: - </para>
                <para class="block">New Hebrides. </para>
                <para>
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Sir,</inline>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fenton</inline>
                    (Victoria), on Wednesday last, moved the adjournment of the House of Representatives to ventilate conditions existing in
                </para>
                <para>New Hebrides, and termed those conditions " a disgrace to white men," that women and children should be torn from their relations by recruiters and forced to work on plantations. . Now, I wish to say that, although no doubt <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fenton</inline> in all good faith moved in this matter, the conditions alleged as existing are altogether distorted and unreliable. The Presbyterian Mission of New Hebrides persists in making glaring statements that do not in any reasonable way represent conditions existing. It goes without saying that in any circumstances there will be incidents of abuse in any country or condition of life, whether under the British flag or any other flag; but to say that an incident of abuse represents the condition of affairs in the place is absurd. </para>
                <para>Because a person was murdered in Sydney, it cannot be put down to " awful conditions " generally in Australia. </para>
                <para>The natives in New Hebrides are easy-going, indolent, and generally suffer from want of regular work. There is no such thing as poverty among them as we know it among white peoples. They live in their native way with very little effort, as prolific Nature is very kind to them, and they have their native foods in plenty. </para>
                <para>Our Presbyterian Mission friends would make it appear that the natives are in an awful condition, that recruiters go round snaring them, taking them away from their homes, ill-using them, and doing everything inhuman it is possible to imagine. I say this is absolutely untrue. The native is a very independent gentleman nowadays, and only goes away for plantation work when it suits him, or he has got into trouble with his tribe. </para>
                <para>Conditions of life on plantations are very good- indeed, as the appearance of the natives on any plantation will show. They live a better life, are healthier and better men, than while leading the indolent life they do in their tribes. As to treatment on the plantations, hours of work, rations, &amp;c, they are fully protected by the conditions of engagement, and those conditions are strictly carried out. </para>
                <para>The principal trouble that arises in recruiting is in regard to women. Their marriage obligations are hardly on the lines recognised by white people, as the woman changes husbands or the man changes wives, and there is some trouble ; perhaps the woman runs away with her new husband and they recruit to some handy recruiting vessel to get away from the trouble. Perhaps the missionary wants to marry a young girl to some old native who supports the mission. She objects, and runs away, recruits on some French recruiting ship, and then we hear some awful vara of kidnapping, taken away against her will, and so forth. </para>
                <para>Under the terms of the Convention women were allowed to be recruited ; but, at the instance of the Presbyterian Mission, a King's regulation was passed which prohibited British settlers recruiting women at all. </para>
                <para>The French have carried out the terms of the Convention, whilst the British have practically had to give up recruiting, let their plantations lie idle, and look on. But why blame the Frenchman for all this? Here they blame the Frenchman, but in the islands nobody's reputation is safe. British settlers are dragged to Vila on some trumped-up charge. What does it avail that they prove the charge false? As an instance, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. D.</inline> H. Kerr was summoned to Vila on a charge by a Presbyterian missionary, had to bring his witnesses to Vila, proved the charge false, but he lost a lot of valuable time, and altogether it cost him about £200.. </para>
                <para>What recourse have the British settlers against this sort of thing? This is simply an instance; there are others. I do not think there is a British settler, except a few ex-missionaries, or those under the wing of the Mission, who have not been brought to Vila on some trivial and trumped-up charge. </para>
                <para>We are not suffering from Government control, but missionary rule. No one objects to the missionaries trying to raise the natives to a higher plane of life, but the Mission should not be allowed to rule the country. Of course, their statements carry a lot of weight here and in Great Britain, where the actual conditions are not known. The present British Commissioner does not pander to the Mission or any other body, but the trouble is beyond his control. </para>
                <para>Australia undoubtedly should have control of these islands - they are a natural dependency - and they could be administered in a more rational way from here, where local conditions would more readily be known. But save us from missionary rule. The friction between the British and French is almost wholly created by the missionaries. There are incidents perpetrated at mission stations which would make " white men" ashamed. It would be as reasonable to apply this to all missionaries as for them to apply remote incidents of abuse in recruiting as general conditions in the islands. </para>

                    <para>In regard to the question of Presbyterian missionaries engaging in trade in the New Hebrides, it is a well-known fact that some of them do, and it has been a public scandal for years.

                        <para>- I have given an answer to the honorable member's question, and he might answer mine. I do not think that missionaries ought to engage in trading in these islands. One can see that it might be very objectionable if they did. I remember reading in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Alfred</inline> Russell Wallace's book, .describing his travels in these islands and in Papua, that he came across two missionaries in Papua who were trying to convert the natives, and who were also engaged in buying their produce, and then selling it back to them at a higher rate. That was a purely commercial transaction, of course; but the natives could not see where the justice of it came in. I do not think that missionaries should engage in trade. The two occupations will not run together, since a- man cannot serve two masters. The honorable member for Wimmera, as a Biblical student, will know that you cannot serve God and Mammon. We ought to know to what extent the statements contained in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kerr's</inline> letters are true, and it might be well for the Government to have an investigation of some kind into the matter. We do not hear about the New Hebrides question very frequently, though, no doubt, a considerable stir is made once or twice a year about it, and an agitation is started in favour of our taking over those islands. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable members who are in favour of our taking over the New Hebrides, and consider that they should really come under our jurisdiction, because they are adjacent to the coast of Australia, should take a look at the map of Europe. If their contention is logical and in accord with common  sense, they should contend that, because the British Isles are even nearer to Europe than the New Hebrides are to Australia, Europe should annex the British Isles. In view of the fact that we have so much to do on the mainland of Australia, I consider that we are spending money foolishly in our endeavours to promote settlement in the New Hebrides, but I do not intend to dwell upon the matter at greater length this afternoon. I suggest that the Minister of External Affairs might endeavour to have some inquiry made as to the truth of the statements made by Kerr Brothers, and by other people, in connexion with the condition of affairs in the New Hebrides. One other matter with which I wish to deal briefly is that referred toby the honorable member for Barrier, who spoke of the practice of the House of Commons being adopted by the House of Representatives of Australia. I should not care to adopt the suggestion that we should abandon the House of Commons practice altogether. </para>

                        <para>- The practice of the House of Commons has been, of course, the practice of centuries. Their Standing Orders are the outcome of the experience of centuries. There is, in my opinion, a great deal of objection to our adopting the practice of the House of Commons, which has prevailed since the establishment of Federation. On this point I wish to direct attention to the fact that in' this Chamber we are using two volumes of <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> - one the 10th edition, and the other the 11th edition. The 11th edition of <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> was compiled since the establishment of Federation, and many of the passages quoted from it by the Attorney-General a few days ago have nothing whatever to do with us, because the Constitution lays it down that the practice of the House of Commons prevailing at the time of the establishment of Federation is the practice to be adopted by us, where we have no Standing Orders of our own to guide us. </para>

                        <para>- I agree with the honorable member for Hindmarsh that the House of Commons is not in our position, but I venture to think that he is » hot quite right when he says that it never will be. The condition of politics in the House of Commons has not reached the stage reached in this country. There was a time when it was the custom in Australia to regard the  Speaker  as outside parties altogether, and he was not opposed when he sought re-election. There was no thought, twenty years ago, of opposing a  Speaker,  no matter what party might be in power. But now, because, in the course of events, we have a Labour party in politics, a change has taken place, and all those old traditions have been cast to the winds. When a Labour  Speaker  was presiding in the Victorian Legislative Assembly, and the time came to elect a new 'Speaker^ the party in power turned the  Speaker  out of the chair, because he was a member of the Labour party. I believe that the time will come in the Old Country when the Labour party will be so strong that it will cast aside the traditions regarding the  Speaker  as we have cast them aside in this country. </para>

In the asking of questions, great latitude should be allowed here, seeing that our House is composed of only seventy-five members. The membership of the House of .Commons is much larger ; indeed all the members cannot be accommodated at one time within the Chamber. </para>

Here we should be guided, as far as possible, by our own practice, and should not depend on any other Legislature. We should refer to the practice of the House of Commons only to ascertain decisions upon cases such as had not previously arisen here. As a matter of fact, we have at the present" time abandoned all the practices and traditions of Parliament, and it would seem that for some years to come the only thing that will operate here will be the will of the majority. The party that has a majority will carry out its intentions, irrespective of parliamentary traditions or anythingelse. </para>

                    <para>.- -I wish to make some reference to a subject that was touched on by the honorable member for Capricornia, that is, the New Hebrides question. The honorable member for Maribyrnong is to be congratulated on having brought it before the House a few days ago. This. is the first opportunity that I have had since the discussion which he initiated of speaking on the subject. In my opinion, we should be given more information regarding the possibility of further negotiations between Great Britain and France respecting the New Hebrides. Past negotiations have been unfortunate for us, Australia having been allowed no voice in the settlement of the various agreements that have been come to between Great Britain and France. In 1906 a "convention was drawn up in England by representatives of the two Governments, and this is ah opportune time to glance at the correspondence which took place regarding it between the Commonwealth and Imperial authorities. The control of the New Hebrides is of more importance to us than might appear on the surface. Eminent naval authorities are of the opinion that in the course of time the Pacific will become, if not the theatre of a great war, at all events the ocean on which fleets of the world's great nations will float, opposing one another, and the control of the islands of the Pacific will greatly affect the position of the rival powers, because of the use to which these island* can be put as coaling stations, and to give other assistance to war vessels. At the present time the New </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>Hebrides are under the joint protectorate of Great Britain and France, that having been arranged for without Australia having had a ".say " in the' matter, and the danger now is that another convention may be agreed to without Australia being consulted. The correspondence to which I have referred shows that the present protectorate was arranged for without reference to the Commonwealth. In 1905 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> who was then Prime Minister, wrote to the Imperial authorities that it was of vital importance to Australia that no agreement regarding the control of the New Hebrides should be come to without the Commonwealth being given an opportunity to suggest terms, and to urge as emphatically as possible the advantages which would accrue from joining the islands to the Commonwealth. As early as the 13th March, 1903, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> had urged the final settlement of this question, but, writing again on the 29th August, 1905, he said that the Commonwealth Ministry - . while declaring its strong objection to the establishment of a Joint . Protectorate over the New Hebrides, felt bound to admit that it was the least objectionable of the alternatives then considered, if the only satisfactory settlement, its annexation to the Empire, must be abandoned. </para>
                <para>He stated also - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>A permanent Joint Protectorate, representative of both countries, founded upon conditions giving security for investment and settlement, preventing any preferences being granted to settlers of a particular nationality, and establishing a Government capable of protecting the natives, securing religious liberty, and fostering civilization in the group, would certainly be preferable to the state of affairs that now obtains. The harbors of the group, while open to commerce, would not, in that event, become the basis of hostile action in the Pacific. The permanence of the Protectorate need not imply that its minor terms must be unalterable. It would be most acceptable if the conditions upon which the Protectorate is to be established, or any amendment of them afterwards, in addition to receiving the approval of  His  Majesty's Government and  the Republic of France, were submitted for the consents of the Commonwealth and of New Zealand prior to their adoption by His Majesty's Government. * </para>
                    <para>The sentiment of the people of the Commonwealth is so averse to anything resembling a sacrifice of the great Imperial possibilities of the New Hebrides that this inquiry is tentative only, in order to ascertain the prospects of such an arrangement, and afford an opportunity for its consideration in the event of no better alternative being open to us. </para>

                <para class="block">The copy referred to was sent, and the terms of the Convention were outlined. The Convention provided for a Court dealing, on the French side, with the French residents, and, on the British side, with the British residents of the islands. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> thereupon pointed out that separate tribunals for French and British were objectionable ; that there should be a common Court for the territory. He pointed out, further, that the Convention gave the employers of native labour too much power; that the conditions under which land was to be allotted would enable native land-owners to be exploited; and that it was possible that the conditions under which native labour might be employed might bring about something in the nature of slavery. Letters which have since reached members of this House show that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin's</inline> fears have been justified, or, at least, afford ground for urging that there should be a thorough inquiry into the government of the islands, to ascertain how far the charges of injustice can be sustained. Although the Imperial Government invited suggestions regarding the Convention from the Commonwealth Government, the same despatch informed the Commonwealth Ministers that the agreement which had been drawn up would have to be rejected or accepted practically as it stood. The conferences between the representatives of Great Britain and France on the subject Of the Convention extended over eight or nine months, but no reference was made to the Commonwealth Government regarding them, nor was any information given of the meetings, except through the newspapers. Diplomatic considerations might have prevented the Imperial Government at the time, from making public what was transpiring, but there should have been official communications with the Commonwealth authorities while the representatives of the two nations were conferring. Better still, as suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> when Prime Minister, the Government should have been invited to send a delegate representking the Commonwealth and New Zealand, or the Commonwealth and the Dominion should each have been invited to send a member to the Conference in order that the views and sentiments of Australasia .might be represented, -seeing that at some time or other we shall inevitably have to exercise a kind of parental control over these territories. From the correspondence between New Zealand and the Colonial Office, and the Commonwealth and the Colonial Office, which was laid on the table in 1907, it can be seen that the whole of the negotiations were carried on without any . reference to the Commonwealth or the Dominion. We now hear rumours, filtering from exactly the same source as the information filtered respect-' ing the Conference in 1906, that there is a possibility, of some modification of the terms then agreed upon. The French residents of the New Hebrides have been making far greater strides than the British residents. According to a recent return, two-thirds of the freehold land are held .by the French, and only one«third by the British, while we know that subsidized steamers run between the New Hebrides and France under specially favorable trade conditions. My chief purpose is to ascertain, if possible, from the Minister whether there are any negotiations going on with respect to a modification of the present agreement, involving greater concession to  the French residents without any cognisance on the part of the Federal Parliament. This is a matter of great importance to us. We know that the Joint Protectorate was instituted without the knowledge of the Commonwealth Government, and it would seem that we ought to be on our guard in regard to the future. A close perusal of the objections taken to the present Convention by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> will show that all the fears he expressed have, according to recent information, been fully justified. Apart altogether from the value of the territorial possessions of Australia, from a strategic point of view, we have also to pay some regard to the broad question of the proper treatment of the natives. I feel sure that the Minister of External Affairs is giving close attention to this matter ; and I hope that he will be able to procure an independent and direct report in regard to the administration of the law on the island, so as to show whether the very serious charges presented to the House last week have any justification. We ought to know at the earliest opportunity whether the Courts of Justice are working satisfactorily, and whether or not it would be wise to continue to allow French jurisdiction to control the French people, and English jurisdiction to control the British residents. It was pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> that the divided control would lead to serious complications, and he re'ferred to what is now one of the present troubles, namely, the power of the magistrate to remit penalties after these have been imposed by the properly constituted Courts. This power has been disclaimed, but, as I say, it was pointed out as a likely thing to occur if the Convention were ratified in its original -form. I hope the Minister will .be able to tell us how far the negotiations, if any, have advanced between France and Great Britain with a view to an amendment, and also whether there is any possibility of an early and independent report regarding the natives. </para>

We are prepared, of course, to pay every attention to communications we receive from what we regard as responsible quarters, but we may not be inclined to accept all they say as representing exactly what has occurred, because the writers, of necessity, must get their information sometimes -secondhand. I have, however, received a communication which is official so far as it -concerns a particular denomination which has missionaries there. Strange to say, the letters received from people on the -islands practically corroborate many of the main statements made by the Rev. G. L. Paton, and, unless those letters are representative of the true state of affairs, I can hardly conceive of the missionaries of three important denominations appending "to the circular from which I read on the occasion their signatures.

They went. The man was flogged, and then put aboard a vessel and sent away. About a week later it- was given out by the Frenchman that he had jumped overboard and been eaten by a shark.

" Two .months ago the French section of the Condominium Government sent the ' man-of war,' and look to Vila our leading teacher, Peter Pentecost, and about twenty-five other men from the same district, as witnesses in a disputed land case,

                <para class="block">These are items that are coming to hand, and they seem to confirm the resolutions passed by the missionaries some time ago. I am not anxious that the Commonwealth should keep on shouldering great additional responsibilities, .but I agree with the honorable member for Wimmera that the geographical position of the New Hebrides is of great importance to Australia, as the islands are on the direct route from the Panama Canal to the Commonwealth, and I understand that they possess some very fine deep-water ports. I have gathered that it is very rare in the Pacific Islands to find harbors with sufficient depth of water to allow vessels of deep draught to enter them ; and the more I read and hear about the New Hebrides the more I conclude it is essential that we should take this question into serious consideration, especially in view of the importance of the islands to Australian commerce and defence, but also for the sake of the defence of the natives. I know that in the Minister of External Affairs we have an extremely sympathetic Minister, and that we could allow these matters to rest in his hands without our making these continual representations. I also know that it is necessary to be very careful how we. touch upon such questions as these, even in Parliament, because there may be some word said that, like a spark, may lead to a difference between Great Britain and France. I am sure no one in the House is anxious that such a thing should occur, because we all rejoice at the amicable relations existing between the two nations. I notice in the Supply Bill there is an item of £150 put down opposite the words " New Hebrides," and I. am curious to know why this sum is required. Does the Minister intend to make a visit to the New Hebrides? </para>

                        <para>- I do nob wish to discuss the particulars of the Bill ; I do not know that it would not be a good thing for the Minister to have a look round those islands. The reply given by the letter I have just read is supplementary to what has already been placed before honorable members. Some- may be inclined 'to take the word of a missionary with a grain of salt - they are entitled to their opinions; but I consider that one needs to take the information coming from people carrying on trading operations in those islands with a very big pinch of salt. The honorable member for Capricornia seemed to balk at the idea of missionaries carrying on trading operations, but in this connexion it is likely that some confusion has arisen. At certain periods of the year people in Australia are called upon to donate in money and in kind for the people of the islands where missionary operations are carried on, and as each year the gifts so collected almost fill a vessel, it is quite likely that the distribution of these gifts sent from Australia, or the sale of them, may lead to the missionaries being accused of carrying on trading operations. </para>

Many denominations had to purchase steamers in order to convey supplies to the mission stations, and, no doubt, once a steamer was purchased and run out regularly to the islands,, it was hardly likely that it would leave off trading with the islands, even though private companies might subsequently commence trading there. </para>

                    formerly Minister of External Affairs, and others, had made very strong representations, pointing out that the British Government sometimes entered into, and completed, treaty arrangements, and utterly ignored the Dominions, and claiming that as the Dominions were part and parcel of the Empire, they should be consulted before arrangements, where their interests were vitally concerned, were finally ratified. I know that the present Minister of External Affairs has made certain representations on this subject, and I hope - and believe that my hope is well founded - that he will not allow one rebuff to balk him in placing the true Australian view in regard to the New Hebrides before the British Government, though I do not imagine that he will receive any rebuff from the Colonial Office or any British Minister, or even the British Government. I hope he will particularly draw attention to the fact that the Condominium, and some of the Courts in the New Hebrides have fallen into disuse. Unfortunately, men are detained awaiting trial, and pending the arrival of a British or French warship to constitute the Court they are hired out as slaves. This treatment is not likely to lead the natives to respect the white race, because delayed justice is often even worse than the punishment actually meted out for the offence. We cannot ignore what is going on in the New Hebrides from the point of view of the protection of the natives, of the work of the missionaries, and of Australian trade with the islands, nor from the point of view of the important geographical position of the islands, lying as they do midway between the two great countries of Australia and America, and on the route to other countries, now that the Panama Canal is opened. I believe the Minister realizes that this is a very serious question to Australia, and one in which Australians must always take a very lively interest.

                    <para>.- It has been my intention &lt;;o say a word or two before the close of the session upon the very important subject of the Northern Territory, and I embrace this opportunity. Those who hail from South Australia know that the matter of the Northern Territory has been a question of great prominence in the Houses of Parliament in South Australia for many years past. Ever since 1864, when the Northern Territory was taken over by that State, the subject has been discussed over and over again. I look upon the Northern Territory as a white elephant to Australia. I go further, and say that it seems to me the Territory is not only a white elephant, but a Moloch, into whose throat we are continually shovelling wealth without getting any return. I have heard very long speeches, and very eloquent speeches, in the South  Australian  Parliament upon the subject of the Northern Territory, but whenever a speech was delivered, it always struck me as being full of meretriciousness. I think it is just about -time we faced the real position. We should not play the part of the ostrich, which foolish bird hides » its head in the sand, and, with its head so hidden, thinks that everything is lovely and- right. We should really be true to ourselves in reference to this part of the' Commonwealth. I have heard glorious descriptions of the Northern Territory. I have heard references in the South Australian Parliament to this " glorious inheritance " of ours," its "boundless resources," and its "undeveloped possibilities;" but there is very little truth in many of these statements. I do not think there is any honorable member of the House, or any person with common-sense outside, who for one brief moment really thinks that these descriptions tell the truth in regard to the likelihood of the Northern Territory becoming a paying proposition within the life of even the youngest Australian living amongst us to-day. Honorable members may ask, " Have you been there?" Some honorable -members have been there for a little while. I have not been there, but I have made it my business again and again to speak to people who have not only put in a day or two in the Northern Territory, not only been on a brief visit there, but who have lived there for a considerable number of years. A few days ago I spoke to a gentleman, an ex-Federal Minister, who has spent some time in the Northern Territory, and some of his friends have lived there for years. It is the opinion of every one of these men to whom I have spoken - and there are dozens of them - that this Territory is a white elephant, and that we should face the proposition in a different manner from the present. For two years I sat in the State Parliament of South Australia alongside the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas</inline> Crush, the representative of the Northern Territory. He lived in the Territory, and he had nothing to say against it; he was passionately fond -of it, and he liked to live there ; but even he had to admit that he did not think for a moment it was likely to be a paying proposition within a reasonable time. </para>

                        <para>- Not permanently. We know mining matters are usually very erratic, and that one never knows when a mine will become worked out. A fortnight ago I made it my business to speak to an old friend of mine 'in South Australia, who had spent twenty-one years in the Territory, who knew practically every inch of it, who had travelled over it from one end to the other. He also ridiculed the idea of the Government offering free farms, and giving the settlers an advance up to £800. He predicted that people might go there, remain until the money was expended, and then suddenly come back again. The main objection, as far as the northern part of the Territory is concerned, is that white people cannot live there with comfort and decency. They cannot bring up their families with any hope of having strong, healthy, virile children. The climate does not agree at all with many of the children when they come to the age of puberty. The same old gentleman told me that when women come to the change of life, it is absolutely necessary for them to leave those climes and come southward in order to recuperate. It is of no use for us to try to settle the Territory with white people when there is no possibility of them bringing up their families there with any hope of their, growing up physically strong. </para>

                <para class="block">I admit that adults who 'go there cao work fairly well for years and years, and keep well so long as they work a reasonable number of hours, and do not overindulge in fermented or spirituous liquors, but I do not think white people can ever live there under the same conditions as in the southern portion of this continent. In India, a tropical country, which has been under British dominion for a long number of years, I do not suppose that there are a million white people in all, including the military. Any one who goes to Ceylon and other such places needs only to look at the few - white youngsters there to understand why white people do not live there in large numbers. Some honorable members opposite may ask, " If the Territory does not suit white people, why not introduce coloured labour?" In 1882 a law or Ordinance was passed in South Australia which enabled people to bring in coloured labour under indenture, but no capitalist would venture his money in the Northern Territory, no matter what labour he could get, when he could invest his money in places like Java, which has a tropical soil, a thing which we have not got in the Territory, except in a few patches. What is the use of our establishing Government experimental farms ? It has been proved for thirty years that European grain will not thrive in the tropical part of the Territory, so that to sow it is simply a waste of money. It is criminal on our part to keep on shovelling our money down the maw of the Northern Territory. There is no fear of any Federal Government ever being at a loss to know what to do with their surplus, because they can always spend it in the Territory without getting any benefit from it. Coloured labour is out of the question, because the soil is not suitable, except in a very few instances. Then comes the question of defence. The first necessity in that regard would be to put people there who would be heart and soul with the British people. It is said that we must people the northern portions of the Territory for the sake of defence, but I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. R.</inline> Barr Smith, a wealthy South Australian gentleman, who, some years ago, said that it would be better if we left the place in a state of nature, because then there would be no fear of the Japanese or any other foreign nation' getting a footing in Australia, and coming to the southern parts as easily as they could if a railway and other facilities were provided. It is an impossibility to settle the northern portions of the Territory with white people. It is said that we might introduce southern Europeans, such as Italians or Spaniards. We cannot defend the country with a coloured population, and it would not do to have there the southern European nations, or even people of northern European stock, such as Scandinavians or Germans. From a defence stand-point, the majority of the people must be of British stock, although you may have a few northern . Europeans amongst them, but no -one can believe that we can . get a sufficient number of Britishers to settle there to form a body that could he truthfully called -a defence force. Why should we spend millions up there when there is so much room in the southern portions of this country, where people can live and thrive and do well for themselves and their descendants ? </para>

                        <para>- It should be considered very seriously indeed. I know that I am running contrary to the opinion of a number of people in my electorate, but that fact never enters into my calculations. I always advocate what I think is the right thing for the people of Australia. The Treasurer asks what is to be done. That is the point. As we have gone as far as we have, we cannot let the thing go. That is absolutely impossible. We must have facilities for transport even in the northern portion of the Territory, to enable the people who will be able in course of time to settle on that portion where white people can live, to send their produce to the seaboard, and have it transhipped. I believe there are possibilities in the Northern Territory apart even from mining. There are portions of the country where white people undoubtedly can live. I have been told again and again that within 150, or even 200, miles from Port Darwin, white people can live and bring up families. White people can live in the Macdonnell Range country, and, in fact, the further you get inland from Oodnadatta, the better the climate for them. Especially, as far as the country about the Ranges is concerned, the place looks very fertile indeed. It would, therefore, be better to populate and develop this country from the south instead of from the north down. The building of a railway to the Katharine River to tap the cattle country may be the means of inducing people to take up more pastoral areas there, because, from what I have seen of the cattle and horses coming from those parts, it certainly must be an ideal country in spots. I believe the tablelands are the best breeding grounds for horses in Australia, and, perhaps, in any part of the world, and they may be used for breeding remounts for our military. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that even wheat can be grown there in the course of time, because there is a larger average rainfall at Alice Springs than there is at Pinnaroo or Loxton, in South Australia. It is absolutely futile to attempt to engage in ordinary European agriculture in the northern part of the Territory, say, from 150 to 200 miles from Port Darwin. I remember a man of the name of Otto Brandt, who came out from the Old Country many years ago. He was possessed of a fair amount of capital, and tried to grow everything under the sun in the Territory; but although he worked very hard indeed, he ended up by having to work on the roads. It is absolutely impossible to compete in tropical agriculture in the Northern Territory with a country like Java. </para>

So far as settling in the malarial part of the Territory is concerned, many South Australians went up there years ago, and returned invalided. I remember a strong young man who went there about ten years ago, and came back four years ago with fever and ague. </para>

                        <para>- I think that it may be . discussed with advantage at this stage. I rose, however, to deal not with the Northern Territory, but with a matter incidentally related to it, and particularly affecting Queensland. The honorable member for Boothby has anticipated me, but I do not agree with the views he has expressed. We have in the Northern Territory a bigger problem than many of us realize. For many centuries large numbers of natives have fished off take north coast of Australia, and it is certainly remarkable that none of them ever thought of permanently settling in the Northern Territory. The same class of natives did not hesitate to. settle ' on the coast of New Guinea, where they engaged in agriculture, and even made potteryware for their own use. There must be some reason for their failure to settle on the north coast of Australia, but what that reason is, I cannot say. Many of these native fishermen must have been wrecked from time to time during the monsoonal storms, and some must have made their way to the Australian coast. Then, again, one would think that they would have found it advantageous to settle on the north coast so as to be near their fishing-grounds, but, as I have said, they never did. lt is also peculiar that no big game is to be found in Northern Australia. </para>

                        <para>- About the time of the building of the Pine Creek railway, it increased, but since then there has been a decrease in the population. It seems to me that if the Territory is to be developed, it will be necessary in the early stages of our work to encourage people to take up land for the raising of horses and cattle, and especially sheep. I believe that stock could be raised with profit on the 29,000 square miles of magnificent country within the Barklay Tablelands, as well as on other fine patches within the Territory. The Government should encourage the people to take up land there for sheep and cattle breeding. </para>

                        <para>- And taken up under the leasehold system. I wish now to bring under the notice of the Postmaster-General, as well as the Minister of External Affairs, the position in regard to postal, telegraphic, and telephonic facilities in the Gulf country. For many years there have been a number of mail services, as well as telegraph repeating stations in that part of Queensland, but an effort is now being made to run the Department on business lines, and changes are being made. It is well known that such stations and mail services do not and cannot be expected to pay, but they link up the people in that remote portion of Australia with civilization. The Floraville telegraph station, at which people for many miles around have transmitted and received telegrams has been abolished. There is no township there; the station is the only building, but the convenience has always been much appreciated. In the Gulf district there must be nearly 1,000,000 head of cattle, and large sales of stock take place from time to time; but the Department has closed the Floraville station, and supplied a telephone service, some distance away, which cannot be used with any privacy. The people of this district have' been deprived of a service which they have enjoyed for some time. The same experience has befallen several other districts, the Department holding that it does not pay to retain these stations, while in the case of certain mail services they have asked the parties served to contribute very largely to the cost. I "recognise  that those who take up laud in these outback places are certainly not philanthropists. They go there to try to better their positions. But we must not lose sight of the fact that they are making it possible for others to follow them, and making life easier in our large cities. They therefore deserve every possible consideration, and I sincerely hope that the Postal Department will restore these services, and not view the matter from a purely business stand-point. The Government should be prepared to supply mail and telegraph services wherever there is a reasonable number of people to be served. The Gulf country near the coast is one of the most fertile spots in Australia. It has a rainfall of from 40 to 50 inches per annum and for about 200 miles inland such a thing as a drought is unknown. Quite a number of perennially flowing streams run into the Gulf, and some day, no doubt, their waters will be used for irrigation schemes designed to promote agriculture. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so. We are spending millions of money in an effort to develop the Northern Territory with the primary object of protecting ourselves from invasion. As the honorable member for Boothby has pointed out, however, it is absurd to think that an enemy would attempt to land a force there. In my opinion, the Gulf of Carpentaria, which runs 400 miles south from Cape York, would be preferred. At the head of the Gulf the enemy would be within easy distance of a railway line running to the eastern coast. </para>

                        <para>- Vessels at the present time go down the Gulf to various ports. If Australia is ever invaded from the north, -Port Darwin will not be the scene of operations. A hostile force landed there would have to travel nearly 2,000 miles overland to reach Adelaide, and at least 900 miles to reach Camooweal, a small hamlet on the Queensland border, where it would be still 300 miles from a railway. From the point of view of a layman, an enemy would be foolish to attempt to invade Australia from that point. I am aware that naval men say that no fleet would attempt to go down the Gulf, because if it did, it might be " bottled up " by a defending fleet. But once the attacking fleet reached the head of the Gulf of Carpentaria it could land men at a point where they would have a better chance of reaching the eastern portion of Australia than they would have from any other northern port. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so. The Gulf country is becoming depopulated. When the gold mines at Croydon were flourishing there was a much larger population in many of our Gulf ports than there is to-day. Population up there  is  steadily decreasing. I hold that the Government could very materially assist to keep population there by granting improved postal, telegraphic, and telephonic facilities. That part of Queensland,  I  regret to say, has been neglected by the State Government. Honorable members, on glancing at the map of Australia, will observe two very big indentations - the one being the Gulf of Carpentaria in the north, and the other Spencer Gulf in the south. These provide water communication for a greater portion of Australia than do any other ports in the Commonwealth. No pdrt serves a larger territory -than does the Gulf of Carpentaria, and it is remarkable that it should have been so long neglected. Something like 1,000.000 head of cattle and some millions of sheep are to be found there. </para>

                        <para>- They are. During a dry season in the south hundreds of thousands of cattle could be obtained from this part of Australia if there were reasonable means of transport. But at  present they are cut off from us by a tract of country over which they cannot be travelled. Improved travelling facilities should be provided. The Department grants a mail subsidy 'to a steamship company for delivering mails every three weeks to the Gulf ports, but passengers to Burketown have to travel for two days by a small boat, the <inline font-style="italic">Lily,</inline> under conditions which are scandalous. I hope that in the next mail contract care will be taken to insure the provision of better accommodation. The Treasurer asked the honorable member for Boothby what proposition he had to put before the Committee in regard to the development of the northern part of Australia. My suggestion is that negotiations should be entered into with the Queensland Government for the creation of a new territory comprising the Gulf country and portion of the Northern Territory served by Gulf ports. If we were to carve out a. new territory there, I do not hesitate to say that within ten years it would pay its own way. </para>

                        <para>- I . do not know whether it would or not. Queensland is doing nothing itself to develop the country. It is neglecting it in the most scandalous way. It is running railways from Cloncurry, within 160 or 180 miles of the Gulf, notwithstanding which, settlers have actually to carry their produce for a distance of 500 or 600 miles. To allow the Gulf country to be depopulated owing to its own criminal neglect, is a standing disgrace to the Queensland Government. </para>

                        <para>- I do not pretend, for a moment, that the mining industry settles people on the land. Take, for example, a place like Croydon. It had a large population when the mining industry was in full swing, but to-day its population has diminished very considerably. The mining industry has not settled people there permanently. But the difficulty in settling a lot of this country is that there is no railway communication. If there were railway communication to the Gulf, all the ores of the big copper and iron mining centres that exist between Cloncurry and the Leichhardt would be treated at one of the Gulf ports, and that work would employ a large number of people. Some day, I suppose that a good deal of irrigation will be undertaken in these parts. </para>

Owing to the fact that the wet season occurs in January, February, and March, maize can be grown there more prolifically than it can in any other part of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- Owing to the cheapness with which maize can be grown there, the industry could be carried on successfully. However, I have no desire to pursue the subject further. This afternoon the honorable member for Barrier brought up a question in regard to standing order No. 1. I confess that I would like to see that standing order wiped out of existence. That has been my desire ever since the first Standing Orders Committee was constituted. I have always held the view that as we were establishing a new Parliament with new ideas, it would be well for us to create our own precedents and practice. Had that course been adopted a good many of the difficulties that we have experienced would have been overcome. We have upon the table of this House one work - I refer to May's <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Practice</inline> - than which no more unsatisfactory publication can be found in any parliamentary institution. I admit the great ability of its author. My complaint is that first of all it lays down a certain procedure, which it says should be followed, and immediately afterwards it cites quite a number of exceptions to the rule. Thus, the man who is opposed to a certain course of action being followed is always able to cite a precedent. To me it is remarkable that whilst some of the State Parliaments of America are able to conduct their business with twenty-nine standing orders, we require 400 or more. That being so, -it is obvious that many matters must be left to the common sense of the person in control of the House, and surely we can adopt similar methods. I say, unhesitatingly, that four out of - every five irregularities which occur in this chamber have to be settled by the common sense of the  Chairman  of Committees, or of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> rather than by our Standing Orders. That will always be the case. The officer in charge of the House will always be called upon to extricate it from the tangles into which it will inevitably get. No genius can prevent it- from getting into those tangles. I have no hesitation in saying that while we have Standing Orders similar to standing order No. 1 any honorable member will be able to find ample precedent to justify any action which he may care to take. </para>

                        <para>- The Standing Orders have been revised several times, but no Government has been prepared to afford the necessary time to put a permanent set upon our table. Those under which we are working are merely temporary. In the early stages of this Parliament appeals were made by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Holder and others for a permanent set of Standing Orders, but, so far, no Government has afforded the necessary time for their preparation. In my judgment we should take the first opportunity of wiping out standing order No. 1. </para>

                    <para>.- In the first place I desire to draw attention to the fact that this Bill makes provision for the expenditure of £250,000 upon defence. In my stand upon- this matter I am very glad to know that- I have the support of one of the great morning newspapers of Victoria. Next year we must seriously take into consideration the manner in which we are drifting in the matter of military expenditure. The wealth of countries can we wiped out just as effectually by taxation as it can be by means of war. We are beginning to impose upon the people of the Commonwealth a burden out of all proportion to the national insurance effected. In my opinion our first and only line of defence should be of a naval character. Seeing that Australia is entirely surrounded by water, and that it is not within less than three weeks' -or one month's striking distance of the armies of any other country - I am referring to the time within which troops can be landed here after they have' been mobilized - it is obvious that whilst we have a single torpedo boat or a few submarines, anything more than a mere raid is out of the question. I admit that we have to accept these Estimates for the present year. They , cannot be classed as belonging to the Liberal party at all. In fact, the Liberal party declines to accept any responsibility for such extraordinary Estimates. They are a relic of the misgovernment and of the reckless expenditure and mismanagement of our predecessors. No matter in what direction we look, we shall find traces of that wanton extravagance. No country in the world could endure it. </para>

                        <para>- If I could lend the honorable member a little understanding, I would not mind; but it is impossible to effect a transference of that commodity. I can only hope that if he suffers he will suffer in silence. The deplorable feature in connexion with these Military Estimates is that the ex-Minister of Defence appears to have been unable to say "No." Although he had the advice of Lord Kitchener, and although the military Estimates were not supposed to exceed £1,800,000 half-a-dozen years hence, he seems to have been unable to say " No." That is why, within the short space of a couple of years, the expenditure has exceeded the estimate of Lord Kitchener by more than £1,000,000. </para>

                        <para>- I can quite understand the honorable member for Maranoa considering that this is terrible when the facts are brought to his notice. The honorable member has sufficient intelligence to recognise that every penny spent upon military service that is not absolutely necessary for national defence is a waste of the means of the mass of the people. Honorable members opposite iu this matter have acted contrary to the spirit animating the Labour party in every other country in the world. I have been asked by the honorable member for Indi why I try to enlighten honorable members opposite, and when I consider the outbreak on their part, I am tempted to believe that it is indeed a hopeless task. But if one repeats a thing often enough, honorable members opposite may get some glimmer of an idea concerning it, although they may never acquire a full understanding of the matter. </para>

                        <para>- Of course, I shall have to support this expenditure just as every member of the Labour party will be bound to support it, unless he wishes to pass a vote of censure on- the late Minister of Defence. These commitments, having been made, must be carried out. It does not matter whether I disagree or agree with this expenditure, it will be necessary to pass these votes this year, but next year the Liberal party will be in a position to put forward their own Estimates, and to put an end to the wanton extravagance upon military affairs that has recently taken place. It must be remembered that the members of the present Government came into office only three days before the close of the financial year. They had only about two days in which to cut down the Estimates of expenditure before them, and at most they could not, in the time, cut off more than about one one-hundred-and-eighty-third of the whole expenditure. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to place upon record my objections to the military extravagance of the late Labour Government. No clearer proof of that extravagance can be required than is to be found in the Estimates which have been placed before this House. We, on this side, cannot take the blame because the expenditure had practically been settled by the late Minister of Defence. It cannot be considered the expenditure of the Liberal party, because the financial year had practically opened when they came into power. In spite of the pruning by the present Government, and I believe there was terrible pruning- </para>

                        <para>- It was still impossible for the present Government to cut down the military expenditure as it should- have been cut down. I say that any party which continues this military extravagance should be swept away by the electors when it appears before them. Those who will contend that it is in the best interests of the country to allow this expenditure to go on must be unable to recognise where the true interests of the people really lie. I cannot repeat too often that the true defence of Australia is naval defence. While we have submarines and destroyers, no hostile power will ever dream 'of putting transport ships on the water to bring a force here to attack us. The military spirit is in honorable members opposite up to the hilt. They do not care how they burden the people with taxation, provided their idea of imposing upon them military rule is carried out. In no other country of the world would they be termed a Labour party. In every other country they would be termed a High Tory party, because it is only the highest Tory, party that is in favour of wanton extravagance in military matters. The idea of Liberals throughout the world is to bring about amity between nations, and- to establish a reign of peace. The so-called Labour party opposite desire to carry out a game of bluff in military matters. While there has been a wave of popular feeling in favour of military extravagance certain commitments have been made. </para>

                        <para>- I never had that meaning, and certainly did not intend to convey it. What I did intend to convey was that in other countries of the world, where there is military rule, one could understand the use of the military for shooting down strikers. In this country we have "boys of from fourteen to eighteen years of age being trained for military purposes, and if any of them are called out to prevent a strike, and are called upon to shoot, clearly we may have an instance of boys being called upon to shoot down their own fathers. </para>

Their ideas would not receive the approval of any Labour party in the world. They would be approved only by the House of Lords. </para>

                <para class="block">I am quite sure that every great earl, baron, and duke in' the House of Lords would be delighted to pass commendation upon honorable members opposite. It would appear as if they have been striving and working with the object of gaining the approval of such people. I say that our true defence is a naval defence, and that every penny expended upon defence should be expended in that way, beyond an amount sufficient to keep small bodies of men together to repel any passing raid. In these days of submarines, very fast torpedo boat destroyers, of aeroplanes, and wireless telegraphy, by the operation of which every single ship leaving any shore can be traced throughout a voyage, to talk in this light way of the necessity for expenditure upon Military Forces for Australia is to play a game of deceit among ourselves. Our training amounts to nothing. We require from our men only sixteen days' training in each year. If, out of 360,000 men, we took one in twelve, and gave them three months' training in each year, we should have a force of 30,000 solid? men at one-fifth of the present cost, that might be able to do something if mobilized, and would be the nucleus of a larger force of citizen soldiers who might be called? upon- to take their share in the military defence of Australia. If the real idea of honorable members opposite is to train young fellows that they may fee trans ported elsewhere in case of war with othercountries </para>

There are 360,000 odd men of military age, that as, persons over eighteen years of age. My honorable friends could have taken one man in every twelve, and have abolished the training of boys between fourteen and eighteen years of age, for that is not good for them. Every other country, even France, where- they train down to the age of fourteen years, has abolished conscription. In Germany, they do not call upon one-half of the men to come out, not only because- the expense of the training is so great, but because they recognise that, as. far as possible, the expenditure should, be kept down. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member is to be commended. I am glad that there is at least one just man amongst the Opposition. He has- my warm approval of his action. I trust that he will keep te that resolution during the rest of the year, and perhaps if he does, I may be able to get him to vote with me when I move that the military expenditure be cut down. As a navy is our primary line of defence, we may, possibly, have ' to take the opinions of naval experts, and see what can be done. I am one of those who believe that this- unit of ours is too far away from' the Fleet of the rest of the Empire to be of real value. I hold that the place of our unit is not out here. If we were quarrelling with a country in the East our first act would be to send our unit out of the way, so as to- enable it to combine with- the. units of the Empire, which would be hastening to our defence. To keep the unit out here would be to display want of sense and extravagance ; not a due preparation  for war. I admit that people may be looking at these matters from the political point of view, but I prefer to treat them from the defence stand-point. Whether the Fleet, of the Empire be large or small, it ought to be a united Fleet, because only in that way could it be of real value in time of war. In that matter there . is no question amongst naval or military experts. Military experts have already told, you that only a certain sum was needed for defence. Yet we have members of the Labour party out-Heroding Herod by saying that so much more should be. contributed than was thought necessary by them.. Reduce your force, take a ballot selecting one man in every twelve, practically abolish your conscription, select the best men - those with a spirit of volunteering in them - make use of all of those, and then you will have a useful force. </para>

                        <para>- In that case my honorable friends would, get a true, useful military force. Even then it would be a fairly large force, and one, I think, more than equal to any military necessity that is likely to happen in Australia. I know that a large number of persons are confusing this issue with the question of hygiene. They ask, " Is not the drilling of the boys a fine thing?" All that drill could be given at school infinitely more cheaply, and it could. be given not at odd times and in the evenings, as it is now given to boys from fourteen to eighteen years of age, but during a large part of their school life, the boys could be taught to form fours and to do company drill through the schools, as has been done in the past with the cadet system. We <inline font-style="italic">could</inline> take a certain amount of money and spend it in that way, but the training would be cheaply done, and just as effectively for those hygienic purposes which some persons seem to so much desire. Then there is the matter of education.  If we had to transfer the vote for educational purposes, perhaps, to assist some of the States with what we might call a semi-military education, well and good; there would be no more to be said. I have made these remarks about the defence expenditure, because the Labour party has abandoned what in other countries' has been held to be the duty of a Labour party, and that is to keep a general censorship over military matters. We cannot trust even to the Opposition in a matter like this, and on our party will be thrown the responsibility of seeing that these Estimates are kept within proper bounds, of saying to the military heads, " There is the annual sum that we -can afford, and you must do the best you can with it." So feeble was the administration of the Labour party in defence matters, that although it was pointed out to the late Minister that every country in the world had a system of pensions for military men, yet that which is one of the cardinal principles we should adopt to enable the country to retain the best men for defence was absolutely departed from. </para>

                    <para>.- There is a small reptile which is famed for its ability to change its colour. Running down the trunk of a tree it will be the colour of the bark of the tree. In less than the tenth part of a second - in the jump from the tree into the grass - it changes to the colour of grass. But that reptile is beaten in the race of changes by the honorable member for Werriwa. It does not take him a tenth part of a second to change his political opinions, to change his ideas to black or to white, as the second suits him. He had nothing to contribute to this debate, but purely for party purposes, and with the sole object of casting odium upon honorable members on this side, with whom at present he is not in political favour, he attempted some remarks on defence matters. There is no member of the House who knows less about finance than does the honorable member for Werriwa, and there is no honorable member who talks more about it. </para>

                        <para>- There is no man in the House who knows less about matters military or naval than does the honorable' member for Werriwa, and there is no honorable member who talks so much or so often about them as he does. Singularly enough, whenever he rises to discuss any question, there are interjections, because of the absurdity of his utterances, and invariably he says that he is unable to make honorable members understand him. That seems to me his everlasting tale. I am ' afraid that he did not even make his electors understand him, for had they understood him as we understand and know him in this Chamber, it is inconceivable that they would have ever so disgraced themselves as to send him here. That would have been outside of the possibilities of common sense. What have we had from the honorable gentleman this afternoon ? We have had a tirade intended to injure the ex -Minister of Defence, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> because he does not happen to be in the chamber to defend himself - a man who, during the last three years, accomplished work second to nothing that has ever been accomplished by a British Minister in a like period, despite the things he may not have done which he ought to have done. Work at which the strongest of men, with the greatest of mentality- and fineness of outlook, might have stood aghast, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> accomplished in such a manner, despite the fact that here and there it may be open to objections, reasonable and good, as to earn for himself the due commendation of the whole of the thinking world. But, of course, he has not received commendation from the honorable member for Werriwa.  ' </para>

                        <para>- The objects of the honorable member were, first, to cast odium upon that honorable gentleman, and, second, to affix some blame to this side, with the view of covering up his own political delinquencies of the moment.  His  tirade against expenditure on defence goes to the wind in a moment when honorable members on this side point out that, in spite of all that the honorable member said, and the vehemence he used, and the peculiar periods he adopted, he has not the moral courage to vote against £1 of the proposed expenditure. I like a man who will stand by his opinions, and who, having expressed them in this chamber, has the courage to say to his constituents, " I spoke against certain expenditure, and suited my actions to my words." But could there be any greater contrast than that between the actions of the honorable member for Werriwa and his constant eruptions in this House ? Day after day he rises in some part of the chamber and rages against the Labour party. The words "gross" and "extravagant" are his chief stock-in-trade. Whenever a financial subject is brought up, he jumps as if touched by a live wire, and declaims against those who now sit in Opposition; but not once do we find this wordy, windy gentleman voting against proposals for expenditure made by his own party. He dare not vote against such proposals. He has the courage to put into <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> tirades such as that in which he has just indulged, because he is aware that a large number of persons who do not know him as we do may accept his statements, but when the opportunity comes to put his words into action, when the enemy is in front and the guns are beginning to shoot, he is to be found behind the biggest stone that will cover him, and squeezes himself into the smallest compass that, a human being can be compressed into, lest he may be hurt. He would be justified in complaining if he would suit his actions to his words, but he has no intention of doing that. In matters of finance, the Treasurer can twist him round his finger. Whenever the Treasurer says, " Vote Conroy," Conroy votes. When the Prime Minister, referring to the vaccination business, said "Silence Conroy," Conroy was as quiet as could be. The honorable member says nothing against his own side, because his fellow members would not put up with it. Therefore, he is forced to orate about what happened last year, and to omit all reference to what is happening now, and to what he could stop if he had the courage to vote as he speaks. He has only to vote against any proposal to which he objects, and it cannot be carried. He tells us that he is free, and he may be free, so far as the Werriwa division is concerned, but he is not free so far as the Fusion is concerned. Were he to revolt, the party would put the whip on the tender spot, and the roaring member for Werriwa would be silent at once. You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> would not allow me to characterize his statements as infamous, but to say that our defence system is such as to make it likely that the boys would be called out to shoot their fathers is an infamous statement. Could there be a more astounding, cruel and wicked assertion ? Am I not justified in speaking of a statement which would associate such a possibility with the party to which I belong as infamous? Did the honorable member know the mere alphabet of the Defence Act, he would know that boys cannot be called out to shoot their fathers or to suppress strikes. As a member of the. Fusion party, the honorable member for Werriwa is doing his best to foment strikes, and is opposing every effort that we, as a Labour party, make to secure industrial peace. He is of the party that stabs the industrial community, forcing it to rise in revolt to secure ordinary human conditions. It is the conditions which he, because of his political views, upholds, that force men into industrial struggles, which the workers deplore, and would avoid if they could. I shall not occupy the time of the Committee by dealing in detail with the honorable member's remarks, but it seemed necessary to say a few words to show how deplorably hollow were the utterances of the honorable member.  His  statements regarding the defence system will hot bear a moment's examination, and I do not know any other member of the House who would give utterance to them. They show that the honorable member for Werriwa has not read the Act. </para>

                        <para>- I am sorry if I have done so. I am not allowed to say that the honorable member for Werriwa, in speaking of the Estimates as the Estimates of the Labour party, made a misstatement, but I say that it was a misstatement which stamps him as so utterly unfit to be in public life that one is aghast at the thought of him remaining here any longer. Not a figure of these Estimates is to be charged to the Labour party. The Prime Minister has said that the Estimates are those of the Labour party, because he would say anything for party purposes, but the Treasurer, thank Heaven, is above that.; he has not said it. The present Ministry is wholly and solely responsible for the Estimates now before us. It could have reduced them, or increased them, as it thought fit. </para>

                        <para>- I said that the Prime Minister would say anything for party purposes, and if exception is taken to that statement, I withdraw it in compliance with our procedure. The party to which I belong has no responsibility for the Estimates. As a matter of fact, the defence proposals for this year are larger than those for last year, and the difference is not attributable to commitments. Had the present Ministry desired it could have cut down the Estimates by £1,000,000, and if it proposed . such a reduction we, on this side, would not oppose it.. Let the honorable member for Werriwa, if he is sincere, persuade the Ministry that he supports to reduce the Estimates. Instead of trying to throw odium on the labour party, he should plead with his Ministry to treat the Estimates as he desires them to be treated. So far as the Loan Bill is concerned, the Labour party would have reduced the proposals that it contains had we been allowed, but we were " gagged. " It is my hope that in another place these proposals will be reduced, so far as -defence is concerned, and if they send back the Bill to us with an amendment, the honorable member for Werriwa will be put to the test. We shall' see then whether he has again changed his colour, or whether he will vote as hespeaks. </para>

I may, in the first place, assure the Committee that the Governments concerned are, in my opinion. fairly seized of the essential facts for decision. The representations which have been exhaustively made by such bodies as the Associated Churches, which met on the 13th June last, at Paama, and forwarded resolutions, not only to me, but to other honorable members, have been communicated to the Imperial Government; as has also the report of a deputation which subsequently waited on me. There will be sent, too, by next mail, the report of a representative deputation which met me in Adelaide on the 17th of this month. Its members comprised representatives of the Church of England, of the Presbyterian Mission, and of the Church of Christ, who have had a zealous and disinterested connexion with the New Hebrides for a period extending over sixty-four years. </para>

Perhaps I might here give a few of the facts with which we have to deal. There are forty islands, and I may take Vila as the central position, seeing that it is the seat of Government. Vila is distant about 1,140 miles from Sydney, and 1,300 miles from Auckland ; and I find that the population of the forty islands consists of 64,500 natives, and 844 Europeans. I am now giving statistics which I have personally collected; and, though they are not exactly those of the French authorities, they are approximately the same. Of the European population, 556 are French, and 288 British, and that, to some extent, may throw light on the question of recruiting. We hear more of recruiting on the French part than on the British, apart altogether from the question of whether the conditions of the Convention have been broken. I notice that, on the British side, the recruits indentured under the Convention in 1910 totalled 429, while on the French side the number was 1,173, or just about in proportion to the two populations. In 1908 there was a more marked difference, the French figure being 2,262, and the British 594. I should also mention, since the question of the future of the islands may or may not in the near future be raised, that Fiji, the nearest British Possession, is about 500 miles to the East, and the Solomon Islands about 500 miles to the north-west. We should not omit consideration of New Caledonia, which in size is much beyond any of the group of the forty islands, and the resources of which are different. New Caledonia has mining resources which have been fairly tested, and such resources are not to be found in the New Hebrides. On the other hand, looked at from the point of view of strategy - and the question must be raised sooner or later in connexion with the islands - we, as Australians, must have a direct interest in these islands as affecting our connexion with the Empire. I use the word " direct," because, while we share the interests of the Empire, whose fate is ours, we have a direct connexion with the international policy of the New Hebrides. In New Caledonia, there are, 1 believe, no harbors worth talking of, while we understand, from the work of Florence Grimshaw, that, in the New Hebrides, there are three splendid harbors. New Caledonia has an area of 7,600 square miles, as against 5,800 square miles in the New Hebrides. New Caledonia is situated 1,058 miles from Sydney, and 758 miles from Brisbane. The population is about 50,000, of whom 28,000 are kanakas, while, from the last report, I think there are 3,500 Japanese in the mines. </para>

                        <para>- Those are the last figures I could obtain; and I think there was an excess stated by some deputation. I cannot say. that the figures are strictly accurate. These are what I may call the islands which come within the purview of discussion in . connexion with the New Hebrides. Let me now put the position shortly in regard to this Government. In 1887, the Naval Commission was appointed by the Governments of France and Great Britain to maintain order throughout the group. This Commission was connected, not with the internal government, but, generally, with the maintenance of order throughout the group. About 1905, it was felt that perhaps the Naval Commission could not do everything that was required, and that it was necessary a Commission should be appointed to deal with the question of land titles, in which both British and French subjects are interested. The French Government asked that the scope of the Commission should be extended so as to cover the consideration of what measures should be taken, under the acknowledged defect of the absence of jurisdiction, in relation to the natives in  the islands. It seems that, to a large extent it was on the suggestion of the French Government that the next arrangement in the form of a Condominium -which applies to the islands now was entered into. The Condominium was entered into about November, 1907, and its general principle, as set forth in the preamble, is that the New Hebrides, Banks Islands, and Torres Islands should form a region of joint influence, in which the subjects and citizens of Great Britain and France respectively shall enjoy equal rights of residence and personal protection and trade, each of the said two Powers retaining jurisdiction over its own subjects and citizens, and neither exercising a separate control over the group, and that the subjects and citizens of other Powers shall enjoy the same rights, and should be subject to the same obligations, as British subjects or French citizens. Honorable members will see that it is emphasized that neither Power is to exercise  exclusive control over the group; that still remains within the control of the Naval Commission, whose appointment was confirmed by Article 6 of the Convention. In other words, its duty was to maintain order throughout the group. Within the group there is the Joint Court presided over by a Spanish Judge, Count de Buena  Esperanza;  a French Judge, M. Jean  Colonna;  and an English Judge, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Roseby.</inline> The language may be either French or English, but that generally used is French. I believe that sometimes great difficulty is caused by the fact that there has to be double translation; in fact, parties to a particular suit often have to have the evidence which may be given in French translated into English, or the other way about. </para>

                        <para>- I do not say that there is any difficulty in the way of reluctance to give the translation, but there must be incidental difficulty, where, perhaps, a French Judge may not be as conversant with the English language as is the English Judge. I know the  President  of the Court can speak English, and when I have had the pleasure of conversing with him in my broken French, we, with the help of the Spanish Consul, managed to get through a two hours' conference. But, apart from the fact that we cannot always be as explicit as we ought to be, for even in this House there is some difficulty in bringing about an apprehension of the facts of a case - clearness is affected - through a double translation. I am stating these dry facts because they are essential to the' understanding of the case as presented by the deputations, and because they may be useful for reference. The jurisdiction of this Joint Court extends, in civil suits, including commercial cases, over all suits respecting land in the group, and over suits of every kind between natives and non-natives; secondly, in police and criminal cases, over every offence or crime committed by natives against non-natives; and, thirdly, generally over the particular offences constituted by the present Convention, in the regulations, for the purpose of carrying it out. Honorable members will observe that the Court has no jurisdiction in criminal cases against non-native respondents, except where the case is one arising out of the terms of the Convention itself. These offences are very few; but where an act of violence, for instance, is committed by a Frenchman or an Englishman against a native, the Court has no jurisdiction; it is the National Court of the defendant that has to entertain the charge' against him. It is from this fact that the greatest trouble seems to arise. </para>

                        <para>- As a matter of fact, the French are tried by their own Courts in criminal cases, except such cases as  directly arise from the terms of the Convention. These latter cases are generally not criminal, but have to do with offences to which a penalty only attaches, connected, as regards labour, with the terms of indentures entered into with the natives. If, in the course of kidnapping, a murder occurs, then the jurisdiction is not in the Joint Court, but in the Court of the defendant charged - that is, the French or English Court, as the case may be. In the Court the law applies in civil cases, including commercial cases. For land disputes, the principles, as laid down by the present Convention, apply, and, for other disputes, the law of the country to which the non-native party belongs, or the legal system applicable to him . In police and criminal cases, the law is that applicable to the non-native party injured; that is, in all cases of a criminal character it is the law of the English or French- party charged that is applicable. In the case of other offences, the principles that apply are those laid down by the present Convention, or the regulations framed for the purpose of carrying it out.- Besides the Joint Court, there are the National Courts to which I referred, and which practically have the greater part of the criminal jurisdiction. The weakness in the working of this system seems to be that the Joint Court has practically no power to enforce its own decisions. It can fine from 4s. to £20 for breaches of the Convention, and can, I believe, imprison up to three months; but the fines are utterly inadequate to some of the breaches. I need scarcely say that to indenture a number of females without the permission of the husband, as the Convention prescribes, or without the permission of the head of the house in the case of a widow or single woman, is a serious crime in view of the moral questions that arise, and for such offences a comparatively small fine is quite inadequate. Besides, the remission of penalties is placed, not in the hands of the Executive, as we understand the Executive, because there is really none in the group, but in the hands of the Resident Commissioner of the defendant ; that is, the French Resident Commissioner' has power to remit penalties imposed on French residents by the Court, and the English Resident Commissioner has the same power in the case of - English defendants. It is said by ' deputations that the French ' </para>

                <para class="block">Court remits penalties, and that in some trials the charges are not at all  proportionate  to the offences. For instance,  in  the kidnapping case, in which a man was shot, it was said that the charge which should have been considered one of manslaughter was merely assault, and the man was let off as a first offender. These are some of the allegations put before me. </para>

It is my duty in submitting  representations  to the Home Government, with the view to their being forwarded to the French Government, so far as  it  is reasonably possible, to sift these statements, and to see that they  are  sufficiently tested as to their accuracy; but beyond that, from official sources alone, I believe there are several matters sufficiently established to be capable of being brought before both Governments. I need not go into all  the  weaknesses of the Convention. There  are  several flaws in it. For instance, there is the provision against the supply of firearms to the natives, but Miss Grimshaw says, that notwithstanding this provision, the New Hebrides are practically an  explosives  magazine. Firearms seem  to be  very freely and wantonly used, not  for  crimes, but in a general way throughout the islands, and that may be due to the f .a0t that shot-guns are excepted, and shotguns are quite  as  effective as rifles  in,  times of peace. Then, again, there  is  a difficulty that the Naval Commission  is  not very frequent in its visitations to  certain  parts of the islands. I believe that the British man-of-war clears out  in the  hurricane season. Sometimes the French boat remains during the hurricane season, but as the vessels of both Powers must act jointly,  an  island must await a visit from both warships before  the  Commission can have jurisdiction, and  in  the meantime a man who may have been arrested is kept and treated as  if  convicted. There was one case where  a  man at Vila was kept for eleven months before trial, which is very harsh procedure  against a native. Seeing that we are of the white race, and interested in the welfare of these coloured races with which we come into such close relationship, this must strike us as exceedingly harsh treatment. I shall not detail all the weaknesses of the Convention. There were some pointed out in 1905 by the then Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> in a communication sent to the Imperial Government. We have also recently communicated with the Imperial Government, drawing their attention to the fact that the established weaknesses - I am using the word " established " authoritatively, not only on. what has been said, but on sources that are official - were foreshadowed in a communication of 1905, after the terms of the Convention has been accepted, and it was too late for effective criticism. It was stated in one despatch - </para>

                    <para>What is desired by us is the establishment of uniform conditions so as to secure perfect equality of treatment of all persons, French or English, an equal degree of cognisance of their wrong doings, and an impartial allotment of punishment where such is merited. It is felt that this will be almost impossible to be maintained under the system of separate tribunals administering separate systems of law which  will  in no way be bound by each other's decisions. It is. easy to conceive how serious difficulties may arise through the peoples, of two nations living under sets of laws which in important features, or in administration, may produce or permit undesirable discriminations. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot recall the exact words, but that is the sentiment of the despatch, I think. We have at times called attention to the desirableness of the Colonies directly and approximately affected, being consulted, if possible, by the Imperial Government, before a serious decision is come to. I remember drawing up a memorandum to that effect in connexion with the Declaration of London, and the present Leader of the Opposition was a party to a resolution carried at the Imperial Conference of 1911, directed to that very same end. The liquor question in the New Hebrides is another matter that seriously affects the maintenance of order. It is said that liquor is sold freely to the natives, although it is enjoined by the terms of the Convention that that shall not be done; and, showing the inequality of the punishment, owing to the distance from the seat of jurisdiction, in one case a man was fined £8 for illegally selling liquor - very often these fines are not collected - and the costs incurred were £80, whereas had he been tried at Vila, instead of where he was, the costs would have been about £2. That holds in a good many cases, I understand, throughout the exercise of jurisdiction. </para>

                        <para>- There is an age prescribed, and it is said that, at times, children are recruited. I have seen official documents in which complaints are made, though a little more qualified, perhaps, than the statements presented to me on the subject from other sources.' I have endeavoured to get at the French views as well as the English. In the matter of land claims, an important feature is that, as soon as the Court is fully constituted again - the  President  of the Joint Court is now in Europe, and his presence there may help - the hearings of claims will be commenced. They have not been taken so far, because, first of all, a number of regulations had to be made which, the  President  of the Joint Court told me a couple of months ago, had only just been approved of by file two Governments;, also, a period of twelve months is allowed for caveats to be entered against claims. However, these hearings will soon come off. But till 1910, the French were alive to their interests, and their Topographical and Survey Department were engaged in the appraisement of claims. The total number on behalf of the Societies Francaise, which I believe is the leading claimant in these islands, covered 1,900,000 acres, whereas the total British claims amounted to 350,000 acres. </para>

                    <para>.- I am surprised that the Government have come down with another Supply Bill. On the occasion of the last Supply Bill, I understood the Treasurer to say that it would be the last for the session; but to-day we are confronted with another, and, later on, probably we shall have still another. The Treasurer finds great pleasure in bringing forward these Supply Bills, and in spending money. He imagines he can get it easily and spend it easily. There is one item to which I wish to draw attention. I feel that the Postal Department is being starved for want of funds. I feel it is under-capitalized, and, I believe, that is one reason, why it is not paying. Until the Government capitalize the Postal Department, and bring it up to date,, they will never get a proper result from the Department. I know the Postmaster-General is in great difficulty. I notice that he has to answer more questions than any other member of the Cabinet, and this will continue until the Treasurer agrees to supply him with an additional £1,000,000, in order "that the Department may be brought up to date. The Treasurer has many millions he is playing with, and an extra million will be nothing to him. The Postmaster-General cannot get sufficient to carry out many of the works he has in hand ; and if he cannot get the money to complete these works, he will have a continuation of the troubles that already exist in his Department. The Postmaster-General will be pleased to admit that the Brisbane Post Office is the most up to date in the Commonwealth. That is not because that post-office has greater facilities, or because there is a greater supply of money for its use than in other cases,, but because there is in. Brisbane a  Deputy  Postmaster-General who is the most, competent officer in the whole of the Postal Department. It is due to this officer that the post-offices throughout Queensland are more up to date ; that, the telephone system in Queensland is more- satisfactory ; and that the whole service is in a more satisfactory condition than will be found in any other State of the Commonwealth. This is a matter which should receive consideration. I suppose this officer is one of the most miserably paid civil servants in the Commonwealth in comparison with the work he has done. Though he has been in Queensland for very few years, he has brought the service up to date; but he is not paid a salary commensurate with the work he is performing, and I think it is due to him that the Postmaster-General should ask for an increase in his Estimates for the purpose of increasing the salaries of the  Deputy  Postmasters-General throughout the Commonwealth. I wish to draw special attention to this matter, because, when residents of Queensland travel to other places, and have to use telephones, or post-offices, or anything else in connexion with the Postal Department, they find that they are not as up-to-date as they are in Queensland. That is one reason why I think the Postmaster-General should give some attention to the increase of salaries promised by the late Government. They should honour the commitments left behind by their predecessors. These were thoroughly justified, and it was the duty of the Government to give them consideration when bringing forward their Estimates. So far, they have not done so ; and post-offices all over the Commonwealth require more attention than the Government apparently intend to give them. The Central Office in Melbourne is in a perfectly disgraceful condition. The office where the public write their telegrams is hardly fit for anybody to go into, and the conditions under which the attendants have to work there are simply deplorable. I hope the Postmaster-General will bring this Department up to date, and in a manner that will do the Government credit. Many post-offices require attention in my own State, and we have been hammering away at the Department for a considerable time without, up to the present, getting any satisfaction. In South Brisbane, which is growing very rapidly, there is hardly a place worth calling a post-office at all. Old-age pensions are paid there, and the pensioners have to travel considerable distances. There is no accommodation for the purpose, the work being done in a little office about 6 feet by 6 feet. The pensioners crowd in there every fortnight, and many of them have to wait three or four hours before they receive their money. This place in particular should receive some consideration. Big works have been established in the neighbourhood, and, quite recently, many factories have started there. This is the only office in which their people can do any business. I trust the Treasurer will increase the Postmaster-General's Estimates by at least another £1,000,000. Nothing under that amount will bring the post-offices of the Commonwealth up to date, and, until they are brought up to date, we shall not get the results that we should get from them. </para>

                        <para>- Then the honorable member will have to give him another £1,000,000. I would urge him to take into serious consideration the miserable state of the South Brisbane Post-office. Another part of the district which is thickly populated, and almost without postal facilities altogether, is Wynnum. I think there are about 1,200 houses there, and the postal accommodation is entirely inadequate. There are two or three little offices in the district, but none of them can really be classed as post-offices at all. The residents have already applied for a central office. That suburb is practically divided into three divisions - Wynnum, Wynnum South, and Manly, and the people are absolutely in need of more up-to-date postal accommodation. I know the Postmaster-General does not know a great deal about the Department in Queensland, personally, but he has a most competent  deputy,  who is doing his best to bring the post-office up-to-date, but is suffering, like the Postmaster-General himself, from want of funds. Even if we are losing a fair amount of money in connexion with the Postal Department, we must recognise the great service that it is to the people of the State, and should seriously consider capitalizing it in a different manner from the present. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly. Any honorable member who has occupied the position of Postmaster-General will readily recognise that something must be done to bring the Department up to date. The Minister is continually worried by people from every part of Australia to do work that it is absolutely necessary should be done, but I know that the revenue earned by the Department is not sufficient to enable him to make any reasonable start to carry out the work in anything like  a business fashion. Something in the nature of the suggestion of the honorable member for Eden-Monaro, who has had experience in connexion with the Department, should be adopted. When the Estimates are considered I hope the honorable member will lead the way in pressing the Government to increase the amount set down. I think the Queensland office has been more successful, and that a greater amount of revenue has been derived from the working of it, than in the  case of any other office in Australia. The revenue in eight years has just doubled. In 1905 the revenue from the Postal Department in Queensland was £330,000. At the end of the last financial year it had increased to £662,000. Much of this result can, I think, be attributed to the  Deputy  Postmaster-General in Brisbane, who is thoroughly alive to his work, and any Postmaster-General who has recently held office will readily recognise that he is one of the most competent officers in the Department. I understand that he was due for an increase in salary before the late Government went out of power. </para>

This officer is justly entitled to it, having done more in connexion with postal work in Queensland than any other man who has been there. He has enabled the Postal Department to be brought up to date and placed on a thoroughly sound basis. Greater revenue is being derived to-day than would have been the case had another man been in his place. </para>

The Chief  Clerk  in Brisbane is, I understand, classed as a second-class officer, and is receiving only £500 per annum, whereas, in Sydney and Melbourne, men holding similar positions are classed as first-class officers, and are receiving £700 per annum. I do not think that there should be that difference. The business done in the Brisbane General Post Office is almost as large as that done in either the Sydney or the Melbourne General Post Office. </para>

                        <para>- I do not say that it is as large, but it is increasing so rapidly that it will not be long before it is. The Postmaster-General, I think, will admit that postal business in Queensland has largely increased, and that that increase is due entirely to the good work done by his Deputy in that State. He will admit that the Deputy Postmaster-General of Queensland is a most competent officer, and I hope that he will bring him into line with the other Deputies in the matter of salary. I trust that he will also increase the salary of the Chief Clerk, whose remuneration is very much below that of officers holding similar positions in New South Wales and Victoria. The disparity between the salary of the Deputy Postmaster-General of Queensland and those received by the Deputy Postmasters-General of New South Wales and Victoria is not as great as is the disparity between the salary of the Chief Clerk of the General Post . Office, Brisbane, and those of the Chief Clerks in Melbourne and Sydney. Some of the heads of Departments are already down for increases, and I hope that the Postmaster-General will carry out the suggestion of his advisers in this connexion. The letter-sorters in the Brisbane General Post Office are much dissatisfied with the system under which any one of their number who is due for an increase has to appear before an Advisory Board consisting of other letter-sorters in the Department, which, if it is not wholly satisfied that he should receive an increase - perhaps for some reason not connected with  his office - may recommend that it be not granted. They are under the impression that undue influence may be brought to bear to prevent them getting an increase when they should receive one. The Board is not working satisfactorily. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member has probably, during his lifetime, obtained things for which he has asked, and has been dissatisfied when he has got them. I think the Postmaster-General, if he consults his experts, will be able to find a more satisfactory method of dealing with this matter. About two years ago a postal officer in Brisbane suggested to the authorities that, in view of the number of typewriting machines used in the Department, tenders should be invited for the manufacture of the machines required by it. That suggestion was never recognised; but I understand that, since it was made, the Department has let a contract for the manufacture of typewriters, and that the change is likely to prove a very profitable one. The officer who made the suggestion should receive the credit to which he is entitled, and should be granted an honorarium for having made such a valuable proposition. The Postal Department in" every State appears to be seething with discontent. This is largely due to the poor pay received by many officers. I hope that the Postmaster-General will give some attention to my representations. I know that he is always prepared to consider any reasonable suggestion made to him, and X am confident that, if he can induce the Treasurer to agree to a considerable increase in the Postal Estimates, and will adopt the suggestions I have made, his Department will be improved, and that more satisfactory results will be obtained from it.  </para>

                    <para>.- I feel sure that the speech just made by the honorable member for Oxley has struck a sympathetic chord in the breast of the Postmaster-General, and, whilst he is in a sympathetic mood, I hope that he will give attention to some other matters of considerable importance to his Department to which I propose to refer. We have to recognise, I suppose, that shortage of funds is his greatest difficulty in carrying out a number of important works in connexion with his Department, and especially in regard to the construction, of telephone lines in country districts. It has been impressed upon this House time and again that the value of telephone lines in the development of country districts cannot be overrated. Let us consider, for a moment, the procedure adopted in connexion with the erection, of telephone lines, and; having done that,. I shall make a suggestion which, I think, the Postmaster-General might very well convert into a departmental practice. When application is made for the construction of a telephone line in a country district, a report is called for by the Department, and an inspector comes along and deals with the matter from what he considers to be a departmental point of view. The requirements and the convenience of the public seem to be regarded as matters of secondary importance. I do not attach any blame to the officer,, but he undoubtedly approaches the matter from a purely departmental standpoint. Having made an inspection, he proceeds to estimate the revenue likely to be received from the line on the basis of the departmental rates generally in vogue.. The Department then makes an estimate,, and, I understand, considers the construction of the line on the basis of a 10 per cent, revenue, extending over a period of eight years. The departmental estimate,, however, very often - and I am referring to cases where it does - shows that the line cannot possibly be constructed, as the residents desire, as a profitable undertaking. A proposal is then made by the Department that the residents of the district should either enter into a guarantee to bear a proportion of the loss, or that, they should make a contribution in money or the equivalent in materials or labour.. These limitations are often very onerous and obnoxious to country residents. They feel that the departmental estimate; of revenue is not a fair one, and that the? question has not been approached from a proper stand-point. The Department often will not take into consideration any profit to be gained by the lines already constructed, from the construction of the new line. In other cases, where a line asked for is a cross-country one, and!  would relieve very considerably the pressure on the main line, that consideration is not taken into account. Furthermore, the estimate of Revenue is always based on the fixed charges in force in connexion with the use of telephones. Country residents feel that these estimates are on a conservative basis. ' I would suggest that where country residents desire the construction of a line, and their estimate of the revenue likely to be derived from it does not agree with that made by the Department, the line should be constructed, subject to special charges being made for its use. If rates in excess of those usually levied are charged in connexion with that line, they must necessarily give an increased revenue. </para>

                        <para>- If the line would prove a public convenience, and its construction is urged on that ground, then the business that would be done would be a purely local business. That being so, the people to be served would undoubtedly be prepared to pay special rates to secure the convenience. Applicants for a telephone line always start out with the statement that it will pay. If they believe it will pay, then they can have no objection to the imposition of special rates, on the understanding that, if a profit is shown, the rates shall be reduced from time to time, until they come down to the normal charges made by the Department. If that course were adopted, we should ultimately have such a line working under normal conditions. If, on the other hand, the special rates required to be maintained, then, I feel sure that the people served by the line would be prepared to pay those special rates in return for the convenience so obtained. </para>

                        <para>- I know that is so. But if it could be shown that a line was not paying, and would not pay under ordinary conditions, there could be no reason whatever for reducing the special rate. If the Department is properly administered, then an agitation for the reduction of special rates, in these circumstances, could have no foundation. If, on the other hand, the working of the line shows that the departmental estimate is entirely wrong, and that special rates should not be imposed, the rates should be reduced. On the other hand, if the contention of the local residents proved to be inaccurate, no claim could be made for the reduction of the special rates to the ordinary rates. At the present time I have in my mind a case in which the Department is asking the local residents to subscribe a very large sum towards the construction of a particular line. The departmental estimate of the -cost of that line is one-third more than that of the residents. As evidencing how incorrect is the departmental estimate, I may mention that one resident is prepared to construct a line of greater length from the proposed terminal point to his own place of business, and he assures me that the revenue payable by him in respect of his own suggested line will more than exceed' the departmental estimate throughout. If he is right, I say unhesitatingly that the residents in question should not be deprived of that line. On the other hand, if they are wrong they can have no objection to paying the special rate to insure its construction. I would especially commend this proposal to the Postmaster-General. Ample power is given under section 97 of the Post and Telegraph Act to frame a regulation to provide for such cases. If people back up their opinions by agreeing to pay these rates, there will be a very considerable extension of the telephonic services in the country districts, and there will also be a means of determining' whether the estimates of the Department or those of the local residents are right in regard to the construction of these lines. There is just one other matter to which I desire to refer, namely, contract post-offices. In the case of a large number of these offices the contractors are being paid very small sums - amounts altogether out of proportion to the value of the work done. That, however, is not the worst feature of the position. When a new contract is let, the remuneration in some cases is still further reduced. In certain instances a reduction has been made even where the volume of the mail matter has increased. I know of one instance in which there has been a slight reduction in payment, notwithstanding that the mail service has- been increased from a tri-weekly to a daily one. </para>

                        <para>- I know that, and I suppose that the scale of remuneration is based upon some general principle. But it does seem a curious thing that what was considered less than an adequate remuneration for a fair amount of work should now be regarded as an adequate remuneration for double the amount of work. Either the old system was radically wrong, or the new system is one of sweating. I would suggest to the Postmaster-General that he should carefully revise the allowances payable to these contractors, especially in country districts. </para>

I have never approached any Postmaster-General with a view to securing a concession in the city, and I have never opposed the extension of telephonic facilities to the country. Our postal rates should be such that everybody can take advantage of them. </para>

                <para>Mr.TUDOR. - It does not. I see that it returns a profit of about £23,000 per annum. I gather that last year, although there was a loss on the Postal Branch of £85,000 in four of the States, there was a profit of £108,000 in two of the States, of which amount Victoria contributed £102,000. Though there was a profit for the Postal, Telegraphic, and Telephonic Branches in Victoria of £8,000 last year, there was a loss of £190,000 in New South Wales. </para>

                        <para>- I am anxious to deal with the matter on the same basis as that adopted by the present Prime Minister when he was on this side. I find that the deficiency of £444,000 on last year's transactions, to which the honorable gentleman referred, will he increased to £602,000 this year. Last year the estimated expenditure on works and buildings was £1,152,000; this year the estimated . expenditure under the same head is £1,350,000; and, in addition to that, there is an estimated expenditure from loan of £595,000. This year the total estimated receipts of the Post and Telegraph Department ' are put down at £4,587,230, whilst the estimated expenditure is £7,134,378. The expenditure on the Post and Telegraph Department this year is estimated to exceed the revenue of the Department by £2,547,148, whereas last year it was only about £1,600,000. It is not unreasonable to assume that our telephonic and telegraphic facilities are not used -by more than 2 per cent, of the community, and it would appear that our rates for the use of. the facilities are not high enough. I do not say that the money- expended upon telegraphic and 'telephonic communication is thrown away, because I trust that the expenditure will yet be reproductive; but when we are asked to spend on this Department £2,500,000 more than we shall receive from revenue, it is time we looked' into the rates we are charging for the facilities afforded. ' In the booklet to which I have referred," the present Prime' Minister charges the late Government with conducting a "-financial carnival," and going in for an " orgy of extravagance " ; but the honorable gentleman's own Estimates presented this year show that the present Government are proposing an excess expenditure in connexion with this Department more than £900,000 greater than the excess with which the late Government were charged. If the Post and Telegraph Department is not paying, and only a small section of the com-' munity receives any advantage- from its operation, it is time we inquired into it: It is possible that the 2 per cent, who make use of the facilities afforded are getting them at much too cheap a rate, and certainly the other 98 per cent. - of the community should not be called upon' to pay for the extra advantages which  other people enjoy. </para>

It is clear, .therefore, that the Estimates now before honorable members are the Estimates of the present Government, and they must stand by them. The honorable - member for Werriwa aired his ignorance here this afternoon. He said that the present Government assumed office only three days before the close of the last .financial year,, and could, therefore, at most, have -only reduced the Estimates of the last Government by .one one-hundred-and-twenty-third. The fact is that the Estimates now before us are the Estimates of -expenditure for this, year, -and not for last year, .and the present Government came into office five days before the termination of the last financial year, so they had ample time to' prepare this year's Estimates. I feel sure that the Treasurer is prepared to take full responsibility for -every figure in the present Estimates as "his own. </para>

I am dealing now with the Treasurer's ' questions. When the right honorable gentleman was in Opposition, he used to ask in July, August, and sometimes in September: "When is the Treasurer going to introduce the Budget?" That question came from the right honorable, gentleman as regularly as a record from a gramophone: After September the right -honorable gentleman used to ask, " When are we going to have the Auditor-General's report?" I asked the right honorable gentleman that question last Friday. The present' Attorney-General and the present Prime Minister were accustomed to denounce the late Government" because the Auditor-General's report was not laid on the table of this House soon enough. They used to say, " Let us have it before the Estimates are' discussed." </para>

                        <para>- On the 19th August this year, when speaking on the no-confidence motion, 1 raised the question as to whether the present Government had not committed a financial blunder in allowing the sugar companies to take out of bond sugar on which Excise duty should have been paid. At the time I had only a reply from the Minister, of Trade and Customs to guide me as to how far the blunder had gone. The honorable gentleman followed me on the 19th August", which- is over three months ago, and he said, that the Government had sent out telegrams that day. </para>

                        <para>- I do not 'say that it was robbed; but it was the financial incapacity of the present Government which allowed the sugar-refiners to ' get money to which they had 'no right. I candidly admit that I would not give 19s: far 'every £1 that the Commonwealth will get from them. I do not think that it will get all the money. The Colonial Sugar. Refining Company said -that, they -were going to pay up; but why. do they not? Seeing that a law was passed about a month ago, why does' not the Attorney-General take action to secure the money? I am told that the Government will act in good time. Apparently, they can hand, back cheques to . the. rich coal companies which were concerned in the Vend, case, but cannot collect the cheques from the other fellows. In: dealing , with the Post. Office, I omitted to mention one point According to the balance-sheet, the Department i» debited with certain money with which I think it should not be debited. Under our oversea mail contract, we"- have to pay an extra sum for' compliance with certain conditions' which were laid down for. the carriage of butter, fruit, and meat. That is not, I think, a proper charge to make against the Department. There are other debits. </para>

                        <para>- It will be just as easy to debit the amount to another Department as to the Postal Department. The honorable member for Kennedy mentioned this afternoon that the Commonwealth is compelled to ran a service down the Gulf of Carpentaria, and that the Postal 'Department is debited with a certain amount in respect of that service. We have the people of Tasmania asking for an improved passenger- service, although they make the excuse that they want an improved mail service. They want other steamers put on for the purpose of carrying passengers, and the additional, subsidy will he debited to the Postal -Department.- During the election -campaign, the. honorable member for Gippsland made a statement, to which I. have referred once or twice, and I understand that he takes exception to my remarks. </para>

                        <para>- It happens to be right, for . I have absolute proof now. On Saturday last, I  waB  down  at  the place where the honorable member made the statement, and I can get half-a-dozen men to make a statutory declaration that he said that- £3,000,000 had been spent by the Labour Government, and that no one knew where the money had gone ; and that a . Church . of England minister at that particular meeting which the honorable member addressed during the election campaign said it was robbery. I think that every member of the House, including the honorable member for Gippsland, will admit that each Department has to account for every Id. which it expends. Whether money is extravagantly spent or not is another matter, but every penny 'of every vote must be accounted for. Yet we have the wild statement made that £3,000,000 was spent under the head' of" Contingencies," and not one penny of that amount was accounted for. In this year's Estimates the amount for . " Contingencies '.' will be over- £3,500,000. Dealing with the contingencies for the Postal Department, the Prime Minister, when he was leading the Opposition, made this statement on page 28 of <inline font-style="italic">The Financial Carnival -</inline></para>

If it was extravagance to spend £1,090,000 on contingencies for the Post Office last year, and 'it was doubtful -where the money went to, ' although I know it was not doubtful at all, surely it is worse to spend . this year £1,258,000 on contingencies for the same Department? </para>

                    (Melbourne) [8.471.- I intend to devote most of my remarks to a speech- which was made by the honorable member for Boothby, and in which he took up a position regarding the settlement, of the Northern Territory that is entertained by most persons outside who have not given some study to- the subject. Twenty years ago every remark he made would possibly have been supported by scientific men, hut to-day, with the record of science triumphing over diseases in the tropics, I can look forward with a heart full of hope to the early and permanent settlement . of the Territory. The tropics produce a vast amount of food that is needed by the centres of population. The peoples of the world are increasing so fast that they will have to push into the territories even in the  tropics. The difficulty hitherto, has been that the tropics generally, have been inhabited by a large population who are willing to accept remuneration at a very low rate. When white persons attempt to settle down in the tropics they have first to meet certain diseases.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Dr.</inline>
                    Breinl,  Director of the Institute for Tropical Diseases at Townsville, is one of the highest authorities in the world. In three lectures he gave here recently he showed very clearly that the tropics of Australia have many advantages with which the tropics in other parts of the world cannot possibly compete. First of all, he stated that where the men may have a chance to succeed, the women have not, for reasons which cause them at certain times to spend a period of the year in a cooler climate. As honorable members understand, that can only apply to persons possessed of means. But one great point is that the women folk in the tropics, ou account of the cheap labour, do not do as much work as health would need them to do. Our aboriginals cannot possibly assist in the daily routine of the household duties. But in our tropics we have this advantage, that we have to face only disease and heat. I intend to quote a few words from a synopsis of the lecture which
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Breinl</inline>
                    delivered in Melbourne last Monday night.  His  three lectures were free to every one, but I am sorry to say they were not as well attended as they should have been. He said -

                    <para>The influence of high temperature on the animal organism has been studied by many workers, both by observations carried on in the tropics and under artificially produced conditions. The results of these experiments are by no means conclusive, but they appear to point lo the fact that no essential difference obtains between the methods employed by the human organism in regulating its temperature and carrying on its functional activities under tropical conditions, from those which obtain in a temperate climate. </para>
                    <para>Of the organs of the body the blood is suspected to suffer the most under the influence of a tropical climate. Observations have been made on the number of blood corpuscles and quantity of red coloring matter in the blood of acclimatized Europeans in the East Indies, and on that of American soldiers on service in the Philippines, and these showed that no appreciable change had taken place. Similar observations are being carried out in Townsville on the blood of school children, and so far these show that there is no appreciable difference between the blood of children of the second and third generation, as far as the number of corpuscles is concerned. </para>

                <para class="block">With all the incomplete experiments we have, there is decided proof that the power of resistance is likely to be less in the children of the second and third generation. I propose to quote a few figures from the lecture. </para>

                    <para>- The Minister of Trade and Customs took the chair on Monday night in the unavoidable absence of the Prime Minister, and when I asked Professor Allen if the lecture would be printed, he said he thought it would be. If there is any difficulty about the publication of the three valuable lectures, I hope that the Treasurer will open the purse strings of the Government, and see that the lectures are published for the benefit of scientists and others in Australia. The genius of France, as enunciated by the great de Lesseps, failed to cut the canal through the Isthmus of Darien, simply because the question was, Which would survive, the man or the mosquito ? Some 50,000 lives were lost there. The French built a magnificent hospital, but it merely ameliorated disease by providing the patients with the best-known treatment of the day. Then America, with that definiteness of purpose which she has shown more than, any other country in the accumulation of money, devoted her attention to the benefit of the human race ; and, taking control of the Canal, sent out some 1,800 men to destroy the mosquito. The mosquito was then recognised as the carrier of disease; but the three shadows that hovered over the building of the Canal when the French had the enterprise in hand - malaria, yellow fever, and typhoid - were met, conquered, and destroyed. Since 1904 the United States of America have employed 2,000 men regularly in the work of destroying mosquitoes. The army of mosquito destroyers went ahead, and the workers followed. In 1906 the deaths were only 821 ; in 1907, 424; and in 1908, 282; a reduction to one- third in three years. With regard to the yellow fever, I might mention that Havana was at one time a perfect death-trap, a large percentage of the whites who visited the place falling victims to the disease; while the black race had not become immune after a residence for some generations. Between 1852 and 1900, 35,952 lives were lost in Havana from yellow fever. </para>

Between 1905 and 1909 there were only forty deaths from yellow fever, and in 1907 only one death. Since 1909 until the date of the printing of the work from which I derive my facts - a book by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Rupert</inline> Boyce, one of the greatest authorities in the world on the mosquito as the cause of disease - there have been no deaths from small-pox, yellow fever, or bubonic plague..

                    <para>The plan of. campaign lay in rigorously prohibiting the keeping of stagnant water, and in screening, house to house inspection, and the infliction of fines if larvae were discovered'. As the result, yellow fever has been ' banished. Colonel Gorgas, under whose able direction these successful operations have been carried out, writes in his 1908 report that, " It is now more than three years since a case of yellow fever has developed in the isthmus, the last case occurring in November, 1905. The health and sick rates will compare favorably with most parts of the United States." Surely a most successful campaign. </para>

                <para class="block">That quotation shows that science now faces disease with opportunities that it never before possessed. In the splendid laboratory of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Breinl</inline> there are bloodsucking insects so small that they can get through the finest mosquito netting. When I stayed in Tasmania with the honorable member for Bass, I learned that the orchardist looks on the butterfly and moth, no matter how beautiful the markings, as pests, dangerous to the fruit industry. Science similarly looks on every organism that can fly, and that sucks blood, as the carrier of disease, directly or indirectly. Therefore, I wish to impress it upon the Government that, to settle white men in the Northern Territory, it is our duty to build for them proper houses, as pest-proof as possible. We should provide such houses for the settlers who take there their wives and families to cultivate the rich lands on the banks of the rivers. </para>

                        <para>- I have it on the authority of the honorable member that, if one places a good rump steak above his bed, mosquitoes will not trouble him, because they will be content to suck the blood from the fresh meat, until they reach practically the bursting point. I understand, too, that the steak can still be eaten for breakfast next morning. I pay my meed of praise to the 'Presbyterians for their missionary efforts' in the New Hebrides. Before asking a minister to go to the islands, they build for him a fine house, which is made as healthy as possible, because they wish their missionaries to take with them their wives and their children. I ask the Government to follow their splendid example, and to build houses on absolutely scientific principles for the settlers sent to the Northern Territory. These, houses need not. be large, but they should provide sufficient accommodation for a family. They should have a good water supply, and the settlers should be instructed to use kerosene .oil for the keeping down of mosquitoes. It is not necessary to use absolutely pure kerosene oil, which is rather expensive. A semi-refined oil could be supplied by the Government at a moderate price, and its use would prevent mosquitoes from breeding. To give effect to my suggestions would do more to settle the Northern Territory than anything else I know of.

When I speak of the British race I recognise that -Saxon England was the result of a German conquest, and that many of our best qualities were brought over from the German fatherland. The Anglo-Saxons and Celts in hot climates hold fast to their liking for roast beef and plum pudding, wear the boxer hat in places where the pith helmet should replace it, often take alcohol in quantities too large for the climate, and wear clothing that is absolutely unsuitable, Turning now to another subject, some honorable members have, been getting in " upper-cuts " and " nasty lefts " on the unfortunate member for Werriwa, but my opinion is that the Naval Estimates will become a burden such as Australia cannot possibly carry, if the expenditure is to go on increasing as at present. </para>

                        <para>- And I shall vote for naval defence so long as experts say that we can continue to carry it on. But if I can suggest a better way, it is for me to express myself as freely as the honorable member for Werriwa desired <inline font-style="italic">to.</inline> I regard <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnoughts</inline> and  super-Dreadnoughts  as in the same category as the armoured man of the Middle Ages, <inline font-style="italic">who,</inline> when he fell from his horse, required two or three other men to set him up again. We know that the destructive power now available is sufficient to make scrap-heaps of ships costing up to £2,000,000 each; and some of tie fine <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnoughts,</inline> we saw in Hobson's Bay when the American Fleet -was here are now on the scrap-heap. I, for one, shall never say a disrespectful word of the Japanese, who have won their right to be called great; and it is their good qualities I fear if it ever should be our misfortune to face them. I asked the Treasurer how many aeroplanes, of an average value of £300, could be built for the £2,000,000 of money expended on our Naval Unit, and I was told about 6,000. Such a number of aeroplanes is not necessary, but, with a coast-line of 8,000 miles, increased to 11,000 miles by the indentations, I see no better guard than aeroplanes, fixed, say, 100 miles apart. Under such circumstances, no enemy would care to approach a port knowing that he was faced with aeroplanes, which, while carrying only two lives, would be capable of sinking a vessel worth two millions of money. We in Australia are in a position of defence; and scientists have -laid down the rule that fewer men are needed to defend than to attack. If my vote is given, it shall be to place a firm thumb on our naval expenditure, and to divert the money, if necessary, to carrying on defence by air. Even half the cost of the Naval Unit would provide a fully-equipped factory for the building of aeroplanes and dirigibles; and my suggestion is that the Government should establish fully-equipped factories from Germany, France, England, Scandinavia, and America, pay the men in each factory good wages, and give a bonus to that factory which produced the best weapon of offence and defence. By this means the racial potentialities of each factory would be stimulated, and An* tralia, at the expense of, say, £1,000,000, would have the finest defence force of aeroplanes and dirigibles in the world. I throw out that suggestion for what it is worth. </para>

                        <para>- It is an able article. I do not wish the present Minister to - think I am pointing my finger against the late Government for the expense they incurred on defence, because I think that expenditure was perfectly justified. We are, however, establishing a great number of officers at large salaries, and I do not think that that plan can possibly be continued. In Switzerland, as I have previously pointed out, an army of 250,000 men can bc assembled in one place in Ihree days, and it has been urged by Cunliffe, in his book, that England could not possibly do the same in six weeks. </para>

                    <para>.- The Government propose an expenditure of £264,000 on the Defence Department, and if there is one vote that is increasing  it is this. It is time that we asked the Prime Minister and the Treasurer whether, by some means, this expenditure cannot be decreased, though I do not blame the present Government, who are simply carrying out a policy that has been laid down. We could, however, make some alteration in the present system of compulsory training. We could, for instance, instead of beginning with the boys of fourteen years, defer their training until they reached the age of sixteen; and, further, instead of keeping them at drill until they are twenty-five or twenty-six years af age, put them in the reserves when they are twenty-one, thus giving them five years of training. </para>

                        <para>- I am prepared to face it on the platform now, because it is evident that the expense must break the system down. We, a young country, have set up a Navy, and every ship we build adds hundreds of men to those whom we have to keep feed, and clothe. Under the circumstances, the Commonwealth Government will have to go in for more direct taxation; and I do not think the people are prepared for that. I have looked through the list of officers in the Defence Department, and the number is enormous oi those drawing £500, £600, £800, and so on a year. I see that it is proposed to expend £175,000 on new machinery for the Fitzroy Dock. In my opinion, that expenditure is not necessary at the present time. At present, about 75 per cent, ot the machinery there is new and up to date, and the <inline font-style="italic">Warrego</inline> has been built and fitted with the machinery at present there. The other three destroyers are . building, and, therefore, we may take it that the machinery is quite capable of doing the work required. The hull of the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline> is in hand, and we understand that the vessel will be ready to launch in about seven months. It is not proposed, however, that the machinery shall be placed on the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline> at the Dock, because the contract has been let to a British firm. An expenditure of £175,000 on new machinery is not at all required at the present time I hope the Ministry will see that, while a few thousand pounds may be required for machinery, it is not necessary to spend the huge amount of £175,000 to bring the machinery at Fitzroy Dock up to date, because they had sufficient there to turn out the engines for the <inline font-style="italic">Warrego,</inline> and it will be sufficient to turn out the engines for the other destroyers, while it' is not necessary to turn out any for the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane,</inline> seeing that the engines for this cruiser are being imported. We do not know where we are going in regard to our great naval policy. I do not see any mention on the Estimates of new ships, and I believe that until the present Unit is complete we should stay our hands. I am somewhat disappointed at the work carried on at Lithgow Small Arms Factory. I have heard something about the matter, but I do not wish to make it public now, because I would rather the Minister would inquire into it. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that the British Government have started the manufacture of small arms in India, and they have spent more money than we have, but have not turned out any rifles so far. I do not mention this in justification for the small quantity of work turned out at Lithgow, but I think the Minister will find that there are a few loose screws that need tightening up, and that the supervision should be better. I have no wish to delay Supply, as the Bill, I understand, should go through to-night, but I hope the Government will bring in another policy in regard to trainees. Every youth we train we have to clothe, and we must provide area officers and drill halls, and this expenditure is only starting to grow. </para>

                        <para>- Irrespective of what party sits on the Treasury bench, I hope that in the interests of the taxpayers, and to prevent any additional taxation, an effort will be made to bring before the House a new system of training' our youths. It should be made a non-party question. I believe the House would assist any Government that would help to curtail the expenditure on the trainee system, while maintaining it in a state of efficiency. No one can tell now where our expenditure on the present basis is going to end. If we take the number <inline font-style="italic">of</inline> boys to be trained each year, we see that the cost will be enormous, and that we cannot keep pace with it. I urge, therefore, as a matter of justice, that the Government, before they bring down Estimates next year, will introduce a new system so as to save expense to the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>.- Earlier in the day, when I asked the Prime Minister a question without notice, he chose to consider it as frivolous, but I can assure him that I was quite serious. In view of the present position, so far as the relationship between the two Houses of the National Parliament is concerned, and in view of the attitude of the world generally toward Second Chambers, I think the Government should well consider whether it would not be wise, in sketching the designs of the Parliament House at Canberra, for provision to be made for one Chamber only. </para>

                        <para>- The idea that we should have one House, and include the senators, meets with my strong approval. I think there is room in the National Parliament for the voices of the States to be heard. But I do not support the proposal because of the present position of affairs. I would be equally favorable to it if the present position were reversed. When the people of Australia were invited to join in this indissoluble Federation, one of the baits held out to secure votes was that the Legislative Councils of the States would be rendered unnecessary, and could well be abolished. It was also said that the number of members in the State Legislative Assemblies would be reduced. In neither respect has faith been kept with the people of Australia, and we propose to continue not only the two Houses in the States, but also the Second Chamber in the Commonwealth, for, as far as I can see, there is no intention of doing away with the Senate. This is surprising to me, because of the attitude of the Prime Minister and many members of his party, who in their references to the Senate during the last few months have openly deplored the position. We can well understand their anxiety in the matter, and if there is a possibility of obviating any similar difficulty- in the future, it can best be met by all parties agreeing on the progressive, democratic, and proper policy of true government,, that is, to have one representative Chamber, and to confine legislation to thatalone. </para>

                        <para>- I am well aware that what the Attorney-General says is correct. But I believe the trend of political thought to-day is to have one responsible Chamber. When kings found they could no longer rule by the assumption of the divine right they claimed, we had our Senates, or King's Councils, and gradually these bodies have changed until we have to-day Houses of Representatives or Legislative Assemblies directly representative of the people. The Commonwealth Senate is also based on that idea, and that is about the only feature that recommends it as a Second Chamber ; but in my opinion that is not sufficient to justify our perpetuating the bicameral system, and spending unnecessary money . in providing two chambers at Canberra. Though the honorable member for Wilmot has suggested that we might use the second chamber as a ballroom when the Senate is abolished, I would rather save the money, because it would be far better for the government of Australia if we had one House only. I wish now to refer to a speech made by the Prime Minister at Parramatta last Saturday night. He was dealing with the suspension, or, as he stated it, the ejection, of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McGrath,</inline> and said - </para>

                    <para>In this case we followed a precedent of the House of Commons. A man must not abuse the  Speaker  when he is acting fairly, whatever he might do when he is acting unfairly. Bias on a Speaker's part, if it can be proven, is a good reason for criticism <inline font-style="italic">as</inline> strong as it can be made. But <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Johnson</inline> cannot violate his own party's principles. He cannot be craven enough to betray his own constituents. When he is forced to vote, how can he vote other than in the interests of the constituency  that put him into Parliament? He is but a member, and he has that vote in accordance with his own conscience and judgment. We would be cravens if we did not protect him when he could not help himself. The duty of having a man put out of the House devolves on the Prime Minister. It was a painful duty, but in the same circumstances I would repeat it tomorrow. </para>

                <para>The objection I have to this is that we did not follow the precedent of the House of . Commons, and that the precedent of the House of Commons cannot possibly govern us in the matter. I have no wish to repeat what was said this afternoon by the honorable member for Barrier, who pointed out that the  Speaker  in this House is in an entirely different . position from that occupied by the  Speaker  in the House of Commons. </para>

He is given every possible opportunity to be quite free from all party influences and party campaigns. In the extract I have read, the Prime Minister admits that our  Speaker  is not in that position, because he says that the  Speaker  has a direct duty to his constituents and to his party. </para>

                        <para>- The Prime Minister has pointed to the fact that the  Speaker  has a casting vote, and that' he shows party feeling if he uses it. It is very seldom that the  Speaker  in the House of Commons has to give a casting vote. In every well-regulated Parliament no Government will carry on unless they have a working, majority. No Government in the Imperial Parliament would continue in office unless they had twenty or more of a working majority. There is no Parliament in the world, unless it is in Australia, where a party has carried on with a majority of one; but in this case the Government are carrying' on without a single individual as a majority. The Prime Minister at Parramatta, on Saturday night, did not put the case in connexion with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McGrath's</inline> suspension either fairly or correctly. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McGrath</inline> was not suspended because he took exception to the .

                        <para>- The main feature in regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McGrath's</inline> suspension was omitted by the Prime Minister. I do not think it was correct for him to say that when the  Speaker  of this House is forced to vote, he can vote no other way than in the interests of the constituency he' represents, and that he could not be craven enough to betray his own constituents. I have previously called attention to what I thought was the unfair reference by the Prime Minister to the Speakership.' Before the House met; the Prime Minister' repeatedly referred to the fact that the Government could only hope to carry on on the casting vote of the  Speaker.  I hold a very high opinion of the responsibilities and dignity of the Speakership. </para>

Speaker  and the Prime Minister, but of other honorable members generally. I have no objection, and. there can be no objection, to the  Speaker  being a party man, and taking care of the interests of his constituents , but I object to the Prime Minister suggesting that honorable members should be limited in the slightest degree, either in the House or outside it, in expressing their opinion of the conduct of affairs either by the  Speaker  or &gt;by yourself, as  Chairman  of Committees, or by the Leader of the House. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McGrath</inline> was suspended because he emphasized that very principle. </para>

                    <para>If the numbers in a division are equal, the  Speaker  (and, in Committee, the  Chairman,  see page 382), who otherwise never- votes, . must give the casting voice. In the performance of this duty, he is at liberty to vote like any other member, according to his conscience, without assigning a reason ; but, in order to avoid the least imputation upon his impartiality, it is usual for him, when practicable, to vote in such a manner as not to make the decision of the House final, and to explain his reasons, which are entered on the Journal. </para>

                        <para>- I deplore with my whole heart some of the statements made by the honorable member for Werriwa to-day, particularly those regarding the use of the military for the settlement of industrial disputes. No one deplores more than I do, and I think we all deplore, the unfortunate necessity that compels us to spend an increasing amount of money every year on naval and military defence, and I wish I could see the possibility of its stopping, or could put a limit to it. Nothing could be more fraught with danger to Australia than the idea, on the part of any honorable member, that the Military Forces should be available at any time for the prevention or settlement of industrial disputes. We have established in Australia, directly and deliberately, a Court for that express purpose. The object of the Act is stated to be " Conciliation and Arbitration for the Prevention and Settlement of Industrial Disputes." With that policy I am in hearty agreement, but I cannot understand any honorable member suggesting the possibility of the military in Australia being asked to take part in the settlement of industrial disputes. </para>

                        <para>- The Attorney-General is well-qualified to weigh the exact meaning of words. It may not be literally correct to say that the military can " settle " industrial disputes, but to suggest that the military should ever be called upon to interfere with an industrial trouble is most dangerous. The Attorney-General the other evening accused us of being syndicalists, and said we were fast drifting into the old system of settling disputes by force. We absolutely deny that charge, and if the honorable member for Werriwa is to be taken as in any sense representing the opinion of any number of honorable members of the House, they must be the true syndicalists, because evidently their method of interfering in or settling industrial disputes is by the force of arms. To this course I am entirely opposed. I should have thought that at this time of the world's history any attempt to interfere with industrial disputes by force of arms would be regretted and deplored. The experience of the last few years should be enough to warn honorable members of the serious possibilities of such an attitude. Only a few months ago we read of the unfortunate scenes which took place at Johannesburg. We are now beginning to get the facts of that case, and to learn why the military were called out to shoot down the strikers there. We have at present an exhibition of the same methods of dealing with strikers in New Zealand. </para>

It was sought to censure the late Government because we had not taken steps to preserve property, and to keep order in Brisbane during the tramway strike. I have been wondering since then what this Government are going to do. No one can imagine that it is possible to settle economic disputes in such a way. No one' can imagine that we are going to create a better feeling by harbouring for a moment the idea that strikes may be interfered in by the armed military.

                    <para>. - I wish to refer to a case relating to the administration of the Maternity Allowance Act, which I brought under the notice of the Treasurer a few weeks ago, and in regard to which I think I should have had a sympathetic reply. I hope that, in the administration of the Act, there will be displayed a little more sympathy than is evidenced in this case. I propose to read the letter which I sent to the Treasurer, and which sets forth the facts. It is dated 9th October last, and is addressed to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, M.P., G.C.M.G., Federal Treasurer, Melbourne. It reads - and I shall leave out the name of the woman concerned - as follows: - </para>

                <para>Dear <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John,</inline> - There is a case in my electorate coming within the administration of the Maternity Allowance Act which <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> think is a hardship, and in which I think an injustice has been done. It is in the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs.- ,</inline> of Enmore. </para>
                <para>During August (I have not the exact date by me), <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs.- gave</inline> birth to a child, which lived about three hours only. An application was made for the maternity allowance, but was refused on the ground that the child was not " viable." The matter was brought under my notice bv a mutual friend, which caused me to make personal investigations. There was no doctor in attendance at the birth, and the nurse did not give her whole attention to the case. Being very poor people, I understand the nurse comes in for a small fee and simply visits the patient in the same way as a doctor would do - at intervals. The mother and child were, therefore, without assistance for some hours immediately after birth, and during this period, it appears, the child died. The birth was premature; the nurse gave her opinion about six months; but the mother states that it was nearer seven, and I think the mother's statement would be more accurate. The child was born alive, and was capable of living, and did live for about three hours. The mother states that she could have saved the child had she been able, without a risk to her own life, to give it the attention required. This she was unable to do. I am quite positive there were no undesirable circumstances, such as it is the policy of the Act to prevent, present in this case. I find that in the case of several of <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs.- children</inline> they were born under the same circumstances, and ore now healthy children. It appears there is some medical reason for these early births. On the1st September I wrote to the nurse and asked the following questions :  - </para>

                        <para>To my knowledge, one hour and a half. (I sent a copy of my letter to the nurse and her reply to the Department in Sydney.) There are the whole facts in a nutshell. Vou could call for the papers from Sydney, and you would find that I have represented matters unsuccessfully to" the departmental head. In my opinion, the. Department are relying upon some provisions of the Act which enable them to refuse the application, which I think is harsh and undue straining of the law. Section c (3) gives a discretion to the Administration to pay the allowance, where it is satisfactorily proved by evidence that a child was born alive or was a viable child, to dispense with medical certificates. In this case the mother was too poor to provide medical assistance, and in view of the previous experience it was not thought to be so necessary as it transpired afterwards. And as there was no doctor it is an absolute impossibility for a doctor's certificate to be produced. It seems to me the intention of the Act is to discourage objectionable practices. I am absolutely sure there is no suggestion of anything of the kind in this case. The nurse has answered some stereotyped questions, and these have been construed to the detriment of the application. I asked the Department locally to send an inspector out to interview the nurse, who would at once impress any officer of her reliability, and she will give the most positive statements that everything in this case is <inline font-style="italic">bond fide.</inline> The fact that the nurse only knows that the child lived for one and a half hours is due to the fact, as I stated before, that she went in and attended as a medical man and left, and it was during her absence that the death took place. This is a case of very great hardship. The funeral expenses are still unpaid : the husband of the woman in question was away looking for work in the country at the time, and in view of all the circumstances I would suggest that you might exercise your authority as Minister to see that the technicalities are weighed and the inherent justice of the case itself recognised. </para>

                <para class="block">This woman, as I pointed out in my letter to the Treasurer, has several children, and every one of them was born in circumstances similar to those attending the birth of the child in question, so that there is absolutely no suggestion of anything of an improper kind in relation to it. In answer to my letter, I simply received from the Treasurer a formal covering note, with a reply from the Department in Sydney, which was exactly the same as that I had received previously. This shows that the case did not have the consideration of the Treasurer himself. </para>

                        <para>- Some of the greatest men who have ever lived have been seven-months' children. If an injustice has been done in the honorable gentleman's Department, we have a right to hold him responsible for it. At any rate, I hope that he will look into the facts of the case. If a doctor had been available, of course, the certificate could have been forwarded, and it would not have been open to question. But the people are very poor, and after the child had died it would have been idle to call in a medical man. The fact is that the child was born alive, and lived for some time, and the dictionary meaning of the word "viable" is "born alive and capable of life." I ask the Treasurer to look into' the papers. </para>

It is only at the last emergency that the military should be used. If soldiers and sailors come out they do not come out as police, as some people seem to think, simply tu look on. They come out as soldiers, with rifles, ball cartridges, and bayonets, and come out to shoot if called on by the civil POW* to do so. </para>

                <para>My whole desire in raising this question is to endeavour to create in the minds of honorable members a horror of any such position arising in Australia. I should not Have mentioned the matter, but for the remarks of the honorable member for Werriwa. I believe that we are travelling towards a better state of affairs. I well remember that, during the debate on the censure motion, which took place in 1912, the then Ministerial supporters remarked with some surprise that the present Prime Minister made very slight reference to the Brisbane strike. But he said - as will be seen by reference to <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> page 149- </para>

                    <para>I was never more serious than I am in expressing the hope that both sides will vie with each other to keep Syndicalism out of Australia. We do not want it here. We have, I hope, in this sunny land of ours a more excellent way of dealing with these matters. What I fear is, however, that the people outside will become disgusted with the legislative tinkering of Labour Governments from time to time. As a matter of fact, if I am any judge of the situation, they are becoming disgusted. Their votes on every conceivable occasion show that they are. So far as honorable members opposite are concerned, the handwriting is already on the wall. They may smile, but the people of Australia, and their own supporters in particular, are turning from them in thousands, and it is important to note in what direction their faces are set. It becomes us to inquire very seriously into the question of industrial unrest. I subscribe entirely to the statement made by my  leader that something ought to be done to encourage to the fullest extent . greater cooperation_ greater harmony and better and more intimate relationship - between the capitalists of Australia and their own workmen. </para>

                        <para>- It is very difficult to take the honorable member seriously. If the Government desire to keep Syndicalism out of Australia they will abandon once and for all any intention to utilize force in any form in the settlement of industrial disputes. I admit that there is a good deal of industrial unrest in Australia. I admit that our methods of settling industrial disputes have not been very successful. They have not been successful simply because of lack of cooperation on the. part of the capitalists. Let me take the Brisbane Tramway strike as a case in point. That strike took place in 1912. Here we are at the end of 1913, and yet, owing to every legal device having been availed of by the Tramway Company, the question at issue has not yet been settled. Personally, I am anxious to encourage conciliation and arbitration in the settlement of industrial disputes. At the same time, I do not wonder that workmen are beginning to grow dissatisfied with arbitration on the grounds that it is too slow, too cumbersome, and too costly. </para>

                        <para>- They are more unsatisfactory still. There is nothing more calculated to encourage Syndicalism in Australia than the difficulty of applying conciliation and. arbitration to industrial unrest. Its. application to our defence system is particularly abhorrent. The moment that any Government send out the military to interfere with an industrial dispute, we shall be faced with the difficulty to which the honorable member for Werriwa has referred. The moment any Government authorize the use of the Militia for any such purpose an agitation will commence in opposition to our citizen defence system, and one which can end only in Syndicalism. I wish to avoid that. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. At the present time the Arbitration Court is exceedingly unsatisfactory in its operation. That is not the fault of the Court itself, but of the machinery which is available to it. Honorable members know that every attempt by the  President  of that tribunal to convene a conference - either friendly or compulsory - of the parties to any industrial dispute has been met with opposition from the employers. The workers have repeatedly shown their readiness to attend these conferences, and to go to arbitration and conciliation, but at every turn obstacles have been placed in their way by the employers. This means Syndicalism. It means that the workers will become tired of this slow legal method of settling industrial disputes. I hope that the Government will see their -way to declare themselves utterly opposed to the use of the military in connexion with industrial disputes, and that those on the other side will just as determinedly set themselves against any attempt to use the military for any such purpose. I am not one of those who believe in peace at any price, but I am whole-heartedly in favour of peace in connexion with industrial, as well as in connexion with international, matters. If we once allow the suggestion of the honorable member for Werriwa to he accepted as in any sense a reflection of the mind of honorable members of this Committee, we shall be creating difficulties for ourselves, inviting opposition to the Arbitration Court, and increasing the tendency towards Syndicalism. The Prime Minister has invited honorable members to oppose Syndicalism, and we on this side are. willing to join him in any effort in that direction, so far as Syndicalism means the use of force in any form to settle industrial matters. Honorable members on both sides should stand shoulder to shoulder in the endeavour to have industrial difficulties settled on reasonable, democratic, and responsible lines. </para>
