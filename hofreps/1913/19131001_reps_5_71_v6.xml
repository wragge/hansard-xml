                        <para>- I ask the Prime Minister if he will state the exact position now existing between the Federal Government and the Government of New South Wales in connexion with the quarantine for small-pox operating over Sydney. Has the Federal Government in any way used its influence in favour of the compulsory vaccination of adults in New South Wales? What overtures have been made to the State Government regarding isolation and the disinfection of infected areas, so as to enable the Federal Government to lift the quarantine? </para>

                            <para>- Of course, there had to be a line drawn somewhere. I received from the Premier of New South Wales some time ago a letter, to which I replied the other day, and as soon as I can get the correspondence here, I shall lay it on the table, so that honorable members may see exactly how matters stand. Our attitude, shortly, is this: If the New South Wales Government will proceed to isolation, and deal with the matter themselves, we shall be glad to lift the quarantine the moment that we are convinced that the steps they have taken are adequate for the purpose of protecting the other States of Australia. </para>

                            <para>- The State Government has at its command all the resources for fighting the disease at close quarters, whereas we have not the requisite machinery. We therefore thought it a fair thing to allow the State Government to tackle the disease at close quarters, and to stamp it out, confining our attention to the preservation of the other States from the ravages of the disease. That seems to me the proper Federal line of action in this connexion. </para>

I receive nothing but personal abuse whenever I rise to speak, and the right honorable member for Wide Bay is joining with those who are responsible for it. </para>

                            <para>I learn, with pleasure, that your Government proposes to legislate upon the subject of vaccination, and are taking such powers as will, in your opinion, render Federal legislation superfluous. Had this action been taken at an earlier stage it is probable that the disease might have been by this time suppressed in Sydney. You ask for a revocation of the Federal Regulations. This would mean the removal of the only existing means to prevent the spread to other States, and, as my advisers here are strongly against such a course, the Government feel quite unable to accept the heavy responsibility of doing so. Immediately, however, your legislation is enacted, and the administration in operation, we will then be in a position to consult with the Quarantine Department as to the adequacy of the action taken by you, and to consider the revocation of the Federal Regulations. </para>

My reply to that letter is that the moment they pass their legislation and show that they are grappling with the disease at close quarters, then, and only then, can we consider the advisableness of raising the quarantine. </para>

I hope that my honorable friends opposite will not keep asking me these questions, because they have all been answered before.

At the present time there is trouble in the General Post Office, Sydney, in connexion with the postal mechanics and electricians. Under an award made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins, the men have been granted an increase in salary, &#39;but, go far as&#39; 1 can understand, there is evidently an attempt on the part of the Department so to reduce the status of the men that, instead of * obtaining an increase, they will really get a decrease of pay. </para>

I told that gentleman that I had no knowledge of the matter, but would inquire into it to-day. I advised the men that they had better continue at work until I had had an opportunity to deal with the question. Unfortunately for some of the men, the award acts against them, but it materially improves the position of others. It provides that junior mechanics, meaning those who have not passed a certain examination, are to receive a salary of &#163;144 a year, whilst mechanics are to be paid &#163;168. I sent over to Sydney to-day to get particulars, and I have received the following information - </para>

Opportunity is now taken to lay upon the table of the House a copy of a memorandum by the Chief Electoral Officer, dated 11th August, 1913. It is understood that the right honorable member&#39;s question does not refer to communications regarding amendments of the Act incorporated in the Electoral Bill now before the House, inasmuch as he has already stated that Ministers should not shelter themselves behind any electoral officials, or expose them to the fire of party politics. </para>

I suggest that you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> should resume the chair after the luncheon adjournment at 2 o&#39;clock instead of at 2.15 p.m. That would give the Treasurer time to deliver his Budget speech before the despatch of trains to the other States. </para>

                            <para>- On the 25th  of  July of this year there was in existence a Customs duty of &#163;6 a ton levied on all sugar imported into Australia, and an Excise duty of &#163;4 on all sugar produced in Australia, while a bounty of &#163;3 was paid on all sugar grown by white labour. The position is that bounty was granted subject to the payment of standard rates of wages, and the observance of certain conditions of employment which were laid down under the Bounty Act. Later on, an agitation arose, and there was, on the part of the growers, a generally expressed desire, although not a unanimous one, that the Excise and bounty should be repealed, and that the sugar industry should be conducted under the same conditions as are other industries in Australia. This Parliament decided to repeal the bounty and Excise under certain conditions, and the effect of those repealing Acts was that the sugar industry was left to the control of the States concerned. The procedure adopted in regard to the bounty was that it should be payable  upon white  grown cane delivered at the mills to be converted into sugar, while the Excise duty was collected upon the sugar as it went into consumption. That being so, the bounty was granted on cane which did not go into consumption until some later date - until it had been converted into raw, and, finally, into refined, sugar. </para>

                            <para>- Popularly speaking, the duty was paid when the sugar was taken out of bond, but the technical procedure under the Act was that, before the sugar was entered for home consumption, the duty had to be paid upon it. Last year, as I have said, this Parliament passed Acts authorizing the repeal of the Excise and bounty on  a  date  to  be fixed by proclamation, and those measures were assented to on 24th December last. The repeal took place by proclamation issued on 25th July, and came into operation on Saturday, 26th July last. The payment of the bounty and Excise ceased from that date. While the bounty had to be paid in respect of sugar-cane that had been delivered up to that time, the repeal naturally freed sugar from the payment of Excise. That is by no means an unusual occurrence; it takes place every time we repeal a duty, hundreds of pounds&#39; worth of goods being freed from the impost, and no effort being made to collect it. In this instance, however, seeing that the bounty had been paid out of the Consolidated Revenue upon the sugar so liberated, it was thought desirable that the Excise should be collected upon the sugar manufactured from the cane on which that bounty had been paid. </para>

                            <para>- That is certainly an important fact, but if the honorable member will allow me, I shall deal with the matter in my own way. The Bill that I am now introducing imposes a duty of Excise upon certain sugar, and deals with the collection of revenue upon the sugar manufactured from cane delivered this season prior to the repeal of the principal Act. Clause 2 imposes an Excise duty at the rate of 4s. per cwt. of manufactured sugar - the rate which existed under the principal Act - as from, and including, the 26th July, 1913, the date on which the repeal came into operation. The effect of this Bill will be, therefore, to reimpose the duty as from that date, first of all upon all sugar produced from cane delivered for manufacture after the 1st May, and before the 26th July, 1913. The first-named date is an arbitrary one. As a matter of fact, the cane crushing started later, but to secure absolute safety we have fixed upon this date so as to cover the full period during which it is possible for cane to be crushed. The quantity of refined sugar covered by paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> of clause 2 will be about 36,000 tons, and of that quantity nearly 4,000 tons will have been made after the 25th July. In other words, a certain quantity of cane which had been delivered </para>

                            <para>- Yes. Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of clause 2 deals with other sugar under Customs control on 25th July, and embraces about 3,500 tons. It consists of last season&#39;s cane sugar, amounting to 3,133 tons, raw and refined, and beet sugar which was manufactured about March of this year. The total quantity covered by these two paragraphs is therefore 39,500 tons, and upon that quantity this Excise is to be imposed. It is estimated that the duty will yield about &#163;158,000. Of that sum &#163;8,000 had been paid prior to 25th JulY. and, of course, will not be collected a second time. I draw special attention to the fact that the total of 39,500 tons is more than the quantity of sugar actually in bond. The quantity in bond is estimated at only 32,815 tons. All the cane not having been converted into raw sugar by the 25th July, a larger amount will be collected than would appear to be likely having regard only to the quantity of sugar in bond. It is well to explain that the figures I have given merely set forth the estimates made by the Customs authorities on the information at present available, and that they are liable to slight alterations upon further investigation. It becomes important to determine the actual quantity of sugar that will be dealt with under paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of clause 2. I have indicated, so far, only the estimates formed by the Department on the information at present available to it. In order that this duty may be collected, it becomes necessary to have some definite authority to determine the quantity. The Comptroller-General is, therefore, charged under this Bill with the duty of certifying in writing, by notice published in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette,</inline> as soon as practicable after the passing of the measure, the quantities of cane sugar and beet sugar respectively on which duty is payable under clause 2. Clause 5 imposes a liability of a wider character, and the reason for this may be briefly stated. Obviously, since the repeal took place, some of this sugar has gone into consumption. </para>

                            <para>- It has been taken out of bond since the repeal, and consequently no duty has been paid upon it. We, therefore, propose under this clause to make all cane and beet sugar manufactured in Australia, and entered for home consumption after the commencement of this Act, subject to the duty of Excise until the respective amounts mentioned by the Comptroller-General in his certificate have been entered for home consumption. Clause 7 provides that for the purposes of this Act, sugar shall be deemed to have continued to be&#39; excisable goods within the meaning of the Excise Act, notwithstanding the repeal of the preceding Acts. When this Bill is passed sugar becomes subject to Excise procedure again. It is provided that the Act shall continue in operation until amounts of duty have been collected equivalent to the amounts respectively certified by the Comptroller-General. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; sometimes it is in transport. The really important point is that if the Excise had been repealed, the benefit would practically have gone to three refiners. All those interested have personally intimated to the Department that they have no desire to take advantage of the repeal, but will pay the duty as if the Act had continued. </para>

                            <para>- That was on the 26th July, and there would have been more in bond in May, but we cannot exactly say how much. The effect would have been the recovery of a similar amount of duty. Speaking roughly, the duty would have been about &#163;12,000 on last year&#39;s  crop,  but more than that in May if the Act had then been repealed. We have never at any time kept in the Central Office a daily record of the amount in bond. </para>

As to beet sugar, the bounty will be 2s. on beet delivered after the 1st January, and before the 26th day of July of this year. As a matter of fact, this 2s. 2d. is the average that was fixed when the late Government were in office, and it has been accepted by the Queensland Government. </para>

It was promised as from the beginning of the season. As I explained before, the repeal was with the intention of giving the grower the benefit of the full &#163;4, and the repeal took place on the 25th July, <inline font-style="italic">From</inline> that date onwards growers are getting the benefit of the full effect of the repeal; and by this legislation we are giving those growers who delivered their cane and received only the &#163;3 bounty up to the 25th July, the extra bounty, thus placing them on the same footing as the rest of the growers. The same applies to the growers of beet sugar, though the amount is smaller, working out at about &#163;600. </para>

                            <para>- That represents the concession. It was hoped at the time we passed the legislation that the repeal would have taken place before this season began, and that there would have been no necessity to introduce the Bounty Bill; but, unfortunately, that was not so, and we are now bringing in this legislation to put us in exactly the same position as if the Queensland Parliament had enacted their Statutes earlier, and the Excise and bounty had been repealed at the beginning of the present season. Those are the provisions of the Bill. I shall now deal with the steps that led up to the repeal of the Commonwealth Acts. On the 5th September, 1912, the Premier of Queensland wrote to the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth asking him to introduce Bills for the repeal of the Excise and bounty on sugar. The letter read as follows - </para>

The people of Australia desire the sugar industry to be a white-labour one, and I gladly give my support to any arrangement which will ensure the realization of that desire. It is also their wish that this industry should pay the white labourer the highest wage consistent with its prosperity, and the better to achieve that end, I shall so enlarge the Industrial Peace Bill as to bring sugar workers (both field and mill hands) under Industrial Boards. I think that will be the most effective means of protecting their interests. </para>

                            <para>- The conditions laid down by the Federal Government were, first, that the Queensland Parliament should make the industry an industry to be carried on under white labour conditions, and, secondly, that there should be industrial tribunals in order to settle the wages conditions in connexion with the industry. The matter was dealt with in the Commonwealth Parliament towards the end of the session of 1912, but, in the meantime, the State Parliament had risen. It rose early in December. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. The two Acts repealing the Excise and bounty on sugar were assented to on the 24th December, and remained on the statute-book, though the Queensland Parliament had risen. But the arrangement made between the Government of Queensland and the Commonwealth was that if the Queensland Parliament would pass certain legislation and lay down the conditions asked for by the Commonwealth Parliament, the repeal of the Excise and bounty would take place. That was clearly the agreement made. In the meantime, the general election was held and there were various speeches delivered in Queensland during the campaign on the question of sugar conditions. The growers felt that there was necessity for an increase in the bounty granted to them owing to the extra conditions of labour they claimed had been imposed on them. These conditions of labour were laid down by a minute of my predecessor, the honorable member for Yarra, dated 13th. August, 1912, and constituted a considerable advance upon the wages previously paid. </para>

                            <para>- The proposal is to pay them on this year&#39;s crop. I presume that is why the Ministry of the day fixed the repeal for this season ; because no legislation was introduced or proposed last session to equalize the bounty and Excise from that date. The Bill made provision only from the date that I have mentioned. Those were the conditions which were imposed, and which justified the giving of the bounty. The cane-growers were entitled to take up this attitude, &#34; Our cost of production has been increased by our being required to observe the conditions imposed by the regulations, and we are, therefore, entitled to consideration and relief.&#34; That position was unanswerable. </para>

                    <para class="block">It is clear from those three utterances that the right honorable gentleman took up this position, that as soon as the Queensland Parliament had performed its part of the undertaking the proclamation would issue forthwith. Had the Queensland Parliament done its part in the month of May the proclamations would have had to issue then if the compact was to be kept. lt was contemplated that upon Queensland doing its part, the proclamations should issue immediately, no matter whether there was sugar in bond or not. The Commonwealth election resulted in a change of Administration. The Queensland Parliament met in June, and immediately passed legislation on the lines required by the Federal Parliament. It went further, and passed an Act securing to the growers, as far as that was possible by legislation, the extra 2s. 2d., which was being remitted by this Parliament in connexion with the remission of the Excise. The first condition laid down by the Federal Parliament was that the sugar industry should be conducted on a white labour basis. The Queensland Parliament has passed a law prohibiting the employment of certain forms of labour in the production of sugar, and for other incidental purposes. This Act gives effect to the white labour policy of the Commonwealth by means of the education test, which has been so effective under Commonwealth administration for the preservation of a white Australia. </para>

                            <para>- I think that it has. At any rate, I am not aware that any member of the Opposition has drawn attention to any proved deficiency in the Queensland legislation in respect of the test. If honorable members opposite think the education test ineffective, why did they not, during last Parliament, when they had, a majority in both Houses of this Legislature, abolish or amend it? The use of that test by the Commonwealth has proved effective during the last thirteen years. </para>

                            <para>- It has always been applied. I do not charge the Labour party with laxity in this regard. I am sure that, when in office, honorable members opposite tried to do their duty in accordance with the law; -and it goes without saying that other Administrations have done their duty. I think we can frankly admit that the test has proved effective. It was adopted for certain reasons of policy, we being asked to pass legislation in such a form as would be as little offensive as possible to other nations. I am sure that the Queensland law will be administered in accordance with the intentions of this Parliament. The  second  condition was an industrial one. It was held that there should be an industrial tribunal to fix the wages of the men who had previously been affected by the bounty regulations. The Queensland Parliament last year passed the Industrial Peace Act, with the object of securing industrial peace, and in it provision was made for the constitution of boards to deal with the sugar industry. I do not know exactly when the boards will meet, but I do not think that it will be long before they do so, steps having already been taken. To bridge over any interval between the repealing of the regulations and the making of industrial awards, the Queensland Government introduced a measure making temporary provision concerning rates .51 wages and conditions of employment in the sugar industry until such matters had been dealt with by awards under the Industrial Peace Act. A schedule of wages of a standard equal to that set up by the Minister of Trade and Customs on the 13th August of last year was placed &#39;n the measure, and it was enacted that that schedule should have the same effect for all purposes, and be construed as an award of the Industrial Peace Act, and should continue in full force and effect until such rates and conditions had been altered or superseded by an award made in accordance with the Act. That measure secured the labour conditions which were desired. But the Premier of the State went even further than he was called upon to go, and introduced a measure to provide for the prompt payment to sugarcane growers of certain additional amounts for their cane. That measure insisted that the manufacturers should pay, in addition to the amounts they had contracted to pay, sums which would be equivalent to the full &#163;4 of Excise that was being repealed. For instance, in No. 1 district, 9s. 8d. was to be paid; in No. 2 district, 9s. 2d.; in No. 3 district, 8s. 8d.; and in No. 4 district, 8s. 2d., in respect of every ton of cane supplied. The intention was to secure to the growers the full benefit. Honorable members are aware that an agitation is now taking place in Queensland for the constitution, if possible, of cane boards to settle prices between the manufacturers and the growers. The Commonwealth Government was appealed to to repeal the Excise and Bounty Acts, in accordance with the promise made to Queensland, and immediately the three Acts to which I have referred were assented to, the repealing proclamations were issued. In issuing those proclamations, we carried out the obligations to which we were bound. The agreement was as clear as it could be. That is apparent from the speeches of the ex-Prime Minister. </para>

                            <para>- The cultivation continued from August until June. All the cultivation took place under the higher labour conditions imposed by the Tudor regulation. This Government, in issuing the proclamation repealing the bounty and Excise as soon as the Queensland Government had passed the legislation that they had undertaken to carry, took  the  only course open to them. Other alternatives have been suggested to us. It has been suggested, for instance, that we should have waited until later in the season before issuing the proclamation, and that we could then have introduced legislation which would have had the effect of protecting the revenue.  The obligation clearly resting upon us, however, was that as soon as the Queensland Government had fulfilled their part of the contract, we should give the growers the benefit of our legislation. That obligation was discharged by us, and it gave rise to the situation with which honorable members are now asked to deal, since the legislation passed last year by the Labour Government made no provision to meet the inevitable contingency with which we are now called upon to deal. It was obvious that, no matter when the conditions were fulfilled, there was bound to be sugar in bond. If the proclamation had been issued in December or January, the quantities in bond would have been much larger; but thereafter they decreased. The Government of the day, no .matter what party was in power, would be bound to honour the arrangement made with the Queensland Government on behalf of the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- The agreement had to be honoured. Our legislation is intended to benefit the growers, and to enable the Commonwealth to collect the additional Excise, so that there shall be in the Treasury an amount equivalent to the bounty that has been paid. These Bills are carefully designed to carry out the purposes that we have in view. The parties concerned have indicated that they have no desire to take advantage of the repeal,, and as the growers are undoubtedly entitled to this relief, I hope that honorable members will expedite the passage of these measures, so that they may obtain it at the earliest possible date. </para>

After I had spoken, however, we were informed by Ministers that the mistake had been discovered, and that they were taking action with a view to remedying it. An attempt was made by the Minister of Trade and Customs to lay upon the shoulders of the previous Government the responsibility for the blunder. </para>

                            <para>- There was no occasion to do so. As the honorable member for Capricornia has said, to have done what the honorable member suggests would have been to practically put in our legislation a statement to the effect that &#34; in the event of some incompetent person being called upon to administer this Act, we decide that so-and-so shall be done.&#34; If the Government can arrange now, as they say they can, with about thirty persons and companies, to pay up this Excise, I fail to see why they should not have made the necessary provision in the first instance, before the Excise and Bounty Repeal Acts were proclaimed, and before the matter was brought forward by me. I do not know whether the parties concerned can now be compelled to pay the Excise. I should like to hear the honorable member for Parkes defending the Colonial Sugar Refining Company against such a claim. </para>

If such a mistake had been made by me when we were in office, and the present Assistant Minister of Home Affairs had obtained exclusive information regarding it, how he would have gloated over us, and have sprung the matter on us without any notice. As a matter of fact, I discovered this mistake on the part pf the present Government in consequence of a reply made by the Minister to a question put to him by the Leader of the Opposition. The title of the Bill is not right; it should be entitled &#34; A Bill for an Act to remedy a blunder by the present Government, and to collect the money which is due to the Commonwealth.&#34; </para>

                            <para>- There was no omission on our part. It i3 all very well for honorable members opposite to make such a statement while all the leading newspapers of Australia are backing them up, but although those newspapers may pretend that this loss of revenue was the result of a mistake on. the part of the late Government, the Minister of Trade and Customs cannot persuade his party that the trouble did not arise from the blundering of the present Government, and that they ought not to have known what would be the effect of the issue of the proclamation. Every word that I uttered on the 19th August regarding the incapacity displayed by the present Government in relation to this matter is amply justified by the introduction of this legislation. I hope that they will be able to collect the amount of money to which the Minister has referred. </para>

                            <para>- I have said on many occasions that sugar is the only Tariff item of which I know in respect of which advantage can be taken, by those controlling the industry, of the full amount of the duty. The sugar monopoly is so complete that if we could land sugar here at &#163;14 per ton, plus the import duty, the company would charge about &#163;19 10s. per ton for the local product, so as to put it about 10s. below the price of the imported article. The control of the industry is within the hands of so few individuals that they find it far easier to fix prices than it is in connexion with any other industry. In the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of 21st August last, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kater,</inline> M.L.C.,  chairman  of directors of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, is reported to have made the following statement at a meeting of the company on the previous day - and the same statement appears, practically word for word, in the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> the two morning papers published in Sydney, and the morning papers published in Brisbane - </para>

                        <para>You will have noticed in the papers a reference in the Federal Parliament to our company, in connexion with the repeal of the Excise duty on sugar, and I may as well take advantage of your presence here to tell you the facts. When we obtained a copy of the proclamation issued on this subject, it was evident to us that unless some further action was taken all the sugar produced this season before July 25th would be freed from duty, although the bounty was payable on the cane from which it was made, and the revenue would thus have to suffer. Accordingly we gave at once to the Customs all the particulars we possessed as to the quantity of sugar in which we were concerned that would be covered by the proclamation, and pointed out that whatever steps might be taken to protect the revenue, the growers who had made early deliveries of cane should receive the same advantage in respect thereto as those whose crops were cut after 25th July. These representations were made by us three weeks ago, and since then the Comptroller has on several occasions seen our Melbourne manager about the  position.  We have thus been made aware that the Government proposed to make such arrangements as would bring about the payment of the duty on the sugar which was freed bv the Act passed last December and the recent proclamation..... </para>

                        <para>Here was another point. He took it for granted that the whole of the 1913 crop that had been crushed and. manufactured so far was still in bond. Not one ounce of that sugar had paid Excise, nor would one ounce of that sugar pay Excise once the proclamation was issued ; and he wished to know whether the Government would insure to the grower the full benefit of that fact. All that sugar had been piled up in the sugar-rooms or in bond, and he presumed the refiners were patiently waiting for the issue of the proclamation. </para>

                            <para>- I quite admit that it is absolutely necessary now, hut it is very strange that we did not hear anything about this question until I raised it here. It is quite possible that legislation would have gone on, but the Colonial Sugar Refining Company did not say a word until after the question had been raised here, although notice had been given, and what was likely to occur was discussed in another Parliament. On the 10th September - about three or four weeks after I raised the question here - I asked how much Australian sugar was held in bond in each State on the date of the proclamation of the repeal of the Sugar Excise Act? I asked, further, who were the persons holding or owning Australian sugar in bond? thirdly, whether the Excise duty had been paid on any of the sugar? and, fourthly, whether the Minister would lay on the table of the House any papers or reports of interviews relating to the repeal of the Sugar Excise Act which passed between the Commonwealth Government and the Queensland Government, and any other persons or companies? The Minister has kindly furnished me with the following draft of his reply - </para>

                        <para>The criticisms of the Opposition, and the final decision of the Government appear alike to have been based upon the fear that by some means an undue profit might accrue to the refiners; and, indeed, it was boldly asserted by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tudor</inline> that many thousands of pounds had been lost to the revenue of the Commonwealth by the laches of the Government in issuing two proclamations - Excise and bounty repeal - on the same day. It has since been shown that nothing of the sort occurred so far as the Colonial Sugar Refining Company is concerned. But, provided steps had been taken to protect the rights of the raw sugar millers and the growers, there could have been no just grounds of complaint, even had &#39;a few thousands of tons of refined sugar passed out of bond automatically on the issue of the proclamation. This is the ordinary course of events in connexion with any alteration in duty, the new law taking effect from the moment it is laid on the table of the House. </para>

The paper says that, although I stated that thousands of pounds had been lost, nothing of the sort had occurred so far as the Colonial Sugar Refining Company were concerned. I asked the Minister if any of them had paid up, and he said, &#34; No, not one.&#34; Although the Colonial Sugar Refining Company held 25,000 tons of sugar on the date of the issue of the proclamation, they have been holding the &#163;100,000, which they ought to have paid in duty, and not one penny of interest is being paid into the Treasury. I would ask the Treasurer if any interest has been paid or been charged for that amount which the company has been withholding since the 25th July, or about nine weeks, estimating the rate of interest at about 4 per cent.- </para>

                            <para>- Had notice been given to the company that the Government intended to bring new legislation into operation as soon as possible, and asked the company what they proposed to do with regard to the sugar on which they ought to pay, the company would have said, &#34; Make a proclamation as soon as you like; we will pay on the sugar we have in bond.&#34; If they are willing to pay now, although they have not paid a single penny, does any honorable member mean to tell me that they would not have been glad to make terms with the Government, saying, &#34; Issue your proclamation on 25th July, at 4 o&#39;clock, and we will have everything cleared out of our bonds at 3.30.&#34; In that event the Government would have had the advantage of the use of the &#163;100,000, and also the &#163;58,000 which, according to the Minister, is due from various other people who hold from 1,200 tons down to three. Probably some of that sugar is not in consumption, and in all probability the Colonial Sugar Refining Company - I have nothing either good, bad, or indifferent to say about them, but I am taking them merely as an illustration - will be so glad to get shut of the whole business that they will be willing to pay up the amount. They are in absolutely the best position of any monopoly in Australia that I know of. Their own journal said that they had paid up, and stated further that even if the Commonwealth had lost the revenue on the few thousand tons of refined sugar, we had nothing to complain about. I personally think we have a good deal to complain about, as the company has not paid up, and there would have been no necessity to bring in this legislation had care been taken at the proper time. </para>

                            <para>- We know, however, that the evidence of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knox</inline> was most unreliable. He refused to answer questions which he considered inconvenient, and when he was asked whether the company had not given &#163;50,000 to fight the referenda of 1911, he said that there was no right to ask such a question. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knox,</inline> however, did not deny that the company had given a certain amount to fight that referenda. I did not know that the representatives of the company had said in their evidence that they were not prepared to take advantage of the repeal of the Acts. I understood that their promise did not refer to the matter now under discussion, but had to do with the basic price of sugar. I take it that what was meant was that if 12s. per ton were being paid for cane in a certain district, and the bounty was 6s., with an extra 2s. or 2s. 2d., they would take no advantage in that connexion. I do not think there was one word in the evidence as to not taking advantage of the repeal of the Act. </para>

                            <para>- I think the Minister will agree with me that the witnesses were trying to make out that the company would not take any advantage of what had been done so far as the price of sugar was concerned. The Minister and the honorable member for Kooyong must be aware that cane, practically useless and valueless, has been sent to the mills for crushing, with the sole object of obtaining the bounty. For instance, cane badly frosted or destroyed by fire has been sent to the mills with that object; but that, of course, will not be possible now. </para>

                            <para>- Practically valueless crop has been sent to the mills, and has  obtained the bounty from the Commonwealth. It is quite possible that, had the legislation remained as it was, it would have been amended in this respect, because the Commonwealth has no right to pay a bounty under such circumstances. The Minister has said that the legislation of 1912 was introduced so late that it was impossible for the Queensland Government to pass their necessary legislation, so that it could be put into operation during the off season. Had the proclamation been issued then, there would have been much less sugar to collect on; but an arrangement could have been made whereby the refiners could have paid the whole amount due to the Commonwealth. As the Minister pointed out last night, there were 3,133 tons of sugar of last season&#39;s crop on which bounty was paid to the extent of &#163;3 per ton; so that we have paid something over &#163;9,500, and received nothing in return. The legislation was introduced as soon as possible alter the Royal Commission had brought in their report. When the report was submitted, a communication was sent to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Denham,</inline> presenting two alternatives - that he should be prepared to hand over to the Commonwealth Government the power to deal with coloured labour in the mills, and fix the industrial conditions, or that his own Government should fix the industrial conditions as laid down by the Royal Commission. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Denham,</inline> in his reply, preferred the latter alternative; and the proclamation would have been issued immediately he passed his legislation, and the Commonwealth Government were satisfied that the proper conditions had been complied with. </para>

The Minister need not think, because he is one of those twopenny-ha&#39;penny barristers, that he has, as it were, got me in the witness-box. He need not keep on repeating questions, because I shall only answer those I choose to answer. I have treated the Minister perfectly fairly, though there are many nasty things that I might have said in connexion with the matter. The honorable gentleman, however, has gone out of his way to make statements that I do not think are quite fair. </para>

I am sure that honorable members opposite do not believe the press when it says that this blunder would not have been rectified by the Labour Government before the proclamation was issued. There is no doubt that an error has been made, and this Bill ought really to bo described as one to remedy the blunder of the present Minister in issuing a proclamation before he knew that it meant a difference of &#163;158,000 in the revenue.. This point will no doubt, be dealt with by the honorable member for Werriwa when he proceeds to show why the extra bounty should or should not be paid. The honorable member will point out that we shall pay away at least three-fourths of the &#163;158,000 in the administration of the Act. </para>

                            <para>- The only information I have to the contrary is a telegram with respect to wages conditions. This was referred to Queensland, and since then I have seen an announcement from the State Treasurer that there was some misunderstanding, and that he was enforcing the provisions of the Act. </para>

                            <para>- I know - and probably the Minister knows - certainly, the honorable member for Kooyong will know better than the present Minister, because he was the Minister of Trade and Customs at the time - that while the old industrial conditions were in operation there were continual complaints from the men. The evidence taken before the Royal Commission shows that, in some cases, the men did not even get the 4&#189;d. per hour laid down by the Chapman regulations. </para>

                            <para>- The regulation I issued was denounced in Queensland; but I am rather proud that the Sugar Commission said I was the first Minister to decide that a living wage should be paid in the sugar industry, and that, where others had only dealt with 4&#189;d. per hour and keep, I, at any rate, had lifted the rate to 9d. per hour and keep. An industry should pay a living wage; otherwise, in my opinion, it cannot justify its existence in Australia. Any industry should pay a living wage to persons engaged in it. </para>

                            <para>- No matter what we are paying for the industry, the men engaged in it are entitled to receive a living wage, and we should see, as far as we can, that the agreement with the Queensland Government has been carried out. Legislation in this matter has been handed over by the Commonwealth Parliament to the Queensland Legislature - because 90 per cent. of the industry is confined to Queensland - on the condition that certain wages and conditions of labour shall be observed. I am anxious to know whether they are being observed; otherwise we should know what is being done in the matter. When the Commonwealth had control of the industry, our officers used to go from place to place to see that the workers got their fair share. If the farmer did not pay the1s. per hour the worker was supposed to get, his bounty, or portion of it, was held back until we were satisfied by inquiry as to whether the workers&#39; complaint, if correct, was met. Have the Queensland Government appointed officers to see whether the men are getting the wages set forth in the report of the Sugar Commission? As for the Bill before us, I am in accord with it, so long as we see that the conditions are being carried out by the Queensland Government. I raised the question the other day to ascertain whether we had secured the revenue of &#163;158,000 which we shall get under this Bill, even though it is paid away again in a great many cases in bounty to farmers, and through the extra 2s. 2d. this year, because of the additional wages they will have to pay for cultivation of the crop to be harvested. I am with the Minister in hoping that this measure will pass into law as soon as possible, so that the Commonwealth can obtain this revenue from the companies and the holders of sugar on the day of the proclamation, which need not have been issued unless this arrangement had been made. </para>

                            <para>- That the Ministry for the time being should have the power to repeal both Acts. It is equally clear, as they were put together in that way, that they were to be repealed at the same time. It was in 1903 that the Bounty and Excise Acts were brought in. They were subsequently amended in 1905, when provision was made for cutting down the bounty in 1911 from 3s. per cwt. to 2s. per cwt., and in 1912 from 2s. to1s. The meaning was that by this time the bounty would entirely disappear. In a similar way provision was also made for the abolition of the Excise, but when the Labour Government came into power in 1910 they introduced a measure which did away with the decrease of the bounty that was to be brought about in the following year, and also the decrease of the Excise. I need hardly say we are in a very extraordinary position with regard to sugar. It has cost the Commonwealth something like &#163;10,000,000 to keep the industry going - if we can term anything that does not pay its way an industry. The Government propose to collect the Excise. I think provision should be made for collecting this, because, undoubtedly, the consumers have had to pay it, and the money should pass into the Treasury. One measure makes provision for that, but, on the other hand, provision is also made for the abolition of the whole of the Excise of 4s. per cwt., so that, by these two Acts combined, instead of continuing the Excise alone, and taking into consideration the Customs duty, we have allowed the Queensland sugar-grower to collect something like &#163;6 a ton for all the cane grown on his farm. On that grown this year it will be about &#163;1,200,000, though it has been as high as &#163;1,300,000, and this is what the country is asked to pay in order to keep the sugar industry going. When Tasmania asked for &#163;500,000, distributed over ten years, practically &#163;50,000 a year, complaints were raised; but here is a great State of the Commonwealth which cannot get along at all, which is apparently utterly useless and barren, and whose industry will die out unless it is allowed to collect &#163;1,250,000 a year from the rest of the people of the Commonwealth. It would seem that the more rich land we have the worse off we are. We are told in one breath of all the rich land of the Commonwealth being in Queensland, and in the next breath we are told that it takes &#163;1,250,000 to cultivate it with white labour. </para>

I shall correct myself at once, but he does not think that I, or any reasonably-minded man, would suppose the Excise duty would add to the outside cost of the article. At the present time one or two great companies are in the position of being able to collect practically the whole of this money from the public. Undoubtedly, they will collect it, because they will allow sugar to be bought in bond just as it is bought out of bond. </para>

My objection to this measure is, first, that it is retrospective, and it is not worth while to introduce such legislation, even for the sake of &#163;150,000. Every citizen should know that under no circumstances, whether a mistake has been made or not, will Parliament go back on its legislation. Rebukes may. fall on Ministers who have made mistakes, or on their predecessors, or on officials, but Parliament should not pass retrospective legislation . </para>

Such legislation creates a precedent which may be acted on in a way that will do infinite harm, and destroy public confidence. The experience of a good many countries has shown that that opinion is sound, and it is an opinion held by many men who have studied all the cases in which retrospective legislation has been deemed necessary. </para>

                            <para>- I should like a definition of &#34;industry.&#34; Every occupation in which men are working is not an industry. If we passed a law compelling the use of wooden ploughs, we should give employment in the making of such ploughs, but we should not thereby create an industry, and if the ploughing operations cost the community &#163;3 an acre more, the more ploughing that was done the worse off the people would be. There are about 140,000 acres planted with sugarcane in Queensland, and cane is cut on about 100,000 acres. According to the Royal Commission of Inquiry appointed by the Labour party, whose report, I suppose, they accept, this costs the community over &#163;1,000,000 a year. Manifestly, Queensland herself could not bear that expense. The wider the extent of her rich land the worse off she would be. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member may think the expenditure necessary, to meet the competition of the black labour of other countries; but that competition is merely transferred from one set of shoulders to another - from the producer of sugar to the consumer. Two industries that should not be the objects of departmental aid, State or Commonwealth, are sugar-growing and tobacco-growing. I have always looked upon the work necessary for the production of sugar and tobacco as appertaining more particularly to native races. The productions are tropical ones, and we should not force white men into tropical industries if it can be avoided. It could be avoided by allowing the sugar industry to go its own road. We could have said to the growers,  &#39; You possess rich land ; make the best use you can of it.&#34; In 1893 it was said that the Richmond River district would be depopulated if the duty on sugar were removed. But <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid, when in power, reduced it from &#163;6 to &#163;3 a ton, with the result that the people went in for other crops and industries, and an enormous development followed. Instead of those who own the rich land of the country assisting the unfortunates who have only poor land, we ask those who have poor land to assist those on the rich land. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly, as far as Bundaberg. If I did not, I should have to admit that a large part of that country is unsuited for white occupation. Labour members say that it is a white man&#39;s country; that any white man can work in the sugar-fields of Queensland. What excuse, then, is there for the proposal now before us to abolish the Excise ? During the past five years the Excise receipts have been, roughly, over &#163;700,000 a year, and in 1910-11 reached &#163;800,000 ; but that year the bounty paid amounted to &#163;631,000, the Excise revenue being reduced accordingly. We can see what a burden the rich sugar lands of Queensland are on the Commonwealth. If a man holding some of the rich Warrnambool potato land were to say to this Parliament, &#34; My land is so rich that I cannot get along without a bounty of &#163;7, &#163;8, or &#163;10 an acre,&#34; he would be laughed at. But a similar statement by those who hold the rich sugar lands of Queensland is treated quite differently. It is surprising to find how the economic view is affected by political considerations. </para>

                            <para>- One foolishness does not excuse another. On the Hunter River and on the Belabula River, where I live, there is rich lucerne land which requires five men to keep 40 acres going. I have been regretting hitherto that I had so much poor land, and so little rich land. Apparently, I ought to say to this Parliament, &#34;My land is so rich that I cannot geb along without a bounty of &#163;7, &#163;8, or &#163;10 an acre&#34;; and if Parliament treated me as the sugar-growers are being treated, I would get a bounty. I employ only white labour. Some of the land in the district will produce 30, 40, and 50  tons  of green crops, and from 7 to 8 to 10 tons of lucerne a year. From 30 to 40 tons of sugar-cane can be got from the richer land; but the frosts destroy the cane, and the sugar content is only 2 or 3 per cent. If the sugar content were 10 per cent., making the cane much more valuable than it is, instead of getting uo assistance, Parliament would help me. I should be told, &#34;Your land is so rich that we intend to subsidize you to the extent of &#163;3 a ton.&#34; That is, I would get 6s. to 7s. 6d. - a little more, or a little less, according to the sugar content of the juice- as a bounty for every ton of cane I produced. But, not being so well off as the Queensland sugar-growers, I cannot get anything. </para>

But, in any event, does the giving of a bounty of &#163;10,000 a year to one industry justify the payment of a bounty of &#163;1,000,000 a year to another? What is the sugar industry doing for Australia in return for all this assistance? Those engaged in the pastoral? wheat, and dairying industries - in fact, the farmers of Australia generally - are paying this big tax. </para>

                            <para>- But not in New South Wales, and since the production of butter in New South Wales just now is a little more than is the production in Victoria, it would seem that the less we have of bounties the better. Is it not extraordinary to allege that a butter market, which was previously in existence in England, was created by the payment of a bonus on the production of butter in Victoria ? An inquiry in Victoria some time ago showed that npt one dairy farmer got a penny of the butter bonus, so that the honorable member&#39;s argument is not a very sound one. The money to provide for these bounties can come only from the industries that are paying. When are honorable members going to realize that such payments cannot go on for ever ? During the last five years, we have received a little over &#163;700,000 a year by way of Excise on sugar. We are now doing away with the whole of that revenue. The extra amount made up to the sugar-growers of Queensland by means of bounty, according to the honorable member for Franklin, runs up to &#163;1,500,000 a year. We can safely put it down, after excepting the amount from the industry that goes into the Treasury, at &#163;1,250,000 per annum. Ten years ago, the honorable member for Angas and I pointed out that this would be the result of the introduction of the system. </para>

                            <para>- The Sugar Commission set out that the assistance granted to the industry by the Commonwealth amounted to &#163;1,000,000 per annum, and for the purposes- of my argument, I will accept those figures. How long are we to continue such a system ? Is this call <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> the rest of the people of Australia for &#163;1,000,000 a year for the sugar industry to be made for another ten years? The bounty should not have been granted in the first place, but, having abolished it, the Government had a right to continue the Excise, since those engaged in the industry will even then be reaping an advantage to the extent of &#163;2 per ton, or between &#163;400,000 and &#163;500,000 per annum. Some other part of the Commonwealth has to make good this payment out of the Treasury to those on the sugar lands. The small area of land in northern New South Wales devoted to sugar cultivation and sugar lands in Queensland would realize, even if their use for the cultivation of sugar were forbidden, up to &#163;25 and &#163;30 per acre. And yet we are told that we ought to give these lands a bonus of &#163;5 or &#163;6 an acre. Last year it cost us, roughly, over &#163;10 per acre to keep the sugar industry going. </para>

                            <para>- In the Richmond River district it used to be said that the industry could not continue without help. It would have been infinitely better for the Commonwealth if we had not paid this bounty. A little while ago I met a man from the Clarence River, who told me that he had had a very bad time last year, floods having destroyed the whole of his crop, and when I remarked that he would be getting his bounty, so that he would be all right, he replied, &#34; The authorities would not give me any bounty this year, although last year I had such a magnificent crop that the bounty ran up to &#163;6 an acre or more.&#34; In other words, when he had a magnificent crop the Government paid him &#163;6 per acre by way of bounty, whilst in the year during which he most needed assistance, it gave himnothing. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member is quite right. Enormous burdens are imposed upon the consumers. In this case we have had &#163;1,000,000 a year diverted from the pockets of the people who earned it, into the pockets of those who did not earn it. We are paying more than the whole industry is worth. The total production of cane before it is cut and delivered is not worth &#163;1,000,000 a year. Yet we have had honorable members opposite claiming that they made a good bargain with the Queensland Government by insisting on the workers in the industry receiving 8s. a day. That does not call for much rejoicing, because there is not a wheat farmer in Australia who, during harvesting operations, is not paying more. In my district, last year, we paid up to 15s. per day for stacking. In addition to the bounty previously offered to the sugar-growers, we have the Government coming forward now with the proposal that a further sum of &#163;35,000 shall be paid to them. I should like to know what scintilla of excuse there is for this further bounty. It was not until 5th September, 1912, that the Premier of Queensland wrote to the Commonwealth Government in regard to the repeal of the Excise and bounty, whilst the repealing Acts were not passed until 21st December last. Why then give the growers a further bounty of &#163;35,000? I am sure that the bulk of them never expected anything of the kind. </para>

                            <para>- The right honorable member will permit me to correct him. The bulk of the work is done by machinery. If any honorable member can show me that a solitary grower was induced by the promise of this extra bounty to cultivate sugar-cane, then, although I do not agree with the principle, I shall offer no objection to it. A Parliament must carry out the promises made on its behalf. But we are asked, at a time when we can ill afford it, to give an additional &#163;35,000 to men who will receive this year in bounties alone over &#163;500,000, whilst last year they received &#163;550,000. </para>

                            <para>- Then the honorable member ought to be all the more ready to do the proper thing on this occasion, and not to vote the money elsewhere. The dairy and wheat farmers have to carry the burden. The money does not come out of the sky. Our farmers have to sell everything they produce in open competition on the other side of the world, but the manufacturer comes along and says, &#34; I cannot bear the competition I have to put up with, and you farmers will have to bear it with me.&#34; The farmer, like a good, willing soul, takes the extra burden on himself, instead of pointing out that he has to bear competition in his own business in the world&#39;s markets. No wonder he often asks himself what advantage he gets out of a Tariff of. this sort.  His  awakening has begun, and, I hope, will continue, because, unless we have a return to sane legislation on matters of this sort, we shall be discouraging our true producers by making them bear the burden of the unproductive industries. </para>

                            <para>- Considering that I sell both in the markets of the world, I believe I would be glad to get rid of such a bitter sham and humbug. My wool, hides, tallow, butter, wheat, and even rabbits, are sold in the markets of the world against the open competition of the world, and yet, when I want to buy anything, I am told that I have to bear, not only that competition, but the manufacturer&#39;s competition as well. I am now told that because Queensland has half-a-dozen representatives who can swing the majority to one side or the other, the farmers of other States must bear this burden. They are to bear this further million a year, which your own Commission have admitted that we have to pay. </para>

You see what a very small class you have to deal with. In other words, we have this proposition put forward, that if you encourage men to produce something which is worth &#163;10 an acre, when produced it is worth only &#163;5 an acre, but they can have a bonus of &#163;5 an acre collected from other people. When you do that you are making it a wonderful industry. </para>

                            <para>- I grant that, but the fruit-grower is not safeguarded if he has to bear a large part of this burden. This &#163;1,000,000 a year can only come from other industries which are self-supporting, and cannot come from the industries that have to be helped. I feel ashamed to have to state simple economic facts of that sort so often to the House, but I do not find Parliament prepared to subsidize me when I make a loss. The year before last, when I sowed 1,000 acres of wheat, and lost it all because of the drought, Parliament did not subsidize me. I freely admit that it could not. </para>

The Tariff already wrings some &#163;16,000,000 a year from the people, and when you add the extra cost of it the amount is over &#163;20,000,000. I hear men in this House say, &#34; We give so much to the farmers.&#34; It always reminds me of the burglar who robbed a man of &#163;10, and gave him back a shilling. </para>

He will first vote for not giving the &#163;35,000, and his next hope is that he can find sufficient in this House to vote for the continuance of the Excise, as we must either do that or reduce the duties, so that there may be a saving to the people of the Commonwealth. I know that what I have said in a House like this, which has made up its mind, will not be of any great practical value for the present, but I desire, at least, to place on record my opinion against this further grant of &#163;35,000, which I distinctly consider ought not to be voted. I further desire to place on record how wrong it is to continue this tremendous protective duty on behalf of the sugar farmers. </para>

I have been put out in the past for that reason, and, in all probability, I may be put out again, but I shall always do what I think right, and not only as my constituents think right. I have had the satisfaction of knowing that they have come back to my views, and scores of them have sufficient faith in me to believe that when I do a thing, it will be justified by reason, and although the results may not be so apparent to-day, I am bound to be justified by the future. </para>

                        <para>.- No one who knows the honorable member will charge him with want of courage, although sometimes they may doubt his discretion. I said, by interjection to the Minister, that he was not as frank in dealing with this matter as I should have expected him to be. I recollect that when <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner was in the Ministry, and had to deal with this matter, he came down to the House, and said, &#34; We have to tell honorable members that we have made a blunder, and we are bringing down legislation to rectify it.&#34; That was a straightforward and proper way of doing it. I wish to tell the honorable member for Werriwa and others that this matter was well considered before these Bills were brought in. Speaking from memory, last year&#39;s crop in Australia was just a little over 130,000 tons, while the average consumption of recent years has been about 220,000 tons; therefore, in the ordinary course of events, long before the new cane had been brought to the mills, the whole produce of the year should have been out of bond and on the market. The agreement with the State Government was perfectly clear. It did not relate to the last year&#39;s crop but applied to the new crop. During the elections it was freely stated in my electorate amongst the growers that the present Prime Minister had given his assurance, as a matter of policy, that he would proclaim the Act unconditionally - whether the Government of Queensland agreed to the conditions or not.  Colonel Rankin  met me at Childers with a deputation of sugar growers, and asked me to proclaim the Act before the Parliament of Queensland had made any agreement as to the conditions to be imposed ; and the deputation was very angry, and said I was unworthy to represent a sugar district when I refused the request, declining to take the word of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Denham</inline> or any one else until the conditions had been complied with. The conditions had not been complied with when we resigned office, and the matter had to be left to our successors. When the Government met Parliament -early in July, the obligation placed upon them was to look after the affairs of the Commonwealth. They complained of the incompetency of the previous Government, and spent their time examining into what the Fisher Government had done or had not done. In the meantime, the new crop was being delivered at the mills, and in due time became sugar subject to Excise duty, and, as such, a bond material in the possession of the Government. Any dutiable article in bond is in every respect under the control of the Government; and yet, although the question has been asked again and again, we cannot ascertain how much sugar was in bond at the particular time. I have often asked the Minister of Trade and Customs for that information, and it would have been quite easy for him to obtain the necessary information from his officers, showing the quantity of sugar in bond at any or every particular period. </para>

                            <para>- I have asked for the information again and again. The trouble arose after the present Government came into office. At that time the new crop was coming into the mills rapidly every day, and it was not for more than a calendar month afterwards that the present Government issued the proclamation. I am sorry to say that no Minister has yet stated whether, before issuing the proclamation, any inquiry was made from the official heads to ascertain how much sugar was in bond, both of the old and new crop. So far as I know, there has been no straightforward statement on the point, although it is one of the first that should have received consideration from the Minister. </para>

                            <para>- Did the Minister of Trade and Customs advise the Prime Minister, before he issued the proclamation, as to the sugar in bond, both in relation to last year&#39;s crop and the present crop ? That was, undoubtedly, a Cabinet matter, and very important. I remember that the Government came down with no policy, as is shown by the fact that, in order to form one, they required time to look into what the late Government had been doing; and there can be no doubt that they looked for defective legislation as well as defective administration. Further, the Government and their supporters had been going all over the country denouncing what we had done, and what we had not done; and the meanest thing of all was their saying that the blunder was caused because of our defective legislation. It would have been better had , provision been made to prevent any sugar on which the bounty had been paid from going out of bond after the proclamation; but, in one sense, the legislation was not defective at all. Owing to the short crop it was, seemingly, evident that there would be, and could be, no sugar m bond at the time of the proclamation. During the whole of the campaign, at Maryborough and elsewhere, I made the statement that the Government would carry out its agreement with the Queensland Government, and proclaim the Acts if the State Government carried out their part. Failing this, the late Government, had they remained in office, would have equalized the bounty and the Excise. They would have protected the growers absolutely, and secured to them everything they could get by legislation. It will be seen, therefore, that the late Government were in no way the cause of the * present trouble. The State Government were exceedingly dilatory in carrying out their part, it being late in the year before their Parliament met. The honorable member for Werriwa has referred to this as a highly protected industry, conducted on some of the best lands in the Commonwealth. The honorable member has only stated facts; and I am happy to say that it is also a fact that it is now a white-labour industry. This industry could not live a year unless it was highly protected, and it is for Parliament to say whether it will continue to grant high Protection. It is not benefited by the bounty and Excise, which were instituted simply to differentiate between the growers employing white labour and the growers employing coloured labour. That legislation does not affect the selling price of sugar in Australia, nor does it affect the remuneration of the growers or others engaged. What does affect the industry is the &#163;10 duty on sugar other than cane, and the &#163;6 duty on purely cane sugar; and, in my opinion, a lesser duty than &#163;6 would prevent the industry being a success. That is my firm conviction; indeed, I am doubtful whether the present protection is sufficient. </para>

                            <para>- But the honorable member has the advantage of the best machinery in the world for harvesting his wheat. Unfortunately the mechanic has lent little aid towards the production of sugar.  Beyond  a few cultivation machines, singular to say, no machinery has been invented that enables us to deal with sugar better than it can be dealt with by manual labour, so that the skilled or white man has very little advantage over the unskilled or coloured man with equal manual strength and dexterity. For that reason the sugar industry is exceedingly peculiar. </para>

                            <para>- No. I go further, and say that the sugar industry in Australia has given the world a lesson, something unknown in the previous history of the world, because 500 miles of tropical country has been developed by white labour in a way that it was never thought possible. The honorable member for Werriwa has referred to the northern rivers of New South Wales. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid, when Premier of New South Wales, proposed to remove the duty upon sugar, but, u&#34;nder pressure, he amended his Tariff to reduce the duty by a half, leaving it at &#163;3. Does the honorable member for Werriwa know that the northern rivers he speaks of are over 1,000 miles south of where the great bulk of the sugar is produced - Cairns, for instance? It was declared in my early days in this country that white men could not work in the sugar-cane fields in the Mary River district, a little north of Brisbane. Ten or twelve years ago in this House we could find honorable members declaring the impossibility of white labour making a success of the sugar industry. Where are those honorable members now? They do not come forward and say so now. What party stood the brunt of the fight on that question? The father of the present Minister of Trade and Customs was one of a Royal Commission to which I must pay respect. They took evidence, going back to 1884 and 1885, and it was declared possible for white labour to work as far north as Mackay. A few years&#39; discussion enabled us later to say that the industry could be developed still further north, until now we know there is no part of Australia where sugar can be produced that white labour cannot successfully produce it. But we cannot produce sugar without protection from outside competition. </para>

When legislation  dealing with the sugar question was first brought into the Commonwealth Parliament, in 1901, the growers at Mackay passed a resolution which said that it was not an economic question at all, but that it was a physical impossibility for white men to do the work. </para>

                                Griffith abolished the recruiting of Polynesian labour because of the abuses which had crept in, to which I do not wish to refer now. That was in 1883 or 1884, and the importation of Polynesian labour was to terminate about 1892; but a financial crisis having intervened in the meantime,
                                <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline>
                                Griffith departed from his political views and principles, and joined in a coalition - something like that which we saw in Federal politics not long since. He became somewhat demoralized, and early in 1891 issued to the electors of Queensland a manifesto, in which he declared he was going to amend his law for another period of ten years. But there is one party in Queensland which has never departed from its principles and beliefs that white labour could and would develop that part of Australia. That party was right; the others were wrong. Great as it may seem to the honorable member for Werriwa, the amount of protection given to the sugar industry is not nearly so much as that given to some of the secondary industries, where the competition is with white labour in practically the same standard of comfort. We have given larger protection to the production of agricultural machinery, which is a monopoly.

                            <para>- When I was in charge of the Customs Department, in 1904, arrangements  were  made for manufacturers  to  use their sugars in bond. They could introduce their sugar from overseas and send it out at no disadvantage to themselves. They could purchase at the lowest price  in  the markets of the world, and return their jams to the markets of the world. Certainly,  as  regards jam, produced and sold in  Australia,  the honorable member&#39;s  argument would  apply for the sugar used,  and  the  same  thing applies to every sweetmeat  and all  confectionery manufactured; but the duty on those articles is much higher than that on sugar. It is&#62; not easy to argue with the honorable member for Werriwa on the question of whether there should be free exchange or not, because his mind is quite settled on that point. </para>

                            <para>- It is much higher than that now. With one exception, I do not remember the price being as low as that which the honorable member has quoted. However, it is of no use my arguing with the honorable member, because he is going to make a case whether it is good, bad, or indifferent. There are larger issues than even that phase  of  the question. One  of  the most difficult questions we have had to deal with is the present situation, because  of  the attitude  of  both parties in the Commonwealth towards divorcing this  industry from the National Parliament. Previously the growers, and those interested, were not anxious that the Commonwealth Government should have anything to do with the industrial side of the sugar question. They were quite prepared to have the National Parliament protect them from outside competition, but, in my opinion, the mass of them did not wish the National Parliament to deal with wages and conditions of labour. The National Parliament quite correctly intervened in that matter. As we were protecting the industry, if we protected it sufficiently, we should, as far as we were able, insure fair and reasonable conditions and wages to the employes in the industry equally with those in any other industry. The present position is this: The Commonwealth Parliament has taken action to protect its growers from outside competition. </para>

                            <para>- That. is not relevant to the present argument. When all is said, there can be only mischief and danger resulting from having one Parliament to deal with the industrial side, and another with the protective and economic side of this subject. It is impossible that the sugar industry could live without high Protection on the sea-board. We must make up our minds for that, and must give security to those engaged in the industry, which involves a greater expenditure of capital, in proportion to the value of the production, than any other. The honorable member for Werriwa spoke lightly of the fine land that is devoted to cane-growing, and the good returns that are got from it, but, in my opinion, there is no more dangerous industry in the world than the sugar industry. </para>

                            <para>- Let us consider who are the parties engaged and interested in the production of saleable sugar. There is the worker, the&#39; grower, the miller, the refiner, and the consumer. In my opinion, it is regrettable that this Parliament has not power to deal  with  the separate interests of those five classes. Had we that power, it would be a simple thing to deal effectively and efficiently with every dispute or complaint that might arise. I hope that the time is not far distant when we shall be able to establish a tribunal to fix a fair remuneration for the worker, a fair price for the grower and the miller, and a fair return for the refiner.  </para>

                            <para>- That is the case in nearly every industry. If we are going to develop the northern parts of Australia with the assistance of the sugar industry, we must protect that industry sufficiently to enable the growers to live on the results of reasonable effort, and they should be assured of a settled policy for a long term. The sugar industry requires an enormous amount of capital for its full development, and no one would go into it without being able to see a number of years ahead. It requires two or three years to get any return at all, and from &#163;50,000 to &#163;150,000 is needed for a mill, and, perhaps, &#163;500,000 for a refinery. </para>

                    <para class="block">Australia. But 500 miles of country there have been settled and developed by the sugar industry, some of the country being more closely settled than the Gippsland districts. That settlement would not have taken place under other conditions. More of the children born in the north than of those born in the south live to maturity, and statistics give a better health return for the north than for the south. The ignorance about the north of Australia among those who do not travel is appalling. They will not believe the facts of the case. I have often stated the belief that the solution of the difficulty is for this Parliament to deal with both parts of the industry. I should have preferred, had it been agreeable to those engaged in the industry, to equalize the bounty and Excise instead of having legislation by two Parliaments; but that is past. I venture to say that the sugar-growers are just entering upon a new series of troubles, and I regret it. The refiners have notified the millers, and the millers the growers, of a proposed reduction in the payments for cane next season. The reason for that is a mystery to all of us who have a knowledge of the industry. Their protection has been increased by &#163;1 per ton. From an economic point of view, they should certainly be able to pay in the future what they have paid in the past. The protective and other legislation passed has been primarily for the benefit of the grower, because, when you come to deal with the miller and the refiner, you reach an industry in which skilled labour is employed in nearly every other country. If it should transpire that the grower is going to be penalized, this Parliament will have again to intervene to protect the best of all citizens - those who produce that which leads to commerce and development. We shall never be able to produce in Australia more sugar than the people of. Australia can consume. </para>

                            <para>- I am afraid it would never do for the honorable member to have responsibility in this regard. The rest of Australia should be prepared to pay its proportion of the cost of developing the tropical parts of the Commonwealth. Unless it is it will be impossible for us to maintain our position against those who are opposed to the policy of a White Australia. They will say, &#34;Why waste our substance on the tropical regions of Australia? Why not give over this industry to those who are accustomed to tropical pursuits?&#34; Our reply is that the ultimate cost of doing that would be greater than that which we are now bearing, and it is for this reason, I believe, that the sugar industry has been effectively protected. </para>

The average annual production of sugar in Australia during the last ten years is only 167,000 tons, and in respect to that quantity, &#163;1 per ton went into the revenue of the Commonwealth, leaving a difference of &#163;3 per ton. Last year only 130,260 tons were produced. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member gave the returns for particular years, instead of taking the average. In my opinion, this industry will require substantial Protection on the sea-board as long as we wish to maintain it. If it is to be a white labour industry, it must be able to pay a reasonable wage to the workers engaged in it, and give to the grower a fair return on his capital and labour, as well as a fair return to the miller and refiner. This can be secured only from the people who purchase our sugar, and these purchasers, I think, will be limited to the people of Australia. The local production of sugar will increase only as the population increases. Leaders of both parties, therefore, should make up their minds to declare their views on this matter, and if they are in agreement on the main principles, the industry must develop. Another reason why the sugar industry needs Protection is that quite close to our shores - in Fiji, the Hawaiian Islands and Java - we have ideal conditions for the production of sugar. There is there an abundance of cheap labour to enable sugar to be produced, perhaps for less than it can be produced elsewhere; and, unless some mechanical appliance is invented which will enable the intelligence of the white man to more than cope with the hand labour of the coloured races of other lands, it will be impossible for this industry, without assistance, to develop beyond the requirements of the Commonwealth in the Commonwealth. I regret that the Minister of Trade and Customs, in introducing this Bill, did not frankly admit that his Government failed to make proper inquiries before issuing the proclamation repealing the bounty and Excise; that they did not do justice to their predecessors by admitting that it was impossible for the late Government to issue a proclamation before they left office, since the Queensland Parliament, up to that time, had not passed the promised legislation. I regret that the honorable gentleman did not admit that the new crop came into existence after the present Government came into office; and that if, upon inquiry, the present Government had found the disabilities which they ultimately discovered, Parliament could have been called together, and amending legislation have been passed which would have avoided any loss, either on the part of the growers or the Government. The Ministry, however, were, apparently, so busily engaged in touring the country vilifying their predecessors in office, and making charges of corruption against the electors of Australia, that they forgot their first duty to the State - that of protecting the interests of the whole of the people. </para>

                        <para>. - The care and solicitude which the Federal Parliament has, from its inception, displayed in regard to the sugar industry, has been well justified by the results achieved. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition, who has just resumed his seat, that it will be necessary for the industry to continue to receive the artificial assistance of the Commonwealth if it is to maintain its existence. The assistance so far granted has been an exhibition of a wise and just policy. The industry has been well established, and its volume and importance warrant all the help we can afford to give it. We have been able to demonstrate that this great tropical industry can fee worked by white labour with the very best results. The encouragement of the sugar industry has meant the settlement of a large area which otherwise might not have been occupied. We must not deal with this question from the mere stand-point of pounds, shillings and pence. We have to realize that the settlement of the large tropical area involved is a great and important factor in the defence of Australia. From that stand-point alone, and apart from the industrial aspect, I venture to say thai, whatever sacrifice has been made from a. monetary stand-point lias been more than justified, and that it has been willingly rendered, not only by the State immediately concerned, but by Australia as a whole. </para>

Victoria is prepared to contribute its share towards the settlement of the tropical areas of Australia, and, as shown by its representation here, it believes that this far-seeing policy is wise in the interests of Australia as a whole. There are at present some 5,500 registered growers of sugar in Queensland, so that, at the very least, something like 6,000 or 7,000 persons are directly engaged in the sugar-growing industry on the soil alone. </para>

                            <para>- I shall give the very latest official returns. The number of &#39; registered growers of sugar-cane and beet in .1913 is as follows: - Queensland, white labour, 5,268; black labour, 240. New South Wales, white labour, 819; black labour, 10. In Victoria, 150 white persons are employed in the production of sugar-beet, so that the registered  growers  represent upwards of 5,500 persons; that is, irrespective altogether of those who are employed in the mills and those who are employed in the refineries. And, as my right honorable friend has just interposed, it is estimated that something like 40,000 persons are engaged in the industry. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; and this fact fully justifies the. help which has been consistently given by the Federal Parliament since tie beginning of Federation. Apart altogether from the employment aspect of the industry&#34;, it has assisted Australia to become more and more self-contained. I repeat, that the development of Australia associated with this industry cannot be valued in pounds, shillings, and pence. I feel that the sacrifice which apparently might be urged from the monetary stand-point must not be taken too seriously, and further, that the volume and strength of the industry have justified that care and solicitude which has been consistently shown by the Federal Parliament. The honorable member for Wide Bay deplored the divorce of the economic and industrial side from the Commonwealth Parliament. I do not think there is room for very much regret in that connexion. The object-lesson of Queensland&#39;s response to the suggestion of the Federal Government has verified the wisdom of the scheme of the Constitution. The Queensland Government, working in co-operation with the Commonwealth Government, have supplied all the industrial regulations that can be desired. My right honorable friend stipulated the character of the industrial aid that should be supplied, and every stipulation that he made from his own stand-point has been more than complied with. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member declared, as one condition, that provision should be made for the employment of white labour only. That was complied with. Then my honorable friend stipulated, further, that Wages Boards should be established. This has also been complied with by the Queensland Government. Then my honorable friend contemplated the hiatus that might occur between the establishment of these Boards and the present time. As a matter of fact, the Queensland Government carefully complied with that stipulation by saying that the present regulations should remain in force, and have the effect of awards, until the Wages Boards were actually brought into operation. They even went further. In order to insure that the grower might get the benefit of the difference between the bounty and Excise that was to bo made, they stipulated in their legislation that the contract prices to the grower were to be increased by the addition of that difference between the bounty and the Excise, and so we have the Commonwealth carrying out its constitutional functions by providing for the imposition of an import duty, and, on the other hand, we have a proper and effective economic and industrial regulation by the State in terms of the Constitution itself. This is an object-lesson that has clearly . shown the wisdom of the scheme of the Constitution, and has carried it out to the letter. I venture to  say  it has complied with every wish of my right honorable friend, who had a say in the creation of these conditions. </para>

                            <para>- In 1911 the white labour, employed in Queensland was 5,079, and the black labour 289. In 1913, the white labour in Queensland was increased to 5,268, and the black labour decreased to 240. There has, therefore, been a substantial increase in the registered growers. The number of sugarcane farmers who employed white labour in 1902 was 1,521, and the number who employed black labour was 975. Let us now come to 1912. The number of sugarcane farmers who employed white labour in 1912 was 5,295&#39;, as against 1,521 in 1902, and those employing black labour numbered 266, as against 975 in 3902. This conclusively establishes the wisdom of the policy adopted by the Federal Parliament, and justifies the industry, hu*; I think we have to take a wider outlook as far as the industry is concerned. We have settled a large tropical area upon a white-labour basis. </para>

                            <para>- I am not responsible for the figures I have quoted, which were supplied by the Statistician. If the honorable member for Werriwa is dissatisfied with them, his quarrel must be with that gentleman. Apart from the matters I have mentioned, very little exception can be taken to the speech of the right honorable member for Wide Bay, but he could not refrain from referring, on more than one occasion, to what he called the blunders of the present Government in this matter. He answered himself in that connexion. He went on to say, in the latter portion of his speech, that perhaps it would have been as well if they - the last Government; - had contemplated the contingencies which have  happened, and provided for them in the repealing Acts. I think his words were that his own repealing Acts might have been improved upon. That, in itself, indicates that there was a defect in the legislation of the previous Government. I am not anxious to reproach my honorable friend for the mistake of his Government in that connexion, but what I do complain of is that they have lost no opportunity of attacking the present Government, and endeavouring to place on its shoulders the sole responsibility for what they allege to be a blunder. But the right honorable member&#39;s admission that it would have been better for his own legislation to have been amended in this direction is the complete answer to those charges. The honorable member for Yarra, on about the 20th August, made a rather heated and vicious attack on the Government in connexion with this matter, charging them with the sole responsibility for the blunder. I asked him what would he have done if he had been in the position held by the present Minister of Trade and Customs, and his reply was that he would not have repealed the Excise duty until the duty was paid on all sugar then in bond. My honorable friend has had an opportunity of re-considering that matter in the meantime, and he does not venture to repeat that untenable proposition now. I pointed out to the honorable member that his answer was totally insufficient, as such an action on his part would not have been warranted, and that, with the full responsibility of office, he dare not have done it, because he would have been guilty of a breach of faith. To-night he admitted, as the ex-Prime Minister admitted, that it was the bounden duty of the Commonwealth Government, as soon as the Queensland Government had carried out its part, to proclaim the repealing Acts, and that, therefore, it was obliged immediately to repeal the Excise the moment that assent was given to the Queensland Act. by the State Governor. But apart from the breach of faith that would have been committed, it would have been penalizing the very people whom we seek to benefit; penalizing the growers who had been promised the benefit of 2s. 2d. a ton on their sugarcane. The growers were calling out for their immediate repeal, and every honorable member of this House would have called out for their immediate repeal, in terms of the arrangement between the Commonwealth and State Governments, but now my honorable friend, forgetting how he said formerly that he would have acted, amends his hand, and states that before he issued the proclamation he would have made some arrangement with the refiners. It is all very well for my honorable friend to say that, but arrangements of the kind would require the assent of the other party. In a later portion of his speech he said that that assent  would  not have been given to a Labour Government- </para>

                            <para>- Can the honorable member confidently say that, in the light of what has happened ? It is an utterly unwarranted assumption, and is no answer. Why should the company, the holder of some 25,000 tons, assent to an arrangement of the kind ? Their practice is to take out only such quantities of sugar as they immediately require, and there was no reason why they should immediately take out the lot, and plank down &#163;100,000, but quite the contrary. They would have insisted on taking out such quantities as they weekly require, and, of course, getting the benefit of the retention of the money in their own coffers till the sugar was actually required for consumption. My honorable friend will, therefore, see that he could not have followed out his plan against the wishes of the company and the other Excise payers in the light and airy way he now speaks of. Then the honorable member reproached the Government with not having received this &#163;100,000 some little time ago. As a matter of fact, little or no interest would accrue, because it would only start when the money was payable, and it would only be payable, as the sugar was entered for home consumption from time to time, according to the necessities of the company. Therefore, even the idea  that the  Government are suffering a loss of interest is not justified. But my honorable friend went on to reflect on the present friendly  attitude of the company, which he sought to associate with the advent of the present Government, though he was assured by myself and others that, for some time past, the company have been prepared, so far as this season&#39;s crop is concerned, to give the growers the fullest benefit of the concession. The Colonial Sugar Company&#39;s agreement with growers contains in the schedule of scales of payment the prices to be paid for cane, and also three additional columns, thus - </para>

                            <para>- The telegram was sent early in August. The presentGovernment had already been engaged in an endeavour to make an arrangement with the manufacturers in this connexion, and it was because of the impracticability of an arrangement that the present legislation was introduced&#39;. This conclusively shows that my honorable friend&#39;s suggestion that he would have made an arrangement before the repeal is utterly fallacious. He would have been no more successful than the present Government, and would have been driven to amending legislation of the kind before us. If there is any blunder, the ex-Minister is equally responsible with the present Minister - always assuming, I say, that there is any blunder at all. </para>

                            <para>- No; but if his original legislation had not been defective, amending legislation would not have been necessary. The Leader of the Opposition has himself admitted that it would have been better if some provision had been made in that legislation; but that was not done, and the ex-Prime Minister, had he remained in office, would have been obliged to do exactly what the present Minister is doing. </para>

                            <para>- I shall show that not one shilling can be lost. The majority of the names are those of raw-sugar holders only, and very small holders at that, and they do not enter sugar for consumption or pay the duty. They transfer the sugar to the refiner, who, when entering it for consumption, ultimately pays the Excise. Apart altogether from that, the scheme of the Bill is novel, and only extraordinary conditions would justify this form of legislation. There are practically only three Excise taxpayers. The quantities of this season&#39;s crop of sugar are known; the quantities delivered to the mills between the 1st May and the 25th or 26th July are also known ; and, therefore, the product of refined sugar from that cane is readily ascertainable. But the extraordinary thing is that this sugar, for the most part, has gone into consumption. What the present Government seeks to do by its legislation can practically be done only with the assent of the other side, not regarding the matter from a strictly technical or legal stand-point, but rather from a moral stand -point. The quantity being known, those who are chargeable are not asked to pay the Excise on this particular sugar the product of the cane between those dates, but to pay the duty on the particular quantity, whatever it is, irrespective of the sugar itself. </para>

                            <para>- We are not going to do that. It is not the actual holders of the sugar on the particular dates that are made to pay. The Comptroller of Customs knows the quantity of sugar produced from the cane on which the bounty has been paid between the dates mentioned, and there is a certain amount of sugar in bond. What the Bill says is that, so far as the sugar now in bond is concerned, every pound entered for consumption must pay duty up to the quantity as certified by the Comptroller-General. </para>

I admit that the legislation is novel, but at the same time I claim that the ex-Minister of Trade and Customs would have been obliged to do exactly the same. In further proof of this, I would add that he could not pay the 2s. 2d. per ton concession to the growers without the sanction of amending legislation. He has not suggested any practical scheme out of tie difficulty other than the one before us. </para>

                            <para>- I set out by saying that the Government would not lose a shilling. I repeat that by this process they will not lose a shilling, but they have made a concession of &#163;35,000 odd so far as this season&#39;s crop is concerned in pursuance of the arrangement mutually made between the parties whereby the growers should get the benefit of this 2s. 2d. extra per ton; this, in itself, as I have already pointed out, requires additional legislation. Therefore, admitting at once the novel character of the legislation, and that retrospective legislation in any circumstances is highly unjustifiable, yet, having regard to the agreement between the parties, we are, in this case, justified in passing this Bill, which reaches the object intended, namely, the granting of the benefit of the concession to the growers at the expense of the revenue to the extent of &#163;35,000. That, of course, meant equalizing the bounty and Excise. So, from a technical legal standpoint there is no doubt as to the constitutionality of the measure before us, but from the moral stand-point, were it not that the taxpayers practically consent, I do not think we would be justified in passing this legislation. Nothing is to be gained by recriminations and reproaches. </para>

Quite the reverse, I think that if we can get the revenue by this or other legitimate means we are justified in seeking to collect it. I hope the Minister will get it. I would not give 10s. in the &#163;1 for his chance of getting it, unless the Bill provides, as it does inferentially in some of its clauses, that the tax shall be. <inline font-style="italic">in futu.ro,</inline> instead of being of a retrospective nature.

                            <para>- At the same time, that will not prevent the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, or any other company interested in this matter, from fighting the Commonwealth; and if we go to law to get this &#163;158,000, possibly it will cost us as much as it is worth. I believe the Minister would be well advised to strike out clause 7. If we look at the preceding clause 5, we will see that it refers to sugar manufactured for home consumption after the commencement of this Act.&#34; Does not that clearly show that the Excise is to be imposed in the future ? Sub clause 3 of clause 3 clearly defines that. If the Minister were to rely on that, and impose an Excise on sugar which shall be manufactured, then he can get his money without any difficulty, because his right could not be contested in any Court of law; but to make the Excise of a retrospective character, as in clause 7, is a very serious mistake. These recriminatory passages are also a mistake. Our object should be to arrive at the best means of getting the money. I must say, as I have said before in another debate this session, that the member for Kooyong and the Minister of Trade and Customs are wrong in saying that the matter of making provision for this Excise was never considered.  I give  their statements the flattest contradiction. The ex-Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> and I discussed this very question in the Minister&#39;s room before any action was taken in regard to the repeal legislation ; and though we did not have the opinion of the Crown Law officers, we came to the conclusion that it could be held in law that, prior to the proclamation, provision could be made for the collection of this Excise duty. We even went so far as to discuss the matter of the molasses left at the end of the crushing season, from which sugar could be made. Honorable members are not speaking by the card in saying that the matter was not given  consideration. It was given the fullest consideration by the ex-Prime Minister. </para>

                            <para>- It was not considered necessary. It was thought the proclamation could be delayed until the conditions could be fulfilled, one of those conditions being that the Excise duty should be paid. I do not intend to debate this measure at any length, because we should pass it to obtain the money if possible ; but I wish to refer to something the Minister has said this afternoon. He has said that the 2s. 2d. extra per ton on cane should be paid because of the regulation issued by the ex-Minister of Trade and Customs on the 13th August, 1912, which not only raised wages, but also shortened the hours. </para>

The present Minister has declined to take that into consideration, and the ex-Minister did the same. </para>

                            <para>- When I challenged the honorable member about his Free Trade principles, and asked him to knock off the duties altogether, he was afraid of it as much as he is of small-pox. There are profits in this industry, but I maintained that those entitled to them could not get them until the referendum questions had been put to the people and carried. The position is exactly the same to-day, and as we cannot get at the Colonial Sugar Refining Company to secure the profits to which the growers and manufacturers are entitled, I claim that we should give to the growers the 2s. 2d. extra per ton to compensate them for the increased cost of production. We hoped that the report of the Royal Commission would be such as to justify the Government in taking some drastic action, but the report did not come up to our expectations in some respects, and we were naturally disappointed. The point I wish to make is that the Minister admits he has tabled his Bill for the purpose of giving 2s. 2d. a ton extra to the growers of cane harvested after the 1st May of this year - that is the cane taken into the mills between 1st May and 26th July of this year, on the grounds of the increased cost of production - but I maintain that the argument is equally applicable to the past season&#39;s harvest, and that it is equally justifiable for the Minister to go back to the 13th August, 1912, because the same conditions applied then exactly. </para>

                            <para>- We have no hope of getting two, and I shall vote for the one on the principle of taking what we can get. The Minister should take that into consideration, and so amend the Bill in Committee as to make it apply to all cane harvested last season, subsequent to the 13th August, when the Tudor regulations were issued. If the one course is justifiable the arguments in favour of the other are unanswerable. I have asked the Minister on more than one occasion recently whether the conditions which were laid down by the FisherGovernment in respect to the repeal of the Excise and bounty legislation have been complied with. The legislation having been repealed, we have no power now to enforce compliance, but if the Queensland Premier desires to honorably fulfil his part of the contract, he will see that they are complied with. A little while ago, I gave the Minister correspondence, which I can assure him is absolutely reliable, to the effect that the conditions are not being complied with. One of the conditions was that white labour only should be employed, not merely in the fields, but also in the mills. The Commonwealth has had no control over the work conducted in the mills. When the first Bounty Bill was under discussion, pressure was brought to bear on the then Minister, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston,</inline> to apply conditions to the manufacture of the sugar, but he said that as the bounty was to be paid only for the production of the cane, we would have no control over anything that was done after the cane was delivered into the mill-yards. But, in the negotiations between the Fisher Government and the Government of Queensland, it was arranged that the mill conditions, as well as the field conditions, should be regulated. Furthermore, the rates of wages and the hours observed were to be those recommended by the Royal Commission. The Queensland Government is violating not merely the spirit, but also the letter of the conditions. I had a return laid on the table a little while ago showing the number of coloured aliens - Japanese, Malays, and others - working in the sugar mills, and I say that those persons are still being employed. So far as we know, the language test has never been applied to any one of them, and it is not likely to be applied. Let me read a telegram which I have received this week from Innisfail. It is dated 30th September, and is worded as follows : - . </para>

                    <para>General meeting Australian Workers Union held yesterday entered emphatic protest against reprehensible and discreditable breach of faith on part Premier, Queensland, in bringing about abolition Excise and bounty without conserving principle of white Australia or insuring adequate return to white workers and growers as stipulated by late Prime Minister Fisher. </para>
                    <para>That telegram is signed by the secretary of the union, a gentleman whom I know, and who may be relied on to state the facts exactly. The mill at Innisfail is the Goondi mill, owned by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and, singularly enough, in no one case are the conditions being observed in the mills owned by that company. The letters and telegrams which I gave to the Minister were from the Herbert River, where the company has two mills - the Victoria mill and the Macnair mill. </para>

                            <para>- Will the Minister say now whether, in his opinion, the grower does or does not pay the Excise, or whether the refiner pays it? Of course, the grower pays it. The mills have fulfilled the condition in regard to the 2s. 2d. They have paid the additional 2s. 2d. a ton, but they have lowered the base price. The base price for cane was regulated by the base price for sugar, which was fixed. When that base price exceeded a certain sum, for every &#163;l by which that sum was exceeded, the miller was given 18s., but the base price of sugar having been lowered, the base price for cane has been lowered. Therefore the grower will not be in such a glorious position as the result of the repeal of the Excise and bounty legislation as he hoped to be. He is, presumably, in a worse position. During the Federal campaign I advised him to hang on to the bounty. That has always been my advice, but it has been ignored. The growers will be sorry that this legislation has been repealed. I again ask the Minister if he is justified in paying the additional 2s. 2d. a ton for cane harvested between 1st May and 26th July, if he is not equally justified in paying that amount for the 1912 season&#39;s cane? Will he do that? The action of the Government in this respect is inconsistent. The matter is of great importance to the people of my electorate. I hope that the Government will treat them in a reasonable and fair way. But, as I am desirous that both these measures shall pass, and am willing to give the Minister all the assistance possible in connexion with them, I shall not occupy more time at present. </para>

                        <para>.- I sincerely hope that all the farmers in Queensland will read the speech of the honorable member for Herbert, because it will show them that they have more friends on this side of the House than on the Ministerial benches. We have been their friends right through the piece. Unfortunately, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, which was the back-bone of an association called the Australian Sugar Producers Association, persuaded more than 50 per cent, of the cane-growers in Queensland to demand the repeal of the Excise and Bounty Acts, telling them that they would get a bigger price for their cane if those Acts were repealed. Consequently, as the honorable member for Herbert has pointed out, the cane-growers were not satisfied until they got the Acts repealed. This party agreed to the repeal of that legislation on certain conditions ; but the honorable member for Herbert has shown that those conditions have not been complied with, and has furnished evidence in proof of his statement. I shall, at a later stage, produce correspondence showing that the conditions laid down by the Leader of this party have not been carried out by the Queensland Government. We have now been in session for something like three mouths, and not a week has passed without evidence being forthcoming of the utter incapacity of the Government. Not one thing it attempts to do is done right. Even the Audit Bill- that simple measure- </para>

                            <para>- I refer to the Audit Bill only by way of illustration. It was brought down in an incomplete state, and, in short, the Government have not done one thing well. I mention this as a reason why the Bill now before us in its present form should not pass the second-reading stage. It may be a novel measure, but it is also a clumsy one. The Minister of Trade and Customs must have been busily engaged in trying to find out something that he could use against his predecessors, otherwise his legal training ought to have enabled him to produce a better measure than that now before us. But for that fact, I think he would have been able, also, to discharge his duties as a Minister without committing the awful blunder of which he was guilty in allowing the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and the twenty-eight or thirty other firms or individuals who had sugar in bond, to escape payment of the Excise. The honorable member for Kooyong, who has held office as Minister of Trade and Customs, was at great pains, both to-night and on a previous occasion, to try to explain away the ridiculous mistake made by the present Minister, but he did not quite succeed. I sympathize with the Minister of Trade and Customs, for I know that he is very much worried over this matter. He has exhibited a great deal of discomfort whenever this matter has been brought before the House, the reason being that he knows that he has made a mistake. I arn sure he will admit, upon reflection, that this is a very clumsy piece of legislation. 1 wonder why it was introduced, suddenly, last night, and the second reading brought on to-day, before the people who are interested in it have had a chance of grasping its significance. The residents of those parts of Australia in which sugar is not produced will be very surprised when they read the terms of this Bill. The Minister has furnished a list of firms or individuals who had sugar in bond, totalling -32,387 tons, on 25th July last, the -date on which the proclamation was issued. This list comprises about thirty different firms or individuals. It is headed by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, which had 24,665 tons. Then come the Millaquin Sugar Company, Fairymead Sugar Company, Gibson and Howes, the Australian Estates and Mortgage Company, the Victorian Government, the Farleigh Estates Company, the Queensland Government, Drysdale Brothers and Company, the Mulgrave Central Mill Company, Mossman Central Mill Company, Cattle Creek Sugar Company, Marian Central Mill Company,  Meadowlands  Company, North Eton Central Sugar Company, Plane Creek Central Mill Company, Pleystowe Central Mill Company, Racecourse Central Sugar Company, Moreton Central Sugar Mill Company,  Stegeliz  Sugar Mill Company, Mourilyan Syndicate Limited, Buss Brothers, Broom and Company, Waterloo Limited, Isis Central Sugar Mill Company,  Blissett  and Hart,  Kinnie,  Randall, and Braddock, Burns, Philp and Company, W. H. Paxton and Company, and Burgess Brothers, with sugar ranging from 3,000 tons to 24,665 tons in bond on the date mentioned. All these firms were allowed to take their sugar out of bond after 25th July without paying the Excise duty. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company expresses its willingness to pay the Excise that ought to have been collected, but the other firms are not willing to do so, and this legislation is designed to compel them to pay. How does the Minister propose to force them ? In this Bill it is declared that, as soon as practicable after its passing, the Comptroller-General shall certify in writing, by notice published in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette,</inline> the quantities of cane and beet sugar respectively on which duty is payable under the Bill. </para>

                    <para class="block">That is to say, the Comptroller-General will announce to the public, I presume, that there were 32,387 tons in bond on which Excise will have to be collected, but the Minister has not inserted in the Bill the names of the persons or companies which I have read, and has not provided that they shall pay this Excise, although that would be a sensible way of dealing with the matter. Instead of doing so, he has inserted a clause declaring that certain sugar shall be&#62; deemed to be dutiable, that is to say - </para>

                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">If this Bill be carried, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company will carry out its promise, and pay the Excise, whilst a number of these other firms who had cane sugar in bond on the date in question will, probably, refuse to pay. They will not enter any cane sugar for home consumption, so that the people who are honest and willing to do their duty by the country will continue to pay Excise until duty has been paid on 32,387 tons. I am sure that the Attorney-General has not gone into this point with his colleague, the Minister of Trade and Customs, and the other lawyers of the Cabinet. Had they conferred, they must have seen that they were proposing to do a great injustice to certain people, while allowing others to escape. This is only another Instance of the incapacity of honorable members opposite, who, in strange circumstances, find themselves to be political bed-fellows for the time being. </para>

                            <para>- Some of the honorable member&#39;s acts are blunders, &#34; and some are crimes, although, perhaps, he does not think they are. I venture to say that this Bill is badly drawn, inasmuch as it contains no clause repealing the Sugar Excise and Bounty Repeal Acts. Those two Acts are still in existence, and I think that the Attorney-General, in a case before the High Court, would be able to prove that they were still law, aud that this measure, therefore, was inconsistent with them. He would probably apply for a nonsuit, or some such legal process, to get his client out of his trouble. I regret that the honorable member for Werriwa has such a poor opinion of honorable members of this House as he .displayed this evening. Whilst he was speaking, I was reminded of a visit that I once paid to a lunatic asylum. In conversation with one of the inmates, who said he was the Duke of Wellington, I asked, &#34; Who are those people over there?&#34; and was told, &#34; Oh, you must not pay much attention to them, because they are all of unsound mind.&#34; Listening to the honorable member to-night, some people might have imagined that he was the only man in the Chamber who was possessed of any intellect. He says that, because a man is a Protectionist, he is, in his opinion, of unsound mind. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member has no sugar-growers in his electorate, otherwise he would not propose such a tax. Sugar-cane is a greedy crop requiring very rich soil, and after about thirteen years is said to take all the good out of the land. The honorable member should not forget that Java, Fiji, and the West Indies have land just as good as our own for sugar-growing, and that they have also that which we have not - a cheap and servile labour. In Java, which is close to Australia, labourers will work in the sugar-fields for 3d. per day, whilst the Colonial Sugar Refining Company has at present in Fiji some 18,000 Hindoos  working for 6s. a week on land just as good as the Queensland sugar areas. Is the honorable member going to subject the 30,000 people engaged in the sugar industry in Queensland to that competition? </para>

                            <para>- And other commodities. If the honorable member had his way Australia would be nothing but a vast sheep walk. There might be some farming carried on, but very little. I cannot waste time in trying to convince the honorable member, because I am sure that he is not to be convinced regarding the necessity of protecting, not only primary, but secondary industries. I agree with the honorable member for Herbert that the sugar farmers of Queensland will be very sorry that the control of this industry passed from the Federal Parliament into the hands of the Queensland State Parliament. The Federal bounty legislation was passed to encourage our sugar farmers to employ white labour, and it had the effect of raising the price of cane for the farmers to something like &#163;1, and, in somes cases, up to 24s. per ton, whereas prior to the granting of the bounty they had to accept as low a price as 7s. 6d. per ton for it. The Government ordered that the bounty should be paid direct to the farmer, because previously some of the money found its way into other hands. Thereafter the farmer got the bounty, varying in some cases from 6s. to 7s. 6d. a ton, according to the district he was in. That legislation has been repealed, and already within a few weeks, as the honorable member for Herbert has pointed out, the raw millers are endeavouring to lower the price that they pay to the grower for his cane, and the time will come, without a doubt, when the farmers will realize that the men on this side, who have been urging them not to repeal the Excise and bounty legislation, were their true friends, whereas, honorable members on the other side, by their policy, were only supporting that gigantic monopoly - the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. The honorable member for Herbert said that the conditions laid down by this party were not being carried out, namely, that the Queensland Government should see that the industry was carried out by white labour. I may quote here a letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Moir</inline> - the Secretary of the Australian Workers Union, Queensland branch, dated from Chillagoe, in the far northern district - </para>

                    <para>What will happen, I think, in regard to this industry is this: There is no sugar legislation applying to New South Wales growers now, and the rich lands in the Richmond River district, which is given up to dairy farming because of the white-labour provisions, will probably now be turned into sugar land again, and employ some of the 40,000 aliens who are at present in Australia. The people of Australia will probably object to an import duty of &#163;6 to protect sugar that is grown by alien labour receiving the alien rate of wages, and the only hope that the sugar producers of Australia have to keep up the duty of &#163;6 per ton, notwithstanding the competition from abroad, is to have the industry conducted in such a way that white people shall be employed at the standard rate of wages, with a minimum, as laid down by a Justice of the High Court, enabling a man to marry and bring up a family in reasonable comfort. I do not think this Bill ought to pass its second reading, because it is clumsily drawn, and does not contain, as it should, a provision repealing the two Acts which it proposes to override - the Acts proclaimed the other day, as passed at the end of last session. Perhaps in Committee, if the Minister of Trade and Customs agrees, we may insert the provision asked for by the honorable member for Herbert, and the provision to pay 2s. 2d. to&#39; the sugar farmers dating from the time of the proclamation of the regulations regarding the rate of wages. I am sure the honorable member for Richmond would support us in that. He argued at the time that it was only fair that the sugar-growers should get, by way of bounty, the full amount of the Excise collected. The 2s. 2d. per ton is the difference between the amount of bounty paid to the farmers, and the amount of Excise collected from the general public of Australia through the refiners. The honorable member for Darling Downs, who always poses here as the principal friend of the farmers, having so many of them in his own district, and who looks to the farmers to return the so-called Liberal or rightly-called Tory party, availed himself of every opportunity to speak of the wrongs of the men engaged in the sugar industry in Queensland, and now that he is Minister in charge of the Bill, all he has to do is to ask the Treasurer to give him money to pay this amount. I am sure that he fan get from the Prime Minister a promise to put into the Bill a clause to pay the farmers the 2s. 2d. to which they are entitled. The Minister is very silent. He knows that he is in difficulties. He stands here now like a man who is not quite as genuine as he professes to be in his regard for the farmers. He is wondering what he will have to say when he gets back to his constituents, or when he passes up along the coast, where there are so many sugar-farmers. Seeing that he has had the power to give them the 2s. 2d. to which they were entitled when the rate of wages was raised, they will ask him what has become of  his  professions. When in Opposition he spoke by the hour of the rights of the farmers, and their interests, and showed why they should be paid the 2s. 2d. I am sure he will get plenty of support from this side of the House if he will only alter that clause in the Bill to date back to about 1st August, 1912, instead of 1st May this year. </para>

                            <para>- The Colonial Sugar Refining Company is, no doubt, getting the r631- 2 cream of the industry, and I might, perhaps, draw attention to its position. The report I hold has been frequently quoted against our party. Honorable members opposite have made a great deal of capital out of the fact that the Sugar Commission said that probably it would cost the Commonwealth too much to nationalize the industry. They do not quote passages in this report which tell against the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, proving beyond question that it is a huge monopoly, and fixes the price of sugar in Australia to-day. The following paragraph appears in part 3 of the report, which deals with &#34; growers, miller and refiners &#34; : - </para>

                        <para>For practical purposes the price of refined sugar in Australia is fixed by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company Limited. The absence of actual competition among refiners is evidenced by the fact that the rival refinery at Millaquin automatically follows the lead of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. Potential competition can have little significance within an area where the dominant company is already in the field and the market is to be led to invite new concerns to enter upon a war of competition. Collective bargaining is inoperative. What actually happens is that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company fixes the price subject to two main qualifications. The price must not be so high as to encourage large importations of refined sugar by other persons or companies. On the other hand, the price must be at least high enough to admit of refining profits, while paying for raw sugar a price sufficiently high to avoid squeezing producers of the raw material out of existence. </para>

In Committee, I shall endeavour to get an amendment made, although probably the Prime Minister, the honorable member for Richmond, the honorable member for Robertson, and other professed friends of the farmer, who are always talking about the primary producer, will object to refund the 2s. 2d. to which he is entitled. I might go through the long list of the farmer&#39;s professed friends opposite who are looking to the man on the land to keep them in their positions as members.

                        <para>.- It was my lot in this House ten years ago to object to the proposed bounty on sugar. If it had not been for some of the extraordinary statements made by the honorable member for Kooyong, I should not have risen. That honorable member gave as his sole reason for supporting this Bill the fact that there has been an enormous increase of the number of people engaged in the industry, and a very large extra production.I explained when he was speaking that he must have got hold of the wrong figures, but the honorable member persisted in proceeding, with a lack of knowledge very reprehensible indeed in an ex-Minister. One thing we have to look for from members of this House is the correct statement of facts, and it is highly undesirable that incorrect statements should go forth unchallenged. If the grounds declared by the honorable member are the only ones on which he supports this Bill, he ought to abandon that support immediately. The real figures will show how far he is mistaken. 1 have in my possession a book issued by the Queensland Government in July of this year, and from this it appears that the total production of cane in Queensland was 113,000 tons, which, with some 16,700 tons in New South Wales, makes a total of about 130,000 tons. </para>

                            <para>- I withdraw my dissent. This Bill is very objectionable, because clause 1 provides that the measure is to come into operation on a day to be fixed by proclamation. In other words, the control of the proclamation of the measure passes out of the hands of Parliament. One would have thought we would have learned experience from the blunder already made in respect to fixing by proclamation the time at which an Act should come into operation ; but here the error is to be repeated, and with all the evil effects that will follow from it. I maintain that we should fix some date, so as to keep the Comptroller-General up to the mark, and have matters expedited and concluded within the financial year. Seeing that the Bill merely covers the sugar from cane produced and delivered for manufacture between the 1st day of May and the 26th July of this year, and seeing that to-day is the 1st October, we can fix the proclamation for the middle of December. That will be quite late enough. I therefore move as an amendment </para>

                        <para>.- By striking out the words &#34; and before the 26th day of July,&#34; it will be possible to make this Bill cover the future production of sugar. No doubt the retention of the words will limit the Excise to the sugar produced from cane presented for manufacture between the 1st May and the 26th July, and subsequent sugar will not pay Excise. In other words, the revenue will suffer to the extent of &#163;713,000 a year, the average on the basis of the last five years, and our future returns will show that we have lost that amount of revenue. I shall not be surprised if honorable members opposite talk of the fine revenue in their term of office, and how it was reduced during the period of office of their opponents. Of course, we can show the cutting-down of expenditure of over &#163;500,000 a year; we can make some point in that direction; but, at the same time it is highly desirable to maintain the Excise duty on sugar. Men are now getting from 12s. to 14s. a ton for their cane without the bounty. The production sometimes runs to 60 tons per acre of sugar-cane, and many growers have been paid as much as 27s. a ton. They secure &#163;60 an acre on this rich land, yet we are asked to further subsidize them by the abolition of the Excise duty. I wish to move an amendment to strike out the words &#34; and before the 26th day of July,&#34; with the object of placing on record all those honorable members who are in favour of giving up three-quarters of a million per year, and so that they may explain to their constituents why they have handed over this sum to 3,900 sugarcane farmers. With unparalleled want of knowledge of the situation, this House is apparently handing over to a small section of the community an enormous sum of money. The honorable member for Kooyong supports this Bill because of the enormous increase in the production of cane, but with this enormous increase, the Excise duty we should be able to collect would mean a still bigger revenue. In 1906-7, the total production of sugar was 206,000 tons; in 1907-8, it was 214,000 tons, and last year it was only 129,000 tons. The quantity of cane produced can be estimated roughly by multiplying by ten. The honorable member for Kooyong, therefore, in arguing that the bounty should be continued, and the Excise abolished, because the industry was steadily growing, forgot that it is progressing backwards. We are told that this year the crop promises to be larger, but that seems to me a reason for retaining the Excise. We are really giving up over &#163;700,000 a year, and 1 feel that I cannot justify that action to the Farmers and Settlers Association. I came here to relieve the farmers of the burden of taxation, and promised that I would, so far as I could, lighten their load. We are asked to forego revenue amounting to over &#163;700,000 a year, not for the benefit of the farmers in the Western districts, who have the greatest troubles of all to face, but for the benefit of the owners of some of the richest land in the Commonwealth. It is said that the Ministers are fulfilling a promise in letting this money slip through their hands. But it must be remembered that the revenue that is lost in this way must be made up by the imposition of additional taxation on the rest of the community, and I am not prepared to vote for any further taxation on the people of Australia. The Labour party, who should be the first to support the reduction of taxation, is in favour of increasing it. However, I have made my protest. I know, that in future years what I have foretold will be clearly seen. Three or our large companies will unite, and their shareholders will benefit by the increase in dividends and the greater value of shares. It ha3 taken honorable members ten years to recognise the force of much that I said when I first came into Parliament, and what I am now foretelling will come to pas3 within the next five or six years. But as it is impossible to get the support of honorable members opposite, it is useless for me to set myself against the whole Committee. I have corrected the statements of the honorable member for Kooyong, because I will not allow members on this side of the Chamber to make wrong statements to the country. We can get quite enough of them without allowing them from Ministerial supporters, and from men who have held Ministerial rank. When wrong statements can be corrected, they should be corrected; we should not permit the making of political capital by the misrepresentation of facts. In the end it will be seen that a grave error has been committed. One or two big combines will probably go on building mills here and there, and this will afterwards be used as a reason for further continuing support to the industry. While honorable members opposite are ready to fight against landlords, they will not fight against manufacturing lords, but show the subserviency to the latter that used to be shown to the former. They bitterly attacked the landlords, striving to abolish them, though to single out any class for undue taxation is an evil thing to do. However, I am not concerned with that now. To test the feeling of the Committee, I move - </para>

                        <para>.- I do not suppose that the Minister intends to accept the amendment. I rise merely to point out that the statements of the honorable member for Werriwa are not correct. He says that over &#163;700,000 of revenue is being given up, but he should know that that is not so, and it is not to the interests of the people that a false impression should be created. All that is being given up by the repeal of thoExcise is, at best, &#163;1 a ton on the sugar produced by the employment of white labour. As regards that produced by coloured labour, &#163;4 is given up. Therefore, the amount of revenue given up can be easily discovered by noting the number of tons of sugar produced in any particular year. If last year the amount of sugar produced was 130,000 tons, then &#163;130,000 of revenue was given up. To talk of over &#163;700,000 being given up because of the abolition of the Excise is absolute nonsense. </para>

                        <para>.- The duty is 4s. per cwt. on manufactured sugar - roughly, from 6s. to 7s. 6d. per ton on all cane - a pretty big price, bigger than many of us get for our cane throughout. I was pointing out that if this Bill is carried, it makes a difference of nearly three-quarters of a million to the revenue of the country. The Leader of the Opposition reminds me that there is a Sugar Bounty Act, under the provisions of which there has been a payment from the revenue amounting to, roughly, half a million a year, leaving a difference of only about &#163;200,000 actually lost to the revenue. I have pointed out that we were able to collect three-quarters of a million a year, and that we are giving up that revenue now. I find that the State of Victoria alone will lose, roughly, &#163;230,000 a year. New South Wales will lose considerably more than that. Yet we are asked to believe that it makes no difference whatever. It makes all the difference to those States, because that revenue, so far as they are concerned, will not come in, whilst the tax will still be collected from them, not only to the extent of &#163;3 per ton, as the honorable member says, but to the full extent of the &#163;6. This Committee ought to be under no misapprehension with regard to the loss of over &#163;700,000 a year to the revenue. The </para>

                    <para class="block">States of New South Wales and Victoria especially will make large contributions towards the sugar lands of Queensland. There is no escape from the fact that over &#163;713,000 a year has been collected in revenue. That &#163;713,000 disappears in a flash. I am told that I am not to consider it, because we propose to abolish the amount of half-a-million a year which we were paying to these men who cultivate the land. But I am quite unable to see the point. The Bounty Act and. the Excise Act ought to stand entirely on different footings. If you allow men to collect &#163;6, and under the Excise Act you only collect &#163;4 from them, you are giving them an advantage of &#163;2 per ton. Take one of the years when we had a product of 226,000 tons. In that year we paid &#163;450,000. The bounty actually averaged &#163;526,000 a year during the last five years. Can it be said that there is not a payment out there ? How any honorable member can explain this matter to his constituency, and defend the subsidizing of these sugar lands to the extent of &#163;5 an acre, I do not know. I cannot defend it to mine. In my electorate men have sufficient sense to recognise that they would be glad even to earn 10s. an acre from their land, much less &#163;5. When they are told that they must contribute from their poor lands to the support of the owners of these rich lands, is it any wonder that their gorge rises, and they exclaim, &#34; Away with Parliaments altogether&#34;? The Leader of the Opposition endeavoured to make it appear that the industry does not cost Australia much. But I would remind him that the Sugar Commission reported that it cost the community more than &#163;1,000,000 per annum to keep it going. The southern division of Queensland produces about two-fifths of the sugar output of that State, and the northern division the remaining three-fifths. The central portion produces little or nothing. The reason for this is that mills were not established there in the first instance. When the honorable member for Wide Bay said that people could not use these coastal lands at all unless they received this assistance, I was reminded that the Queensland Government, in a paper issued by the Intelligence Bureau, point out that the majority of the men engaged in sugar production do not depend upon the cultivation of sugar alone, but are engaged in dairying or fruit culture. We ought to continue the Excise, because we ought to recognise that otherwise we shall be handing the industry over to half-a-dozen sugar mills. The money ought to be collected, and the difference of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> per ton which the mills would still get would be a very big thing indeed . Therefore, I think my amendment ought to be carried. </para>

                            <para>- By the operation of the bounty and Excise the Commonwealth gained, and in no other protected industry does such a condition prevail. The only reason why  superstructural  legislation was enacted was to differentiate between cane produced by white labour and cane produced by coloured labour. If the honorable member had had his way, the sugar produced in both cases would have received the same treatment. As the principle of a White Australia means that no man shall be asked to give his labour for less than is sufficient to keep a wife and family in comfort in a civilized community, we had to discriminate between white and coloured labour. That was done in the first instance by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton, later by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston,</inline> and still later by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin.</inline> First, an Excise of &#163;3 per ton was imposed in conjunction with a bounty of &#163;2 per ton, and subsequently the Excise was increased to &#163;4 per ton and the bounty to &#163;3 per ton. That legislation transformed the industry from one in which coloured labour to the extent of 90 per cent, was employed to one in which white labour to the extent of 95 per cent, is employed. By doing away with both the Excise and the bounty we shall place the industry on the same basis as any other industry, and shall give up less than &#163;1 per ton upon all the sugar that is being produced.

                        <para>. - I think it is time the Minister gave us some information as to how he proposes to collect this duty. The honorable member for Capricornia read a list containing the names of about twenty firms who are interested in this matter, in so far as they had stocks of sugar in hand when the Sugar Excise Act was repealed. It is evidently impossible for the Minister to collect Excise on that sugar. I am quite aware that clause 5 provides that whatever sugar is entered for home consumption in future will pay the Excise until  the  quantity which was in stock on the 26th July is reached. But the firms which are entering sugar for home consumption now are not those which held stocks of sugar on the 26th July. Consequently, the Minister is going to ask persons to pay duty upon sugar which they have no right to pay, whilst allowing others to escape who ought to pay. In addition, I understand that the Excise officers have been withdrawn from the mills. Unless they are to be reintroduced, how can the Minister arrive at the home consumption ? The whole Bill, in this regard, seems to bristle with difficulties. </para>

                        <para>. - In moving the second reading of the Bill I explained that the mere fact that certain persons held raw sugar in bond did not necessarily imply that they were the persons who had to pay duty upon ft. The duty is paid by the refiners when the goods are entered for home consumption. The impost falls practically upon the refiners. When this Bill becomes law, the Excise machinery will come into operation again, just as if it had never been discontinued. The refiners will then have to enter sugar for home consumption, and will have to pay the duty upon it. </para>

                            <para>- It would appear, from that list, that some twenty-five firms or individuals, instead of only three or four, are involved, and I should like to know whether they are within the control of the officers of the Excise Department ? We cannot get away from the fact that another &#163;35,000 is to be paid out by way of bounty, so that it is highly desirable that every penny of this revenue should be collected. I do not believe in doing away with the Excise, and, therefore, if there is any doubt as to how this money is to be collected, I hope that it will be cleared up. Seeing that the honorable member for Yarra, the ex-Minister of Trade and Customs, is dissatisfied about this matter, it is evident to me that some amendment is required. </para>

In some cases the mills refuse to take cane grown on certain areas, with the result that a very much higher price is obtainable for land the cane from which will be purchased by the mills than for land immediately adjoining it, and the cane from which will not be taken by them. </para>

                            <para>- It is evident, therefore, that an artificial value is given to some of these lands in this way, and that this matter ought to be discussed by almost every honorable member, instead of being rushed through at this late hour. The honorable member for Wide Bay has opened up a new field for discussion by pointing out that, owing to the fact that some of the sugar companies will only accept cane grown on land sold or leased by themselves to the farmers, they get a direct benefit from the bounty. Unquestionably the bounty has enabled the big sugar companies to dispose of large quantities of their land; but if the Government are satisfied that this money will be properly collected, T shall not further dobs te this clause. </para>

                    <para class="block">I know that I have no hope of carrying this amendment, the effect of which would be to provide that all cane sugar coming in, even after the date named in the Bill, would be subject to the Excise duty. We ought to continue the Excise charged in respect of the product of all lands to &#34;which an artificial value has been given by this bounty, and from which these companies are deriving their profits. We should also provide that no sugar company or corporation connected with a sugar company should have the Excise duty remitted. If such a provision were made, lands which had been thrown out of cultivation by the action of these companies would again be put into use. If  my  amendment were agreed to, it would be necessary for me to move a further amendment, omitting from the clause the reference to beet sugar. Are we going to favour the sugar-beet growers of Victoria or the sugar-cane growers of Queensland ? If, as has been said, we are going to settle the tropical areas of the north by encouraging the sugar industry, we must pass a law to prevent beet-sugar growers competing with the cane growers. Unless we do so, the argument about building up a Defence Force in the north by encouraging the sugar-cane industry will also disappear. If honorable members are consistent, they will assist to prevent any growth of sugar-beet by the farmers of Victoria, or the introduction of sugar from any other part. That is a further reason why the Committee should support me. Clearly, it is an argument to show how fast the Bill is being put through without due discussion. Here we are with really nobody present to discuss this important question. Where is the honorable member for Kooyong, who poses as an authority on sugar? Does he not see if he is logical in his statements that he will have to pass a law to forbid the beet-growers of Victoria from growing beet? I find that, although there were 10,000 tons of beet sugar grown here last year, it is expected that this season the quantity will be increased by at least 75 per cent. How the honorable member for Wide Bay&#39; and others are to sit down under that, I do not know, because their whole argument for a tropical industry will at once disappear. The honorable member for Herbert must view the prospect with the greatest dismay, and if next year he learns that 100,000 tons of beet-sugar have been grown in Victoria, I suppose he will come forward, if he is logical, with a proposal to put an end to the growing of beet-sugar, because it is coming into competition with the sugar grown in the tropical north, and with the settlement of the country for the purpose of defence. </para>

                            <para>- I am merely speaking to the clause, and, no doubt, by-and-by, many honorable members will be sorry that they did not take part in this discussion. In the minds of some honorable members my conduct may assume that appearance, but I feel that too little time is allowed for the consideration of this important matter. Measures involving the expenditure of hundreds of thousands of pounds are to be rushed through in single sitting. We are to get the same* hasty slipshod legislation as we got in the past. What I condemn on one side, I&#34; condemn on the other side. If our Bills - are to be rushed through without getting - proper consideration, we shall suffer just- the same fate as the Labour party suffered at the last election. The Labourparty passed Bills in such a hurry that innumerable troubles arose from them. No&#187; one could foretell the future, and eventually it brought down that party with its great majority. Our small majority will certainly vanish. I submit that we ought to have a full discussion of this matter. It is almost unfair that I should be called upon to take the major share of a discussion which should engage the attention of all. I do feel a certain amount of annoyance at the attitude of honorable members when I protest against the measure being rushed through, and point out the difficulties which must inevitably arise. The consideration of the Bill ought to be adjourned. I have entered my protest, and if I can get any honorable member to join with me, I shall be very glad to take a vote. The Committee ought not to allow a measure of this sort to slip through in this way, which must eventually be challenged when the people wake up. I believe that my anticipation will be proved up to the hilt, and probably in a few years the Labour party, who, apparently, are all in favour of an Excise duty, will have to take action in that direction. Naturally, this side cannot go against the Ministerial party. </para>

I should not like it to go forth to the country that there was not an honorable member prepared to divide with me on a question of this great importance. I submit my proposal, and it is for the Committee to express its opinion one way or the other. </para>

                    <para>.- I see that I have no hope of carrying an amendment, but I point out that the effect of this will be to divide another &#163;35,000 amongst the cane-growers in addition to the &#163;323,000 they have already received this year. Not a single man who will get this money expected, or had a right to expect, when he put in the cane on which it will be paid, that he would receive a single penny piece of it. I, therefore, think it is highly inadvisable to vote the amount in this cheap, light, and easy way. It must be remembered that it will have to be made up by other citizens of the community. The Government are supposed to be a Liberal Government, and in this connexion they are liberal, indeed - with other people&#39;s money. I contend that this is not the proper course to follow, and to give these people another &#163;35,000 will be only to grease the fatted pig. The money will have to come out of the pockets of the farmers and settlers of the country. They are the people who sent a number of us here, and we are deliberately ignoring them in putting this further tax upon them. Scores of them believe that they are already sufficiently taxed, and they will take revenge for this further taxation on some one or other. </para>

                        <para>- If they do, they make a mighty good thing out of it. What help is being given to the farmers and dairymen of the community, or to any other class but those who are engaged in growing sugar, and who have already been subsidized to an extent good enough for them during the last ten years? At the last moment, we are being asked to pitchfork another &#163;35,000 into their pockets. I record my protest against the proposal, and some of my honorable friends will, perhaps, later on agree that the protest is absolutely sound, and that this proposal should never have been brought forward. The clause will enable an additional &#163;1 a ton to be given to those who are already receiving bounty to the extent of &#163;3 per ton. At the present time the growers are getting on every ton of cane from 6s. to 7s.6d., and it is proposed to hand over to them this further bounty. Last year I grew 400 tons of cane, but only got about 2 per cent. of sugar and no bounty; whereas, if I had got 10 per cent. of sugar, I would have got the benefit of this legislation. Where is this thing to end? Is it any wonder that we have the present great burden of taxation? </para>
