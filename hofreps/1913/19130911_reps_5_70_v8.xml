                            <para>- My desire is, of course, to meet the convenience of every honorable member, as far as practicable, in this matter. It has been represented to me by those who are at present in occupation of the room on the ground floor, usually known as the Opposition room, that they wish to remain there, but I have tried to get the Whips of the two parties to come to an agreement as to the disposition of rooms. The suggestion has been made, and I think it is a very good one, that the members of the Ministerial party might occupy the room on the ground floor which has hitherto been the Opposition room, and of which they are now in possession, and that the members of  the Opposition party might retain the room on tha floor above, taking in addition the room on the ground floor that was last session used by the Independent party, and which I am informed has generally been regarded, and sometimes used as a Ministerial room, the Independent party being no longer in existence. If it is not agreeable to members of the Opposition to keep the room that they now have, with the smaller, room on the ground floor, the Ministerialists will take the upstairs room, and the smaller room on the lower floor will be allotted to the member for Eden-Monaro  on account oE his physical disability to move freely up and down so many stairs. I do not propose to disturb the present arrangement if it meets with the general approval of members. </para>

                            <para>- As I have said, it is my wish to meet the convenience of honorable members of both sides, but any conflict of opinion on this matter makes it necessary if somewhat difficult for me to come to a decision. If the members of the Opposition desire th.8 ground floor room now in possession of the members of the Ministerial party, they are at liberty to take it, but if they do so, they must give up the small ground floor room occupied for some time by what was known as the Independent party, because there is one member of the Ministerial party, at any rate, who has informed ms that he cannot, on account of severe physical affliction, go up and downstairs frequently, and accommodation must be found for him on the lower floor. I propose, in the circumstances, that if the present arrangement is not continued the small room on the ground floor shall be set aside for him. </para>

                            <para>- I wish to correct a statement that has been made in regard to these rooms. You stated, sir, that you had been informed that a certain room had always been used by members of the Ministerial party. I wish to inform you that when the first Parliament met members of the Labour party had no room at all, save one in the basement which was shown to us. We were then permitted to use the room on the ground floor, to which reference lias just been made, and we used to meet in that room. We continued to do so, at least during the life of the first Parliament, if not afterwards. There were only twenty-four of us at that time - sixteen members in this House and eight in another place - and we held all our meetings there; so that you must have been misinformed, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> as to that room having been used always by members of the Ministerial party. The Ministerial room was then, as now, upstairs. That being so, there is no precedent for members of the Ministerial party using the room in question on the ground floor. If the room were placed at our disposal, it woul'd be a very great convenience to those members of my party who are not too agile in getting up and down stairs. </para>

                                <para>-It was precisely the fact that those occupying the Opposition benches in conjunction with members of another House required more accommodation that suggested the idea that they should retain' the largest room available. That was the main guiding principle that led me not to disturb the present arrangement, because I recognised that the large room upstairs was certainly the best for large gatherings. I was desirous of meeting the convenience of honorable members. I recognised that the larger room upstairs was best adapted to meetings such as the present Opposition members were likely to have, and that the room below does not confer anything like the accommodation the room upstairs gives in this respect. </para>

                                <para>- Yes; during the Deakin and Reid Administrations, lt has been used for various purposes, but has been used as a Ministerial room. It was almost exclusively used by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne as his room for some time; but, by courtesy of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne, other members were permitted to go into it for the purpose of writing their correspondence. I am not laying this down as a statement from my own knowledge, but I have made inquiries on the subject, and, so far as I can learn, it was so. As to the other portion of the Prime Minister's question, as I have said, while it may not be my duty to provide accommodation for members of another place, still it is my desire to meet the convenience of members as far as possible. </para>

                        <para>- The question of getting an experimental internal combustion engine for use on the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta line has been under consideration for some time past. The Engineer-in-Chief for Commonwealth Railways has reported that an estimated saving in constructional cost for water conservation of over £250,000 can be effected if we can procure a satisfactory type of internal combustion engine. That saving would be apart from the saving that would result from the use of such engines instead of steam engines for the ordinary working of the line over country where there are difficulties in obtaining water for boiler purposes - difficulties due, not to scarcity of water, but to defects in the water. The question is engaging the serious attention of the Government; but if the honorable- member desires fuller information, and will give notice of detailed questions, I shall obtain for him all the information that the Department can give. </para>

                    <para>.- While I have no objection to this motion, at the same time I think we should have had an explanation from the Honorary Minister why he did not take the first reading last night when permission was granted by the House. He could also have moved last night to fix the second reading for to-day. It seems to me, however, that he did not have the Bill ready. If that is so, then the Opposition cannot be accused of having obstructed business yesterday. </para>

                    <para>.- It would be much better for the Honorary Minister to fix some day next week for the second reading of this Bill instead of proposing that the House shall proceed with its consideration to-morrow. The honorable gentleman had ample opportunity yesterday to bring the Bill up to the second-reading stage. Had he done so it would have been distributed this morning, and we could have studied it this afternoon during the consideration of private members' business. It requires to be carefully considered, and had this course been followed we should have been in a position to discuss it to-morrow. As it is the Minister has placed the whole House in a most awkward position. Important matters are set down for consideration after dinner, so that we shall have no time to look through this Bill before the meeting of the House tomorrow morning. </para>

Every day I have had to call the attention of the House to the frequency of interjections, and to appeal to honorable members to assist me in carrying out the Standing Orders.I cannot do this without the assistance of the House, and it is not right that I should be compelled continually to interrupt honorable members while addressing the Chair in order to try to get a hearing for them. I hope that it will not be necessary for me to make any further appeal, but that reasonable opportunities will be given every honorable member to make his speech with something' like coherency. </para>

                    <para>.- I am inclined to the view that the Prime Minister is correct when he says there is no precedent for the procedure now being followed. No doubt that is due to the fact that no Minister in the past was so frightfully inept as to bungle matters as the Minister in charge of this Bill has done. It is, perhaps, a matter for regret that the very first Bill which it was his honour to introduce to the House should have been so badly bungled. That, however, is a matter which concerns only himself and his colleagues. In a direct sense the Opposition have nothing to do with it. We have something, however, to do with the procedure, and the right to ask for information. Of course, the Government have the right to withhold the' information, but we are entitled to ask that the ordinary procedure be observed unless there is something to justify an irregular procedure. While the action of the Honorary Minister in moving the first reading of the Bill during question time is not out of order, having strict regard to the Standing Orders, it nevertheless is somewhat irregular. If the honorable gentleman proceeds in an irregular way, though not necessarily out of keeping with the Standing Orders, it is not fair on the part of the Prime Minister to complain if the procedure becomes irregular because of the irregular conduct of his own Minister. In the circumstances, the Prime Minister's complaint falls to the ground, in that, if the procedure is in any way irregular, it is entirely due to his Minister, possibly for Governmental reasons, adopting a particular course. However, the Prime Minister seems to have taken some credit to himself on one point. He says that the Bill was withheld from honorable members yesterday for Governmental purposes. </para>

                        <para>- I understand that; and the statement I am making leads to the question whether the Bill shall be discussed to-morrow or postponed, say, until Tuesday. I know of no honorable member on this side who desires any unnecessary delay ; but we certainly ask that we shall be treated with ordinary courtesy. If the practice to be adopted is to be irregular, a courteous intimation of the fact might be vouchsafed to us. It is regrettable that the Prime Minister and one of his colleagues should differ materially. Yesterday evening the Minister in charge of the Bill repeatedly assured the House that he was anxious to introduce the measure, and that it was only because of the discussion that he was unable to do so. Now we have it from the Prime Minister that the Bill was withheld for Governmental reasons only. Here we have a distinct' difference of opinion, which, of course, those two gentleman can settle between themselves. It is necessary, however, that attention should be called to the point, in order that we on this side may not be put in a wrong light before the constituencies. The course adopted by the Honorary Minister results in the Bill being put back at least twenty-four hours, and in placing honorable members on this side in a very unfortunate position. Had the course been pursued that the Honorary </para>

I am not presuming to complain of the method adopted by the Government for the conduct of business - it is their right to conduct the business of the House as they think best - but I have the right to draw attention to the unfortunate position in which honorable members on this side are placed because of the methods adopted. Had the ordinary procedure been followed yesterday, the first reading might then have been passed, and the Bill have been in our hands this morning. This would have enabled the Minister to make his second-reading speech tomorrow or on Tuesday, or whenever he thought fit. </para>

But the Government have no right, particularly the Prime Minister, to place honorable members on this side in a position in which they ought not to be placed, and to attempt to make political capital out of the procedure the Government themselves have adopted. While I am anxious that the Bill should be in the hands of honorable members and discussed at the earliest possible reasonable moment, I suggest, notwithstanding what may be said of my action later on, that, the delay having been caused by the method adopted by the Government, they should not proceed with the Bill to-morrow. I am anxious, because of the importance of the Bill, to be placed in a position to follow closely all that is said in relation to it, and I suggest that, as the Ministry has adopted an unfortunate course of action, honorable members be given time to look at the Bill before the second reading is proposed. </para>

The last occasion on which it was adopted was on 12th November of last year - in the last session of the last Parliament - when the honorable member for West Sydney, as Attorney-General, immediately after petitions had been presented, moved that the Bankruptcy Bill be read a first time. Immediately afterwards, and also before questions had been dealt with, the honorable member moved the first reading of the Constitution Alteration (Trade and Commerce) Bill; and a third Bill was also introduced before the business of the day was called upon. </para>

No one deplores more than I do that this discussion should have arisen, but there is every reason for our addressing the House, irrespective of what may have been ' the custom hitherto. An unusual course was adopted all day yesterday by the Minister in charge of the Bill. The first reading of the Bill could have been agreed to last night, and the measure placed in the hands of honorable members this morning. Whose fault is it that the Bill did not pass its first reading last night, so that we  might  have proceeded with the second reading to-day? Throughout yesterday we were told by the Honorary Minister that, if honorable members on this side would sit down, he would inform them as to the contents of the Bill. The honorable member sat on a piece of paper, and produced it and reproduced it repeatedly as though it were the Bill itself. All the time he was deceiving the House and the country. </para>

                        <para>- I withdraw it if the Honorary Minister thinks that I made it. I said that his action in sitting on the piece of paper and repeatedly producing it was calculated. to deceive the House by making honorable members think that it was a copy of the Bill. The tactics of the Minister are responsible for the present position. Parliament has been flouted by a juvenile Minister who does not understand his business, and who is not willing to learn from older members. He has neglected to treat the House with the respect to which it is entitled. Although he promised repeatedly to give us information as to the contents of the Bill, he did not do so.  His  conduct is calculated to dislocate the continuity of thought of honorable members. </para>

                        <para>- I would not say that. I am anxious for an opportunity to thoroughly review, analyze, and dissect this measure. It requires all the keen, penetrating thought of this party to watch what the party opposite is likely to do with a Bill of this character. We are not playing with politics; we are here to do the business of the country in a manner that will reflect credit on the House and on the people. For that reason there should be ample time given to honorable members to make good the loss occasioned by the deficiencies of the Minister. I hope that what happened yesterday will never occur again in this House. When we asked the Minister for the Bill, what did we get but taunts and abuse from one who should have, treated members with the respect that is their due. The Prime Minister has stated that never before has a motion of this kind been debated. Might I remind him that, when the honorable member for Brisbane was moving for the right to set down for a definite day a motion relating to temperance reform, he and the Honorary Minister and others discussed the question at length. Yet to-day he says that the discussion is irregular.  His  action shows to those who listened to him that when it suits his purpose he can digress from the straight and narrow path. The Bill is a very important one; at least the Minister tells us so, and any one who saw him when he was professing to have charge of it could see that he thought that it was mightily important. If the Minister would indicate to the House that he will endeavour to expedite the business committed to his care, in the public interest and for the sake of the reputation of the Government, I shall be prepared to forgive him on this occasion, hoping that what has occurred will never be repeated. </para>

                    <para>.- In addressing myself to this important question I hope that the Honorary Minister, for his own sake, will not deny that he repeatedly gave honorable members on this side to understand that if the person who at the time was addressing the Chair would sit down he would immediately make known the provisions of the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- If the Honorary Minister persists in denying what the Opposition unanimously hold to be the facts, I must accept his denial under the forms of the House. I do not in the slightest degree object to or criticise the action of the Government in withdrawing the draft Bill to amend it, because the discussion of yesterday made amendment inevitable. The information then given was of a character bound to clarify the mind of the Honorary Minister. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member has addressed a series of questions to me, pausing after each, and, although I did not wish to answer the questions by interjection, I felt that if I allowed them to pass unanswered, an entirely untrue impression would be created. I submit that the honorable member is not in order in putting a series of questions to me in a way that is likely to mislead unless I reply to them immediately. </para>

                        <para>- I have on previous occasions pointed out that I cannot dictate to any honorable member what method he shall employ in delivering his speech, but that, in using an interrogative form, disorderly interjections are invited which make it difficult for me to maintain order and enable the member himself to be properly heard. But the fact that a member is addressing the House in an interrogative way does not furnish a valid excuse for a series of interjections, which are always disorderly. </para>

                        <para>- In adopting the Socratic method for extracting information for the benefit of the House, I thought that the Honorary Minister would be able to contain himself until his opportunity to reply came. I do not wish to delay business, more particularly as the Electoral Bill is a measure of vital consequence. But, notwithstanding the offensive suggestion of the Honorary Minister, that I have received from the press information not available to other honorable members, I repeat that I have been credibly informed that the terms of the Bill were supplied to the press yesterday. As to whether the second reading should be made an Order of the Day for to-morrow, I know that yesterday the Honorary Minister declined to give any information as  to the scope of the Bill, although he conveyed the impression to every member on this side that he would be most happy, immediately the discussion closed, to afford us every information. I know, because I was here, that when the discussion closed the Honorary Minister dramatically, and obviously with great self-satisfaction, because he thought it was a <inline font-style="italic">coup,</inline> sat down after simply moving the motion in his name. In those circumstances, I think it is due to enter a protest in discussing whether the second reading should be made an Order of the Day for to-morrow, and I shall be glad if the Minister will inform us that no member of the Government conveyed to the press the contents of this Bill. If he can do so, it will be a satisfaction to us, who are interested in maintaining the privileges of the House, and in discussing this matter in an ordinary way. </para>

                    <para>.- I wish to appeal to the Prime Minister, and enter my protest against the second reading of this Bill being made an Order of the Day for to-morrow. Many members are away from the House with the approval of the House, and next week many members will be away also with the approval of the House. The circumstances of their absence are well known to every member. Therefore, I ask that this question be put down for consideration no earlier than Wednesday or Thursday next, when every member will have the opportunity of being in his place and dealing with this important measure to the best of his judgment. There is no necessity for the Government to push on with such haste as to put it down for consideration to-morrow, because tomorrow is an off day. The Ministry will lose no time if the Prime Minister will assure the House that the measure will not come on until Thursday next. If he will give that assurance, this matter can pass without further trouble. </para>

                    <para>. -  I add my plea to those already put forward. I have glanced through the Bill, by the courtesy of the  Clerk,  and I notice that it contains a number of pages, so that if we are to follow the second-reading speech intelligently it is absolutely essential that the Bill should be in the possession of members for a considerable time. Postponing the consideration of the second reading does not cause any loss of time between the introduction of the Bill and its final exit from this House. The second reading ought not to be proceeded with almost immediately, because it will be tomorrow morning before any member can be in possession of copies, and as the measure contains a number of pages, on each of which, I presume, a vital principle is affected, it seems a very fair request to make that the second reading should be fixed for some day next week. I am making my protest quite apart from any party spirit, because I consider that if the progress of the Bill is to be expedited, it is absolutely essential that members should have the chance of conning it and extracting from it some idea of what its provisions are. If they have this opportunity they can more intelligently follow the remarks made by the Honorary Minister in moving the second reading. I hope the Prime Minister will accede to this exceptionally moderate request. As remarked by the honorable member for Grey, many members are away, and it is well known that if a member hears a second-reading speech he is in a much better position to grasp the principles of a measure, and to take part in the succeeding discussion. </para>

I submit that this is Government business, and that Government business cannot be introduced to take precedence of private members' business on private members' day. Upon the introduction of this Bill the House is entitled to debate the proposition, and the discussion may go on for the whole afternoon; but whether there has been discussion or not, the Government have deliberately introduced Government business on the day set apart for private members' business. I submit that if the Government can do this, then it is in their power to deprive private members of their rights under the Standing Orders on private members' day. So I submit that this business is, at the present stage, out of order. </para>

The procedure is perfectly in order, and I have quoted a precedent of not later than November last, on which date a similar practice was followed. This motion could have been taken as formal, and there is no obligation on any member to discuss it unless he so desires. Usually such a motion is taken as formal, and without debate; but if honorable members themselves desire to occupy the time which otherwise would be devoted to private members' business, it is their own concern, and not the Speaker's, </para>

                    <para>. - There are many reasons why this Bill should not be considered in such a hurry. It is evident the Government intend to make this measure the great piece of legislation of the short session they are likely to have. I am an unsuspicious character; but knowing the deep guile of gentlemen on the Government side, and the fact that they are quite capable of taking advantage of any opportunity to put their case in a very good way before the public, I am rather suspicious that they are after something on this occasion. As Ministers have control of the House, so soon as this Bill is settled we may have to go away. So as a party we are deeply concerned as to the contents of the measure. Further, we would like to consider it deeply before we address ourselves to it in the House. It is no great stretch of imagination - and you, I am sure, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> will agree with me - to think there may be something deep in this Bill, because, so far, we have heard of nothing but dissolutions and alterations of the Electoral Act to suit one particular party. </para>

                        <para>- I am trying to show that it is the Bill of all Bills to be presented to the House in the present situation, and that it is one which should receive deep consideration. Both inside the House and outside, at pleasant Sunday afternoons, political meetings, and smoke nights, nothing but the alteration of the Electoral Act has been considered by the Ministerial side of the House.. This is an undoubted fact that can be read in every newspaper, and heard at every meeting they hold; and it is my only reason for saying that, before the Bill is considered in the Chamber, members should peruse it. Yesterday we were charged with obstructing business,, but we are not quite innocent on <inline font-style="italic">this</inline> side, and we know that the gun is loaded. We are just as capable of looking after ourselves as are members opposite. They taunt us. That is why I believe the Government have something up their sleeve, and that is why I desire to have the time to consider the Bill. It certainly cannot be sufficiently considered in time for us to go on with it to-morrow. </para>

                    <para>.- I hope Ministers will not wipe out private members' business altogether, and 1 trust they will agree to let this matter be postponed until Wednesday next. I have looked upon private members' day,, and the words " precedence until 6.30 p.m.," as a shibboleth of truth. Whether it is any malign influence or the intention of the Minister to get at me directly or indirectly, I do not know; but I appeal to my friends of the Opposition not to cause me to lose the whole of the time for dealing with the motion I have upon the notice-paper. </para>

                    <para>. - I shall say only one word. There are one or two suggestions to which some reply should be made. It has been charged that I did not act fairly with honorable members yesterday when I expressed myself as ready to give an explanation of the bread principles of the Bill if they would sit down, and did not take steps  last  night to do it. I was prepared yesterday afternoon to make that explanation, although called upon to do so at an unusual time. I was willing to do anything to expedite business, even at 10 o'clock' last night, when only an hour remained for the Government to introduce business ; but when 11 o'clock strikes, as honorable members know, no new business can be brought on. In the middle of the speech of the honorable member for Gwydir, the Opposition Whip drew the attention of the honorable member to the fact that there was no occasion to speak any more, as 11 o'clock had come. </para>

I had felt that honorable members opposite, either intentionally or unintentionally, had kept up a discussion on the motion for leave to introduce this Bill from 3 o'clock in the afternoon until a few minutes after that time when the Government . were free to introduce new business. I recognised the position, and realized, consequently, that honorable members opposite had merely been trifling with the Government when they were pleading, during the whole of those long hours, for information as to what was in the Bill. For that reason 3 when, later on, I replied to <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> debate in a few brief words, I accepted the suggestion of the honorable member for West Sydney that it was not a fair thing to enter upon a full reply at that hour of the evening. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable members of my party can speak for themselves. I suggest that this is a very unfair statement to make unless the honorable member who makes it is prepared to substantiate it, since it places in an atmosphere of suspicion a number of officers connected with our printing establishment, who do not deserve to have such a stigma cast upon them. Does the honorable member mean to charge members of the printing office, who are, I believe, above suspicion, or the confidential officers oi the Department, with having betrayed secret information? I challenge the honorable member to produce his pressman' and his <inline font-style="italic">pi-oof, or to</inline> apologize to the Government Printing Office for having made this statement in the House. </para>

                            <para>As regards the statement that has been mad? that the educational section of the examinations  for appointment to the mechanical branch is an obstacle to many capable men, and is one reason for the present shortage of permanent mechanics, I am informed by the Public Service Commissioner that such an asseveration has no foundation in fact. The educational examination is merely qualifying, is of the simplest character, and is imposed to guard against the introduction of men who are wholly illiterate, and who could not even write to the small extent required of some mechanics in their everyday work. I have here copies of the papers set at the educational section of the last examination held, and I do not think I have ever before seen more elementary tests. I can only say that the statement that has been made that " a University education " is required of candidates at these examinations is quite incorrect. I have here figures for these examinations, which should convince any one that the educational test does not produce the results claimed against it. At all examinations held for appointment as mechanic, 468 candidates from outside the Service presented themselves, and, of these, only twelve failed in the educational examination. Of these twelve, ten (10) also failed in the practical section of the examination, leaving only two who were debarred appointment by the educational examination. These two were foreigners, who could scarcely write a word of English. </para>
                            <para>Coming to the examination for junior mechanics, I find that 703 candidates have been examined, of whom thirty-three could not pass the educational tests. But of these thirty-three twenty-nine also could not pass the practical examination, which leaves only four out of 703 to whom the educational test meant failure at the examination. </para>
                            <para>It will be seen, therefore, that of 1,171 candidates who underwent examination, only six were failed by the educational tests, and, taking into consideration the easy character of the examination-papers and the leniency exercised in judging candidates' efforts, I am driven to the conclusion that these six must have been so illiterate that their rejection was an advantage to the Department. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know that the difference referred to is made, and' I shall make inquiries. Honorable members may rest assured that it is neither- the salary nor the education test that is causing trouble, but simply a shortage of suitable men for the work; there is no other reason. I am informed by the Postmaster-General that the salary offered in Western Australia is the same as that offered for imported men - there is no distinction. </para>

                    <para>The question upon which I propose to speak to-day is one that I have studied during many years. It is a question that pertains to no party, but in which every party is interested. No country can be happy and contented if its people are out of work and their potentialities unemployed. I have a vivid memory of the first public meeting that I addressed after I had been elected to Parliament. I was speaking to a body of unemployed, and I was wise, or unwise, enough to say that I did not know what hunger was, but I knew what thirst was, and if hunger was as bad as thirst I would take - let people call it what they will. Next morning I found myself famous, or infamous. The newspapers called me an Anarchist, a Nihilist, a Socialist, and I was the butt of many thoughtless people. But one kind individual wrote to the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> saying that he did not think that I had erred in very bad company, because the great Cardinal Manning had used almost the same words, saying that " necessity knows no law, and the starving man has a right to his brother's bread." Evidently my constituents held the same views as I did, because that statement was on my card at the next election, when I obtained the largest majority for a single electorate that has ever been obtained in one of that size. I maintain that more misery has been caused by want of work and unemployment than by anything else since the world began. Following the Paradise of the golden time, we read of crucifixions when the conquered were too numerous to be used as slaves, of whippings, of brandings on the face and hand, even in Merry England, of men who, unable to work on the land, were forced by hunger to beg, much unemployment being caused by what were known as the Enclosure Acts, which robbed the common people of free land to which they were entitled. Then came all the horrors of the French Revolution and the disturbances of the Chartist movement, and the miseries caused by the Vagrancy Acts. The man who is unable to obtain work soon gets down on his uppers, and loses the virile impulses of humanity. When a man has to ask for assistance, either in the shape of money to keep a roof over his family, or in the shape of food to still the cravings of his stomach, he loses a certain part of his manhood that, perhaps, can never be recovered. There is no thinking person but will agree that that land will be the happiest whose people are engaged in useful employment on works of benefit to the whole community. Those great scientists, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Lubbock, known later as Lord Avebury, and Grant Allen, have told us that there were three intelligent orders of beings on this earth - the ant, the bee, and the man. Seeing with the eyes of these men of genius, we know that never in the hive of the bee or in the nest of the ant does the young or the worker want for the necessities of life if they are obtainable. The statistics which can now be found in every library show that it is not so in human society, although men are better gifted with intelligence than insects. ' I hope that that intelligence will be devoted by honorable members here to making this beloved Australia of ours the one continent in the world in which no man or woman shall be out of work through his own fault, and in which all will be assisted to obtain work, and protected from an abasement by poverty that no human being should be subjected to. 1 do not propose to quote too freely from books, because I wish to make my remarks as concise as I can. The opinions I shall cite will be those, not of Democrats, but of some of the most conservative men whose names stand on the roll of English statesmen. There is no honorable member but will agree that there is an hiatus between our school education and practical employment. What is the question that comes to every mother and father when a boy or a girl has terminated school life? It is what to do with them for the future. There is a gap between school life and adult life. This Commonwealth should assist the States in making the education of our young complete. It should begin at the earliest age when, under the splendid German kindergarten system, the minds of children maybe moulded, and continued through the primary and secondary schools, finishing with technical education, in which the British race are woefully behindhand. Germany, in the matter of technical education, is head and shoulders above Great Britain. Any one who has seen the splendid schools of Germany must wish, a3 I did, that we could have such schools in Australia, and even better ones. The old-time apprenticeship is going into the abyss of oblivion. 'Of all the bootmakers that I knew when a boy, there are now only four at work in the city of Melbourne, though I know of more than ten who have become repairers of boots. Today, boots are turned out by the factories, one mau being employed at one stage of their manufacture, as, say, a clicker, another adding the sole, and so on, until the article is finished. The man who becomes expert in any of these processes is not a finished workman. But our technical schools should send out educated tradesmen equipped to face the battle of life. We know what has been done in Denmark, the country to which the author of the <inline font-style="italic">Go-operative Commonwealth</inline> pays the great compliment of borrowing his ideal of legislation. I, too, shall compliment this Government if it will follow the advice given in to-day's <inline font-style="italic">Age.</inline> I recognise that every one of the seventy-five members of this House is a lover of Australia, and wishes to raise the country to the highest pitch of civilization. Disraeli has stated the aphorism that " the happy progress of a nation depends on the health and strength of its individual units." I ask you to apply that aphorism. It has a practical bearing on unemployment. We all know that if a man who looks weak applies for work his services will not be accepted, the boss not taking the trouble to ascertain the causes of his pallor and weakness- and naturally choosing the strongest applicant. A book called <inline font-style="italic">The Dawn of the Health Age,</inline> by Benjamin Moore, Master of Arts and Doctor of Science - which is the highest diploma that a man can obtain in the English-speaking world - a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, and Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians, shows that the 30,000 medical men in Great Britain could be adequately paid by a contribution of Id. per man per week from the 12,000,000 male workers, and the same contribution from the employers, with an extra Id. from the Government. That would pay all the doctors, commencing at the rate of <inline font-style="italic">£150</inline> a year, and going up to £1,000 a year, or, in some cases, to a still larger amount, as an emolument to those in charge of administration. But as only one-third of the medical men of Great Britain are brought into contact with the workers, a much smaller contribution would be sufficient. It is a contribution of this kind that is at the base of the splendid measure that the British Government have introduced, namely, the National Insurance Act 1911, which will help on the nationalization of health. I say, without fear of contradiction, that the pallid faces of the British workers which I and my friends saw on our recent visit to the Old Country will get colour, not only by reason of the medical assistance that will be given, but also by reason of the constant work which will be provided by means of the unemployment fund. The nations whose youth are technically educated are amongst r,he strongest and most competent. The late Lord Playfair spoke of " trained intelligence," and there could be no better definition of technical education. He said that technical education means that those who are engaged in industry should have a trained intelligence for the special industries in which they enter as bread-winners. We all hope that the terrible evil of war will be abolished ; that the Peace Congress at the Hague will increase its beneficent power until the nations have become as wise as the individuals in civilized countries where the duel has been abolished. But there will still be the friction of competition. There will still be wars in the making of commercial products, and in them the best trained technical intelligence will win. Therefore, I say that we should fill up the gap between the school age and the adult age, so that our people may be equipped for the work of earning their living. All should have the highest trained intelligence that technical school? can give. I am sure every honorable member will agree as to that. Lord Kelvin, than whom no greater brain ever tried to solve the mysteries of electricity, said that technical training not only offered facilities for earning a livelihood, but offered knowledge which made life worth living. We all know that a healthy man, a highly trained mechanic, will go whistling to his work - may be, even humming. We know that, with health pulsing his heart, and with hands that know how to carry out the ideas of his brain, he is better equipped to face the difficulties of the world than the man who has not been trained, or who is troubled with ill-health. To show how this is carried out in Prussia, the largest State in Germany, and whose King is the Emperor of that mighty nation, I may point out that in that State there are eleven mining schools; at Crefeld, a dyeing school; at Hanover, thirteen weaving schools, and eight weavers' apprentice shops. Also, in Westphalia, there are technical schools for the metal industry. In the North Sea and Baltic ports there are fourteen navigation schools. The trade unions of Germany maintain 294 trade schools for painters, decorators, locksmiths, blacksmiths, joiners, &amp;c. I do not mean that the district continuation and industrial schools should be confined to the leading industry of the district, but they should certainly have  Lt  as their predominant feature. For instance, where wheat is greatly grown, and we have our farming schools and agricultural colleges, a young boy who would like to follow a farming life can attend and get a technical training. Country members, and members like myself who are residents of the city, must agree that the greatest asset any country can have is an intelligently-trained scientific farmer ; occupying not a big area, but well-cultivated blocks where the highest intelligence, readily obtainable from public Departments, can be applied to the raising of food. To my mind, that is worth all the minerals, save coal and iron, that have ever been garnered out of the earth. I consider that primary subjects common to all industries, which are necessary as a groundwork, should be taught in every district school, such, for instance, as drawing, mathematics, geography, more particularly technical drawings to suit a useful purpose, and such necessary subjects as industrial bookkeeping and knowledge of business affairs. These are subjects that are now taught, I understand, in our agricultural colleges. I do not wish drawing to be devoted to the fine profile of a handsome face or figure, or to a landscape. I want the drawing a man can show another workman to teach him what to do. A friend of mine, whose name I am not permitted to mention, but to whom I owe a great meed of gratitude for assistance in many points, has said that if there be one universal language in the world, it is sketching. You can show a German or a Frenchman by a few lines how a house is to be built. Some one has said that the harmonious sound of music is the universal language, but I lean to the other view. I do not know any person gifted with eyesight, and with brains to think, to whom a pencil and a piece of paper cannot explain a great deal. Certainly, the apprenticeship question should be thoroughly threshed out. I should like to see the employer taking his apprentices from the technical schools, so that there would be continuity of employment, thus assisting to remove the evil of unemployment. Housing, adulteration of food, and environment also enter into this question. I cannot give a better example of environment than what we saw at </para>
                    <para>Port Sunlight, which we visited iu the Coronation year. There we saw the only complete big body of healthy men and women working that we saw in England, Ireland, Scotland, or Wales. There was no body of workers there compared with the men at the Newport Factory; I never saw their equal ; but at Port Sunlight, not on charitable lines, but on business lines, the proprietor, in order to get healthy workmen, built this place. One instance alone must appeal to every one. The death rate in these little cottages and homes was but half of what it was in the suburb of Birkenhead, a few hundred yards away. Of those whom the reaper Death gathered, only half fell by the way under healthy surroundings, and in the absence of slums, compared with the numbers that were gathered by him in the town alongside, called Birkenhead. </para>

                            <para>- Those born in the slums become mere waifs on the sea of adversity. They enter blind alley occupations, struggle on, eke out an existence of the most menial description, and when they attain middle age become what are called casual workers, and old age, if they survive as long, finds them beggars. In the forties the height for entrance to the British Army was 5 ft. 6 in. In the following decade it was reduced to 5 ft. 5 in. In another decade it came down to 5 ft. 4 in. It was reduced in about the eighties to 5 ft. 3 in., and in the nineties, I think, to 5 ft. 2 in., while in the stress of the Boer War 5 feet only was a permitted height; but during that time 75 per cent, of the men who offered themselves were refused because they were physically unfit. The slums, their surroundings, the want of proper food in their early days were the causes of this deterioration, because the British race, especially the Scotch and Irish, fundamentally are a healthy, strong, virile race, although the big cities, acting like cancers with their improper conditions of housing, are destroying that reputation. The greatest compliment ever paid to Australia was by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Rudolf</inline> Broda, Professor of Economics in Paris, who visited Australia to see our social conditions.' I take the privilege of making a long quotation from his remarks. He paid a high tribute to Australian character, and the efforts being made in this country to elevate mankind. He declared that we were gradually, but surely, evolving the noblest sentiments of humanity, and he observed that there was a tremendous difference between Australia and America, where, amidst splendid national wealth, are to be found starving girls in sweating shops. The learned professor was particularly impressed with the system of Wages Boards in Australia. He said - </para>

                        <para>Their establishment was the victory of a great principle. The principles of humanity and equanimity have been introduced into industrial life, where formerly we had brute force. You have also adopted the principle of protecting those who, through sex or age, or other reasons, are unable to protect themselves. This great principle, you may say, is the principle of Christianity. I would call it the principle of humanity. I am quite overwhelmed with the working conditions which I have seen in your factories. I have a certain acquaintance with the clothing trade as a result of my journeys round the world. I know that in Vienna young women and girls work eleven hours a  day  for Ss. a week of your money. That is not the exception, but the rule, for girls of sixteen and eighteen. Tuberculosis and other diseases run through their ranks, and the degeneration of the race follows. In New York, not in factories, it is true, but in the sweating systems known as home industries, 1 found a worse condition of affairs. In the great progressive country of America, in the slums in the east end of New York, women are working fourteen to sixteen hours a day for half-a-dollar, and the same degeneration follows. </para>

If I compare that with my experiences in Europe and America, I congratulate you heartily on what you have done. You have accomplished a splendid thing in the present workers and in the future of the race, for the well-being of the children depends upon the well-being of the mothers, and these girls will be mothers of the future generations of Australians. </para>

                    <para class="block">That is a splendid tribute, and would be far more applicable to-day, because our factories are even better now than they  were then, and our Wages Boards extend sometimes beyond the city, whereas when I had the pleasure of meeting him they were too frequently confined to it. In asking honorable members to take the necessary procedure to remove the evil of unemployment, I wish to place before them two typical causes of unemployment - one is that which is beyond the control of nations, the other is well within the control of each individual. I allude, first of all, to the calamity that too frequently in Australia overtakes us - the terrible thing called drought. Prior to the last drought Australia had 104,000,000 sheep, and in 1903 they were reduced to 56,000,000. Thus, nearly 50,000,000 sheep were lost in the primary industry of growing sheep and wool. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> - and I believe his statement - that drought cost Australia £130,000,000. It proved once and for all how dependent are the secondary industries upon the primary industries of Australia. It emphasized Gibbons' maxim that agriculture is the foundation of the manufacturers. I have heard it said that the history of the world is only the history of cities and the history of Protection whereby those cities have . been built up. While I agree in a general sense with that statement, 1 do not fully indorse it. After all, the townsman cannot live without his brother of the country. I have always felt great sympathy for the man in the country who grows our food ever since I, as a poor little bank clerk, was seized with a mania to go on the land, and was sent by the beautiful Government of the day to the heavily-timbered country of Gippsland, where, on one acre of my land, I counted twenty-six trees all over 6 feet in diameter. </para>

                            <para>- No; by the use of the axe I developed my chest. That venture, however, robbed me, not only of my five years' savings as a bank clerk, but of what my poor old mother had added. I picture to-day land laws which would throw open the lands of Australia to our own people. We might well follow the magnificent example of Denmark, whose splendid system of fostering and encouraging the man on the land is shown in the life of Captain Enrico  Miglius  Dal.ger8. When little Denmark was fighting against Austria and Prussia, a war which lost to her two provinces, Jutland was almost a barren waste, covered with heath. But this soldier, at the end of the war, exchanged the spade for the sword and set out to teach the Danes how to cultivate Jutland, and so make up for the lost provinces. Jutland was a forest iri the stone age, as shown by remnants of mounds that have been found, and in the 18th century 1,000 German colonists were brought over to try to cultivate the heath land there. That enterprise failed. It was then found that red spruce could be raised to a height of 3 feet or 4 feet, but that it would thereafter die away. In 1800, the Government laid out three plantations, and in 1866, 100 large landowners formed a Danish Heath Society, and never asked for a dividend in return for the capital they expended. They took up the work that had been started by  Dalgers,  and discovered a means by which spruce could be grown to advantage, with the result that the area of the forest land in Jutland has been increased from 157,000 acres in 1860 to 476,000 in 1907. A little over a century and a quarter ago, 100 human beings owned the whole of Denmark. To-day that country has almost reached the acme of perfection so far as justice and the welfare of its people are concerned. It actually takes from Great Britain in return for the produce that it sells there more gold than all Australia raises from its many mines. Of the five continents, Australia is the most arid. Its catchment areas must therefore be utilized to the fullest extent by converting them into reservoirs to hold the winter rains, which can then be used for irrigation purposes. The Inter-State Commission should be able to do good work in this respect, and it should see that this right is apportioned equally amongst the various States. We must lock the rivers and build more reservoirs. We must have catchment areas sufficient to supply additional reservoirs; and if by means of bores we should discover, as I hope we shall, unlimited supplies of water, the whole character of vast stretches of country would be altered. Geologists entertain the idea that the great layer of rock forming a huge basin under the widest portion of Australia comes hundreds of miles under the ocean from the Himalayas. </para>

Those who examine the rainfall records of this continent as carefully as I do must know how little falls over a vast portion of Australia. We must do our best to build up our farmers, and to establish throughout the country as many Milduras as we can. In the struggle for existence some fall by the way, and some through causes within their own control. Alcohol, for instance, has many a time destroyed a n.au, and brought poverty and suffering to his family. I wish to pay my meed of praise to the Lara Institute for the treatment of inebriates, which has been more successful, having regard to the number which it has treated, than any institution of which I know. A man who is fined repeatedly should not be left amid his old surroundings, but should be sent to a public institution of this kind. Then, when all the liquor has been removed from his system, and he can stand in the presence of his Maker a clean and healthy man, the head of his department could say to him, <inline font-weight="bold">"Mr. Jones,</inline> you have had your chance. We have done all that we can for you. You are now a healthy man. Take this as a warning and do not break away again, for, if you do, trouble must ensue." The Lara Institute can point to even 60 per cent, of cures, and offers a splendid means of treating the victims of alcohol. Drunkenness is one of the causes of unemployment of which men may rid themselves. I come now to the question of strikes. I hate war as I hate hell, and my hatred of strikes is second only to my loathing of war, since behind every striker, as behind every soldier, I see the woman and the child who suffer. Strikes entail suffering on innocent people who have had nothing to do with them. At the same time I must admit, as Frost shows, that strikes have been productive of far more good than harm. There is one way of settling  strikes which may not appeal to honorable members, but is certainly worthy of consideration if we are going to make Australia firm and strong. Some time ago there was a lock-out in connexion with the collieries in Westphalia and Silesia. Some little disturbance occurred, and the masters, who had locked out their men, refused to meet in conference delegates appointed by the employes. The men asked that their hours of labour should be reduced to ten per day, and that they should be granted a slight increase of pay in their wages. William of Germany at last intervened, and issued a. proclamation in which he said, in effect, to the workers, " If you keep peace I will see that you get justice; but if you create riots I shall have you shot down likedogs." Then he said to the mineowners, " If you do not appoint representatives to meet the delegates of the workers; within twenty-four hours I shall appoint them for you, and you will have to abide by the result." Delegates were appointed. The request of the men was granted, and the whole trouble was over in forty-eight hours. I wish to see our Conciliation and Arbitration Court made so strong and powerful that it will be able to say to the one party, " Thou shalt not strike," and to the others, " Thou shalt not lock out until we have seen how justice can be done." </para>

Time was when there was no justice, but we now have a fair amount of it in our Courts of Law. The Inter-State Commission should be able to do much good in the matter of water conservation. We all recognise, that  President  Roosevelt was right when he told an Australian native that we should fill up our empty spaces. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr..</inline> Elmslie,  the Acting Leader of the Opposition in the Victorian Legislative Assembly, assures me that although a large sum of money has been spent in advertising Australia in the United States, only five Americans have come here as settlers. Let us make it easier for our people to get on the land, and when, instead of hundreds of applicants for one block of land, we have hundreds of blocks offering for every one applicant, let us welcome with open arms every one of the white races. In addition to improved water conservation facilities, I hope to see the time when every farmer will be within reach of a Government tank and a Government silo, so that in time of drought stock will not suffer. We all remember the splendid lines of the Australian poet, in which he pictures the unfortunate cattle lowing for want of water, and dying for what man had not provided for them. The workers may be broadly divided into two classes - the regulars and the casuals. When a man gets into the forties he finds it harder to obtain employment than it was in his early days, and if he falls sick by the wayside his master cannot always keep his position open for him. If he belongs to a trade union, in many cases he is able to draw from an out-of-work fund. But whilst the unions do a lot of good in that way, they cannot long withstand such a drain upon their resources. A casual may be generally defined as an unskilled worker, having little hope of obtaining a fixity of tenure, and who is harassed by the uncertainty of the future, and the difficulty of finding his next job. Despite all that the State Parliaments have done in the great public services, such as the railways, the call is for more organization and more regular and fewer relatively casual workers in the ranks of industry. When men and women are " temporarily " employed by a Government for ten or twenty years, it surely is a sign of management that is not too good, for if they are worthy of being employed year after year, I see no logical reason why they should not be given permanent positions. I cannot do better at this point than quote from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cyril</inline> Jackson's book, <inline font-style="italic">Unemployment and Trade Unions: -</inline></para>

                        whose words ought to be written in diamonds, said that unionism was not " a conspiracy against freedom, but a healthy combination, and one of the greatest hopes of the workers." I recognise the great good that trade unions have done for Australia, and I only wish that the casual workers, who are not trained workers, could be formed into some association which would benefit them as unionism has benefited the expert worker. I should like to see all the trade societies throughout Australia take up the question of unemployment. I am certain that the evidence - practical, every-day evidence - which they could collect would be of incalculable benefit to the cause. I should here like to say a word of praise of our splendid Statist,
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs,</inline>
                        and his able staff. A scholarly American, much versed in statistics, assured me that he considered that the Commonwealth Department, with the limited amount of money supplied for its maintenance, would hold its own with any to be found in the world. I should now like to quote a few figures just to show that wealth sometimes bears an appearance which acquaintance with the real conditions removes. I am informed that during the past five years the highest note circulation in Victoria during the quarter ended 31st December was that in 1910, namely, £934,291. On the same basis, the note issue on the 30th June, 1913, would be £1,008,958. Notes held in the banks are not counted; and for the March quarter, 1913, the average amount of Australian notes in the hands of the public was £4,047,446, representing £1,181,826 for Victoria, if the Commonwealth average be assumed to apply to this State. If, however, we add to this the number of notes actually out of the Commonwealth Treasury, the figure is £2,717,000, as against £934,291 in 1910. In the matter of our old-age pensions, invalid pensions, and maternity allowance, I trust that our policy Will tend to remove any stigma of poverty or pauperism. These three activities of the Government must be brought under more scientific control; and there is the germ of a great idea in national insurance. In this connexion, I cannot do better than quote Viscount Milner, who wrote a preface for
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cyril</inline>
                        Jackson's book, from which I have already quoted. Viscount Milner says -

                        <para>The State is now definitely committed to an active policy with regard to unemployment. One important step has already been taken in the establishment of Labour Exchanges supported by public funds. Another step, even more important and more difficult, is likely to follow soon, viz., a State-aided system of insurance seeking to provide for the workman during spells of unemployment, and to prevent such periods from causing a permanent deterioration in his condition or in that of his family. A system of insurance would mitigate the evils of unemployment, but it would not prevent their recurrence. There are other remedies striking more directly at the root of the evil, such as the better distribution and organization of work, and an improvement in our methods of industrial training, and of our educational system generally. </para>

                    <para class="block">Those words have my full approval, and, I hope, the approval of every member of this House. It is true that in the Middle Ages the guilds sought to guarantee work for all their members, and some trades unions do so even in our own day. It is to the friendly societies, however, that the greatest credit is duo for aid of this kind, though we know that thos© friendly societies are composed of the thrifty, the skilled, and the saving. It is when we have to deal with others who are not so well blessed with this world's goods, that it becomes our duty as politicians to afford help. I see that my time has about expired, and I must draw to a conclusion. I should like to see instituted some place under an attractive name, say " The Farm of Hope," where men out of work could go and earn, not a wage calculated to interfere with private enterprise, or large enough to cause them to wish to remain, but sufficient to tide them over a difficulty, and enable them to lead a pure and healthy life, with good food and shelter, and, perhaps, to give them a taste for country pursuit*. So, too, with the womenfolk. But I desire that the conditions of such a Home should not be in any way degraded.. Notwithstanding the good intentions of the State Governments, the labour farms have not been carried on' altogether as they should be. Whether these Homes of Hope are established in the Federal Capital Territory, or in the Northern Territory, or by the States, I do not want to see the dignity of those who go to them abased. Nor do I desire that trades and callings shall be taught there. My idea is that the men and women who go to these Homes of Hope shall be taught how to live on the land. A husband and wife with their family may be sent to one of these homes at a time when unemployment is rife, and set up in a little house on the farm. The woman would have chickens to tend, and the man vegetables to grow. I can picture such a woman, without the fear of the landlord's knock on Monday morning, without the dread of the butcher's, the baker's, the bootmaker's bill, saying to her husband,  ' John, this life is better than the town life; let us stay longer, and try to get a little block of land of our own on which to bring up our children in a healthier atmosphere than that of the town." I thank honorable members for the hearing which they have given me, and hope that every one of them 'will make himself a proselytizing force. I have seen the Salvation Army preaching to one man, but look at the power of the organization ! History tells us that Mahomet made only one convert in three years. Let us all this night go out with the full determination to do our level best, without respect to party differences, to remove this curse of unemployment. I had  the  idea, before I commenced reading, that Germany was pre-eminent among the countries of the world for the assistance which she gave to the unemployed. But that great measure which has just been passed y the Mother of Parliaments makes Great Britain pre-eminent. My hope is that our Australia, leading the van in social and other progress, will make this continent one in which poverty some day - please God, may the day be soon - will cease to exist. </para>

                        <para>. - I compliment the honorable member for Melbourne on the spirit ' with which he always deals with humanitarian questions. I give him the assurance that the matter to which he has called attention is being considered by the Government; and I join with him in hoping that we may compass reforms affecting society so intimately and deeply, without being diverted by the consideration of mere party ends. I have just been settling a list of questions for submission to the friendly societies of Australia, whose co-operation I, as the Minister in charge of the social insurance project, solicit. This list of questions will, I trust, be handed to the press this afternoon, so that all in Australia who desire to further this great reform may help us to find the best method for doing what is needed. I have also a tentative outline of a scheme of social insurance which will cover many of the matters on which the honorable member has touched, among them unemployment. We all recognise that we cannot allow society to drift by adhering too strictly to what may be termed the tenets of the old economic school. It was laid down by Bentham that justice was the end of government. We may all admit that, but the difficulty is how to apply it. Following him came Herbert Spencer, <inline font-style="italic">par excellence the</inline> individualist writer of the last fifty or sixty years. He considered pure individualism the salvation of society, and thought that the test to be applied to all legislation was': Did it allow each man freedom of action so long as he allowed equal freedom of action to others? That test he would have applied to almost every legislative measure. But its application would put outside the sphere of legislation factory laws - for which I admit that trade unionism has done so much - education, sanitation, and many other measures regulating human activity, which have greatly improved the condition of the masses. It almost shocks us now to think that when the Ten Hours Bill was introduced in 1858, even a man of so kindly a temperament, so clear a head, and such intense humanity as John Bright - from a too strict and pedantic adherence to the old Radicalism, which I very much respect, because I trust that I am somewhat of a Radical in the best sense of the term - should have been led to doubt, as I think Macaulay did, too, the efficacy of the measure. It is the desire of this Government that, so far as  unemployment is capable of being mitigated, if not altogether removed, by legislation, no abstract principle of individualism, Liberalism, or Conservatism shall interfere with the placing of a measure on the statute-book which will lead to that <inline font-style="italic">end.</inline> Unemployment has been found to be one of the most difficult subjects with which to deal in connexion with social insurance. I have read the reports of some of the commissions on the question which have sat in America, and a synopsis of some published by a professor of one of the American universities, who points out that even in January, the busiest month in New York, from 10 to 15 per cent, of the operatives cannot get employment; and at the time of the dockers' strike in England it was found that about three-fourths of the men were casuals, their employment being fitful and ill-paid. A similar state of affairs exists even in connexion with somewhat highly-skilled industries. If we can frame legislation that will mitigate the evils of unemployment which affect so largely the unskilled workers who live closest to the margin of a decent standard of living, we should not hesitate to introduce it. I ask the honorable member not to insist upon that part of his motion affirming -the desirability of appointing a Royal Commission. As the Government is endeavouring to do  everything  that is reasonable, seeking the co-operation of both sides of the House, with thf employment of its departmental officers, and the assistance of such men as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs,</inline> in whose hands I have placed the actual technical business connected with insurance, the subject is likely to be dealt with more effectively and expeditiously than by a general inquiry by a Royal Commission. Besides, the Inter-State Commission Act provides, if we wish to delegate these matters, that the question of labour, employment and unemployment may be investigated by the Commission. With the spirit of the motion expressed in the first paragraph, we are all more or less in agreement. The honorable member mentioned other matters directly concerned with Australian prosperity and development, among them irrigation. I hope that something will be done in that regard with the co-operation of the Commonwealth. A board of engineers, appointed in the middle of 1911, recently presented a very valuable report to the Premiers of the States on the possibilities of storage for purposes of navigation and irrigation. They say that, taking the money already spent on works such as the Burrenjuck  reservoir in New South Wales - estimated to cost £1,000,000 or £1,500,000, according to the height of the dam - on the Goulburn and on the Murray in Victoria, the largest being the Waranga Basin ; and on the South Australian works, something like £6,333,000 would be needed to do all that they suggest for the impounding and distribution of water to settlers for the irrigation of 1,400,000 acres. Some years ago ridiculous notions were entertained as to the possibilities of irrigation from our rivers, which I never shared. I expressed my doubts on the subject in a pamphlet which I wrote in 1891, and on several other occasions. The engineers to whom I have referred say that between £6,000,000 and £6,500,000 will be needed to finish the works already in progress, and to complete other works, including a great storage reservoir on the Upper Murray at  Cumberoona,  or at some other place where the foundation would be absolutely reliable. The Federal Government will do all that it can to enable that outlay to be effective. When that is done, the rivers will be destroyed for the purpose of navigation. It is absolutely clear that when you have stored the water, or provided for the control of rivers for storage to the extent necessary to irrigate 1,400,000 acres, navigation will be brought to such a limit that it will be too intermittent and fitful to continue boats on the rivers. That fact is amply demonstrated by the reports of the different States. It is, then, for us to say to what extent we shall help the States to restore navigation, in fact, to maintain and improve the navigation which would be destroyed by carrying out these storage works. </para>

                            <para>- We cannot deal with irrigation ; that is a matter for the States, and a matter, perhaps, that should be left to the States. The Inter-State Commission can only report what is going on. I helped to draft the measure, and the part dealing with rivers was drafted by my own pen. My proposal was to ask the Inter-State Commission to watch what was being done by the States, and report from time to time to Parliament. The jurisdiction of the Commonwealth is confined to navigation, to preserving the river waters as instruments of Inter-State commerce. </para>

After the storage has been constructed, if the storage renders the rivers unnavigable and the expenditure of £2,500,000 or £3,000,000 will make them perfectly navigable for, say, 2,000 miles, the Commonwealth would not hesitate to say to the States, " Having regard to your policy of storage, if you declare finally that you are prepared to settle the whole question by a scheme of locking, as well as storage, we are prepared, as guardians of navigation, to subsidize your expenditure on that work." </para>

                            <para>- I think so. South Australia last week passed a Bill which would involve the expenditure of up to £1,000,000 in making the Murray permanently navigable from the mouth to the junction with the Darling. They propose to put down six locks in South Australia - two, or probably three, from Lake Victoria to about 50 miles up the river from the border of South Australia; and the others between there and the Darling. This will raise the level of the river. According to the report of Captain Johnson, the locking of the Murray between South Australia and the Darling will lift the height of the river about 9 feet, which will be sufficient to give a navigable depth of about 6£ feet as far as the Darling. </para>

The original estimate showed a lift of 12 feet to 16 feet at some of the locks; but Captain Johnson's report is to the effect that a lower lift is better. He claims that three locks with lifts of 9 feet are better than two locks with lifts of 12 feet. I cannot say the. actual lift of a lock at the present moment. </para>

                            <para>-A s the honorable member for Maranoa has suggested, the lower the river the less the pressure on the structure, and the less the danger is. Of course, a weir will not always be up. When the river level is low, the weirs can be altered to allow the water to go over as usual. If the scheme suggested by the engineers is carried out, there will be nine or ten months of the year when there will not be navigation at all. If, however, the States determine amongst themselves to carry out a scheme of storage, and irrigate economically from the rivers, and if that destroys the latter from the point of view of navigation ; and if they go beyond that phase, and attack the whole question of incidentally locking the rivers to maintain and improve the navigation of them, I think the Commonwealth would be justified in some co-operation to bring that about. I merely wish the honorable member to understand I express sympathy with his motion, and I hope he will accept my suggestion that the second paragraph be omitted, knowing that everything reasonable will be done to mitigate the evils of unemployment. The other portion of his motion is a declaration of principle, that may or may not be pressed. </para>

                        <para>That, in the opinion of this House, a Public; Works Committee of members of this House should be appointed, to whom all proposals of expenditure exceeding£10,000 should be submitted for inquiry and report, such Committee to be appointed during the present session. </para>

                    <para>This is one of the most important motions the House can deal with. I have moved it in two previous sessions, but owing to time failing I have been unable to get it decided. It took me some little time to persuade the then Minister of Home Affairs that there was nothing antagonistic in it towards his Department; but I think I satisfied him upon that point. Nor is there anything in the present proposal antagonistic to the Department. I think it has been evident to many honorable members that the public works of the Commonwealth have increased to an enormous extent since the expiration of the Braddon section. The Home Affairs Office a few years ago was a small concern. Now it is the most important Department in the Commonwealth. It is the great spending Department, other than the Defence Department, and it is not fair to honorable members, or to the country, that huge works should be proposed and! brought down to the House, and members be asked to vote " Yes " or " No "  on them, and yet know practically very little about them. In the .larger States it has been found necessary to appoint Standing Public Works Committees, to whom such works are referred, and how much more necessary is it in the case of the Commonwealth ? A very important work may be proposed for Queensland or the Northern Territory, but what do members in the south know about it? Works may be proposed for Western Australia, and Queensland members will be in the same position. We are thrown wholly and solely on the departmental reports, and the experience of all the States of Australia and of the Commonwealth goes to show there is a very wide difference between the estimates of responsible officers. My proposal is to adopt the same system as that adopted in some of the States, notably in New South Wales, where a Standing Parliamentary Committee has been appointed, to which all public works costing more than £20,000 are referred. By the courtesy of the Secretary of that Committee I have obtained the reports, guide, and manuals of the Committee, the reports covering the last three or four years, and I shall be glad to allow any honorable member to peruse them. It is not necessary to quote them. However, it would be an enormous saving to the Commonwealth to have such a committee appointed by Parliament, to  which  all works should be referred. In my motion I suggest that the amount should be £10,000, although in New South Wales it is £20,000, but I do not tie myself to the £10,000. We must remember that we have before us a Commonwealth expenditure of from £25,000,000 to £30,000,000 on public works, and I think it must be patent to every one that we need some different system from that we have had in the past. In the Federal Capital we have a proposed expenditure of four or five millions, and, judging by the present proceedings, the expenditure in the near future will be very large. Again, we have propositions for the construction of a railway through the heart of Australia from Pine Creek to Oodnadatta, and for the building of the overland line from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie. In these three directions alone we can see ahead of us an expenditure of from £20,000,000 to £25,000,000, and on other works which I believe the House is prepared to accept we have a further expenditure of from £25,000,000 to £30,000,000 staring us in the face. Members are asked to vote these huge sums of money with practically no information. All the information that is supplied comes from departmental officers, and experience has shown us that the estimates of these officers vary so enormously that it is not fair to us or to the country to expect us to pass these large sums without further information. </para>

We have had an example of what may happen in the Defence Department in connexion with the purchase of the Fitzroy Dock at Cockatoo Island. Some honorable members declare that it is the best bargain ever made by the Commonwealth, while others declare that New South Wales made a magnificent bargain in selling to us. This purchase was made without any opportunity being afforded the House to express an opinion upon it. The Estimates, covering the expenditure, will be submitted in due 'course, and no matter how bad the bargain might prove to be, I do not think any honorable member would be prepared to repudiate the act of the Government.

                            <para>- Whether a purchase be made from a Government or a private individual, nothing remains to us but to foot the bill, no matter how bad the bargain may be. Surely that is not a proper position for this House to occupy. Before any such works are purchased, the House should be able to obtain reliable information as to their character, and the amount that ought to be paid for them. Our public works have increased so enormously that I think in the interests of the country and the Parliament, as well as in the interests of Ministers themselves, it would be well to appoint such a Committee as I propose, in order that information necessary for the guidance of this Parliament may be obtained. At present departmental officers are the only source of information which Ministers have. Their opinions may be exceedingly valuable, but experience has shown that they are not infallible. Let us, look at the way in which votes for public works have been passed from year to year in this Parliament. As a rule, the Estimates are kept back until the last week of the session, Ministers intimate their intention of forcing them through within a certain time, we have an all-night sitting, and expenditure amounting to millions of pounds is agreed to very often when only five or six honorable members are awake in the chamber. A company that attempted to carry on business in such a way would soon have bankruptcy, if not fraudulent bankruptcy, staring it in the face. </para>

                            <para>- There are some points in respect of which we might make a departure from the New South Wales system. My own idea is that the Committee should consist of seven members, five members of the House of Representatives and two senators, and that the representation of both parties should be as evenly divided as possible. With such a Committee, the practice of agreeing to works involving an expenditure of millions of money, with practically no information before us, and after very little consideration would no longer be continued. Then, again, the Government of the day, knowing that the Committee would take evidence with open doors, would not dare to bring down any proposal which it thought would not bear the light of day. I am sure that our experience would be that of the States which have adopted this system. I am informed by some who have followed the proceedings of the Public Works Committees of New South Wales and Victoria that, as the result of their inquiries, enormous sums have been saved to those States. </para>

                            <para>- No. I think there is too great a tendency to hand over the privileges and responsibilities of this Parliament to Boards and Commissions. If the Parliament is not competent to appoint a Committee of its own members to deal with the public works of the Commonwealth, it had better make way for experts, and hand over to them the charge of the public affairs of Australia. No matter what experts were appointed, such a Board would be open to exactly the same criticism that is levelled now at departmental reports. My experience both in this Parliament and in the Legislature of Tasmania has not been such as to make me an absolute believer in departmental reports. I think it would be well to have a Public Works Committee, before whom the departmental officers could appear, and which, if necessary, could take evidence from outside to determine whether or not the views expressed by the departmental experts were quite correct. Departmental officers are no more infallible than are others. </para>

                            <para>- That is a matter to be determined when framing the Bill, but it seems to me that if this work is to be done well, the members of the Committee should receive some recompense for their loss of time and the labour which their duties would involve. Unless the Committee is to do its work well and thoroughly, it would be better not to appoint it. The Bill creating it and bestowing upon it the necessary powers could determine the remuneration or expenses to be allowed. Under the New South Wales Act, the remuneration allowed to the members of the Committee cannot exceed £2,000 per annum. </para>

                            <para>- My vote would go to make the proposal apply to all works; and the Defence Department is the one on which the least information has been obtainable, so far as expenditure is concerned. Whether or not that is due to the fact that, of recent years, the Minister of Defence has occupied a seat in another place, I do not know, but we have had less information regarding the Defence Estimates than any other. The Defence Department has grown to be the largest spending Department in the Commonwealth. Under Admiral Henderson's scheme, the expenditure to which we are pledged amounts, roughly, to £100,000,000 for naval defence alone; and, of course, the House should be supplied with the fullest and most complete information. I am not in favour of the New South Wales principle of exempting defence work from such supervision, and every motion in this House, whether for a new work or the continuation of a work, should be referred to the Committee. </para>

                            <para>- So far as some of the naval bases are concerned, it would have been a good job if they had been referred to a Committee. In this matter, we have the choice between a waste of time and a waste of money; and, up to the present, we have had both. We have confronting us the enormous expenditure I have mentioned; and, in addition, there are works in the Federal Territory to which we shall be asked to consent almost immediately. Practically, this House has no knowledge, and no means of obtaining knowledge, of the works proposed. There is no reason why this Committee should prove very expensive; and, in any case, a muddle in one of the large public works would cost more than the maintenance of the Committee for twenty-five years. This Committee, I believe, could obtain information of the very highest value to the House in enabling honorable members to form proper conclusions ; and I ask serious consideration for my proposal as of great advantage to Parliament, to Australia, and to the Government. I ask honorable members not to debate the matter at such length as to render a decision impossible, but to carry the motion, and thus enable a Bill, creating the Committee, to be passed during the present session. </para>

                        <para>. - I hope the honorable member for Franklin will not press this motion to a division. I do this the more because I have felt for a long while that some different method of dealing with our public works would, perforce, have to be adopted. The whole matter is in a more or less chaotic state to-day. Huge sums are being, and have been spent for years past, without proper inquiries, and without that information to which the House is entitled No big public work ought to be undertaken until this House has passed judgment upon it. That is one of the prime functions of a legislative assembly anywhere and always; indeed, this proposition goes to the very root and basis of our system of responsible government and parliamentary control. I have the greatest possible sympathy with the principle underlying the motion. I have urged more than once that this House ought to be placed in possession of the plans and specifications of any large work undertaken by the Government. In our present condition of affairs, it is impossible for that to be done, and there is something more needed than this proposal for a Public Works Committee. </para>

However, that is a matter which can wait. The great outstanding requirement of the moment, it seems to me, is a re-shaping a re-aligning, and re-allotting of the duties now carried out by the various Departments. I am making no complaint whatever as to administration by previous Ministries; the present state of affairs is not due to the action of Ministers anywhere, or at any time. </para>

                            <para>- That is the point. The Departments began in the simplest and most elementary way, but, like Topsy, they have grown. There has been no particular plan of development or evolution, and the result is that, by one accretion of functions and another, by this subdivision and that subdivision, the whole administration is out of harmony and proportion - out of focus altogether. In the Home Affairs Department we have a constructing authority, and that is not a works Department. The Department has also to do with statistics, meteorology, and electoral matters; all the odds and ends seem to find their way to this Department. There is no affinity, for instance, between electoral matters and the construction of a huge national public work. Then, in the External Affairs Department we also have a constructing authority. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so; but there is the fact. There is, I suppose, about £20,000,000 of expenditure projected in connexion with the development of the Territory. Thousands of miles of railway have to be built if we expect effective occupation, and yet with this work our Construction Branch has nothing whatever to do. I suppose that in a week or so the Minister of External Affairs will be submitting proposals for Northern Territory railways. Further, there is the Post Office, and the Postmaster-General behind me says that he is spending </para>

                            <para>- The Postmaster-General talks of millions as if they were sixpences, and yet his Department is not a constructing Department to any great extent. In the Defence Department many millions have to be spent on the construction of our naval bases and other works of various kinds. It will be seen, therefore, that to-day we have in operation four different constructing authorities. </para>

                            <para>- All I can say is that I am not responsible for what appears in the newspapers, and I hope my honorable friends will take no notice whatever of those statements. This is a matter which affects the House, irrespective of party, and goes to the very root of the efficient government of the nation. The sooner something is done the better for all concerned; but there is the greatest possible difficulty in devising measures for the rectification of the troubles I have mentioned. For instance, we can do nothing without legislative power. At the present time we have nothing in the shape of a Supply and Tender Board, except scratch boards got together in the various States and at the Seat of Government in connexion with the Departments. We have no properly constituted Supply and Tender Board, and the Treasurer is now seeking power, by an amendment of the Audit Act, to bring about that little reform. Further, we have no such thing as a Committee of Public Accounts. There are Estimates for works to cost at least £22,000,000, and I defy the most autocratic Minister or the humblest member in the House to say or show that this money is being spent wisely and well. What we require is what is in existence elsewhere - a Committee of Public Accounts to follow those Estimates into the Departments, and see that the money voted gets to its proper destination. </para>

I am interested to hear that these are non-contentious measures, and I hope that my honorable friends opposite will make some proposition whereby we can get the Bills through in a few days' time. Then we shall do something. But they make me nervous when they talk of non-contentious measures. </para>

                            <para>- I am speaking of the possibility of getting through the House a very useful Works measure. Other statutory power is required to enable us to establish a proper constructing Department, an organized, modern, up-to-date Works Office. We have no such thing to-day, and our officers are struggling along under the greatest disabilities. I am afraid that we are overlapping. I do not speak authoritatively on the point; I only give my impressions, as any honorable member may do. The co-ordination of the works expenditure is a pressing necessity. We need some expert body to make preliminary investigations, and to present reasoned estimates and forecasts before Parliament is asked to vote huge sums of money. To my way of thinking - I do not say this for party purposes - the manner of the taking over of the Fitzroy Dock was wrong. An obligation amounting to £850,000 was incurred by the late Government without reference to Parliament. </para>

I have several times called order, and it is grossly disorderly, when the  Speaker  is trying to preserve order, for an honorable member to again immediately interject. I hope that it will not occur again. </para>

I have tried to defer action like this as much as possible; but, immediately after I had pointed out the grossness of the disorder of interjecting, when I had but a moment before called for order, and before I had more than resumed my seat, the honorable member interjected again. He had no right to impugn my impartiality, because I think I have shown proof of my desire to be fair to every one. The opportunity is still open to him, if he desires ft, to express his regret. </para>

In addition to interjecting immediately after I had called the House to order, and had explained how disorderly such interjections were, the honorable member interjected again, and thus forced me to name him; an action which was most repugnant to me. Having done that, he further charged me with partiality. Therefore, he has offended doubly. I ask him to apologize to the House. </para>

                            <para>- Parliament knows nothing about what he has been doing, nor does any one else. It cannot, under present circumstances, be known. Parliament votes money in total ignorance of how it will be spent in detail. That is why we need inquiries to follow these votes, and see that they reach their proper destinations. More than that, Parliament should be fully seized of the purposes for which money is asked. That is impossible under present conditions. We have not the requisite expert bodies to inform Parliament, so that honorable members may deal intelligently with the proposals put before them. But as we are nearing the hour for the dinner adjournment, I ask leave to continue my speech on another occasion. </para>

                <para class="block">I take no exception. We shall be glad to facilitate the passing of that part of the Bill as speedily as possible. Clause 3, however, deals with an entirely different matter. There is no necessary relation between the two provisions. The one is to provide for contingencies that have arisen, and are likely to arise, in order to enable the public services of the country to be carried on without resort - as the Prime Minister has said - to doubtfully legal expedients. The other proposes to create a Supply and Tender Board, or, as the clause stands, to give to the Auditor-General, under section 71 of the Audit Act, power to make regulations for regulating the purchase, custody, control, and issue of public stores. That, shortly, is a proposal to create a Supply and Tender Board. I want to make the position of the Opposition perfectly clear in this matter. We do not take exception to the creation of a Supply and Tender Board. To that, it appears to me, there can be no valid objection. Such a Board, to my knowledge, is in existence in New </para>
                <para class="block">South Wale3, and, so far as I know, in other States; but the proposal to make provision for it in this measure is, in my opinion, objectionable. There is no necessary relation between the two matters, and it sets up what appears to be a quite vicious principle. The Auditor-General is an independent officer, his sole function being to review the financial expenditure and financial conditions of the other Departments. In himself he does nothing. He, as public auditor, guarantees to the public that everything is as the Ministerial heads declare it to be. The Government are now proposing to make him the head of a Supply and Tender Board. </para>

                        <para>- I beg the right honorable member's pardon. That must be the position under the Audit Act. Such a position ought not to be created, because if it is, the Auditor-General will have to review the acts of his own officers. He should not do that.  His  duty is to review the actions of officers of other Departments. The object which the Government have in view can be secured in one of two ways. It is open to them to create a Departmental Board, such as exists in New South Wales - where the UnderSecretary to the Treasury, and two other Departmental heads, are constituted by departmental regulation or arrangement a Supply and Tender Board - or they can create such a Board by special Statute. To these courses I have no objection. Either course would give the Government what they want, whilst, at the same time, it would give the Auditor-General that power to review, as an independent officer, the actions of this Board, which he will not have if he has to review, as he would have to do under this Bill, his own acts. The right honorable member says, " No," but he will permit me to state my own view of the position. Clause 2 of the Bill is entirely acceptable to the Opposition) but there is a difference of opinion as to whether, under clause 3, there should be created a Supply and Tender Board, or whether that Board should not be created either under a separate measure or by regulation. The Board may be created by Statute - I do not know that there is any particular reason for doing so - or it may be established by regulation. I think the Treasurer would be well advised to withdraw this clause, so that the Bill will deal with one particular matter in stead of two that are entirely unrelated. Clause 2 will really give the Parliament power to grant Supply for thirteen months instead of twelve. The two matters should not be embraced by the one measure. That, shortly put, is our position. The difference of' opinion relates to a matter of procedure rather than of principle, and the desire of the Government to- establish a Board should be carried out in the way I have suggested. </para>

                    <para>.- This Bill was practically thrown at us at the end of last week by the Treasurer, who, for all practical purposes, acknowledged, in the course of his remarks, that he did not understand it. That, perhaps, is not surprising; nevertheless it would have been only ordinary courtesy on the right honorable member's part to make himself acquainted with the provisions of the Bill before presenting it to the House. At the very first breath of reasonable criticism, he admitted that the Bill did not contain a very important provision which should have been embodied in it, and he has since emphasized that admission by himself providing for a substantial amendment. Whilst the right honorable member was moving the motion for the second reading of the Bill, it was interjected that the Bill did not provide that payments made under it during the month of July should not be in excess of the appropriation for the previous year. He replied, " I think there is such a provision in the Bill." He did not know, and presumably had not looked at the measure, or taken the trouble to see that it contained such a provision. The right honorable gentleman subsequently found that it did not, and at this early stage we have had circulated by him a very important amendment, which would not have been necessary had the Bill been reasonably considered before being thrown on the table of the House. The Bill, as introduced, and without the amendment that has now been circulated, would have made it possible for a Ministry defeated at the polls to have indulged during the month of July, without calling Parliament together, in an expenditure altogether out of proportion to the appropriation made during the previous year, when the House waa in session. That is scarcely permitted in the case of an ordinary Supply Bill, granted when a Ministry holds office by virtue of even a large majority and the House is in session. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">There is invariably a stipulation, when an ordinary Supply Bill is granted before the Estimates come on, that the payments made shall not be in excess of the previous year's appropriation. Now, however, we have the Treasurer throwing a Bill at honorable members which, had they not carefully looked at it - far more carefully than did the responsible Minister - would have meant that next July, for instance, the Government need not have called the House together, and would have been able to indulge in any form of expenditure which the House would have no opportunity to consider. As a matter of fact, such expenditure would practically have to be condoned, and, doubtless, would have been  condoned. </para>

It will scarcely be believed by the people outside, who have been misled by those references to the necessity for the Bill going through in one sitting, that in no circumstances can it come into operation until July of next year. </para>

                        <para>- Then why should the Treasurer, or the Prime Minister, suggest that we on this side wasted time in discussing the Bill for a moment, and urging that it was not a measure of urgency ? Such painful attempts to mislead the community ought to be reprimanded and severely condemned, because they are becoming regular. First of all, the Bill cannot come into operation before next July, and, in all probability, it will not be brought into operation until the July following a general election. It is inconceivable that, unless under the latter circumstances, the Ministry would delay calling the House together until after the first week in July. After an election there might be an excuse for its doing so, and then only would the Bill be of the slightest use, in so far as its main features are concerned. As the Prime Minister dealt with this particular feature of the Bill when speaking at Dandenong a day or two ago, it is permissible to refer to what he there said. Again, we have a direct and deplorable misrepresentation of the situation, as will be seen from the Prime Minister's words, as reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of 9 th September.

                    <para>Last Friday the Ministry took them at their word, with an Audit Bill and a Bill to provide an agricultural bureau.

                <para class="block">There, again, the statement is incorrect, and a distinct misrepresentation; no stratagem had to be resorted to. The House met on the 9 th July, and then, practically without discussion, the Government were granted Supply. The Bill was put through the other branch of the Legislature with equal rapidity on 10th July, four or five da.ys before the Public Service salaries were due. There was no necessity for any stratagem, much less one which Parliament, to use the Prime Minister's own words, would have to " indemnify." Perhaps honorable members on the Government side are so accustomed to stratagems and methods that many honorable men reject that the idea occurs to the mind of the Prime Minister. The Government had not, and did not, resort to any stratagem, because, in the first place, the necessity never arose, salaries not being payable until the middle of the month; and, in the second place, a Supply Bill passed both Houses long before that time, the Government having been given a clear intimation by the </para>

So far as the Bill dealt only with the means of tiding over the first few weeks of a financial year, it was regarded as non-contentious, and we were prepared to pass it practically without a word.

                        <para>- We know that, and it was for that reason that we allowed the Prime Minister, practically without criticism, to wander on in his remarks. We knew that he was taken at a disadvantage, although he is Prime Minister, and the Government submit this Bill as, according to the honorable member for Wannon, their supreme measure, which is to raise the agricultural community to a standard that could never be reached by the poor members on this side, and which will stamp the present Government as one deserving the permanent occupancy of the Treasury benches. We know why the Minister of Trade and Customs is absent, and on that score no objection can be raised. The notes prepared for that honorable gentleman at the Customs House were sent up to the Prime Minister, who did his best. In view of this predicament of the Government, why should the Prime Minister and others go to Dandenong, or any other place, and make statements intended to convey to the public that we on this side are deliberately delaying measures, and taking undue advantage of the forms of the House to prevent the Ministry getting their business through? When we come to debate the Agricultural Bureau Bill we shall be able to show very clearly that, not only the Prime Minister, but practically the whole of the Ministry, are taken at a disadvantage at the present moment. In reply to a question a day or two ago the Prime Minister had to admit that the Government had not considered the Bill in any shape or form, and really did not know what the financial provisions were to be. However, we shall deal with all this when the Bill is before us. It is reasonable to ask the Treasurer to explain what, stratagem he indulged in in order to pay salaries in the early part of July. </para>

                        <para>- The Treasurer states that his Department, the paying Department, had not to resort to any strategy. But out in the country, at places like Dandenong, before cheering crowds of Liberal supporters, the present Prime Minister said the opposite. The honorable gentleman has a right to indulge in post-prandial speeches, but he should not use the occasion to slander those on this side, and to mislead the community. Had not the Treasurer told us the truth we should have had to ascertain it by direct inquiry. I take no exception to clauses 1 and 2 of the Bill, the provisions of which are reasonable. In the month of July, particularly after a general election, it may not be convenient to call Parliament together until perhaps ten or twelve days after the beginning of the financial year, and the Ministry, even though defeated at the polls, would be justified in paying salaries for the transaction of the ordinary business of the country. The Bill would permit that, the payments being in accordance with the previous appropriation. But the Acting Leader of the Opposition has properly drawn attention to a provision which, in my opinion, should not be retained in the measure. Clause 3 provides for the establishment of a Supply and Tender Board. I do not take exception to the establishment of such a Board, but I say that it should be provided for by a separate Bill. We should know, too, what the composition of the Board will be, what its functions will be, and whether its members will be new appointments or officers already in the service. Under the Bill the Government could appoint new men at any salaries they chose, and we have just had a message from the Governor-General recommending an appropriation for the purposes of the Bill. I do not know what the amount of the appropriation will be. </para>

                <para class="block">Under clause 3 the Government could establish a Supply and Tender Board, and; by regulation give it practically any powers they thought fit, without Parliament having an opportunity to criticise what had been done. The deletion of clause 3 is not proposed by way of an attack on the Government, and it can be agreed to without loss of dignity. Honorable members on this side feel that the provision is not in its right place, and that the Board, if established, should be authorized by a separate Bill. Clause 3 amends section 71 of the principal Act - which provides for the making of regulations - by adding a new paragraph; but it is a matter for consideration whether the establishment of a Supply and Tender Board would be consistent with the original Act. The Act deals with the auditing and keeping of accounts and the proper expenditure of the appropriations of Parliament. The establishment of a Supply and Tender Board is an entirely different thing. Section 71 gives power to make regulations " not inconsistent with the provisions of this Act " ; but it might be found that regulations for the creation of a Supply and Tender Board were inconsistent, and, therefore, they would go for nothing.

                        <para>- I do not think so. In the first place, I take the point that this is not a mere matter of accountancy. It is not a mere matter of determining whether a particular set of accounts is correct or not. It is something more than that. It is a general direction to the Treasurer and others who have to deal with public moneys and materials as to how they are to exercise control over them. It empowers the Auditor-General to check, within the scope of the measure, the application or use of those moneys and materials. That that is properly provided for is shown, by an examination of the Audit Acts of the States. Take the South Australian Audit Act of 1882. It provides that the Commissioner of Audit, or any officers appointed by him - and if a separate Tender Board were appointed they would be officers within the meaning of the Audit Act - are authorized from time to time to check accounts and goods warehoused in Government stores, and so on. </para>

One is that, assuming we give these powers, they are inconsistent with the spirit of the Audit Act. The other is that which seems to be taken by the honorable member for Adelaide, that though the proposal may, or may not, be in conformity with the objects of the Audit Act, we are not attaining the object by the way we are amending section 71. </para>

                        <para>- Do honorable members want the Audit Act to contain a provision that only certain classes of persons shall be appointed, and do they want the names of the persons connected with the staff of the Tender Board to appear? That sort of thing has nob been the practice in our legislation. It is only when you appoint Railways Commissioners, or some great functionaries of that kind, who are not permanent heads of Departments, that you prescribe their powers in an Act. In other cases, general powers are given. For instance, we hand over to the Public Service Commissioner the power of classification and selection of officers, and so on. Similarly, in this case it is proposed to give to the Treasurer by Act of Parliament power to appoint a Supply and Tender Board. Surely we can intrust him with the constitution of that Board as long as we define the general powers. Those powers can extend - and, as a matter of fact, they do extend in the States where they have more of these operations than we do - to the control and purchase of material as well as the disposition of material. </para>

                        <para>- It is a mere question of this provision that is objected to being in keeping with the spirit of the Audit Act. Of course, if what is intended is not properly achieved by the wording of this measure, it can be amended in Committee. But I do not for a moment think the object is not properly achieved. Whether it should be provided for in an Audit Act is a question upon which there may be a difference of opinion. All that I say is that similar powers are contained in the Audit Acts of the States. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot see for the life of me why this matter should be under the Prime Minister's Department. If we say that a regulation may be made affecting, the custody and purchase of public stores, surely that matter can be under the control of the Treasurer, he being the Minister who will have to provide the funds. As a matter of fact, it will be found that in the Acts of the States, in many cases, the audit relates, not merely to money, but to materials - to materials into which cash' has been converted ; and it is a perfectly proper thing to invest a commissioner or a Board with a power of supervision over such matters. There is no doubt about that. The only question is as to whether we are attaining that object by this measure. According to my reading the Bill is ample for the purpose. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable gentleman who has just resumed his seat has devoted his attention to showing that, because there is a provision in some of the Acts of the States which permits of the Auditor-General performing the functions laid down in this Bill, therefore, it is proper that we should provide for them in the Bill. But there is a difference between the Auditor-General of a State and the Auditor-General of the Commonwealth. The Auditor-General of no State to-day has the enormous amount of work to supervise that the Auditor-General of the Commonwealth has. The whole of the time of our Auditor-General is consumed by his present duties. He is in a different position from that which this Tender Board will" occupy. The Auditor-General presents his report to this House. He is responsible to Parliament, and not to the Government. If the Auditor-General is to be made the head of a Supply and Tender Board, he will not be responsible to this House as he is now. </para>

                        <para>- No doubt if the Attorney-General had explained matters he would have put them more clearly. We have been told that he will have complete control over the purchase of the various stores required by the Commonwealth. If that be so, sooner or later he must come into conflict with the members of this House. Now, if there is one man in the Public Service of the Commonwealth who should be placed beyond the possibility of conflict with either House of this Parliament, that man is the Auditor-General. I object to government by regulation. I agree with the Prime Minister, who, upon numerous occasions in this House, has taken strong exception to government by regulation. We do not know who are to constitute the proposed Supply and Tender Board. This Bill will empower the Treasurer to expend money for one month after the close of the financial year, on the basis of the Estimates for the preceding year. I think that the exercise of that power should be limited to the first month after a general election. That is the only time that the Treasurer will be called upon to exercise it. </para>

                        <para>- It is only required because Governments call Parliament together at the last possible moment. There is a necessity for empowering the Treasurer, after a general election, to expend money for one month on the basis of the Estimates for the preceding year, because if Parliament were called together before the 30th June, the Senate would have to meet composed of its old members, notwithstanding that the country had elected new members. </para>

                        <para>- I think that the measure will work out in the manner I have suggested, and that, in the future, Governments, instead of calling Parliament together during the first week of July, will probably defer meeting it till the end of July or the beginning of August. I recollect that, on a former occasion, when money was required before the meeting of Parliament, a special Bill was passed to authorize the necessary expenditure. By adopting that course now the public finances would be protected in a way that they cannot be protected under this Bill. To-day I asked the Treasurer whether there had been a proper audit of the public accounts from time to time, and I again ask him whether those accounts have been correctly audited from time to time? </para>

                        <para>- Yet we find the Prime Minister going about the country and declaring that the accounts are not properly audited. I strongly object to placing this additional burden on the Auditor-General. I do not know what the Government intend to do in this matter. The Treasurer did not tell us. He acted exactly as the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs acted last night. He gave us very little information. I am quite in accord with the idea of establishing a Supply and Tender Board. The sooner we have our supplies regulated under one head the better. But I do not think that the method proposed is the best way of going about that work. A Bill should be introduced creating a Department expressly to deal with this matter - a Department which should be under the control of some responsible Minister, and which would leave the Auditor-General free to audit the accounts from time to time. </para>

                        <para>- But the Treasurer is proposing to do it by regulation, when it should be done by means of an Act of Parliament. The Government ask for power to make regulations from time to time, and every honorable member knows the difficulty that we experience in understanding them. They are brought forward in bundles, and I do not believe that there is a single man in this Chamber, from the Prime Minister to the humblest member of it, who ever reads those regulations. I notice that the Prime Minister is very anxious to make a personal explanation. He has had to make so many since the last general elections that the mere making of them is becoming a gift with him. I enter my protest against the procedure that is being adopted in connexion with this Bill. I do not think that the first portion of it will bring about the results anticipated, because it will enable Governments to postpone calling Parliament together until the last possible moment. It can be made effective so far as the financial portion of it is concerned only after a general election. </para>

He points out that previously eight Liberal Administrations had always enabled him to present his report 'on the accounts to Parliament while it was sitting. </para><interjection>

They show that, whereas previously eight Liberal Administrations had presented their statement of accounts, and got them 'audited, and the audit put before this Parliament during the session, during the three years of Labour rule of the Treasurer the Auditor-General could not get the statement of accounts in any one year in time to make his audit of any use to this Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know now why the accounts cannot be presented to this Parliament just the same as can be done in connexion with any big business, perhaps not quite as readily. I am not asking that the report of the Auditor- General and the balance-sheet should be presented as is done in the case of a company; but, making allowance for the difference between the affairs of a Government and those of a company, I still say that the very purpose and intention of an Auditor-General auditing our accounts is that the audit may be of service to this Parliament in reviewing the accounts of the year, and that, as he himself points out, is absolutely impossible unless he can get the statement of accounts in time to audit them and present them to this Parliament while it is in session. </para>

It was the year in respect of which a special appropriation was made by this Parliament in order that a large party of honorable members might attend the Coronation celebrations in the Old Country. He is well acquainted with the fact that Parliament was deliberately called together very late in that year, and that it was for that reason that at the end of the previous session a Supply Bill was passed authorizing expenditure for the first two months of the next financial year. A.11 these facts are cleverly concealed from the public, and particularly from the residents of Dandenong, when the Prime Minister goes up there with his colleague the Attorney-General to take part in a specially -prepared " boosting " function. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that the remark is slightly irrelevant. Here is another interesting fact which has just been unearthed - a fact which the Prime Minister did not care to look up, but which we have found out for ourselves - that the report of the Auditor-General for 1907 was presented on the last day that Parliament met. That was during the term of office of the Fusion Government. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that it was the Reid-McLean Administration, which was supported by honorable members opposite. The point that I wish to make is that the Prime Minister said that prior to the advent of the Labour Administration the accounts had been presented in time, whereas in 1907 the Auditor-General did not present his report until the last day of .the session. </para>

                        <para>- And left his leader in a nice fix. Coming to the Bill itself, I do not propose to take serious exception to the first part, so far as it is designed to legitimately amend the Audit Act, although there is associated with it a dangerous feature. I recognise that it is absolutely impossible for the Government of the day to carry on the great Departments of the Commonwealth when they have not a penny at their disposal from 1st July until Parliament meets. The Treasurer knows, however, that whilst that is so, he allows the different Departments under his authority to enter into contractual obligations in connexion with the supply of the various stores required by them - obligations extending into the following financial year. I do not say that the money is expended, but the contractual obligation to expend it is undoubtedly authorized by the Treasurer. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. This Bill does not relieve Ministers from that obligation; but it will give the Government of the day, willy nilly, a month's supply without the express authority of Parliament. It would be. possible, under the Bill as it stands, for a Government situated as the present Administration is, to refrain from calling Parliament together until the second week in August, instead of early in July. Knowing the difficulty which the Treasurer has in ascertaining whether he can meet his expenditure on the exact day on which the books close, namely, 30th June, I shall not take serious exception to this provision, although, under it, a Government defeated at the polls in April or May could carry on until August, and still have authority to expend public moneys. </para>

                        <para>- It is a question not of what they would do, but what they could do. As to the second part of the Bill, the Prime Minister this afternoon indicated that he was favorable to the appointment of a Public Works Committee to supervise public works, and also that he thought it might be necessary to have a Public Accounts Committee. The late Government inherited from their predecessors a legacy which they did not leave for their successors. At the Sydney Post Office it was found that telephone accounts amounting to nearly £30,000 had been unaudited for about eighteen months. In the Stores Branch the late Government for nearly two years made efforts to find out exactly what the position was ; and at the expiration of that time it was decided by the Treasurer, as the easiest way out of the trouble, to close the books and start again. </para>

                        <para>- After a general election Parliament cannot reasonably be called together in the first week in July unless, of course, we are content to include senators who may have been defeated at the poll. If an election be held late in June, it may be some weeks before the final result is known, as on the last occasion, and the Government returned certainly require a few weeks in which to consider their position before meeting Parliament. It appears to me that the proposal to place on the Auditor-General the responsibility for the purchase, custody, control, and issue of public stores is quite foreign to this Bill. </para>

                <para class="block">In my opinion it is dangerous to allow regulations to govern business of that description ; but, in any case, it is now proposed that the Auditor-General shall be empowered to make regulations governing the purchase, custody, control, and issue of public stores, which, I contend, cannot be considered relevant to an Audit Act. Personally, I am not at all opposed to some sort of tribunal to insure a more effective examination of tenders, and exercise control over the purchase of stores made by the Departments, because such a body would be particularly useful. In my opinion, however, this is the wrong Bill in which to provide for such a tribunal. It would be much more satisfactory to provide for this control in a separate Bill, which can be criticised here, and not leave it to regulations. I shall give a general support to the first part of this measure. I have no desire to impede its progress; but I must commend the points I have raised to the attention of the Treasurer. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to address myself shortly to the point raised by honorable members opposite, that the clause referred to is one that ought not to find a place in the Bill. The question is not whether it might not form part of another Bill, or form a Bill by itself, but whether it properly forms part of a Bill to amend the Audit Act. The scope of an auditor's duties is pretty well defined at law, and known to men of business. They involve not merely accountancy, but also the investigation of all the affairs and finances of the company, corporation, or government for which the audit is made. Auditing involves the examination of vouchers for all payments, the ascertaining of the existence of the property alleged to have been purchased with money spent, and other things. The duties of an auditor are stated clearly in the <inline font-style="italic">Encyclopedia of the</inline><inline font-style="italic">Lavis</inline><inline font-style="italic">of England -</inline></para>

                    <para>An auditor may be described as a person whose duty it is to examine the accounts of a, company, firm, or person, so as to ascertain the exact state of affairs financially at a given moment. This involves, not only a scrutiny of the figures, but also an examination of the form and substance of the accounts, in order to see that they truly represent the state of affairs purporting to be represented by them. </para>

                <para class="block">Although the duties of an auditor are not usually construed to extend to valuation, they include the ascertaining of the existence of the goods for the purchase of which money has been expended. A general supervision of stores, and the ascertaining where they are, what is left of them, what has been issued, and what has come in, fall within the scope of an auditor's duties. </para>

                        <para>- On that considerable doubt has been expressed from time to time, but I think it is now the generally conceived opinion that an auditor's "duties do not strictly cover valuation, unless there is depreciation such as must be patent to every ordinary man of business. It is not the duty of an auditor, in auditing the accounts of a company holding mortgages on properties extending over a wide area, to visit all those properties, to find out whether they are correctly valued. </para>

                        <para>- If stores had been destroyed, it would come within the duty of an auditor to ascertain that fact. The auditor must be able to say that money supposed to be represented in goods is so represented ; but it is not his duty to make valuations. Among the duties of an auditor is the ascertaining of the existence of, and the supervision of the dealing with, stores. The honorable member for Denison says that we wish to make the Auditor-General .an inspector of stores, but that is expressly provided for by the Audit Act. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; the powers are contained in the Act from which I am quoting. The first point that I want to make is that the general supervision of stores - not as a purchaser, not as a Ministerial head - is under the auditorial supervision of the Auditor-General. The next point that has been made is that this measure, if carried, will give the Auditor-General power to purchase, control, and issue stores. It will give him nothing of the kind. </para>

                <para>None of those duties, except indirectly, imposes any powers whatever upon the Auditor-General, but some of them may impose conditions which he will have to see have been complied with before he can say that a proper audit has been made of the affairs of the Treasury officers, who are conducting the actual receipt and expenditure of money. It is only incidentally that they affect the Auditor-General.. They prescribe matters which the Auditor-General will have to see have been complied with. That is all. This Bill, then, merely imposes another condition. It is not an enabling measure. It does not enable the Auditor-General to do anything. It merely says that the Governor-General may make regulations affecting the control and issue of public stores. </para>

                        <para>- The House must judge of that. I am only explaining what is being done. We have to read the Audit Act generally. First, there are the provisions for the safety of the public, laying down conditions under which public money can be issued. Over all those the Auditor-General is given control. He must find whether the money has been properly appropriated by Parliament. Those are all provisions relating to his duties. They are ordinary conditions that have to be complied with, and'. which he has to certify have been complied with. He has to see that particular moneys which have gone out of the Treasury have received the appropriation of Parliament. But the Governor-General may make regulations imposing other : conditions affecting the payment of money out of the Treasury, or the receipt of money. Under section 71, if the Governor-General does make those regulations, the Auditor-General may have, and probably will have, other duties imposed upon him - namely, to see that these regulations have been complied with. But he is still in exactly the same position of complete independence as a high official charged with the duty of seeing whether the law has been complied with, and whether the money of the Government is intact in the shape of funds or stores. All that falls within his direct province. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable member is asking me a question affecting political ethics, I do not want to enter into it now. I am simply endeavouring to explain the legal position. I arn inclined to think that there would, under this measure, be authority for the Governor-General to issue a certain regulation under which a particular Board might be appointed. At all events, that is the intention of the Government. </para>

                        <para>- Several honorable members have taken a good deal of exception to the appointment of this Board, because they apprehend that the&gt; Auditor-General will be either the  chairman  of it or a member of it. Not only will that not be so, but it would be quire inconsistent with the position which he occupies under the Audit Act. The Auditor-General is the person who has to see whether the conditions imposed by the Supply and Tender Board, as well as all the other conditions under Statute or regulations, have been complied with, before he can certify to the expenditure of the money. Consequently, it is highly undesirable that he should be connected with the Board in any way. As a matter of fact, he will not be. Therefore,, this provision is a purely restrictive one. Any regulation which may be passed wilt merely restrict the power of the Minister to purchase stores. </para>

Can there be any practical objection to such a self-denying provision as that? No regulation can give the Treasurer more power than he has. It can only limit his power. </para>

Personally, I think that the more appropriate place for it is the Audit Act. Because regulations may impose other conditions which the </para>

                        <para>- If the Auditor-General made that statement, let us look at the facts. We have had the same man in the position since the beginning of the Commonwealth. For the six months ending 30th June, 1901, the report was presented on 26th May, 1903 - that is nearly two years after the accounts were closed. For the year ending 30th June, 1902, the report was presented on 26th May, 1903. For the year ending 30th June, 1903, the report was presented on 3rd March, 1904. As far as I am aware, in no instance when a Labour Ministry was in office was the report presented so late as on these occasions. </para>

                        <para>- I will not be surprised to find that one of the honorable member's reports was presented on the first of April. When the Prime Minister gets up and says that under the Liberal, or Fusion, or Wreckage party - happily named by its late leader - the' report of the Auditor-General was presented when Parliament was sitting, I am compelled to point out the dates when it was actually presented. For the year ending 30th June, 1904, the report was presented on 14th December, 1904 - the day before Parliament rose. The honorable member for Swan was Treasurer then. </para>

                        <para>- For the year ending 30th June, 1907, the report of the Auditor-General was presented on 13th December - the last day on which Parliament sat. Except in the first few years of the Federation, when the report was very late in being presented, it has been presented practically on the last day of a session, or thereabouts. For the year ending 30th June, 1908, the report was presented on 10th December, 1908, the first Fisher Ministry having been in office for about three weeks. No doubt, the accounts had been sent along, and anything that the previous Treasurer could do, either to facilitate them, or keep them back, had been done by him. When the present leader of the Opposition was Treasurer in 1908, the report was presented on the 10th December, that is, four days earlier than the present Treasurer presented his report in 1905. I have objected to these statements which have been made on public platforms for party purposes. Were the honorable member for Gippsland present to-night, I would deal with him on this measure, as he has criticised the Auditor-General's report, but since he is absent, I will save my criticism for a Supply Bill or a grievance day. He objected to statements which have appeared in one journal called <inline font-style="italic">Every Week.</inline> I shall take the statements in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">South Gippsland Shire Record.</inline></para>

                        <para>- I was pleased to hear the Treasurer state that every audit has been correct, and that all moneys spent by the Fisher Government have been accounted for. I am absolutely in accord with this Bill, except the provision for the inclusion of a Supply and Tender Board, as I consider it out of its proper place in this Bill. I believe that the proposal to have the money available in July is a right one, and I approve of the amendment, which the Treasurer had apparently forgotten when he introduced the measure. This is a case of hasty legislation. Had we passed the Bill on Friday, when the Government were anxious that we should, the right honorable gentleman would have had to get it altered by his huge majority in the Senate. The whole seven of them would have had to get to work there. I am anxious that the Bill should go from this Chamber complete. But I do not think it is right to deal in an Audit Bill with the creation of a Supply and Tender Board. That should be dealt with in a separate measure, so that people should not have to look up a number of regulations which have to be altered from time to time. Honorable members on the other side have objected to government by regulation. It is far better to deal with a question of this kind by a special Act than to leave it to be dealt with by regulations, because any Minister may amend the regulations a week after Parliament is out of session. </para>

                        <para>- I did not hear the Prime Minister make that remark. This serves only to emphasize the importance of maintaining silence when an honorable member is addressing the Chair. It is sometimes absolutely impossible for me to hear what is going on owing to the numerous interjections and remarks that are being made simultaneously. If the Prime Minister made such a statement I ask him to withdraw it. </para>

                    <para>. - I deeply regret that the heads of the Departments of the Commonwealth are not better protected than they are in this House. We all know that the officers of each Department look to Ministers for protection. To-night, however, we find the Prime Minister evidently not realizing his responsibility, and, for purely party purposes, in order to refute a statement made outside this House, questioning the ability of the various heads of Departments. </para>

                        <para>- T regret that any honorable member, in order to make himself good with the public outside, should question the ability of officers whose ability is really beyond question. The Commonwealth took over the best officers of the State Departments, and we have at the head of our Departments capable men quite able to look after the interest? of Australia. The Prime Minister casts n reflection upon them when he says that, the Auditor-General is unable to fulfil his duties owing to the neglect of  some  person. The system is responsible for the delay. The financial year closes on the 30th June, and the accounts have to come from, say, Western Australia, or southern Tasmania : or auditors have to be sent to those places. How is it possible for the Auditor-General's officers to audit the accounts more quickly than hitherto? The Departments have grown much within the last few years, owing to the fact that the late Government were a Government who did something, and, in doing that something, they created new work. I question very much whether the present Government will be able to furnish the accounts to the Auditor-General any earlier than did the previous Government. I do not think that the Honorary Minister would intentionally mislead this House; and, in my simplicity, I believe statements made from the other side. </para>

                        <para>- I have said that it was in my simplicity, as a young member of the House, that I took it for granted that neither the Honorary Minister nor the Prime Minister would mislead honorable members. We were told that this was a simple little Bill; and I had no intention to speak until I heard four honorable members on the Government side give four different interpretations of the measure. The only honorable gentleman opposite who, in my humble opinion, after my twenty-one years' experience of the making out of requisitions for stores for a big Department, presented the Bill to us in a way that I could grasp was the Attorney-General; and I feel deeply grateful to him for the information he has imparted. I do not know that, after only three years' experience as a member here, I am quite at liberty to adversely criticise the Treasurer, with his many years of parliamentary life behind him," and his reputation as a financier; but I must say that, after having listened attentively ito him when he introduced the Bill. I find the views I then formed as to the object of the measure entirely changed by the explanation of the Attorney-General. I am in agreement with this Bill up to a certain point, because undoubtedly the Audit Act needs amendment; but I fail to see the propriety of imposing on the Auditor-General the duties of an inspector-general of stores. It is an unfortunate fact that there is a different system of  storekeeping  in each one of the States, and each Department has its own Stores Branch. The Post, Office, the Department of Home Affairs, and the Defence Department each has a Stores Branch, and the work in this connexion must increase as the years go on. My idea is that we ought to have an expert inspector-general of stores, and that the machinery suggested by the Government will, if created, clog before long. An inspector-general would bring about a uniform system throughout the Commonwealth, and this would be of great advantage. I question very much whether it could be ascertained now what stores there are in stock in any one of the Departments, and there is practically no expert supervision over their issue. If the electrical engineer in the Post Office desires stores, the storekeeper cannot Pay whether they are required or not, because he has no practical knowledge of electrical engineering. At the present time, we have the Public Service Commissioner, with no responsibility, selecting and regulating the number of hands who shall be employed in the Post Office : and now it is proposed to saddle the Auditor-General with the extra duty of a stores inspector. There is no doubt that if this Bill be passed as presented, the Auditor-General will have to create an expert branch in order to carry out his new duties, because his Department is now admittedly overloaded with work : and this new branch will mean the appointment of a head and a number of officers. The staff of the Auditor-General's Department have had no practical experience of this kind, and to ask them to undertake expert duties such as are proposed must prove to the disadvantage of the Commonwealth. I am informed that a quantity of German insulated wire has been purchased by the Postal Department, although there is preference of about 15 per cent, in favour of British wire of superior quality. The reason given is that the British wire could not be obtained in Australia for work that was urgently required, and the Department had to accept the inferior article which was available. My own opinion is that, if these new duties be imposed on the Auditor-General's Department, the purchase of stores will be still further delayed. The duties of an Auditor-General are to supervise the accounts, compel stocktaking at least once a year, and see that the vouchers are all right. He should not be called on to do work altogether outside his proper duties. Who will be responsible to the Minister when stores are purchased ? Will the Auditor-General be responsible? That would make him subordinate to the Minister, and he should be altogether free from political influence. But the chief officer of a Tender Board should be responsible to a Minister, so that the work of the Board might be discussed by Parliament. I have no desire to " stone-wall " or delay the passing of the Bill, but I hope that the Prime Minister will see his way to agree to an adjournment of the debate. </para>

                        <para>- The denials of the Prime Minister are so frequent that one cannot keep them in memory. To his own delight, he quoted from the report of the Auditor-General a passage which he thought would discredit the Labour party. He pointed out that the Auditor-General has stated that he did not receive the accounts for the year 1909-10 early enough to enable him to submit his report to Parliament in time ; that he did not get them before the 10th March, 1911. One might expect that the Prime Minister would at least endeavour to be fair, and would investigate all the circumstances before quoting a passage with the object of discrediting opponents. Had he done that he would have found that the Fisher Government came into office in 1910, only two months before the financial year closed. During the first ten months of it the Deakin-Cook Administration had control of the Commonwealth, and its successor had to clear up th, <inline font-style="italic">debris</inline> arising from the neglect of the past, and deal with the inauguration of heavy expenditure to remedy that neglect. It could not be expected to present accounts in the way alleged by the Auditor-General that they had been presented by nine previous Administrations, though the honorable member for Yarra has disproved that statement. At the end of the year the honorable member for Wide Bay had to go to Africa, and he did not return until early in 1911, and a few months later he had to go to England. These extraordinary calls on the time of a Prime Minister new to office, and faced with tasks calculated to overawe any man, increased the difficulty of clearing up after the imperfect arrangements of the past. The present Prime Minister is always sheltering himself behind some one when his statements bring him into difficulty, and this time it was the Auditor-General.  His  charges against his predecessor are not fair. I draw attention to the legal exposition undertaken by the Attorney-General. He endeavoured to explain what the duties of the Auditor-General were. He said it was the duty of that official, not only to review the accounts submitted to him, but to see that the stores and other assets were as reported by the officers in whose Departments they were. I asked the honorable gentleman whether depreciation was to be allowed for, and he said that the investigation did not include depreciation. I say unhesitatingly that in Departments such as the Defence Department and the Post and Telegraph Department, where material depreciates and becomes obsolete, if the Auditor-General makes a report without allowing for and estimating depreciation, his report must fail to convey an idea of the true position of affairs for the guidance of the Government and Parliament. Consequently, the Attorney-General's argument falls to the ground. What is the reason for the power to make regulations provided for in this Bill? Is it the outcome of a discovery that there has been no supervision in the past, no person responsible for the duties of purchasing and controlling public stores? Is it that the accounts of the Government of Australia have been so badly kept, and the provision for the custody and purchase of stores has been so ineffective, that Parliament is now asked to give the Government power to make these regulations? Personally, I am very pleased to find that, at last, some one is going to be made responsible. In travelling through the country with the Postal Commission, and in examining the stores of the various States, we found that the officers in charge could not furnish any reliable data as to the property in their custody, nor did their books indicate that they had any reliable accounts to serve as a guarantee to the public. In Western Australia, through the lack of system which obtained, an officer accumulated copper wire belonging to the Department to such an extent that at length he got sufficient to enable him to fence a selection with it. That was not discovered until the Postal Commission investigated matters in that State. There was no system. How could there be a system ? The methods followed in every State varied. We find different degrees of unreliability in re- gard  to the keeping of public stores. Whilst the Public Service Commissioner has the power of appointing officers to take charge, and pays little regard to their adaptability, we shall not get that efficient administration which is required. Men are appointed to positions by a rule of seniority, not by a rule of fitness. If you have a man in charge of a store who understands proper methods of stocktaking and bookkeeping, he may be removed to some other position, where he knows nothing about the duties, and another officer may be brought in to fill his place who knows nothing about stores. There is a constant changing of men and putting them into positions for which they have no special fitness. While that system continues, you may give the Auditor-General any powers you like, but you will not obtain that completeness of supervision that is insisted upon by any decent private firm. No business man would take a competent ironmonger and put him into his accounts branch, or would take a good accountant and put him in charge of his ironmongery. Yet that is what takes place in our Public Service to-day. We are constantly putting round pegs in square holes, and square pegs in round ones. While that system continues, it will be useless to give extra powers to the Auditor-General. There should be an accountant in each State, who should be made personally responsible to the Minister, and the Auditor-General should be the correcting officer between the accountant and Parliament. Unless you have some such double check, you will obtain no satisfaction. What is the position in regard to accountancy to-day? Let the Postmaster-General investigate the matter in his own Department. After an exhibition of weakness extending over years, an accountant was appointed, but we have not been able to get a statement yet. </para>

Even if there is in the Department a man of whom the Postmaster- General thinks highly he will not be able to do the work as it should be done, unless he has qualified juniors to take charge of the various branches in the different States. </para>

                        <para>- It is not always the man who has served his time at accountancy who makes the best accountant. But any man of ordinary common sense who investigates the working of a Department can pass judgment upon it. The Treasurer need not attempt to flout me, or to throw out innuendoes in respect of work to which I devoted a large amount of time without any consideration whatever. I devoted myself to that work wholly for the purpose of improving the position of the Postal Department, and it ill becomes him to sneer at my efforts. The Postal Department is the greatest spending Department in the Commonwealth. 1 venture to say that two-thirds of the time of the Auditor-General is spent in supervising and directing the Accountant's Branch of the Postal Department. Consequently, the relations between the Post Office and the Auditor-General constitute one of the most striking illustrations of the defective system which exists to-day. The Government do not appear to realize that any provision for the creation of a Supply and Tender Board should be contained in a special Bill. The duties of such a Board could then be plainly set out. We have to recollect that a Commonwealth Supply and Tender Board will be the biggest thing of its kind in Australia, and, consequently, its functions should be clearly specified. </para>

                        <para>- The Prime Minister, both in the country and in this House, has been flourishing the reports of the Auditor-General. 1 should have thought that any reasonable man would have been satisfied with the explanation given in connexion with the presentation of the Auditor-General's report during the closing days of the last session of the last Parliament. But  notwithstanding  the statement of the ex-Prime Minister and Treasurer, we find that the present Prime Minister, both in this House and in the country, has been making statements which, in my judgment, cannot conduce to the advancement of the Commonwealth. In speaking of the finances of the Commonwealth, we need to be especially careful, otherwise we do great damage to our country's credit. Yet leading politicians have been going about the country gasconading on this subject. </para>

                <para class="block">Last session the Prime Minister complained that the Auditor-General's report had been presented to Parliament only in the dying hours of the session. No matter what Government has been in power, it seems to me that the Auditor-General's report has always been presented during the closing weeks of the session. I recollect one year in which the Treasurer represented this country in South Africa, and that may have caused some delay, and also in another year this Parliament did not meet until September, because the honorable member for Wide Bay and other members attended the Imperial Conference in London and arrived here late. The Prime Minister ought to realize when he is making these complaints - whether he is reading from a report of the Auditor-General or not - that he is throwing a certain amount of odium upon leading public servants of this country, especially those who are associated with the making up of our accounts. Last session, after the honorable gentleman had made complaints similar to those which he made here tonight, the ex-Prime Minister spoke as follows : - </para>

                    <para>The statement of the honorable member for Parramatta is so far from what I should call a judicial criticism regarding the presentation of the Auditor-General's report as to be of no value whatever. To say that there is no control over the finances  because the Auditor-General's report has only just been presented is not within measurable distance of fact or truth. The Auditor-General's report is in the hands of honorable members, and the position of the Government can be tested, if not in this House, elsewhere. </para>

                        <para>- Then my remark clearly covers the honorable member's statement. The Auditor-General acquits the Treasury of any intention to do other than facilitate the presentation of accounts. He says that the Treasury officials showed every desire to bring matters before him. If there is one thing that I should like more than another, it is the presentation to the public of the results of a full investigation of Commonwealth affairs since we took office, and such a statement will be presented to the public. </para>

                <para class="block">That is a manly, truthful statement, which ought to have prevented honorable members when seeking election, or trying to secure the election of comrades, making many of these diatribes against the financial conduct of the Commonwealth. That is unpatriotic conduct, in my opinion. I am not here to defend the honorable member for Wide Bay. There is not the slightest doubt that had he been here to-night he would have ably refuted what the Prime Minister has said. I think it is about time that we laid aside the reports of the Auditor-General, and ceased to quote them ever and anon, in the hope that in throwing a lot of mud some of it may stick to a political party. While 1 congratulate the Attorney-General upon the lucid exposition he gave of this Bill, for which we are very thankful, I do say that he has wrongly apprehended the duties of an auditor. 1 believe that I am a little at variance with some of my honorable friends on this side. 1 take it that the duty of the Auditor-General is to analyze the accounts and vouchers just as any auditor deals with the vouchers, accounts, and balance-sheet of a company. I hold in my hand a certificate as to what an auditor does under the Companies Act in Victoria. I take it that the auditor to a public company or a big concern acts in relation to the company in the same way as the Auditor-General acts in relation to our great Commonwealth. An auditor's certificate in this State reads as follows: - </para>

                <para class="block">Department ? It would be physically impossible for him to. examine the stores at all.' Is any one prepared to tell me that the Auditor-General would be able to leave his office here, and go over to Western Australia to examine all the stores there, and afterwards in turn go to South Australia, Victoria, Tasmania, New South Wales, and Queensland? Such a thing would be physically impossible. I trust that a vote will be taken which will confine the Auditor-General to his proper sphere, and so relieve him from the duties of comptroller or inspector of stores. It is quite likely that to-morrow I shall have some observations to make on the Sill in Committee. I trust that the Treasurer, as well as his colleagues and their supporters, will take kindly any hints that may come from this side. The complaint made by the Opposition in the last Parliament was that the Labour Government would never take any hints or suggestions from them, but I sincerely trust that any hints from the present Opposition regarding this measure will receive fair consideration. I hope that when the Bill is brought on for consideration in Committee, one of the first announcements made by the Treasurer will be that he intends to relieve the Auditor-General of the duties of comptroller of stores. I am in favour of that portion of the Bill which deals with the expenditure of money on the public services and other items, but I consider that the purchase of stores, and the consideration of tenders, are matters which ought to be dealt with in a separate measure. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not think that I shall be prepared to take the honorable member's advice and to alter the Bill in the way that he suggests. It seems to me that if we did nothing, we should have no trouble; but that when we desire to do something that will be of advantage to the Parliament and the country, we are met with a host of objections. A good deal of care has already been exercised in connexion with the purchase, -custody, and control of stores. The work has not been allowed to proceed in a haphazard way. We have used, up to the present time, the Tender Boards of the States with great advantage. Victoria has a very complete set of regulations with regard to the purchase, custody, and control of public stores, and, with the concurrence of the State Government, to whom we are much obliged, we have availed ourselves of them. There has been, however, some want of organization on our own part, and we are now trying to perfect the system. Even at the present time it is open to us to make Treasury regulations dealing with the subject, but they would not have the force of law, and, perhaps, would not be as binding on the Auditor-General as regulations are. The reason for the insertion in this Bill of a clause giving the Governor-General in Council power to make regulations for the purchase, custody, control, and issue of stores is that we desire that regulations having the force of law, instead of Treasury instructions, -shall be framed. I am quite surprised that any exception should have been taken to this Bill. The first part merely makes provision for a convenient arrangement. It will be, no doubt, of assistance to the Government and to their successors. It is a machinery provision, which has been much talked of, and which, it was thought, would readily meet with the concurrence of the House. The only object that we have in view in connexion with the second part of the Bill is to try to afford greater security than at present exists. The objection that has been taken that clause 3 is in the wrong place - that such a provision should not be in an Audit . Bill - has been shown by the Attorney-General to be without foundation. In every State, I think, the purchase, control, and custody of stores is provided for by regulations made by virtue of a section in the Audit or some other Act. It is not covered by a separate Statute. Nothing but good can result from this proposal. We are not seeking under it to make our path easier. We are really imposing more restrictions upon the expenditure of public money, and taking upon ourselves, as administrators, more burdens. Honorable members opposite have been good enough to approve of the principles of the Bill; but they seem to disapprove of the form it takes. The speeches made to-night should rightly have been made, I think, in Committee, for they have not dealt with the principles of the Bill. </para>

In the first place, we propose to allow payments to be made during July of each year; and, in the second place, to take power to make regulations to control the purchase, custody, control, and issue of stores. The Departments have been purchasing stores ever since the inception 'of Federation, but because we seek, under this Bill, to improve the control, placing upon ourselves more burdens as administrators, numerous objections have been raised. If the Opposition do not want the stores of the country to be controlled, let them say so. No one would suggest that we should introduce a Bill of a hundred clauses, embodying all that is usually provided for by regulation. Honorable members will find a hundred clauses in regulations of the States governing the custody, control, purchase, and issue of stores. What chance would we have of passing a Bill of so many clauses if we had a repetition of the prolonged debate to which we have listened to-day ? Last session such a Bill would have been passed in an hour. The debate has been unduly prolonged. I shall not take the advice of honorable members opposite, and mutilate the Bill in the way they propose. In view of what we have had to put up with at their hands during the last few days, and the fact that they have been doing their best to prolong the debate, I do not think they have any right to give advice to the Government. . </para>
