Is the Minister prepared to allow the High Commissioner to take such action in the interests of Australian producers? </para>

During the discussion of the Estimates the other evening, when the issue of day labour against contract arose, I quoted from memory a paragraph from a judgment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Heydon; to the effect that in a case that he was determining, it had been demonstrated that the rate at which men were working upon piecework was in some cases twelve times, and in other cases twenty times, as fast as the rate at which they worked under day-labour conditions. In order to justify my statement, I have looked up the judgment. I find that the report of the case is headed, " Twenty times as fast.

                        <para>- I ask the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs whether a statement attributed to him in the public press to-day is correct. It is stated that the name of a certain lady - Miss Annie Irvine - was left off the roll because of an insufficient address. I ask the Minister whether he is aware that on the roll for the Balaclava Division there are the names of Annie Irvine, Hughenden-road, St. Kilda, Christina Irvine, Hughenden-road, St. Kilda, Elsie Isabel Irvine, Hughenden-road, St. Kilda, and Margaret Irvine, Hughenden-road, St. Kilda. Is the Minister further aware that there are only nine houses in Hughenden-road? These being the facts, is the statement which has been publicly made, that Miss Annie Irvine' s address was insufficient, and that, therefore, her name was struck off the roll, correct ? Did the Minister, in making that statement, intend to mislead the public, or was it made negligently? </para>

                    <para>- I can only speak from memory, but I believe that the acceptance of tenders was delayed for two or three months, and that fresh tenders were invited, with the result that a tender for one automatic exchange has been accepted. I shall find out and inform the honorable member later on what the position actually is. </para>

                        <para>- I am sure that there must be some misapprehension. The technical fact is that the agreement was made with the Department of External Affairs, and that the loss upon the working of the railway has to be debited to that Department The Department of Home Affairs, however, has a direct interest in the matter, since the wharf, which is part of the railway property, will be used by it. Naturally, therefore, , the two Departments are looking at what is being done. I think a misunderstanding must have arisen as to something said by my honorable colleague. Perhaps what is meant is that, assuming the agreement was entered into, the expenditure of, I think, £125,000 on rolling-stock to work the line would be unnecessary. There naturally would be no necessity to provide rolling-stock if the working of the line was left to the State. </para>

This Bill is nearly always introduced somewhat late in the financial year, but on this occasion it is later than usual. Until we obtain parliamentary sanction for new appropriations, we cannot proceed with the works for which the money is needed. </para>

                            <para>- The change of Government is the principal reason for the delay that has occurred. Four months of the financial year have now passed. In the interests of the labour market alone, the works that are provided for in the Bill should be commenced as early as possible, and it will be of advantage to the whole community to have them commenced. They are. all necessary works for which the people are crying out, and the longer the passing of the Bill is delayed, the less time will remain for the expenditure of the money within the financial year. The Senate is now sitting, and, I believe, is ready to deal with the Bill promptly. I therefore ask honorable members to assist me in getting the Bill transmitted to the other Chamber as soon as possible. </para>

                        <para>.- I agree with the Treasurer that it is important and desirable that the Bill should be passed as soon as possible, but I do not agree with him as to the reasons for the delay in its introduction. The preparation of the Estimates was well advanced before the right honorable gentleman took office, and he has always boasted nf his ability to facilitate the production of a Budget. On this occasion his promises have been better than his fulfilment, which is not quite unusual with him. When he was in Opposition we heard a great deal about the delay of the last Administration in bringing forward the Budget, although no one knew better than he that it is almost impossible to get the accounts necessary to enable the Treasurer to present them as they should be presented, within a month or two after the end of the financial year. </para>

                            <para>- The Treasurer and every other member should know the reason. When he was last in office, the Departments had practically nothing to do. The development of Commonwealth enterprise has occurred within the last three years. It is assumed that the Commonwealth Government began its national career with the inauguration of Federation, but that is not so. For some years' it was merely an agency for the collection of revenue, and its distribution among the States. It was only after 1910 that the Commonwealth began to undertake national works, and to study national interests. Therefore, it was during the <inline font-style="italic">regime</inline> of the late Government that the difficulty of organizing a Department for spending money to bring public works up to date, and to deal in a national way with national matters, arose. When accounts were not brought before Parliament until a month or two of the financial year had elapsed, those who were then in Opposition were very pleased. They did not confine their criticism of us to speeches in Parliament, but went into the country, and in every way convenient to themselves misrepresented, for political purposes, the delay that had occurred, attributing it to negligence, saying that it was wilful, and in some cases suggesting corruption. </para>

In 1912-13, under the previous Government, the administrative staff on Cockatoo Island was 21, and the expenditure on this staff was £6,416, including £415 for 1 officer-in-charge at Newcastle. Under the Cook Government Estimates for 1913-14, the establishment is raised from 21 to 45, and the expenditure on the staff from £6,416 to £14,006. </para>

                            <para>- We have gathered from the Estimates, as best we could, the total administrative staffs on the two islands, and the expenditure on those  staffs.  When I have finished, I shall hand the honorable member the document from which I am quoting. It shows that, so far from there being an excessive expenditure by the previous Government, the present Government have doubled the staff, and doubled the administrative expenditure, since they have been in office. </para>

                            <para>- Those who were in the  last  Parliament can well remember when tha then honorable member for Mernda and. other financial geniuses, like the honorable member for Richmond, discovered in the Auditor-General's report what they considered was an error or blunder on my part as Treasurer, though it was the Auditor-General who had made the mistake; bub, instead of showing ordinary courtesy, such as honorable members show to each other, they were roving about for a week saying, with the greatest confidence and jubilation, " We will let you know what we have got." Then when they ultimately came down and shot their bolt, without giving the Treasury the slightest hint of what they had, and without my knowing anything about what it was, I said that the accounts were correct so far as the Australian notes reserve was concerned, making the statement without seeing a public officer; and the Auditor-General afterwards had to admit that it was an error of his. own. </para>

I mention this for a reason. Many candidates standing for election, and many newspapers, instead of recognising that the Auditor-General had over and over again apologized for the error, presented the case to the public as it was given to the House by the late honorable member for Mernda, and did not mention that it was a mistake on the part of the Auditor-General, and not on the part of the Treasurer. </para>

                            <para>- If there is anything in it' I hope the honorable member will raise the question. I challenge the Government to do so. The Prime Minister insinuates that- he knows something. I say, " Let him come - come early and come often." The figures in regard to Garden Island are even more interesting than those relating: to Cockatoo Island. Under the Imperial Government the staff in 1912-13 was - Victualling and clothing, 6, costing £2,418; shipbuilding, repairs, &amp;c, 29, costing £8,925 ; naval armament, 5, costing £1,568; total administrative staff, 40; total expenditure on administrative staff, £12,911. The Estimates for 1913- 14 show that under the present Government the Garden Island staff for the Naval Depot and dockyard, naval ordnance and victualling, totals 71, and that the expenditure on this administrative staff is £15,311. These figures show an increase in the year nf from 40 to 71 in staff, and from £12,911 to £15,311 in expenditure. I have good reason for holding the opinion that both these establishments are overmanned in regard to the administrative staff. </para>

                            <para>- I hesitate about cutting down a matter dealing with defence. No one knows better than the honorable member for Eden-Monaro that if there is an increase of highly-paid officers in the administrative staff to that extent, the Treasurer would be the first to challenge it, and know the -reason of it, and that the Minister of Home Affairs, and the Minister of Defence particularly, should have the full details ready to give to Parliament. It is not the business of an Opposition to be constantly asking for details of new expenditure. The Minister in charge, when introducing a new policy or proposing an increase of expenditure on the .administrative staff, should make an explanation without being asked to do so. But when the Treasurer is interrogated regarding this matter, he says that he has no information to give. </para>

                            <para>- I hold that the late Government kept down the expenditure in a careful and business-like way, whereas, in these cases, as the honorable member for South Sydney interjected a few minutes ago, , the expenditure has been increased by our successors by 100 . per cent. There is, probably, underlying these proposals by the Government a policy which, I think, is not an Australian one. There is in these Estimates evidence that would lead one reasonably to the conclusion that an attempt is being made by subterfuge to set aside the Henderson scheme of naval defence by concentrating the whole staff in and about Sydney. </para>

                            <para>- This is an Australian question, and the citizens of New South Wales are Australian people. Look for a moment at the magnitude of the expenditure on the higher-paid administrative officers. Expenditure has been lavished on one centre, while outposts, where works which are necessary to the defence of Australia should be carried out, are being absolutely neglected. I recognise that Sydney must be, for all time, the centre of naval defence for Australia; but Admiral Henderson said that, in addition to the establishment of a Naval Base there, a first class Naval Base must be provided on the Western Australian coast for the protection of Australia. The policy of this Government is, apparently, to abandon everything in the West, and to go in for a "policy of concentration in the East. </para>

                            <para>- That would be an occasion for merriment on the part of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. Perhaps the right honorable member will allow me, however, to finish one sentence without an interruption. If the Prime Minister were subjected to half the interruptions to which I have had to submit, he would say, " Am I not to be heard?" I would remind honorable members that in Sydney, although an investigation, we are told, is to be made, this expenditure is being doubled, whereas other proposed works, in Western Australia more particularly, have been stopped pending investigation and report by an expert. The works- in several other parts of Australia have been practically held up; but, so far as Sydney is concerned, money is placed on the Estimates to provide for them. Our ships will be concentrated there, and will be victualled and repaired - and effectively victualled and repaired - no doubt, at Sydney. I am not complaining of this. Sydney, by reason of its geographical position and its waterways, should be given everything that it can legitimately claim, but I object to parochial interests swaying the determination of the Government upon the national question of defence, more especially when such interests come into conflict with the scheme adopted by both parties as a national one. </para>

                            <para>- Expert members of the firm of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Coode and Company have reported on the very waterways which are now to be reported upon by a member of that firm at the instance of the present Government. Other experts have also dealt with the matter. The late Government appointed experts to take borings and soundings at the proposed sub-Naval Base in Western Australia, and the reports of those experts have been absolutely borne out. I am not in a position to give details to the Treasurer, and it is not necessary that I should do so at this stage. The Estimates indicate that there is only one place in Australia to which full consideration is given at the present time; and, although that place is an important centre, it is not entitled to the concentration of the Fleet Unit. </para>

                            <para>- The Estimates provide for wharfage, and the victualling and equipment of the vessels, and, what is equally essential, the means by which the ships shall be enabled to come into port to make them useful at all. According to the published statement of the Minister of Defence, it has been left to the Admiral of the Fleet to take the ships where he pleases, and do with them what he pleases. If that is the policy of the Government, it ought to have been stated here by the Prime Minister. If the Naval Board or the Government have not the power to send the vessels where they please, and to send stores where they may be picked up, how will the Naval Board be able to know what the Admiral is going to do with the ships, or where he is going to satisfy his requirements ? Unless the power is in the hands of the Government, working through the Naval Board, there will be two authorities, and the authority that will have control of the Fleet, will be outside the ambit of the Government and Parliament. This is the Government who say they are the authors of an Australian owned, manned, and controlled Fleet. </para>

                            <para>- Responsible government ! Having had the pleasure of meeting the Admiral, and of speaking to other Admirals regarding his ability and capacity, my opinion is that the Admiral will not accept any such responsibility, and, if he declines, he will be a wise man. We have it announced as their policy that the Government are going to shift the responsibility for the management of the Fleet on to the shoulders of the Admiral; and, if anything should go wrong, I would say, from what I know of the Government, that they will not hesitate to shake themselves clear of that responsibility. Such an attitude is absolutely wrong, false in principle, and dangerous to the control of the Unit; and I hope the Prime Minister will take the earliest opportunity to dissociate himself and his Government from this statement by the Minister of Defence. </para>

                            <para>- We are working under a form of responsible government, and if Ministers give to His Majesty's representative advice which may betray the Commonwealth, they must take the responsibility. We have to attack the Government, because the Admiral is under their direct authority, and must take his orders from them; it is the Government who have to. make the explanation. The reported statement of the Minister of Defence is subversive of the principle of responsible government, and ought to be corrected by the head of the Government without delay, because, if that is the policy, we shall not have an Australian owned, manned, and controlled Fleet. We shall not know where the Fleet will be taken, or what will be done with it; we shall only have the assurance that the distinguished sailor who has been sent out to command our Fleet will do his best in the interests of His Majesty and of the Commonwealth. That does not in any way, however, minimize the blundering stupidity of the statement made in regard to policy. The two matters to which I have referred are of the first order. The one is the handing over the control of the Fleet to the Admiral without Governmental responsibility, and the other the excessive expenditure and concentration of the Fleet in one portion of the Commonwealth, with tacit neglect and delay in carrying out the scheme of Admiral Henderson in other portions of the Commonwealth; and there should be an immediate explanation. </para>

I shall begin where the right honorable gentleman began, namely, with the Auditor-General. I have made several statements on this matter, and I desire to give my authority for making them. My first statement was that, during the three years of the right honorable gentleman's Administration, we never could get the Auditor-General's report on the table in time to be of the slightest use to Parliament. The dates are sufficient to establish the truth of "that statement. </para>

                            <para>-It is not; the House has not adjourned yet. In two of those years the report was not presented to this House, but was published in the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Gazette,</inline> because the House had risen, and at a time when the House was almost ready to meet again. In one case the report was presented in March of the following year, and in the other case in April. In the third year, we pressed the right honorable member for an earlier delivery of the statement; and I say that he tried to mislead the House concerning his attitude to the Auditor-General. </para>

                            <para>- Even if it meant a great deal more expense, it would be a good thing if the Auditor-General's report were in the hands of honorable members in mid-session, say, about September. That is what we ought to aim at ; but no one knows better than the honorable member for Parramatta that the adjustment of the postal accounts, owing to the transition, has rendered it difficult for the report to be submitted earlier during the past two . or three years. </para>

                            <para>- I have never made that charge, and have, therefore, nothing to answer in regard to it. Concerning the docks, what we have complained of is that, in taking over the Fitzroy Dock, the right honorable member was guilty of a breach of good faith towards the House. He told the honorable member for Dalley, and he also told me, that the matter would be submitted to the House before a decision was arrived at. He told us that within two or three days of the prorogation. Almost immediately afterwards he ignored his promise, and completed the arrangements for taking over the dock, thus incurring a liability of £850,000 without consulting Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- The reply is very simple, and it is to this effect: that the taking over of the Fitzroy Dock involved the taking over of the State officials who were employed there. It was about that matter that the honorable member for Dalley was most concerned. These officials have been taken into the employment of the Commonwealth. Is that an extravagance ? If so, it is an extravagance that was recommended and determined on by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline></para>

                            <para>- Yes. If there is extravagance and overmanning, and if that fact supports the suspicion that an un-Australian policy is being pursued, it is the responsibility of my right honorable friend and his colleagues, not ours. With regard to Garden Island, the same explanation applies. We have not appointed the officials there on our own initiative; we have merely honoured the obligations of our predecessors. That seems to be our fault. In this case we have taken over Imperial officers. The staffing of Garden Island is exactly what was proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> If charges of this kind are to continue to be made, we- shall have to repudiate everything done by our predecessors, and go on our own. Then, perhaps, we shall escape the criticism of the Leader of the Opposition. We took over the officers recommended by his Administration. So far as I know, we have appointed none on our own initiative. </para>

                            <para>- There is no doubt as to it. Is it not time for honorable members to stop this sort of drivelling? They are on the horns of a dilemma with the leader of the last Government denouncing his own administration. They should take their gruelling, and make the best farce they can. It is not our trouble; it is theirs; it is their policy, and their determination, and their shaping. All we have done is to try to carry but what was left for us by our predecessors in the spirit now promulgated from the house-tops,that in this matter of defence there should be no party. </para>

So far as I understand, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has said that he will consult Admiral Patey in all matters relating to the efficiency of the Navy and its control in Australian waters - the disposition of the Fleet and its governance. What else could he do? Is the Minister going to direct the Admiral what to do, and where to go to train his men, and as to what training the men shall get? That is all fixed in the Naval Act ; it is the law of the land which Admiral Patey will have to observe. Whatever policy has been laid down will be faithfully adhered to. Of course, the final responsibility rests on the civil authorities. </para>

                            <para>- I shall be glad if the honorable member will do so, so that we can put the matter right. Of course, the Navy and the Army must be under the control of the Government of the day. That should go without saying in connexion with a responsible Parliament. For what reason have we secured the services of Admiral Patey, if not to consult him and take advantage of his expert knowledge, which we, as laymen, do not possess? He is here to take the responsibility for the training of the men and the manipulating of the ships, in order to put them in the best possible position to defend Australia, and, if necessary, to take their share in Imperial defence. </para>

                            had an interview with Rear Admiral Patey on Saturday, and it is understood that this subject was discussed. The programme as drawn up by the Admiral provided that the fleet should proceed to Port Lincoln about the middle of November (when the leave of the men will have expired), and afterwards to Hobart. As, however, Melbourne will be passed on the way to Port Lincoln, it is believed that the Admiral has had under consideration an alteration of the programme so as to include a brief visit to Melbourne.

                            <para>- I think we can discuss grievances on this Bill, and it is one of my grievances that the Prime Minister gets so angry when he is given a little dose of the medicine he used to administer from this side. The attitude I take up on the question of naval expenditure in the Bill before us is my personal attitude. I take the greatest possible exception to the policy adopted by the Treasurer. I look in vain in this Supply Bill for certain expenditure. The former Government laid down the policy of avoiding borrowing for the purpose of furnishing services, and I look in vain in this Supply Bill for items : such as the purchase of land for defence purposes, the construction of conduits for laying wires underground, the erection of London offices, and expenditure in connexion with the Northern Territory on the construction of the railway from Pine Creek to the Katherine River. In view of the fact that we took over the Northern Territory for defence purposes, I expected to find that the £400,000 for this railway would appear in the revenue Estimates, seeing that the money should be spent out of the revenue we shall receive. I think that the sum of £1,400,000 for the construction of the railway from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta should also find a place in the works to be paid for out of revenue. </para>

                            <para>- The former Government took up the position that we should pay for defence out of revenue, and I take up the attitude that a railway such as the Kalgoorlie-Port Augusta line, which is to be built for defence purposes mainly, and which cannot pay for years, should be built out of revenue. The Treasurer has an ingenious system of finance, for which he should take out a patent. He proposes to spend money for defence out of revenue, but he will borrow for the items I have mentioned, for the construction of works, to furnish the money to pay for them. I take strong exception to that method, and I take great exception to the money that he proposes to spend ondefence. </para>

                    <para>There are vast increases on the amounts proposed by the former Government, and I ask what reply have honorable members on the Ministerial side to a leaflet circulated by the Queensland People's Progressive League, otherwise the Liberal League ? This circular is headed "Labour Socialistic Extravagance," "The Fisher Government cannot pay its way," and it includes - </para>

                    <para>The sober finance we are obtaining from honorable members opposite, whose organization, no doubt, paid for the printing of these leaflets, is a proposal to expend on defence, this year, £5,746,853, as compared with an expenditure of £4,079,590 in 1911-12, and £4,331,498 in 1912-13. In 1912-13, according to the Treasurer, £166,600 was expended in respect of the naval subsidy, and that item does not appear in the figures for this year. The increase in the estimated defence expenditure this year, as compared with that of last year, is £1,415,355. </para>
                    <para>I propose to prove that we are going too fast, particularly in the matter of naval expenditure. Certain people take the view that the awakening of China is fraught with danger to Australia, and that we are also in danger from Japan. I believe, however, that we have no reason to anticipate danger from Japan. In the first place that country, I read, is overburdened with debt. Authorities tell us that an attacking force must be five times as strong as a defending force. That was about the position in the case of the South African War. The Boer forces consisted of about 50,000 soldiers, and Great Britain had to send out 250,000 to defeat them. That war cost the Old Country £211,000,000. Is Japan in a position to send an attacking force of 250,000 men to Australia, or to find £211,000,000 to provide for the cost of an Australian invasion ? </para>
                    <para>Then, again, I would ask whether it is likely that the civilized races of the earth would allow Japan to take hold of Australia. Have not Germany, France, and the United States of America, as well as Great Britain and other nations, interests in Australia which they would hasten to protect the moment they were threatened ? I propose to show why we have no right to incur this large expenditure in respect of naval defence. Capitalists - most of them in London - consisting not only of Anglo-Saxons and Celts, but of people of all nationalities who have settled in England, have interests in Australia, as well as in other parts of the world, and they should be called upon to pay the money necessary to maintain the Navy if they want it. </para>
                    <para>We have no right to call upon the people of Australia to meet an annual defence expenditure amounting to 23s. 6d. per head of the population, or, estimating four persons to a family, £414s. per family per annum. In these days, when the cost of living is extremely high, is it right that we should impose such taxation ? I ask honorable members opposite to consider how their action in supporting this expenditure corresponds with their declaration during the election campaign that, if returned, they would reduce the cost of living. They certainly will not reduce it by imposing, in respect of defence, taxation amounting to £414s. per annum per family. The following table shows how defence expenditure has increased in Australia during the last twelve years: - </para>

                    <para>Our defence expenditure per head of the population during the last twelve years has increased from 4s. 6d. to 23s. 6d. per annum. No Government has a right to impose such a burden on a people so far removed as we are from the centres of militarism, and unlikely to come into conflict with any nation for many years. I have another table which shows that we are spending upon defence more per head of our population than are many European countries, which may reasonably expect attack at any moment. The figures are as follow : - </para>

We spend 10s. per head more than does Spain, three times as much per head as Austria-Hungary, more than three times as much per head as does Russia, many shillings per head more than do Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Holland, and five times as much per head as does Japan. And we are asked to pay this money because London capitalists, who have investments in all parts of the world, desire that a big navy should be maintained, to protect their interests, as they believe, and wish that part of the burden shall be passed on to the people of Australia on the ground that we ought to do something for the Empire. I have already mentioned what the pioneers of Australia have done for the Empire. I am referring to those who settled here in the early days, and not to those of whom it was written - </para>

The capitalists of London, arid other great cities, have got the major portion of the world absolutely deluded. In their opinion it is necessary to have a huge Navy in order to protect their large investments of money abroad. We remember a few years ago, when Venezuela proposed to repudiate her public debt, Great Britain and Germany combined to enforce payment; but I believe the United States Government, under the Monroe doctrine, interfered, and the matter was settled without going to war. </para>

What do they care for the 21,000 families at present having but one room apiece in the city of Dublin?

Those figures were given in a very interesting paper read by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. George</inline> Paish before the Royal Statistical Society, with Lord George Hamilton in the chair, on 20th December, 1910; and the sum is enormous, the grand total being no less than £3,191,000,000. The figures are as follow : - </para>

                    <para>Capitalists talk about patriotism, but they expect it to be all on the one side. They have no patriotism whatever; they are internationalists, and invest their money where they can get the biggest rate of interest. They are gulling the_ people of the various nations into the belief tha,t they ought to be patriotic, and the people are bled all the time. The figures continue - </para>

                    <para class="block">We see that £53,705,000 has been lent to Japan by capitalists, some of whom are the rulers of England. Japan is supposed to be a possible enemy of the Old Country; and yet British capitalists have lent her money to be used in some cases in building warships. It is rather singular that while the British capitalists lend Japan money to build warships, those warships are built- in England. What a monstrous state of affairs ! </para>
                    <para>Are the people of Australia to be gulled for all time by army and navy contractors, and other people interested in creating the idea that there is likely to be war? A recent1 number of the <inline font-style="italic">Socialist Review</inline> contains an article about the great Krupp works in Germany, which turn out huge guns and all the munitions of war, and in which some of the Royal family of the country are interested. It is said that quite a number of important officers in the Army and Navy are interested in that concern; further, it is said that some of the rulers of England are interested in the various ammunition works and war-shipbuilding firms in the Old Country. It was mentioned the other day by the editor of the <inline font-style="italic">Economist</inline> .that war scares are got up by army and navy contractors. It is declared, for instance, that Germany is building two ships, and that, therefore, Great Britain must build four; and the two-keels-to-one policy was held until quite recently, when a ten to sixteen standard was agreed to. </para>
                    <para>It is true that Germany agreed to this standard, ' but I have an idea that she was willing to do so because she has in her mind another method of warfare altogether, as represented by dirigible balloons and airships. The moment there is any diminution in the amount of money England is spending in war material, the managers of these great concerns raise a scare; they have letters written to the newspapers pointing out the danger there is from Germany, while, of course, at the same time, those similarly interested in Germany talk about danger from Great Britain. The people of the world, generally speaking, have got to bear the huge burden of taxation that this policy entails. It is wrong; and I hope that the Labour party will do their best to prevent this growing expenditure on the Navy. No doubt the capitalists in London have their Mafeking nights when trouble is on, and display flags and medals, some of the latter, no doubt, like that shown by the honorable member for </para>

                        Paish's  paper, before referred to, shows that British capitalists are investing in countries outside the Empire almost pound for pound of their investments within the Empire. They know no country; and we ought to be alive to their schemes. If the people in Great Britain had votes as we have, I do not believe that her rulers, prompted by the capitalists, would be permitted to continue their present ways. Is it right that we in this country, who are, generally speaking, a hard-working community, should pay 23s. 6d. per head, or five times as much as is paid in Japan, on defence? The Labour Government spent some £4,000,000 on -defence, but I believe our party would have altered the policy of spending money on warships, which -will be obsolete in ten, or at the most twenty, years. Our policy, as outlined by the present Leader of the Opposition, provided for a line of Commonwealth steam-ships.

                        <para>My reason for saying that the Commonwealth will never be able to do any. good until it establishes a Commonwealth line of steamers is this : We bring all our produce down to the seaboard by train ; it is dumped down at the seaboard, and we are left entirely at the mercy of the shipping ring afterwards, no mutter what it is we are sending away. I gave evidence before the Butter Commission and emphasized that point very strongly, and I have not changed my mind since. I feel certain that the only solution of the difficulty is a Commonwealth line of steamers, and I say if we can run our railways we ' can run a line of steamers. By that means we can carry our mails, our passengers, and our perishable products, and at the same time train young Australians in navigation and sea life. I do not care what Government is in power. In this regard we shall not do any good until the Commonwealth Government has the power to establish a line of steamers of its own. </para>

If honorable members will refer to the reviews, they will see what is being done elsewhere in this matter. I had the good fortune to witness, at Hendon, in the Old Country, a most remarkable performance by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Graham</inline> White, showing what could be done in the way of dropping bombs within a given space. The outline of the deck of a warship was marked on a lawn, and the aviator from his aeroplane dropped bags of sand on to this space, going very close to what was equivalent to a bull's eye. Of course, these bags were not dropped from a very great height, but, since then, in the war in Tripoli, and in the Balkans, aerial vessels have been successfully used for the dropping of bombs, and will play an important part in all future wars. I have here an article on the subject, written by two experts, which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Review of Reviews</inline> for April, 1913. It is headed- "The Next War in the Air," the writers being T. R.  Macmechen  and Carl  Dienstbach.  They say - </para>

The problems of the next war will be greatly multiplied if the Powers engaging: in it are fairly matched in the air. If they are not, the war will be over before it is well begun. </para>
                        <para>No nation without an air navy can hope for success against an enemy with powerful fleets of dreadnought airships and of cruisers and torpedo craft in the form of aeroplanes, having a speed of So, 90, and even 100 miles an hour, because it will find it impossible to mobilize its army. </para>
                        <para>It is too much to expect of men that they will stand helpless while death and destruction is rained down upon them' from an impregnable fortress floating in the air. Any sea navy which the otherwise unprepared Power may have will be all but useless. Only a few hours will be required for airships to make a desperate attack upon any naval base. Weather, unless desperately bad, will not hinder the attack, for the reason that the modern airship is now sufficiently powerful to make detours and come with the wind to the point of naval mobilization. </para>
                        <para>England has been quick to recognise the threatened danger. The new British cruisers are to bc fitted with heavily-armoured and curved upper decks, and with steel .umbrella-like coverings for funnels. The cruisers will also carry guns that can be elevated to an angle of 80 degrees, and that will have an effective range of 9,000 yards. At a distance of 4^ miles one of these guns can send a 31-lb. shrapnel shell to  a  height of 13,000 feet. Thus the men in the hostile airships and aeroplanes will find the air filled with danger to themselves. . . . </para>
                        <para>While France long placed its main reliance in the aeroplane, it now realizes that the greatest danger will not come from that quarter. France has recognised that aerial war will be a naval war in the air, and is lending full encouragement to the airship. By the end of the year 1913 fourteen semi-rigid dirigibles, as large as the earlier Zeppelins, will be in the service in connexion with the French army. There is now in construction in a factory near Paris, a war airship of the Zeppelin type. The French aerial war budget for 1911 was £250,000; for 1912 it was £800,00; and for 1913 it is estimated at £1,700,000. « </para>

Four Zeppelin-built giant air Dreadnoughts, armed and munitioned as if war were a thing of to-day, keep almost constantly in the air, training their crews in the science of navigation, and also in markmanship The naval Z. is stationed at Wilhelmshaven, om the North Sea; the ZI. is at Koenigsberg, on the Russian frontier; the ZIII. is at Metz; and the ZII. is at Cologne - each ready to raid across the French border at a moment's notice. </para>

                    <para>I wish to emphasize the folly of this Government in proposing to spend so much more money on vessels, which, it is admitted on all hands, will be on the scrap heap within ten years. It would be better to spend some of the money on technical education, subsidizing the technical schools in the big cities, and establishing others in the country, for the training of our children. This would enable parents who now have to send their children to work at an early age, to keep them at school a little longer. It is  this extravagant and foolish expenditure that makes it necessary for working people to send out their boys and girls at a tender age. when they should still be at school, being educated to equip them for the battle of life. It makes one's heart bleed to see the little fellows that now have to go out to help to fill the family purse. This child labour is rendered necessary, because of the enormous expenditure on defence. </para>

                        <para>There are too many newspapers and schools in present-day civilization to allow the antiquated methods of over-ambitious men hiding their selfish aims behind a loud cry for the glory of their country to force ruin on the people. Anyhow, the war game has been spoiled for good by the perfection of the aeroplane. I have been told that the fact that France was able to enrol 1,200 airmen in one day for the aeroplane branch of the army has tempered in no mean way the position taken by Emperor William in the Moroccan situation. Think of the effect of a fleet of a thousand aeroplanes ! And they can get 5,000 of these aeroplanes for the cost of one <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought.</inline> All the great destructive  possibilities  of the aeroplane are  dwarfed  by the moral effect on the population, the fear of indiscriminate annihilation. </para>

                        <para>Aerial navigation will end war. Universal peace will be assured as soon as it is realized that the airship which carries a man could carry 150 lbs. of nitro-glycerine just as well, and 30,000 airships thus equipped could annihilate the assembled navies of the world. No sharpshooting, however efficient, would be proof against such an attack. With the passing of poverty, disease, and war, the cause of intellectual advancement will receive an impetus which will carry everything before it. The man of the future will be an intellectual giant. Human passions and failings can hardly be eradicated entirely, but they will be better controlled. Physically and morally, science will make the world over. And the best part of this great triumph will be witnessed, I believe, within he next fifty years. </para>

Some of them' have no idea of what authority is, or of how it should be exercised. They treat the boys as so much dirt.

I hope the day will ' never come when the Australian citizen will have to bow his head before authority, as has to be done in some parts of the world under military systems. Why should not the boys be treated courteously and addressed in a proper manner ? If the officer commands respect from the boy, why should not the boy receive respect from the officer? The boy is compelled to salute the officer. </para>

I also think that the employers should pay the boys. There should be no deduction from the lads' pay for the time they spend in drilling for the safety of the country. I shall vote against this increased expenditure on naval defence wherever I can. I take a risk in doing so. I am not saying that boastfully, but there is a certain risk. The powerful daily press in this country have worked up a feeling of so-called loyalty to the Empire. </para>

                            <para>- Order ! I am very sorry, indeed, that we should engage in proceedings which are of a most unseemly character, and which certainly do nob reflect credit on the dignity of the House or the reputation of honorable members. It is very difficult for the  Speaker  to preserve order and carry out the Standing Orders of the House, which I would remind honorable members are not his Standing Orders, unless he has the sympathetic co-operation of honorable members on both sides of the House. Without the support of honorable members, the  Speaker  is absolutely powerless. In carrying out the orders of the House, he is only doing his duty. There is no personal feeling whatever, so far as he is concerned, and he has a right to expect from honorable members every support in his effort to carry out the practice and rules of the House. The honorable member for North Sydney must know that it is distinctly contrary to the Standing Orders and the practice of Parliament to persist in refusing to withdraw and apologize when called upon by the Chair, after having used offensive language to another honorable member, and I appeal to him to reconsider the matter. </para>

                            <para>- I can only say that the action of the Government in regard to these Estimates, from beginning to end, is quite sufficient to excite any member in his desire to obtain that information which is necessary to guide him as to the vote he must give. This is the Government who professed to be a Government of economy, and who were going to introduce a new era of what they call true representative government. The Government and their supporters obtained their present position by telling the people they were going, not on the lines of the Labour party, but on lines which they have mapped out for themselves, and which would prove to the country that they were able to restore economical and representative government. How are they doing it? Look at the increase of expenditure now proposed. Well might the honorable member for Capricornia refer to them in the terms in which he did - terms which, to my mind, were not too extravagant. The Government and their supporters raved about the reckless expenditure of the Labour party; and yet, in their first year of office, they increase the expenditure by an amount bordering on £5,000,000, and do things for which they would have denounced the Labour party from the .housetops. This afternoon the Prime Minister, I believe, alleged that the late Minister of Defence was responsible for the large number of additional appointments at Garden Island and Cockatoo Island. That statement is not in accordance with fact. The late Minister of Defence did not indorse the proposal to increase the staff from forty to seventy on Garden Island, nor did he indorse the increase of expenditure from nearly £5,000 to nearly £14,000, as in one year the present Government have done. The Naval Board submitted those names to the late Minister of Defence, but, like a wise man, he refused to make the appointments, on the ground that it would be more advisable to wait the appointment of a general manager at Cockatoo Island before selecting the staff. No Government, who were careful of the interests of the people, would ever dream of adding to the list of employes in such a way when the appointment of a manager was in contemplation. Surely the first step is to appoint the manager, who is to be responsible for the work, and then allow him to select his own staff ? But the present Government have put the cart before the horse, and appointed a number of officers who may prove to be of the greatest trouble to whoever may become manager. With all deference to the rules of the House, the action of the Government is not contrary to the language in which the honorable member for Capricornia stigmatized it before dinner. The Prime Minister stood on the floor of the House, and charged the late Minister of Defence with something that he never did, and which the Prime Minister, and. the present Minister of Defence, must know he never did. To come here and say what is not true- </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member has repeated his offence, and forces me to take a course of action which 1 have already said is most repugnant to me; but, if he persists, I have, under the Standing Orders, no option. I give him a further opportunity, and hope that, after reflection, he will withdraw the statement that lie made. Sometimes things are said in the heat of the moment, when feeling runs high, which the good sense of the member offending induces him to retract. We are not school children, but men legislating in the interests of the country, and we should, at least, prove our capability to observe and abide by our own rules of debate and conduct in the House. I trust that the appeal that I make to the honorable member will not fall on deaf ears. Does the honorable member withdraw his statement? </para>

                        between my case and that of the honorable members for Capricornia and "Gwydir? The honorable member for Capricornia made use of an expression which, I think, was very much stronger than that which I used, and I believe that his offence was greater than mine. He was called upon to withdraw what he said, and we know the result. Likewise, the honorable member for Gwydir was called upon to withdraw his statement. But I was asked, not merely to withdraw what I said, but also to apologize to the House. I wish to know why I was treated differently from two other honorable members who had offended' similarly. They were not called upon to apologize, but I was.

That is generally understood. The honorable member for Capricornia persisted in defying the authority of the Chair, and left me no other course than to name him. The honorable member for. North Sydney eventually conformed to the direction of the Chair. </para>

                        <para>,- I hope that in what I am about to say, I shall not bring myself into conflict with the rules of the House, nor with you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline> The honorable member for Capricornia was most profuse and most interesting in the matter that he placed before the Chamber, but I cannot follow the lines that he followed ; and, while I claim that there is no better party man in the House than myself, I am, in regard to the matter on which I wish to speak, somewhat at variance with my leader, the right honorable member for Wide Bay. It has been said that with me Cockatoo Island Dock is what King Charles' head was to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dick;</inline> that I cannot keep it out of my speeches; but when expenditure involving large sums is concerned, those who know most about it should express their views in such terms as they can, even though they may seem to go beyond what some other honorable members may regard as reasonable limits. I say at once that I care not where the fault lies, whether with the last or with the present Administration, extravagance is, to my personal knowledge, occurring in connexion with the administration of the Fitzroy Dock. The sum of £40,000 is provided for the administration of that establishment. Now, I visit the dock, often, and when I go there I see almost as many managers and foremen as workmen. This is a development of the past two and a half years. It is astonishing to me to see how money is being spent in. paying men who seem to do little or nothing. The majority of these persons are not those who have been associated with* the establishment for years, but are newcomers. What their abilities and qualifications are God only knows; I do not. They are "there, and the men who have been connected with the establishment for years are being slowly displaced. The general manager is, of course, necessary,, and if the Government can keep the gentleman who is there at the present time, it will be a good thing for the Commonwealth. I refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cutler,</inline> who is now acting as manager. Evidently the Government have not yet been able to get a more able man for the position. Speaking from personal knowledge of, and association with, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cutler,</inline> I say that no more energetic and capable engineer than he was ever on CockatooIsland. He made the place. </para>

                            <para>- That is what I wish to know. For lack of a decision on the part of the last Administration, and of this, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cutler,</inline> a man of unquestionable ability, has been kept in suspense, not knowing what will happen to him. The result is that the development of this establishment, which is one of the principal, parts of our defence scheme, is being kept back, because no one knows what is to happen in connexion with the administration of the place. Surely that shows, the existence of something rotten <inline font-style="italic">ia</inline> the state of Denmark. It is about time some Minister applied himself in an effective way to making a statement in connexion with this establishment. You are crying out for defence, and right in the centre of the defence system here is this matter of maladministration, this failure to frame any definite scheme to deal with the subject. I find provision on the Estimates for a shipyard manager. That -may be necessary, but I question it very much. I do not know why a shipyard manager should be there. I see a dockyard master provided for, and a constructor overseer. As a matter of fact, the one mau who takes on the duty of constructor overseer should really be the shipyard manager, and thus we have nearly £1,500 spent annually to duplicate work which should be done by one man. This seems very wrong. I say not one word against the gentlemen who are holding these positions, but I really cannot understand how the Administration can duplicate positions, and pay this enormous sum of money for work to be done by two persons that really should be done by one. Provision is also made for an engineer overseer with two assistants, and their salaries total over £1,000 for work that has hitherto been done at a much less expenditure. I find that officers who have hitherto per formed all the duties that are now supposed to attach to these overseers are still retained, and yet these additional people are brought in. This seems to me gross extravagance. I think both the present and the last Administration are equally guilty in this regard, and the sooner some reform is effected in  this matter  the better it will be for our Defence Department. The expenditure is creeping up every day. The Government have already stated in their Budget that there must be an increasing expenditure this year, which is more than likely to continue for many years to come. We must be cautious, and safeguard in every possible way the expenditure on defence. I have been always bitterly opposed to the idea of building up a fleet unit in this country, and it was only when I felt that the pressure of the times forced the necessity upon us that I gave my assent to it, but in every possible way I shall raise my voice in this House against extravagant expenditure. I believe that it is taking place in our midst to-day. I feel that there is growing up here that despotism of  navalism  and militarism that always seems in every nation to get possession of the people, and override the general interests of the community in the interests of its own personal desires and requirements, and, shall I say, that frenzy of warfare that seems to come upon it. Today, when we are taking upon ourselves this burden, not only as a young, independent Australian people, but as a part of the Empire, comparatively small in numbers, but yet feeling ourselves to be sharers in the great Imperial ideal, we must take the greatest care not to impose upon the backs of our working classes a burden too hard to bear. Through mistaken efforts on our part, we may make the burden so heavy that the inevitable reaction will come. I desire, when we possibly can, to co-operate with the people of the Old Country, and to see the stock from which we have sprung grow and develop and maintain the position they have gained to-day, but I see dangers ahead if burdens are heaped upon their backs by excessive taxation arising out of extravagant expenditure. There is the greatest need for careful attention to these matters, and for reforms to be made where possible. A day or two ago I asked that certain regulations in regard to military matters should be framed and embodied in book form, so that we, as members of the House, might know precisely where we stood in connexion with our defence system. We do  not  know this today. We have our Defence Acts embodied in such books as are issued to us, but there is not one man in this House who knows what the regulations are, and almost every day every member is challenged with questions by his constituents regarding the treatment of our youths. This is most objectionable. It seems to me that instead of the Minister of Defence controlling his Department, the Department is controlling him. It is issuing regulations without his knowledge, and enforcing upon this country many things that, if tested by the A.ct itself, would, I believe, prove to be illegal. Nevertheless, they are there, and we cannot see them. We get them on little slips of paper; we know nothing at all about the regulations, and, while seeking to build up an <inline font-style="italic">esprit de corps</inline> in our country in defence matters, wo have no means by which we can safeguard our youths, who are becoming the basis of that system, from any wrong-doing that may emanate from the brains of officers who really do not. know themselves what the regulations are. Reforms are very essential in this direction. I put certain questions on the notice-paper quite recently. I will not say what they are, but I will say that there is room for an investigation into our naval service. We are building up our Navy, but, from the information that has come to me, I am very much afraid that at no distant date we shall have to take into careful consideration the interests of the crews, and control the . officers who are upon these vessels. I know that men who are untrained in thought, and who speak, perhaps, with prejudice, feeling that an injury has been done to them which has, perhaps not been done, will sometimes come to a member of the House and put before him statements that may, on investigation, prove to be not as correct as they at first seem. I do not know how information belonging to the House gets into the press before members themselves receive it, but this certainly happens. As late as Friday last I put certain questions on the notice-paper of the House, and by Saturday the matter was in the hands of the press before it was in the hands of members of the House. </para>

                            <para>- The matter was not even before the House, but the press knew all about it. I think that is most undesirable. If matters come before the House, those who should first know the particulars are the members of the House, and no one else. If information is to be given from the Departments in this fashion, we do not know where we shall end. I was very pleased that a particular letter which I have here emphasizes, from a Melbourne point of view, 'the position that I put forward from Sydney. Whether the statements are correct or not I cannot say. I shall wait for the Minister's answer in reply to the question which I have put. At all events, I am pleased that I have something from Melbourne in the nature of corroboration of the statements that reached me in Sydney. </para>

I am glad the opportunity has presented itself, because, since last evening, there has been more information avail able to honorable members in regard to the Defence Estimates. </para>

                            <para>- I quite agree. It is to be regretted that Estimates are often brought down in which a large aggregate sum is voted without our knowing to what the money is to be devoted. Very often members may vote money for one purpose, only to discover afterwards that they were entirely opposed to the object of that expenditure. All honorable members must realize that defence expenditure will go on increasing now that we have established compulsory military training, and a Navy of our own; but, at the same time, it is absolutely necessary for us to see that there is no unnecessary expenditure. What is necessary should be undertaken, but beyond that no money should be spent. The discussion to-day has disclosed that wasteful expenditure is going on. The Prime Minister takes up the position that it is on account of commitments left to him by the previous Administration, but I say that, irrespective of whether that is so or not, it was the duty of the Prime Minister to use the pruning knife if he found any expenditure extravagant. The responsibility is on the Government who bring down Estimates to see that no unnecessary expenditure takes place. I do not claim that the late Minister of Defence was not responsible. Certainly he was not responsible for the additional expenditure provided on these Estimates for Cockatoo Island and Garden Island. </para>

I think it will be admitted that the Commonwealth secured a good bargain in taking over Cockatoo Island. No one appears to take up the position that it is not a good bargain. In fact, Admiral Henderson reported in favour of Cockatoo Island, being in our hands in order to dock warships. </para>

It will be shown clearly from the evidence taken before a tribunal, evidence that cannot be claimed to be partisan, evidence from experts, that these boilers were admirably suited for the purpose for which they were used, and that they had passed all tests. However, I do not wish to enter into that field. There is a Committee dealing with these boilers, and the whole matter is <inline font-style="italic">sub judice.</inline> While Admiral Henderson approved of Cockatoo Island Dock being taken over by the Commonwealth, he also disapproved of the Commonwealth, when that time arrived, still continuing to spend large sums of money on Garden Island. Admiral Henderson has been the guide for both sides of the House in regard to the Navy, and that being so, surely there should be some explanation as to why the expenditure in regard to Garden Island is being increased, notwithstanding the fact that we have acquired Cockatoo Island. </para>

It is as well to quote Admiral Henderson's report, and have it on record, because, last evening, the Prime Minister said that the report was not against additional expenditure on Garden Island. Admiral Henderson says, in paragraph 29 of his report - </para>

It is considered that this number of ranks and ratings should be retained in their existing positions until such time as the Dockyard Establishment at Cockatoo Island is taken over by the Commonwealth as a naval dockyard, when a revision of the complement will be necessary. It is considered that it should then be practicable to reduce the complement of Garden island to a very small number. </para>

                    <para>He points out clearly that Garden Island was being utilized by the Imperial Government for the purpose of making minor repairs to warships in these waters, and his recommendation that the Commonwealth should take over Cockatoo Island Dock was for the purpose of having a more effective dock to deal with the big warships coming .here. He says that immediately the Commonwealth secured control of Cockatoo Island there should be a reduction of the staff on Garden  Island  Otherwise it must mean duplicating the work, having two docks to do the same work. Though Cockatoo Island is quite sufficient for all requirements, we are apparently to continue expenditure on Garden Island. Last year we had forty salaried men on Garden Island, but the number has been increased this year to seventy-one, making an additional thirty-one salaried men to be paid out of this year's Estimates, notwithstanding that we also have Cockatoo Island Dock. </para>

                            <para>- In view of the statements made from time to time by honorable members on the Ministerial side, how do they reconcile this large increase of officers on Garden Island after we have taken over the Cockatoo Island Dock? Certain figures were given this afternoon by the Leader of the Opposition. Last year the expenditure on Garden Island was: - Victualling and clothing, £2,418; ship-building, repairs, &amp;c., £8,925; and naval armaments, £1,568; making a total of £12,911, which was spent last year, when we did not have Cockatoo Island Dock. </para>

                            <para>- I endeavoured to get this information last evening on the Estimates, but I could not. I had to get the figures myself. This year we are to spend £15,311 on Garden Island, while we have increased the number of officers from forty, to seventy-one. If we take the cost for ship-building and repairs, which can now be performed at Cockatoo Island, we find there was £8,925 spent last year. Deducting- this from the total of £15,311, it leaves a balance of £6,386, "Then take the naval armaments. We are  not  going to make them at Garden Island. That work will be done at Cockatoo Island. If we further subtract £1,568, the amount spent in this direction last year, it leaves £4,818 for victualling and clothing to correspond with last year's expenditure in this direction; yet we are going to spend £15,311. This is the economy honorable members prate -about so much in the country. They are -actually duplicating work. The Prime Minister last evening, after a lengthy debate, seeing the absurdity of building a home for a manger on Garden Island,  reduced  the item by £2,000, and promised not to build the house this year, but, notwithstanding that reduction, there is this heavy expenditure to be incurred on administration. Are we justified in increasing the expenditure on the Navy unnecessarily? Can any one claim this is necessary expenditure, seeing that we are now going to carry on work at Cockatoo Island Dock ? I have heard that it is  the  intention of the Government to keep 100 members of the Navy permanently on Garden Island. I leave it to the Treasurer to deny that. I would like some information from him on the point. Why are these men to be put there ? The Government are not justified in  increasing  the expenditure on Garden Island after taking over Cockatoo Island. While we are increasing expenditure on Garden Island we are also increasing the cost so far as Cockatoo Island is concerned. The number of officials there has been increased from twenty-one to forty-five, whilst the cost has increased from £6,416 to £14,006. In other  words, twenty-four additional officers have been appointed this year to Cockatoo Island. I do not say that there may not be necessity for an increased staff at Cockatoo Island, but I do contend that if an increase is necessary in that case, it cannot be necessary to have additional men on Garden Island. Admiral Henderson distinctly pointed out that the Imperial authorities were compelled to hold Garden Island only because they had no other place at which to dock their vessels. But although we have expended a large sum in acquiring Cockatoo Island, and are asked to vote a large sum to place machinery in position there, the Government are continuing the other establishment. We ought to have some information regarding this matter. If it is absolutely necessary to do what the Government propose, then I shall willingly vote for it, but if it is not necessary, then a wasteful expenditure is proposed, and it is my duty, and that of every honorable member, to vote against it. The Treasurer does not appear to know much about the matter. If he could make out a good case for the maintenance of Garden* Island, and for an increased expenditure upon it, we should be justified in supporting him, but until we know what justification there is for the proposed increase of expenditure there, we cannot be expected to allow these matters to go without challenge. I desire now to refer to another matter which was brought up this evening. I refer to the statement that the Admiral was to have full control of the disposition of the Fleet. The Prime Minister, in the. first place, stated that " as far as he knew " it was not correct, but subsequently gave his word that it was incorrect. It was claimed here this afternoon that the Admiral was to have full control of the disposition of the warships. If that be so, a great mistake is  being  made': I know that the Prime Minister himself ultimately said that it would not be so, and I hope that it will not, because once we permit the Admiral to determine what shall be the disposition of our vessels, the power of this Parliament in the matter will have disappeared. The Prime Minister said, with a laugh, this afternoon, ' ' The idea of talking about Parliament directing the movements of the Fleet ! Does the British Government do anything of the kind with the British Navy ? Does not every British admiral decide where the vessels of his fleet shall manoeuvre?" As a matter of fact, no British admiral does anything of the kind. The Admiralty gives orders as to the movements of the vessels of the British Navy. It directs an admiral to proceed with his fleet to a certain point, and he has to do so. When he reaches there he may do as he pleases, but he cannot decide for himself whether or not his vessels shall go there. What would be the position of our finances if we permitted this sort of thing in connexion with our Navy? We should soon be asked to vote huge sums for stores and fuel. We shall have coaling stations at different points along the coast. But. the Admiral, if he had the power to decide without question where a vessel of the Fleet should go, might make it necessary  for us to charter steamers to carry coal for its use, and so pile up our naval expenditure. On the other hand, if the Government have the right to direct where a ship shall go, then the Admiral will be able to pick up coal at the depot, and so save money. This is an important question. If, at the initiation of the </para>

The Army and Navy will run the show, and we shall simply have to pay. As representatives of the people we ought to have something to say in regard to the management of our Navy. I do not wish to interfere with the Admiral, but the Government of the day should always have vested in it the power to control the movements of the vessels of the Fleet. </para>

                            <para>- I am surprised  at  that interjection in view of the statement in print by the Minister of Defence, and the reiteration of that statement in the Senate this afternoon. The right honorable gentleman, who admits that he knows nothing about these Estimates, now  says  that my statement is puerile. </para>

                            <para>- I admit that, sir, but I was pleased to learn that the Minister of Defence had really indorsed  the  statement made this afternoon by  the  Leader of the Opposition. I appeal  to  honorable members to allow party feeling to remain in abeyance for the moment, and to say whether it is not right  that  we should have our position clearly  defined  in the initial stages of our  naval  policy. As the Treasurer says, Parliament should be supreme, but it is quite possible for  a  mistake to be made.  We  ought not to wait until a mistake  has  been made, and then find fault with those responsible for it. Now is the time  to  take action. </para>

                            <para>- Why should the expenditure on Garden Island be greater than it was last year, in view of Admiral Henderson's report that it should be reduced as soon as we took over Cockatoo Island? He pointed out that the Imperial Government used Garden Island only to effect minor repairs to warships while in these waters, and that, if we obtained control of Cockatoo Island, all repairs could be done there, so that the cost of Garden Island would be considerably reduced. We find, however, that it is to be increased. </para>

Does the right honorable member forget that he and his party told the electors that we had been guilty of extravagance, and that, if they were placed in office, they would introduce the pruning knife ? </para>

                            <para>- The right honorable gentleman knows a good deal more than I do about what he has said. We are not concerned with what the expenditure has been, because that money has gone; we are concerned with the votes we are now asked to pass. Suppose we admit: - though I do not admit it - that the money in the past was not wisely expended, surely the present Government are not justified in increasing the waste. I find that the total defence expenditure last year was £4,381,000, whereas the proposed expenditure this year is £5,746,000, or an increase, taking the odd figures into account, of, approximately, £1,500,000. There is no reason why we should vote all this additional expenditure without explanation. My mission is not to find fault with legitimate expenditure, and if the Government can show any justification for any part of it, I am prepared to support them; but it appears to me that, in place of making out a case, they take up the position that this expenditure consists of commitments that were left by the previous Government. That is a very unfair position to take up, because those who complain of expenditure should, if placed in power, endeavour to cut it down, or show that such a step is impossible. </para>

It seems strange that a private member should have to delve for information that ought to be given by the Government, and if the right honorable gentleman had been prepared to state fully the intentions of the Government, and to justify the additional expenditure, there would have been very little debate, and the !bill would have been passed. </para>

                            <para>- Even -when I do give notice I cannot get information. Last Thursday I asked for some information in regard to the amount of money to be expended on the submarine base at Port Stephens, and the Treasurer told me lie would' endeavour to answer my question by the following Tuesday when he had consulted the Minister of Defence. Yet, at the same time, his Estimates were on the table, and the probability is that he anticipated that by the Tuesday they would have been disposed of. Even on the Tuesday the information was not forthcoming, though I did get it to-day. Strange to say, I was informed by the Prime Minister that the expenditure would probably be £2,000, whereas the Honorary Minister, who represents the Minister of Defence, said it would be £3,000 or £4:000. I suppose that if we keep on for another day or two we shall find the expenditure at £6,000. It is the lack of information that causes honorable members to take up time. Admiral Henderson stated in his report that th&gt; first submarine base should be established at Port Stephens prior to the arrival of the submarines. Are the Government going to give effect to that recommendation ? Does the honorable member think that £3,000 or £4,000 will be sufficient to construct this base? We know that the submarines are expected by the end of another year ; and if something is not done, we shall have no place to berth them. At the same time, we are increasing the expenditure at Garden Island by over half of what it was last year, and this quite unnecessarily. As a representative, I cannot permit this money to be voted in the absence of fuller information without raising my protest; and the right honorable gentleman would be doing a service to honorable members if he would rise and explain. However, perhaps  it  would be hardly fair to ask him to do so considering that he knows nothing about the- matter. The question of defence  is all  important, and one in regard to which party feeling should be sunk. In Australia to-day, there are only a little over 4,500,000 people, and yet our Defence expenditure is over £6,000,000, and must grow. How the people are going to bear this burden, is a question that presents itself to us. If, from the inception, it keeps on - increasing unnecessarily, taxation must increase, and possibly give rise to a strong feeling of opposition to the whole defence system. Every one  is-  prepared to pay what is just and fair, because we realize it is necessary that we should be in a position to defend ourselves, and, if necessary, help the Mother Country. We have, however, to be careful, and we are not justified in voting money without knowing whether it  is  justifiable to do so. I would not be doing my duty to my constituents if I did not raise my voice in protest. </para>

                            <para>- There must be very, few, but the question is not the number of constituents who live there, but the number of people who reside  in  Australia, and have to find the money. This is no parochial matter, but a big national problem, which should be considered on its merits. I do not wish,  in  twelve months' time, to find myself  in  the position that I have voted thousands of pounds for some purpose that may prove useless, because I should not dare to attempt to justify myself in the eyes of my constituents, or the people of thecountry. </para>

                            <para>- Then I am prepared to give the Honorary Minister the  opportunity. This matter is of more importance to me than any other that could be discussed; and it is only because of the paucity of information that I have risen. Admiral Henderson's report has been repeatedly quoted by honorable members <inline font-style="italic">-on</inline> both sides, and is regarded as .a guide for all of us; and we should have some information as to where that gentleman has been wrong in his estimate. If Admiral Henderson said we should not expend much money on Garden Island, why is the Government increasing the expenditure there, especially when the greater part of the money last year was used in making the necessary repairs to the  warboats,  and the Government say they are going to do this work at Cockatoo Island. I cannot see, for the life of me, why they should increase the expenditure at Garden Island. Is it' correct that the Government intend to keep 100 privates on this particular island ? </para>

                            <para>- I do' not know whether that is so or not, but I do not believe in the people of the country paying for those social functions. My opinion is that the men in the Navy ought to be engaged .on the boats, because they are paid for that purpose. If those 100 men are to be retained on the island simply to look after the officers ..who are there, it is an arrangement that the Government are not justified in making. With regard to the expenditure to be incurred on Garden Island, I wish to know why there has been jan increase in the number of officers, and whether the work that was formerly done there in the way of repairing vessels is to be continued. If it is not, will the £8,000 spent last year be needed? I should like the Minister to give the fullest information as to the intentions of the Government in regard to both Cockatoo and Garden Islands. </para>

                        <para>.- The first point dealt with by the honorable member for Hunter is the alleged increase of staff at the Garden Island establishment. Let me say, at the outset, that there has been no such increase as he seems to .have been led to believe. If he will take the Estimatesiuchief, he will see, on page 99, the officers who belong to that establishment. The transfer to the .Common wealth of all the officers there provided for, with the exception of the Assistant Victualling Store officer, who was in service there, and had to be taken over,  was approved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> and all of them are being paid according to a scale of which he approved-. The proof, of my statement is in the departmental papers, which are available for the inspection of those honorable members who care to look through them. </para>

                            <para>- No. It was decided by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> that that, office should carry the salary of £2,000 a year. The present Administration cannot be charged with having originated that salary. We believe the salary fixed to be necessary, and assume full responsibility for it; but we must not be charged with the creation of this highly paid office. There is shown in the Estimates the salaries of certain men who are not permanent officers of the Commonwealth; but it was merely the desire to be candid that led to those salaries being included. These officers have been working at Cockatoo Island under a three years' engagement. They are Australian officers, who have, been serving at the island in connexion with the shipbuilding that has been going on there for Commonwealth purposes, and their salaries are being debited in this part of the Estimates in order to properly show the cost of each section of our Naval establishment. </para>

                            <para>- None. There is the new office of general manager, which, in a sense, has not yet been filled, though I understand that the person .who is to fill it is to arrive very shortly; but no new  officers  have been appointed. So far as the officers taken over from the service of the State are concerned, their salaries have not been raised. In addition, there are certain men whose salaries appear on the Estimates who are working under a three years' engagement. They are - G. W. Barr, shipyard manager, £800; </para>

As they all draw fairly large salaries, the amounts are shown on the Estimates, so that honorable members may understand the full charge in connexion with these establishments. As I have said, I shall be only too happy if honorable members will peruse the papers. If they, do so, they will see for themselves that the transfer of these officers to the Commonwealth was approved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> and that the increases in the rates of pay at Garden Island were - very properly, in my opinion - authorized, in the first instance, by him. </para>

                        <para>After consultation with the responsible officers at Sydney, and after making personal inquiries into the actual work performed by the hired clerical staff in His Majesty's Naval Establishments at Sydney, I recommend that the present staff be taken over on 1 st July next, and appointed to the positions and at the rates shown in enclosed statement. There are no permanent clerical  officers  employed in His Majesty's Naval Establishments in Sydney; the hired clerical staff do practically all the clerical work, and they are, in my opinion, underpaid excepting the juniors. Hitherto they have been paid at similar rates to those paid in England, notwithstanding it is recognised that the cost of living is much higher in Australia. </para>

Enclosed statements show the nature of the duties performed by each officer of the hired clerical staff. With regard to the fitters, boiler-makers, storemen, labourers, &amp;c., employed at daily rates of pay, many of whom have served continuously from10 to 20 years, are recommended to be taken over on1st July as temporary employes at their existing rates of pay, provided such are not less than Union rates, and in the case of labourers, that they be paid the Commonwealth rate, at 9s. perday. </para>

                            <para>- There are no new officers at Cockatoo Island. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> engaged the special men that have been referred to, and I fancy it is possible that, by merely counting up the Estimates and considering that those officers would nob be shown as they were only under a temporary engagement, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> made a mistake in that regard; but they were appointed for three years, and we are showing them on the Estimates because they are highly paid. That is the matter in a nutshell. I hope my honorable friends are satisfied with the explanation, and will facilitate the passage of the Estimates, as the matter is one of considerable urgency. </para>

                        <para>.- The honorable member has gone a long way to explain the Estimates in relation to Cockatoo Island and Garden Island. I do not know much about that matter, and it is not my intention to say much upon it; but I very much regret that a good deal of this discussion has taken place owing to the action of the Minister himself yesterday in not giving the information which had been asked for ; the Minister who is now in charge of the Estimates appeared to know very little, and gave the House no information concerning them at all. If there is one thing that we ought to be particular about it is the voting of large sums of money. </para>

Nearly all the discussion that has taken place at the present time is on new expenditure, which did not appear on the Estimates last year. We are now called upon to vote this large increase, and the Minister tells us that, although all this money is to be voted for Cockatoo Island, there is to be no increase iu the staff. We maintain that there- has been an increase. If the Honorary Minister is correct in saying that there has been no increase, how comes it that the Estimates have increased from £6,000 to £14,000 for the administrative staff? That is one of the things that the honorable member ought to have explained while on his feet. </para>

I very much regret that he should have taken up the stand he did, because it led ultimately to a scene, which we all very much regret. The Prime Minister has a way of making statements 'from time to time in the most irresponsible way, without any knowledge whatever, and without investigation. In making his attack upon the Leader of the Opposition this afternoon he went back to the old statement in the Auditor-General's report, that the accounts came to him so late in the year that it was not possible for him to. get his report ready before Parliament prorogued. The Prime Minister "used that statement from the Auditor-General's, report on the platform from, one end of the country to the other for political purposes, and I regret that the Auditor-General should be dragged into party politics. If there is one man who ought to be kept out of the sphere of party politics it is the Auditor-General, yet the honorable gentleman has never lost an opportunity of dragging up the statement about the time when his report is presented to the House, regardless of the fact that for many years the report has come along at abou a similar time. The Prime Minister stated in many places that the public accounts of this country had not been properly audited, but when I accused him of making that statement he denied it. I produced the paper, and then, of course, he wriggled out of it by saying that the Auditor-General said that, owing to  the late  hour at which the accounts came along, it was not possible for him to get his report presented to Parliament before the prorogation. While the Auditor-General took up that stand, however, he did not say that the reports were not correctly audited. As a matter of fact, the Prime Minister cast a very strong reflection upon the Auditor-General - that of not having properly audited the accounts. What are the facts in this case ? The first report of the Auditor-General for the period ended 30th June, 1901, was not presented to Parliament until 25th May, 19.03, or one year and eleven months after the end of the financial year. In 190.4 it was not presented to Parliament until 14th December, or a day before Parliament rose. In 1905 the report was presented on the 15th December, and in 1906 it was presented on the 25th September, or the earliest in its history. In 1907 the report reached us on the 13th December, the last day that Parliament sat. In 1908 it was presented on the 10th December. During all those years, with the exception of a very brief period, the. Labour party was not in office at all, so that it was idle for the Prime Minister to try to justify the charge that he made against the late Government, that the accounts could not be properly audited, owing to the fact that they were not handed to the Auditor-General in time. If the honorable member desired to; be fair, and to give an honest interpretation of what had taken place in this House, he would have, told the House that the report would come along about the usual, time. The. honorable member for Gippsland, went about the country telling the people- that there were millions of money, unaccounted, for,, and,, that when the, Auditor-General came along, the Treasurer and several other members of the Ministry locked the doors, and would not let him in. The thing was so utterly absurd that I wonder the audience- did not laugh at him. We are in rather a remarkable position in this House at present. The Government have no majority, ' and no one can point to any other country where a similar state of affairs exists. The Prime Minister said that if they could not carry out their policy, they, as self-respecting men, would not sit on the Treasury bench. I ask the Government what they have done to. carry out their policy, and what solitary measure, containing part of their policy, they have .passed through the House, and sent to the other Chamber. </para>

                            <para>- It may be good work, but this is the Government who-: were going to do so much, who never lost an opportunity of disparaging the party in power prior to the elections, and who talked of the wild extravagance of the past Administration. Yet. they come down with Estimates to the extent of £27,000,000. I do not object to this expenditure if the money is required for the development of the country. Any Government afraid to find the money necessary for the development- of the continent are unworthy of office, and I am not cavilling at the fact that there is an inflated expenditure of nearly £5,000,000 in excess of last year's, but I do find fault with those who say that what was a crime on the part of the late Ministry is a virtue on the part of the present Government. The press through all parts of Australia, and honorable members who are now in accord with this increased expenditure, claimed that the* late Government's expenditure of about. £22.000,000 was the wildest extravagance practically bordering on corruption. The honorable members for Gippsland, Indi, and Wannon, and others who denounced what they termed the wild expenditure of the late Government, have not the moral courage to denounce the present Administration, yet if it was wild expenditure to spent £22,000,000, surely to spend £27,000,000 is also wild expenditure. Honorable members should have the courage of the statements they have so frequently made. I do not object to the expenditure so long as it is for the beneficial development of Australia. The position taken up to-night by the honorable member for Capricornia is an important one. We shall need to be careful in regard to our expenditure on the Navy. There is nothing to cavil at in regard to universal training, but it seems to be difficult to put any limit on naval expenditure, so that we should guard to the fullest extent any expenditure in connexion with the development of our Navy. It is all very nice to wave flags and beat drums, and do all those sort of things. At the same time it will land us in difficulty if we are not careful. </para>

                            <para>- I believe the Liberal Association were selling these things to augment their funds. It shows how far their loyalty goes. Even at the great banquet held to welcome the officers of the Fleet, I believe there were little flags, made in Japan, ornamenting the table. The words were on the flags, so that there could be no excuse for it. A lot of the loyalty we hear about is spoken with the tongue in the cheek. We have a large expenditure in this Bill in connexion with the Northern Territory. I do not say that we had to take over the Northern Territory for our own protection, because immediately we start to develop that portion of Australia the danger increases. Nevertheless, South Australia had held the Territory for many years, and it became necessary for the Commonwealth to take it over. We have done so, and that involves a large expenditure, and a necessary expenditure, I believe, to develop it. It is most difficult to say whether the money being spent is being wisely spent; we certainly have in the Northern Territory one of the biggest problems Australia has to deal with. In declaring that we are to hold Australia for the white races of the world, we have assumed a burden that has brought forth problems, not only far reaching in their extent, but also demanding the utmost enthusiasm and energy from every member of the community. I believe that the development of the Northern Territory will not be brought about on the lines now being adopted. I consider that we should resume the long leases on the Barklay Tableland, and set about building a railway to the Gulf of Carpentaria; or, if we do not do it, we should get the Queensland Government to do it. In this way I believe the Barklay Tableland can be successfully developed inside two or three years. </para>

I can remember fifteen or twenty years ago, when we were told that no man could make a living in the Flinders district on less than 100,000 acres, but I have lived to see that land cut up into holdings of 20,000 acres, and even 10,000 acres, and 5,000 acres. </para>

                            <para>- No; but I am telling the honorable member what has been done in the Flinders district'. About six months ago, a block of 10,000 acres was sold. The man who held it had completed his five years' settlement on it. I forget how many sheep he had, but he sold the block for £6,000, though he had only been on it for five years. I know other men who have started on 10,000-acre blocks, and who are wealthy men to-day. I maintain that this tableland can be cut up into 20,000-acre blocks. It is of uo use saying a living cannot be made on these blocks. Men are not only making a living out of them, but they are making small fortunes. There are on the Barklay Tableland high pebbly downs, well sheltered. </para>

                            <para>- I know places where they cart the fencing material 80 and 100 miles, but there is ample timber on the Barklay Tableland. There is ample opportunity, not only for fencing, but for making small holdings pay. But no attempt seems to be made in that direction. We could still go on with the development of that part of the Northern Territory, as well as the part nearer Port Darwin, but the desire seems to be to hang round. .Port Darwin. Probably it is because the railway is there, and there is a settled town. I have no .objection to developing that part near Port Darwin. Probably the people already there know more about it than I do, but I believe that the Barklay Tableland could be successfully developed and made to carry sheep. The trouble is that there are large leases given by the South Australian Government, and there has been no attempt to redeem them. </para>

                            <para>- Borroloola is nearer, but it is in the Northern Territory. The difficulty in regard to many of these Gulf ports - Burketown, Normanton,  Gulftown,  and Borroloola - is in regard to the mouths of the rivers. The only evidence we  can  get in regard to these difficulties would be from experts who are well-versed in the building of harbors. I am not prepared to say whether Burketown, or Normanton in the Gulf, or Point Parker, or Borroloola, in the Northern Territory, are the best ports, but undoubtedly we could settle a large number of people for all time on the Barklay tablelands, and I hope that the Government will put some energy into the work. I desire now to refer to the trouble experienced by the Library Committee in securing sufficient room to house our books and documents.. We have had the use of this building since the inauguration of Federation, and seeing that the finances of the Commonwealth are very buoyant, I think it would be a graceful recognition of the generosity of the Victorian Parliament and the people of the State to complete the north wing. I understand that an estimate of the cost has been framed, and that plans are already in existence. It would cost about £60,000 or £70,000 to complete the north wing of this building, and by doing so we should provide ample accommodation to meet the requirements of the Library. We have had the free use of this building for twelve or thirteen years, and are likely to be here for another eight or ten years. </para>

                        <para>. - I am rather suspicious of the cheers of the Opposition. I rise to express my dissatisfaction at the way these Estimates have been placed before the House. At 2 o'clock this morning I felt constrained to enter my protest against the Estimates- for the Northern Territory, which are the most extraordinary we have ever had before us. We have had to drag information from the Government, and I am strongly of opinion that much of the time taken up by this debate would have been saved :if Ministers had come forward in the first place with the particulars we desired. I agree with what the honorable member for Kennedy has said in regard to the Northern Territory, but I would point out that he has saddled the wrong horse. He seems to forget that the late Government laid down the lines for the development' of the Northern Territory which are being followed in these Estimates. </para>

                            <para>- The consideration of next year's Estimates may be a long way off, seeing that the Opposition are determined that no business shall be done, and we want to know at once what policy is being pursued by the Government in regard 'to the Northern Territory. Ministers, however, after being three or four months in office, bring down these Estimates, offer us no information in regard to them, and, when we protest against the proposed expenditure in the Northern Territory, realizing, as most of us do, that it is but the foundation of a much larger expenditure, we are told to wait for information on the subject. If we did the right thing, I think that we would strike out a lot of the items in the Estimates, and make Ministers responsible for the proposals they put before us in regard to the expenditure of the people's money. Unfortunately, however, the party bell is rung, and as soon as that is done we know fairly well how every honorable member will vote. I feel disposed to ask the Treasurer where he expects, to get the money necessary to provide for all these undertakings. It is all very well for the honorable member for Kennedy to- propose an expenditure of £50,000 or £60,000 in completing the north wing of this building, but whilst I recognise that the people of Victoria have treated us well in giving us the free use of Parliament House, I cannot lose sight of the fact that the people would have- to find the money to carry out such a proposal. As a country representative, I am told again and again that money cannot be found even to provide for short telephone and telegraph lines, or to build small post-offices. It is the duty of the Government to explain, not only the expenditure they now propose, but what it will lead to, and where they are going to find the money. I feel that I am tied up here, and that I ought to vote against a number of the items in the Schedule; but I would rather vote with the Minister of External Affairs for a proposal in which I do not believe than give a vote which would put the Socialists into office. The trouble with honorable members opposite is that our party is in office. I enter an emphatic protest against the way in which the Estimates have been put before us. It was only after a lot of cavilling and much waste of time that we secured information which we had sought from the outset. Ministers can blame themselves for the waste of time that has taken place. The Treasurer was asked for information, but did not give it to us till we threatened an all-night sitting. At the same time, I freely admit that the Prime Minister made last night a candid statement which disarmed a lot of the criticism which would have come from this corner, or, at all events, from myself. During my twenty years of political life I have never known an Opposition to cavil, as the Opposition in this House have done, at certain expenditure, and then to become as silent as the grave on finding that it relates to their own appointments and their own commitments. </para>

                            <para>- And when I protested last night, the  Trea-surer  asked me to leave the matter over until. the next day. Generally speaking, I arn very dissatisfied, and. feel much disposed to give my vote against the Treasurer. It is all very well to. point to the Minister of External Affairs, but we all like him so very much that we do not care to criticise him; and, in any case, he gets enough unkind treatment from the Treasurer himself. I have a protest to enter against the Department of the Postmaster-General, who, I am sorry to see, is not present. There are thirty or forty small telephone and post offices being held up in my district. </para>

The Treasurer ought to tell us whether he has any system for the expenditure of this money. If this sort of thing goes on, it will necessitate extra taxation, including, no doubt, an income tax, and against that nobody would call out louder than the Treasurer himself. </para>

" I am not asking for a .million, but merely that some funds shall be placed at the disposal of the Postmaster-General to permit of the provision of small post offices in country districts. If the Treasurer does not provide that money, he is in for trouble. I am not making threats, but I am not going to stand this sort of thing. The Treasurer may feel very snug where he is, but it is quite time that we honors able members in the Corner, who keep him in his position, should raise a solemn protest against the treatment the country districts receive. </para>

                            <para>- I dare say there is, and there is no doubt that, generally, not much sympathy is shown with country people here. Honorable members may laugh at the country people now, but they do not laugh at them at election time. I appeal for some consideration for the country districts. Is the Treasurer satisfied that the expenditure shall go on in this slipshod way in the Northern Territory, at the Capital, and at Jervis Bay, with no. responsibility and no check ? We must not forget, however, that this system was initiated by the late Government ; but it is for the present Government to show a better example. I know that I went about the country charging the late Government with extravagance, and with working on a bad system, and many honorable members on the front Government bench did the same tiling. It is now time that those charges were proved, and it would not be hard to prove them in many cases. As a matter of fact, in twenty-four hours I could prove that money was grossly wasted and squandered in many places by the late Administration; and the present Government ought to make the facts public. We ought not to indulge in generalities, but ram the charges home. </para>

                            <para>- The Government ought to be able to prove one very easily; at any rate, I could prove more than one. If the Government will appoint a small Royal Commission to make inquiries into the administration of Jervis Bay, I will undertake to prove waste and extravagance, and that the system is rotten to the core. For a £10 note, a Royal Commission of three members could do the work, and I suggest that two should be taken from the Government side, and one from the Opposition side, with no expenses or fees of any kind. </para>

                            <para>- Honorable members may choose to treat this subject in a light vein, but the people who have to find the money do not so treat it. If money is wasted at Jervis Bay and the other places I have mentioned, it may be wasted all over the country. I do not blame Ministers,"because they cannot look after everything personally, but it is the system that is wrong, and requires mending. The Treasurer may be very jovial now that he is assured of getting his Estimates through, but he is not doing his duty to the people of the country. I am tired of hearing charges flung round, and the Government should make an effort to prove them, because people are beginning to think there is nothing in those charges. Many statements have been made, but up to the present nothing has been proved, although I feel satisfied that much could be proved ; if I did not think so, I would not say what I am now saying. I do not lay the blame at the door of the late Ministers, but I blame the system. The Treasurer raised a lot of trouble over the sleepers for the transcontinental railway; but with him all is right so long as the money is spent in the West. Why does he not take a national view, as I do, in connexion with the Federal Capital? </para>

                        <para>.- I wish, in a friendly way, to make a suggestion or two to the Government, with a view to saving expense at Cockatoo Island, where there are over 1,200 men employed building our cruisers and torpedo boats. When the Commonwealth took over the island they took over all the staff of the State Government, including the general manager, but that gentleman is now only in an acting capacity; and where there is not a permanency of tenure a man cannot be expected to take the same interest in his work. The Honorary Minister told us of a large number of experts who had been brought out by the State Government, and who are on the temporary list, some for three years, and others for two; and we cannot hope for the best results under such circumstances. I regret very much that the present manager, who was in his present position for ten or twelve years under the State, is only temporarily employed. He has brought the place up to its present position, and it is unfair to suggest that he is not qualified to carry out the construction of ships. If the expenses of construction are increasing, that is due to the administration of the Naval Board.. I do not blame the Minister or the late Minister, but, as a fact, the plans of the ships are kept, not in Sydney, but with the Naval Board, in Melbourne. If any detailed information is required, or any dispute arises about the construction, a gentleman has to be sent from </para>

                            <para>- We are not here to be guided by the Admiralty in Great Britain, and I think an alteration in this connexion would save expense. The Minister ought to insist on the plans, and the draughtsmen, if necessary, being -located where the shipbuilding goes on. As to Garden Island, it would be a great mistake to have another set of engineers and supervisors to do the repair work. The British Government have used Garden Island for repairs, Cockatoo Island being in the hands of the State Government for their shipbuilding and repairing. On the Estimates there is a large sum of money for the installation of machinery of the latest type for Cockatoo Island, and there is no need to bring in a separate staff for repairs at Garden Island. In shipbuilding, centralization ought to be aimed at, and I hope that the Minister, instead of creating a separate staff, and building a house for the manager at Garden Island, will see that one part of Cockatoo Island is ' set aside for repairs. In any case, all our ships are new, and no repairs ought to be necessary for a long time. </para>

                            <para>- It ought to be kept as a store, and not mixed up with the engineering work. I hope that the Bill will go through without delay, because it provides for necessary expenditure. I rose merely 'to point out the need for supervising the recommendations of the Navy Board. The history of every part el the world shows that naval and military men have no sense of proportion in matters of finance. They are not responsible to the people as are members of Parliament, and they make  recommendations,  leaving it to others to find the money. If we act on democratic lines, we shall see that Parliament retains its responsibility, making the Minister responsible to it, and allowing no extravagance. Once the public think that the Navy is extravagantly managed, it will become unpopular, and it will then '11 difficult to maintain it at a proper degree of efficiency. I trust that all proposals for naval expenditure will be properly controlled by the Minister. It would lie a good thing if we had some smart business men on the Navy Board to  look  after the interests of the public. There would be safety in that arrangement. 1 hope that there is some misunderstanding regarding the attitude of the Prime Minister and of the Minister of Defence as to the control of the Navy. I hope that the latter has wrongly put the position, and that on no consideration will he hand over to the Admiral the right to say where the ships shall go, where they shall coal, and so forth. As an official, the Admiral should be always under the control of the Minister of Defence for the time being, and the Parliament will hold the' Minister responsible. It would be a backward step to give the control of the Navy to the Admiral, or to the Navy Board. I trust that the  Minister will keep a close eye upon proposals for expenditure, both Naval and Military. I believe that there have been leakages, but that must happen whenever a new system is inaugurated. I hope, however, that when Ministers get into recess they will see_ that the extravagance, if any, is cur tailed. </para>

                        <para>, - I wish to refer to a statement made by the honorable member for Moreton. If there is one man in the House who I thought would not take advantage of another, it is he, and I am very sorry that I should be one of the few to come under his ban. I have read his speech carefully from beginning to end, and I cannot see why he should have referred to something that occurred four years ago. Since then. I have been before my constituents on two occasions, and it was then, if at any time, that the matter should have been dealt with. I ask honorable members on both sides if I have ever been against the Naval or Military Defence policy of the Government. I have been one of the most sincere adherents of that policy all along, although, if there are two constituencies in the Commonwealth whose electors are against it, they are the Maranoa and the Kennedy constituencies. </para>

                            <para>- Because their people are anti-jingo. It would have been more popular to denounce than to defend the Naval and Military policy of the Commonwealth in those constituencies. But even at this early hour in the establishment of our Defence policy, I am beginning to fear that we may have made a mistake. There is a jingoistic spirit in Australia that was never here before, and we may be creating a naval and military caste, for which many of us may ultimately be sorry. </para>

                            <para>- We have the experience of the past to guide us, and know what naval arid military gentlemen are in regard to expenditure. Our expenditure is mounting up by leaps and bounds, and the Government are providing for works and buildings out of loan money, so that they may have sufficient revenue to pay for Defence. They introduced a Naval Loan Bill, but found that it was unpopular throughout Australia. They know now that the country will not allow borrowing for Defence, and therefore they propose to borrow for works expenditure, Using the revenue for Defence. If the honorable member for Moreton thinks that his remarks tended to injure me in my constituency, he is mistaken. Instead of doing me harm, they will do me good. He said that I was one of the few who voted against the Defence policy introduced by the present Prime Minister when Minister of Defence. Why was he not fair? At that time the chamber was in an electrical state, one member stopping another from speaking,and the Minister of Defence of the day over leapt himself. He moved that the question be now put, and found that he had made a "bloomer."Hethen asked leave to withdraw the motion. My vote was given, not against the Defence policy then being proposed, but as a protest against the way in which the business of the day was being put through. I would do the same thing again to-morrow. If we had put a little more devil into the proceedings at the time, things would have been different, and had my advice been taken, there would have been something stronger to chronicle in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> The question was - </para>

I voted amongst the Noes on that occasion also, the voting being thirty-nine to nine. I do not know why the honorable member for Moreton has brought up this matter to-day. I cannot see what motive he has, or what he was to get out of it. I do not know that I have ever done anything dirty to the honorable member.I have always regarded him as a personal friend, and I cannot understand why ho should have taken this action. I have a word or two to say with regard to the matter mentioned by the honorable member for Kennedy. With regard to the Barklay Tableland, it is quite true that there are thousands of acres available. When I first went to Queensland, there was nothing out there but cattle ranches, and the cattle were pretty wild at that. The late James Tyson took up a place from the Saltern Creek Pastoral Company. He fenced it, and put a large number of sheep on it. He put down bores at shallow depths. That sounds all right, but it requires money to do that sort of thing. Bores cannot be put down on the Barklay Tableland for 20s. a foot. The honorable member for Kennedy mentioned 5,000 acres. </para>

                            <para>- I know places in Queensland where men are starving on 5,000 acres. They are in the hands of the banks and financial institutions. An area of 5,000 acres is of no use to a man going in for sheep. Any one who tries it is a lunatic. The honorable member said that there are people making money on 10,000 acres in parts of the country said to be useless twenty years ago. Of course you will find "mugs" buying stations, just as you will find them buying horses. They think that all that you have to do is to put your money into a sheep station, and that a fortune will grow like turnips. When they have been 'at it a little while, they learn that experience and good management are required. Twenty thousand acre blocks on the Barklay Tableland would be of no more use than 20 acres would be in Victoria. If bores are to be put down in that country people want to have more than 20,000 acres. The veriest tyro in station management knows that on such a holding you cannot carry enough stock even to pay for transit. The nearest port of shipment to the Barklay Tableland is Burketown. To build a railway from Burketown to the tableland you would have to go through Queensland territory. Queensland is naturally jealous of her own trade, and would not allow the Commonwealth to build a line from the tableland to Burketown. I believe that those areas which are good for settlement should be settled at the earliest opportunity, and that we .should prove to the world what the tableland is. It is reported to be good sheep country, but. there are not going to be the fortunes in it that many people think. I have dropped nearly £1,000 in it as a member of a company that thought that it was going to make a lob of money out of sheep raising. We all dropped our " little bit," and were quite satisfied to get out of the venture as lightly as we did. Another thing with regard to Barklay Tableland is that it will be necessary to have sheep driven there, and that cannot be done in that part of the country during a drought. It cannot be done in the Kennedy and Maranoa electorates when they are suffering from drought. </para>

                            <para>- Big mobs of  sheep  have often perished going out to these far-back stations, but if they can get out there, and there is a good season, how can they get the clip away ? A man with 50,000 acres cannot wait until the weather ' breaks, because he has not the capital behind him. It means that any one going to start the sheep industry there without' a bank behind him - and a good bank at that - is doomed to failure from the commencement. I would like the Minister . of External Affairs to tell us how much he is paying per foot for the experimental bores, whether any water has been struck, and whether it is artesian or sub-artesian . </para>

I wish to make a reference to the great Protectionist - party on the other side of the chamber. Surely in this great Australia of ours we can make a few flags. It did grieve me when I saw the flags of welcome that were sold in the streets of Sydney on the day of the arrival of our Fleet. It made me feel a bit queer to see " Made in Japan " on a corner of those flags. Our Australian youngsters, bursting with enthusiasm to cheer and do something to show their exuberance of spirits on that great day, had little Union Jacks, made in Japan, in their hands. </para>

                            <para>- It did grate on my patriotism. Had they been made in England, I would not have minded so much. Instead of it being a home-coming for the Fleet, the occasion was more like a funeral. I never witnessed anything worse from a jubilation point of view. The bands were playing as if at a funeral ; the vessels went silently up the harbor, and we followed in their wake. Without taking us round the Fleet, they landed us just where we started. It was a funeral, I am sorry to say, though the people were just bursting with enthusiasm. "On the previous day an order was issued that no sirens or whistles were to be blown, and no jubilation was to be shown, because a few children would be singing in one of the boats. I think the Government muddled that business. Instead of taking us down the harbor, they could have chartered a full-rigged ship and manned it with Australian Naval Cadets, and they could have had Australian girls on the decks welcoming the warships with the good old English hurrahs. That would have been something towards a welcome. </para>

                        <para>. - I am sorry at this late hour to take up the time of the House, but the exuberance of New South Wales members to show the great bargain the Commonwealth had secured in Cockatoo Island and Garden Island took up so much time that I was unable to catch the eye of the  Speaker  before this. The Government, in these Estimates, are following on the lines of the late Government, but, beyond Cockatoo Island and Garden Island, they have made no provision to be self-contained so far as armaments are concerned. Apparently they intend to rely on Cockatoo Island, and to a lesser degree on Garden Island, where there is a fairly good workshop. I have to admit that the works at Cockatoo Island are splendid. As to whether they were worth the money paid for them, of course I cannot claim to be a judge. It is with a good deal of diffidence that I express a doubt as to whether we are really getting value for our money. </para>

                            <para>- If that assertion were made by a disinterested member I should be disposed to accept it, but since it comes from a New South Welshman I must take it with a grain of salt, because we know that all their geese over there are swans. An endeavour is being made to make Australia self-contained as far as possible in the matter of the requirements of the Army and Navy, and if that effort is to be successful we shall have to provide, not only for the manufacture of small arms and cordite, but for the nucleus of an arsenal in which heavy guns and ammunition can be manufactured. I had hoped that the present Government would take a step in that direction, but I find that they are content to traverse the path which other Administrations have followed. We are importing tools and parts for our heavy guns at a cost of many thousands of pounds, although they can be manufactured here. It is dangerous to continue this practice. </para>

                            <para>- It is a shame that such should be the position. Even a novice, looking at one of our up-to-date big guns, can see that it is a piece of high mechanism, and that it would not take much to put the mechanism out of order. We have in Victoria a rather good Ordnance Department, which, I believe, is capable of making many of the parts and tools that have been imported, and by means of an expenditure of £40,000, or £50,000, we could be made less dependent upon Cockatoo Island than we are at present. I know that it will be said that I am taking a provincial view of the position .when I urge that in some part of Victoria there should be established the nucleus of an arsenal in which all that is required in connexion with our heavy guns could be manufactured. In setting out to construct the arsenal we should make provision for an extension. </para>

                            <para>- I do not wish to raise that question. If I were to suggest that we should have one in Melbourne every representative of New South Wales would be up in arms, and would declare that I was making an attack on the "Ma" State. We are spending something like £60,000 per annum on the Ordnance Department, and we have, in <inline font-weight="bold">Major Hardy,</inline> an inspector of ordnance machinery who, although I have disagreed  with many of his actions, is undoubtedly a highly-trained specialist. He was one of the best mechanics in the Newport workshops, where he worked many years ago prior to his appointment by the Victorian Government as an artificer in the Defence Department. He has under him in the different States a fairly good staff of highly-trained engineers, capable of making all that we are now importing in this direction. We have in the Ordnance Department the nucleus of an arsenal, and it is only fair that we should make use of it instead of having to depend wholly on Cockatoo Island. Great as may be the ability of those in charge of the Cockatoo Island works, I think that they have been given too much to do, and that it was because of this that certain experiments they undertook were not up to expectations. </para>

                            <para>- On more than one occasion I expressed my disapproval of what the ex-Minister of Defence was doing, and I went so far as to complain, as I complain to-day, that the Minister of Defence was a member of another place. I have always said that that office should be alloted to an honorable member of this House. I always thought it was unfair to attack the honorable member for Adelaide when he represented the Minister of Defence in this House, and I hold the same opinion in regard to the Honorary Minister now. The honorable member for Parkes seemed to think I was making an attack on the Honorary Minister, but that is not so, because I always thought, as I say, that it was unreasonable to attack his predecessor. The Prime Minister is really the only honorable member opposite who has had any intimate association with the Defence Department, and he knows that during his term of office there were many reports submitted with a view to having the articles to which I have referred constructed in Australia, but if anything of the kind was suggested, it was wiped out at once by the naval and military advisers. As a matter of fact, these men, and not the Minister, rule the Defence Department. For instance, in the QuartermasterGeneral's Branch there was at one time at the head Lieutenant-Colonel Legge, whom I believe to be a highly capable man, and he made many departures in the direction of having material manufactured here. I had certain papers laid on the table of the Library -showing that suggestions had been made  by other officers to similar effect, but nothing was ever done. Rightly or wrongly, Ministers of Defence h.ave to depend on the advice of their expert advisers; and one Minister tol'd me that he must do so or assert himself as a layman, which-, under the circumstances, he did not care to do. The members of the Military Board and Naval Board may be very capable men individually, but when they are collected' together as a Board it is almost impossible to get them to do anything of a. progressive character, and this is not good for Australia. We are led to believe that there are rumours of war in Europe, and the British Government are- building vessels to a greater extent than even a wealthy nation like the British can afford. Only the other day a British Minister, to his credit, endeavoured to bring about a change in this connexion, and he did this without cringing or crawling to foreign Powers. If there is any possibility of war during the next few years we ought to .be prepared, and to do that we ought to be self-contained so far as armaments are concerned. There is nothing to stop our commencing with small field-pieces, or in re-casing , and strengthening heavier guns, which, I understand, is required after a certain number of projectiles have been discharged. Further, guns become  obsolete  in a very few years, but it is possible by altering the mechanism to bring them up to. date, and something might be done in preparing for work of that character. The position demands that something in this connexion should be attempted, and in the different States at present there are artificers who would form a nucleus for such an establishment. I hope our friends from Sydney will not think we are endeavouring to take something  from  them, but it is not a tar-seeing policy to rely on one manufacturing place for such commodities. <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> do not wish to raise a scare, but it is as veil that honorable members should know chat a, vessel armed with up-to-date heavy guns could stand off in the open sea and shell any- portion of Sydney, including Cockatoo Island. </para>

                            <para>- Honorable members can now hear Cockatoo Island speaking. I feel sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> has never discerned it, but it is a fact, nevertheless, that representatives from Sydney are unable- to believe that anything can be done as well elsewhere. The moment one attempts to put any other place on the same plane as Sydney they cling together like long-lost brothers, irrespective of party. I understand that the same feeling is noticeable as between Sydney representatives and country representatives of New South Wales. This is a digression, but I was induced to make it by the aspersion cast by the honorable member for East Sydney upon the depth of water in Port Phillip. I do not intend to delay honorable members longer, but I am determined to hammer away at this phase of the question until we have an arsenal established which will be independent of Cockatoo Island, and which, when that place fails us, may be used in the interests of Australia. </para>

                        <para>.- I should not have spoken on this Bill were it not for the fact that I have been charged with misrepresenting the honorable member for Maranoa by a quotation which I made the other night from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> I was pointing out that the members of the Labour party, on the defence policy, speak with a double voice. In the country they claim that they are responsible for the defence policy of Australia, but they have not been responsible for it here. The honorable member for Maranoa brought himself into the limelight by taking exception to what I said on the occasion referred to. The honorable member for Yarra did the proper thing by getting up, after I had spoken, to explain his attitude in the matter: I regret that .both honorable members did not make their explanations four years ago, instead of waiting until now to make them. I told the honorable member for Maranoa when I spoke that I should be very sorry to misrepresent him. I am  sorry  now that the honorable member did not accept my assurance. <inline font-style="italic">T</inline> had no intention of misrepresenting him personally, or of doing him any injury in his electorate. I am aware that it is not possible to injure him in his electorate, but I take exception to being accused of misrepresenting the honorable member. When the honorable members for Maranoa -and Yarra say that they wished to protest against the action of the Government of the day, I say that they had already protested in the division on the motion that the question be now put. I challenge any one who investigates the- matter without bias to come to any conclusion other than that at which I arrived with regard to that division. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, the honorable member entered his protest against that motion. I was pointing out when referring to this matter that some members of the Labour party could not take credit for having initiated the present naval policy of the Commonwealth. I had no desire to hurt the feelings of the honorable member for Maranoa. I have the utmost friendship for the honorable member, and am pleased to say that, apart from politics, we are able to agree remarkably well. I think that we have some cause to be alarmed about' the growing, expenditure on defence. It is not merely creeping up&gt; but is advancing at an alarming rate. In 1909-10 the expenditure was £1,534,881; in 1910-11 it had jumped up to £3,008,705; in 191.1-12 it was £4,080,039. In 19!l2-13 the estimated expenditure was £5,438,364, and this year we have an estimate which is an increase upon that amount. It appears to me that the expenditure is growing so rapidly that it is time we went rather slower than we are doing in the matter of defence. I do not wonder at the honorable member for Maranoa and other honorable members objecting to this large expenditure. The unfortunate point is that they  are  responsible for it. During the Labour Government's term of office, the expenditure upon defence increased from £1,000,000 to £5,000,000 per annum. This year the increase is not much more than it was last year. </para>

                            <para>- I have no desire to do the honorable member an injustice; but he is one of the party which has claimed credit for having initiated our naval policy. I hope that the time has passed when there will be any parties in this House upon the question of defence. There are some other items of expenditure in respect of which we have a perfect right to know the intentions of . the Government. Upon last year's Estimates for new works and buildings there was an item of £8,000 for the establishment of Woollen Mills at Geelong. The honorable member for Adelaide, who was then representing the Minister of Defence, was questioned very closely as to what was the policy of the Government in regard to' that work. He told us that he could hardly be expected to say how many bricks would be in the factory, or how many machines -would be installed there. The Prime Minister has told us that these mills would cost £117,000 when completed. Upon the Estimates now before us there is an item of £85,000 to complete the work which was initiated by the last Administration. I do not object to that now, the works, having been started, must be completed; but I do think, in regard to large expenditures which are anticipated, that the House has a right to know exactly what is the policy of the Government. </para>

                            <para>- I was not aware of it. I was absent from the Chamber at the time. The honorable member has stated that the Labour party speak with two voices upon the question of naval defence. I say they do not. The facts are that, in 1909, the honorable member for Parramatta, who was then Minister of Defence, brought down to this House an abstract motion, which he attempted to explain. In the course of his explanation, some members of the Labour party were smarting under the use of the "gag," which had been applied to them time after time, and one of those members moved to "gag" the present Prime Minister; but every member of the Labour party, except three, voted against the application of the  " gag." In view of the statements made by the honorable member for Moreton, is it not significant that the nine members of the Labour party whom he mentioned are still members of this House? Since then the honorable member for Melbourne has managed to be elected on two occasions by very large majorities, on the last occasion, I think with the largest majority obtained in the whole Commonwealth. I managed to get returned, too, and I think that my majority was the second largest in the Commonwealth. At any rate, our constituents are quite satisfied. What did the honorable member for Parramatta do? He brought down an abstract proposition. He said that the ways and means were to be considered in connexion' with the Naval proposals. He did not attempt to explain them. It was proposed by the honorable member for Gwydir that he be no further heard. </para>

                            <para>- I had no intention of getting up until the honorable member for Moreton again raised this question. I make the same explanation now as I have made all through. I would do the same thing again. If a Minister gets up here, and proposes that we accept a Naval proposal, or enter into an agreement, surely we are entitled to some information ? When the honorable member for Parramatta knew that all the members of the House except three were in favour of hearing him, surely he had no Tight to practically closure himself and every other member! </para>

                            <para>- I doubt that. It is only a dead heat, at any rate - thirty-seven all, and my honorable friends have a lot to boast of, have they not, considering that they have the whole press of Australia barking and yelping for them every day, and when anything we say is not reported. The honorable member for Moreton no doubt will be reported, but anything said on this side will not be published. The honorable member said that we spoke with two voices on this question. He said that the expenditure on defence had gone up from £1,000,000 to £5,000,000. It would have gone up in that proportion no matter what Ministry was in power, if we are to have a safe system of defence. We should have a proper system, or none at all. As I said on many platforms, it surely was a mistake to have a naval policy which only provided for some vessels that could not move, and a tug had to be used to drag one of the warships about. I refer to the <inline font-style="italic">Cerberus</inline> at Melbourne, which I suppose was part of our Fleet. The honorable member for Moreton said that we only took the matter up when it was popular. Was that the reason why the first Fisher Government did not take up the <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> cry? Was that cry popular throughout Australia ? </para>

I rose to point out again the attitude I took up on that occasion, and I will take it up again if any Minister objects to give information concerning proposals before the House which will entail a heavy expenditure. It was known that the naval proposal, if adopted, would run the country into an expenditure of millions.

At Cockatoo Island the number of persons employed has increased from twenty-one to forty-five, and, according to the Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> recommended the increase. I take this opportunity to say that, having heard that statement, I asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> whether it was true, and he absolutely repudiated it. </para>

When the Prime Minister tries to shuffle on to the shoulders of another responsibility that  belongs  to him, when he challenges the word of the late Minister of Defence, and? questions statements made by the Leader of the Opposition, it -is time to make reference to the matter, and to give him an opportunity to say definitely that the word of these men cannot be taken, or that he is mistaken. </para>

There is an item of £7,500 towards the construction of office accommodation at Victoria Barracks, Melbourne, and a foot-note in the Estimates shows that the total estimated cost, including division No. 52, is £25,000. Seeing that we are about to construct a Federal City, which will probably cost £3,000,000, is it not fair that we should have some information in regard to expenditure of this description ? Are we to have this additional accommodation at Victoria Barracks ? However, it seems "impossible to extract information from the Minister, so I ask for a quorum to be formed. <inline font-style="italic">[Quorum formed].</inline> I am trying to elicit from the Prime Minister what it is intended to do with this £25,000. </para>

                            <para>- He was always prepared to give full particulars concerning any item. Complaint has been made about the delay in passing this measure, but I would remind honorable members that the New Works and -Buildings Estimates in respect of the Postal Department alone last year were held up for twenty-eight hours. The present Prime Minister was then Leader of the Opposition, and the honorable member for Richmond was doing his best to make things particularly disagreeable for us. When the Prime Minister is asked now how it is proposed to expend £25,000 on the Victoria Barracks, he says he knows nothing about it. I am not surprised. The honorable gentleman comes into this House with a bogus assumption of wrath, and talks of an alleged waste of time. </para>

I shall leave this question of the Victoria Barracks in its present unsatisfactory position, the Prime Minister being unable to say how this £25,000 of the taxpayers' money is to be expended, or why it is to be expended. There are in the schedule some items of the most extreme importance, and we shall not have another opportunity to discuss them. The information regarding the items is the most meagre I have known since I have been in Parliament. Here is one of £30,000 for the provision, in connexion with the Military College at Can berra, of quarters for officers, stables, rabbit-proof fencing, and so forth. </para>

                            <para>- I have not the slightest intention to evade the Speaker's ruling for one moment, but on a Supply Bill I am entitled to mention any vote that is to be expended in a particular direction. I do not propose to debate the merits of particular items, but we have a proposal to expend £30,000 in practically providing officers' residences and stables for their horses, and I wished to know the accommodation to be provided. The proportions to which Defence expenditure is going is alarming to the last degree, and it is due to the House that the Minister in charge should make a statement regarding this item. I am not going to debate these matters without having honorable members here to listen, and I ask for a quorum. <inline font-style="italic">[Quorum formed.]</inline> Another question raised this afternoon was as to who is to shoulder the responsibilities for the movements of the Fleet. The statement made by the Minister of Defence, which was deftly shelved by the Prime Minister, seems to show distinctly that the Government are not prepared to exercise the control they should over the Fleet. The Minister of Defence is reported to have said that the Admiral is responsible for the efficient training of the Fleet, and that it is for him to say what the future disposition of the Fleet shall be. I do not agree with that idea, because, in my opinion, the civil authority is responsible, and not Admiral Patey. He may be the most estimable and competent man associated with the control of  His  Majesty's ships of war, and, presumably, he is a competent person, seeing that the Admiralty recommended him; but the policy laid down by the Minister is absolutely foreign to the inclinations of the Australian people. We have never taken the attitude that the Army or Navy, or the officers of either, should control the civil authority, but that the Litter should indicate how and where the military and naval resources of the country are to be used. The Prime Minister, however, sees no difficulty in such a policy, but I think, and the Leader of the Opposition takes the same view, that ' it is an interference with the civil authority which should not be permitted. I do not intend to pursue either military or naval matters any further, but there are a couple of other matters in which I am particularly interested. One is the Perth Post Office. The Postmaster-General has, apparently, gone home. A valuable piece of land has been acquired iu Perth for the purpose of erecting a post-office and other public buildings. The present post-office at Perth is probably the most congested of any in Australia. It is in an inconvenient position, and the space available is entirely insufficient for dealing with the ever-increasing volume of mail matter to be handled there. It was indicated that the plans of the new building were ready prior to the last election, and that the work could be proceeded with at a very early date. Nothing has been done up to now. I want to say that this is a matter which directly concerns the Treasurer. The sooner we can get on with the building of the new Post-office at Perth the better, as, in a couple of years from now, it will be absolutely impossible to cope with the congestion of mail matter in the existing building. It will take a couple of years to erect the new building after a start is made. The total expenditure on the work proposed for this year is £12,000, and that is ».n altogether insufficient and insignificant amount. If the Treasurer had been alive to the needs of Perth in this matter he would have placed, not £12,000, but et least £50,000 on the Works Estimates for this purpose. It is a matter which concerns the right honorable gentleman just as much as it concerns me. It does not now appear to concern anybody very much, and we should at least have twenty-five honorable members listening to what is to be said on this subject. <inline font-style="italic">[Quorum formed.']</inline> I intend to leave the Perth Post Office now to the tender mercies of the Treasurer. I hope the right honorable gentleman will have pleasure, when he goes back to Western Australia, in telling the people that, in connexion with an undertaking which will cost about" £100,000, he has provided only £12,000 on the Works Estimates for this year. </para>

                            <para>- I wish to speak Cor a few moments on the question of wireless telegraphy. I quite approve of the action of the Government in bringing out <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Swinburne</inline> to report on the system which is employed by the Commonwealth Government at the present time, and the system assigned to them by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Balsillie.</inline> I do not intend to go into details in dealing with the subject. The Commonwealth Government have a responsibility in connexion with wireless telegraphy to construct a station at Port Darwin, which will be the Australian link of the Imperial chain. The station will, in all probability, cost something like £50,000. It will be a most important link in the chain if the idea of those who attended the late Imperial Conference is to be given effect. The progress made in connexion with this station should have been stated by the Treasurer when delivering his Budget speech, but it was not. At the present time, we have simply to obtain expressions of opinion from the man in the street regarding the position of this most important station. Neither the Prime Minister nor the Treasurer will vouchsafe any information concerning it. We are asked to vote this money absolutely in the dark. Notwithstanding the assurance given by the Prime Minister last evening, the Government take up the position that they have a majority to-night. They have put two members of our party out of the House. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member may rest assured that the Bill will not be advanced beyond its second-reading stage. The expenditure which is proposed under the heading of " Wireless Telegraphy " is of special importance to the people of Australia. I take particular interest in this matter, for the reason that I inaugurated the system whch has been adopted in the Commonwealth. So far, it has. proved a decided success. We have decided to build a high-power station at Port Darwin; the money for the purpose is to be voted, and yet not a word of information is forthcoming as to how it is to be expended. If the Government intend to yield to the claim of the Marconi Company, that the latter own everything above the earth, I say that, before any payment is made to that company, they will hear from me on the matter. I absolutely dispute that everything above the earth belongs to the Marconi Company. I believe that the patent which has been assigned to the Commonwealth through the medium of the Postmaster-General is perfectly valid. The high-power station at Darwin is a very important one, and one that is necessary to complete the link in the Imperial chain of wireless communication. It ought to be constructed with all possible expedition, and when we are about to construct it we ought not to introduce any system other than that which is already in operation here. I stand by the Commonwealth patent, and I am prepared to support the Government in defending it. If that patent be valid, we are on sound ground, but if it be not valid, let us pay for the rights within Australia, and put an end to litigation. I wish now to refer to the matter of the machinery and plant which are used for stamp printing. I find that a considerable expenditure was incurred upon stamp printing last year. </para>

                            <para>- There appears to be still another expenditure contemplated in regard to the production of stamps. I wish to say that I am particularly dissatisfied with the paper upon which the stamp containing a reproduction of the kangaroo was printed, as well as its perforations and gumming. When we are expending money upon a new stamp, it would not be a bad idea if we obtained the services of a new man to produce it. I feel compelled to say that, because the Australian stamp was never decently treated in the stamp -printing office. If the machinery was deficient, the officer had a right to inform me of the fact. I never received a notification to that effect, and I believe that the defects which I have enumerated were a formidable factor in bringing the stamp into disrepute. </para>

                            <para>- I come now to the subject of the Naval Bases. The people of Western Australia are very dissatisfied with the amount of work which is being undertaken at Cockburn Sound. It is true that the Government have appointed an expert - <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Maurice</inline> Fitzmaurice - to come out and report on the whole question of naval dockyards and naval equipment, including sites. Judging from the conversations I have had with the late Minister of Defence, there does not appear to me to be any doubt that, so far as Cockburn Sound is concerned, the right position has been chosen. The shore works have been practically suspended. How long that is going to continue I do not know, but I hope that it will not be long. The people of Western Australia are very suspicious indeed as to the <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> of the present Government in connexion with making Cockburn Sound one of the Naval Bases. On the shore there is work which could easily occupy a number of men. for some years, so that the ships may ultimately find a suitable base. Our ships are now in Australian waters, but, with the exception of Cockatoo Island, about which also there has been a dispute, so far as the present Government are concerned, not the slightest provision has been made for the ships. Again, this afternoon the honorable member for Hunter pointed out that the submarines will be here towards the end of next year, but no provision has been made for them', although Port Stephens was indicated as the site where the first depot ought to be provided. The Prime Minister assured us last night that there was a sum of £2,000 on the Estimates in order to provide 'a submarine depot. The men engaged by the late Minister of Defence to .do the work on shore in connexion with 'Cockburn Sound - ;and I believe that the same thing applies to Westernport - have been dismissed, and the work is at a standstill. We invited Admiral Henderson to come out and advise us, but the present 'Government apparently take up this .attitude: "What does he know about the matter? 'We will get somebody else out to advise us." In the meantime, the work is 'Stopped ; the ships are here, and may require to be docked, but there is no provision for that purpose. That is ,a most unsatisfactory state of affairs. It appears to me that it is carrying ,out the disposition to be hostile to the Australian Fleet which was displayed here when it was described as a "mosquito fleet." One of the most prominent men on the other side made that statement when the proposal for the Australian Navy was submitted by the Fisher Administration. Apparently their attitude, both at Westernport and at Cockburn Sound, is a continuation of the policy of being opposed to the existence of au Australian Fleet, and to making provision for it. Their attitude is to do anything in order to make a failure of the proposal that was submitted and carried through by the Labour Government. </para>

                        (Adelaide) T12.48 a.m.]. - There is one little matter above all others which, in my opinion, it seems necessary to .emphasize. During this debate there have been references made to the initiation of the naval policy, and efforts -have been made to-day, as they were also made during the election campaign, to create the impression first that Labour members were not in any way responsible for the introduction of the naval policy, that they were, in fact, some of them opposed to it, and that the credit, if there be any credit, should be given to the honorable gentlemen of the Fusion. I am not ,at all particular as to who receives the credit for the initiation of the naval or military policy of the Commonwealth, which I sincerely hope will not ever be .a party question. I am concerned, however, about the ordinary facts of the matter. I am concerned as to whether members of the House shall be put before the electors in a reasonable and proper light. I am concerned when efforts are made to cloud the issue and, in certain circumstances, to take credit for the initiation of a policy, while, when it is supposed that the expenditure in relation thereto is not popular, it is alleged that the policy is that .of the other party. For instance, the Prime Minister, assisted by the honorable member for Moreton, this evening has alleged that to him belongs that credit, and he referred in a pointed manner to the resolution that was carried here on the 24th November, 1909, which, according to him, started the naval policy of the Commonwealth. When, however, we find that exception is taken to the expenditure, which is increasing, which,, in the total, is to be increased this -financial year by £4,100,000 over and above that of last year; when we find that that is somewhat distasteful to the Commonwealth, and that a little objection is being taken here and there; when we find  that honorable members on the Ministerial side -desire some excuse for the huge expenditure, of which they are unanimously approving on this occasion, then they make -references -to what they -call the commitments of the past Administration. And if any exception be taken to the expenditure on defence, the reply is at once  cheerfully  given, " We cannot help ourselves; the Labour Administration committed ,us to it." Now, there is an obligation .on honorable gentlemen to be reasonably fair even to an opponent. There i3 an obligation to be consistent. There is an obligation to deal honorably and properly with the different constituencies. Surely .my honorable friends .do not propose to make a game of politics, and ito .tell the elector one thing with a view to tickling his ears and securing his support, and then to act in a precisely different direction when they have secured election. For if that be the case, Parliament can scarcely claim to be a reflex of public opinion. It cau scarcely claim to be a place where the views -of the electors are to be given effect to. It can scarcely claim the confidence of the electors in such circumstances. W,e have here a striking illustration of how unfair the conduct of honorable members was at election time, and, apparently, is to remain in respect to the naval policy. Honorable gentlemen on the other side cannot have at one and the same time the credit of initiating that policy and relieve themselves of the unpopularity and the distastefulness of the expenditure in regard to the initiation of that policy. .If they want the credit in the first instance, let them take the blame, if blame there be; in the second instance, personally, I do not mind if they do, but they ought not to blow hot and blow cold. They cannot with impunity claim credit in one direction and refuse debit in the other. Let me, however, for a moment refer to the particular question brought up by the honorable member for Moreton. Because nine out of twenty-seven Labour members then occupying seats here voted against the resolution of the Fusion Ministry in 1909, which related to a naval policy, it is now alleged that the Labour party were opposed to "that particular policy. Before an allegation of so sweeping and general a character should be made, .a reasonable view of the situation might be taken, and the whole facts placed carefully before the electors. The motion submitted by the then Minister of Defence, the present Prime Minister, on the submission of which he bases his claim to have initiated the naval policy of the Commonwealth, is to be found in volume LIV., page 6251, of

                    <para class="block">The responsible Minister submitted an abstract motion, and frankly admitted that neither he nor his colleagues, nor their supporters had given the subject of Ways and Means any consideration whatever. That alone would have justified, honorable members in voting against it. To put the facts plainly before the constituencies, it should be told that a mere abstract motion was moved, committing the country to a huge expenditure, consideration to which had not been given by the Ministry, and the amount of which was not known. Parliament was asked to commit the country to a policy, the cost of which Ministers had not considered, and which they said would be considered at some future time. Would any honorable member commit himself to any proposal without a reasonable knowledge of what it would cost, and how the money was to be provided ? Would the honorable member for Wannon buy 5,000 sheep on such terms? In 1909 it was a case of " open your mouth and shut your eyes; do not question in any way' what we propose, because we know nothing about it ourselves." Yet the naval policy was so acceptable, quite apart from details, to many honorable members, that it was carried by a very large majority. </para>

                        <para>- And myself. We showed by our votes that we sincerely desired the initiation of a naval policy, which disproves the recent utterances of the Prime Minister and the honorable member for Moreton. A little later the then Minister of Defence moved the closure, refusing to give information, and refusing to allow any honorable member to say a word for or against the proposal. That fact should be made known to the community before it is attempted to create the impression that we on this side desired to prevent the initiation of a naval policy. If, for' proposing the motion that was carried, honorable members opposite claim credit for the initiation of this policy, well and good, but now that some degree of unpopularity attaches to it, they should not be so pusillanimous as to blame the Opposition, saying, " We cannot help ourselves; these are the commitments of the Opposition." They should say, " We initiated the policy and intend to continue it, and therefore fully approve of the expenditure that has taken place, and the further expenditure that is proposed." To do that would be to show some manliness. But we have had members opposite approving of the expenditure of millions of pounds, and seeking to get behind the word " commitment," alleging that they cannot help themselves. If they desired, they could check expenditure in any direction they like. They could reduce either naval or military expenditure. Old-age pensions and the maternity allowance are statutory commitments from which they cannot escape, but there are huge sums in the Works Estimates and in the General Estimates which they could reduce if they had the will. </para>

                            <para>- My honorable friend should put us to the test. I have seen no indication of a desire to do that. We were successful yesterday in reducing an item for expenditure on Garden Island from £3,000 to £1,000. The honorable member for Eden-Monaro, after threatening in very blunt terms to move the reduction of certain items, particularly in regard to the Northern Territory, failed to give colour to his threats. If the honorable member for Corio feels that this expenditure is too heavy, and that he should, in some measure, retrieve the situation prior to the elections, it is open to him to move amendments and call for a division. Then the honorable member will have on record, not a mere objection or such an emphatic verbal protest as that so  ludicrously  indulged in by the honorable member for Eden-Monaro, but something from which honorable members cannot escape, and indicating what their opinions are. </para>

                            <para>- Unless honorable members divide the House, they <inline font-style="italic">must</inline> take the responsibility of approving of this expenditure of £27,200,000. I certainly voted for the expenditure on the Federal Capital site, and the honorable member for Wannon voted against it. The division is on record to show his constituents that the honorable member was sincere in his attempts to reduce the expenditure. I regarded the Federal compact as a matter of honour between the several States. I venture to say that if a referendum of -the people of South Australia were taken on the Federal Capital expenditure as a separate item, a large majority would not approve of it; but I recognise that there was a compact entered into, and that, after a lapse of ten years, it is reasonable to start giving effect to it. I am afraid it will be some years before members will occupy Parliament House at Canberra, and, except for the frightfully insanitary condition of the chamber we now occupy, I venture to' say honor able members are not sadly displeased at the prospect of Parliament remaining in Melbourne. I am justified in drawing attention to the absence of information supplied by the Ministry. I do not care about making comparisons, but I think it is safe to say that no other Ministry has submitted Estimates with such little information in respect to the different items, or with so little desire to give information. In a few months honorable members will be facing their constituents, quite apart from any election, and they may be invited to give some explanation of the expenditure they are now approving; but I venture to say no honorable member on the Government side can explain in a reasonable manner the expenditure they are now approving by their votes. If Ministers at head-quarters, with all the papers before them, and all the information given them by their experts, cannot explain the expenditure in the House, and have to frankly admit their ignorance, how can honorable members explain it? </para>

Then we must take into consideration that the peculiar conduct of the Prime Minister, aided, to some extent, by the irascibility of the right honorable member for Swan, has led to some of the remarks made during the debate. The inability of any private member to explain these Estimates to the electors might be excused, except that as representatives of the people we ought to demand information regarding them. Honorable members sitting behind the Ministry not only remain quiet, but appear to indorse the attitude of the Government in refusing to give the information which is sought. They seem in some cases to take pleasure in the knowledge that the Ministry are battling through' without giving the information that we seek, and without having a knowledge of the items in the schedule. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Eden-Monaro said that these Estimates were a public scandal, and that he had never heard of Estimates being brought forward as these had been. Such remarks from a Ministerial supporter were somewhat pointed, but the Government "took them smiling." What cared they that one of their supporters chose to speak in this way? They knew full well, I suppose, that he was merely "barking," and would take good care not to bite. They did not give him the information, and he has not got it yet, but he intends to support the Ministry. My experience in State and Federal politics does not extend over many years, but never previously have I known a Ministry to be so ignorant of the proposals submitted by them to Parliament as this Ministry are in the present instance. More particularly ought this point to- be emphasized since finance was the one thing on which, they prided themselves, when before the electors, and about which they made innumerable allegations in respect- of the Fisher Government. They led the people to believe that there was a total, absence of business capacity on our part, and that it rested entirely with them. They were going to establish a system of " sound " finance, we were told, and certainly they made, at the time, a great deal of " sound." They were going, they said, to reestablish responsible government, particularly in the matter of finance. How are they re-establishing it? When we draw attention to the increase in expenditure, they tamely say, " We are committed to it." Is that a re-establishment of anything in the way of responsible government, even assuming for the moment that- there was a call for its reestablishment? Is that an indication that the policy of the late Government was unsound? The Government have to admit that, despite their much vaunted ability in- this direction, they do not propose to make, one alteration. In no particular do we find them making the slightest move to alter, improve, or amend that which we did. The situation is one of the most distressing that has occurred in Australian politics. We find honorable members opposite, who were never tired of prating about- their great business ability, and that, they alone could save the country from financial ruin, doing nothing now that they have complete- control. The Government can do what they will in the matter of finance,, because they have behind them a quiet and cheerful support. Their supporters are prepared to take anything they offer - to feed out of the Ministerial hand, and all that was said at pre-election time may go for nought. It was, iu fact, so much electioneering  clap-trap,  for which there was not a scintilla of justification - a mere appeal to prejudice and the selfish side of human nature. Now that they have- secured political power, they show conclusively they are unable to do the things that ought, to be done, and for the safe and sure reason that it is not necessary to do them. They found, as they knew when before the electors, that there was really nothing the matter with the financial situation, and they have no settled plan or scheme. They were unable to point to any particular instance of extravagance, and their utterances were of the most general character. When repeatedly asked by honorable members on this side to give some specific instance of extravagance, the inevitable result was a shuffle. We know how easily a percentage of the electors- can be frightened by reference to the expenditure of millions of money, but honorable members opposite have signally and shamefully failed to give any specific cases of extravagance. And now that they are in power, there is not one item of Labour expenditure to which they can take exception. As a matter of fact, in all except the maternity allowance, they were as fully committed to the expenditure as we on the Labour side. They declaimed in certain circles against the land tax, but they do not propose to repeal it. They alleged that we were taking money from the States, and so obtaining large sums to meet our expenditure; and this is another instance of their remarkable inconsistency. There was no money taken from the States, the fact being that we merely gave statutory effect to the unanimous agreement which, the Fusion of 1909 had entered into with the States. With an audacity that defies, description, these gentlemen during the election asserted, as I say, that we had secured many millions by depriving the States of their (revenue. Yet they have not made any alteration, and do not propose to give more money to the States. The agreement as to the 25s. per head has to stand, and the present Government are to continue to expend the millions. They declaimed against the "colossal expenditure of the Labour Government on defence, but there is no indication in these Estimates of any reduction. On the contrary, there are many instances in which the Government, of their own volition, deliberately propose to increase the expenditure. Could we have a more amazing or more shocking change of front than that shown by honorable members opposite in relation to finance ? The honorable member for Gippsland, for instance, was one who was loud in  his  utterances on this point, if the newspapers in his electorate are to "be- believed. I do not know the political leanings of those newspapers, "but, according to the honorable member's statements, they seem to have done him a great injustice. I do not know why I should be brought into the matter, but quite a number of people in Gippsland seem to think that I have a personal interest in it, for they keep sending me newspapers with marked reports of speeches bY the honorable member when seeking election as to the great expenditure indulged in by the Fisher Administration. The honorable member has given us his explanation, but I am not going into the details, because", apart from that explanation, there is enough to prove that Labour finance was his trump card - the whip which he used to lash the electors to boiling point. He secured his election by declaring that if he were returned this vast expenditure would be curtailed; but what action has he taken during the discussion on the Estimates to have any reduction made, and thus substantiate the great stand he took when before the electors. Whilst the expenditure of £23,100,000 last year called forth the denunciations of the honorable member, the proposal of the present Government is to spend £27,200,000 during the current financial year, or no less than £4,100,000 more than the expenditure of last year. Does the honorable member recognise the enormity of this, in view of his electioneering utterances? Some of his electors may call' his attention to the expenditure pro posed for this year, and to the fact that he is indorsing it cheerfully, makes no Request for an explanation of it, and is meekly assisting Ministers to put through votes which they admit themselves they do not understand. </para>

                            <para>- I. feel grateful to the honorable member for his generosity to the workers. I hope that his explanation will be satisfactory to his constituents. If it takes £27,200,000 to do justice to the workers this year, does not the honorable member see that he must have been wrong when he so bitterly declaimed against the expenditure of £23,100,000 in the interests of the workers last year? Has their number increased so suddenly, and to such an extent, that this year it is necessary that £4,100,000 more than was expended last year should be spent in their interests ? The honorable member's reason for supporting this expenditure is puerile. </para>

He is, no doubt, somewhat indisposed because of the reasonable criticism which has been offered to the Government proposals, but he does not do himself justice when he suggests that I do not keep my word. That is a wickedly incorrect statement for the right honorable gentleman to make. It does not follow that, because he is rich in worldly goods, he has any greater sense of honour than has any other member of the House. </para>

                            <para>- I shall not pursue that matter, bub the right honorable gentleman's suggestion that I have broken my word was personally offensive. When this Bill is passed, Ministers will have the right to commence the expenditure of £3,266,000. At the close of the financial year, and not before, we shall know whether the money has been expended, and whether the Government are justified in the Estimates they have submitted. Judging by the fact that they are quite unable to give us any information upon the items of the schedule-, if my predictions be correct, the financial position ten or twelve months hence will be deplorable, and the eyes of the electors will be more fully opened to the fact that, so far as the finances of the Commonwealth are concerned, they were gulled during the recent elections. I have made only general references on the second reading of the Bill, but I felt it necessary tp place on record the fact that we are asked to consent to the expenditure of £3,266,000, that Ministers are trying to get this Bill through with as little discussion as possible, have admitted that they know little or nothing about many of the items in the schedule, have refrained from giving information desired by honorable members, and that the expenditure they propose proves conclusively that the major portion of their utterances during the recent election in relation to finance were unworthy, uncalled for, and unjustifiable. Now that they have complete control, and are in a position to give effect to their policy, they propose to increase the expenditure over that incurred last year by some millions of pounds. I do sincerely hope that the highest anticipations of those who support this expenditure will be amply realized. I trust that the money will be expended in a direction which will meet with the approval of the electors, and that, though the outlook appears very black, the result will be to some extent acceptable to the general community. </para>

                        <para>. - The time when the honorable member should have asked for this information was when we were dealing with the Estimates. It is unusual to ask these questions at this stage. However, I am prepared to supply the information which he seeks. It is proposed to establish a Navy Office at the Victoria Barracks instead of having a separate building in another part of the city. Accommodation will thus be provided at the barracks for both Military and Naval Offices. </para>

May I appeal to my two honorable friends opposite to give us the third reading of the Bill to-night, so that the Senate may be able to deal with it? To-day is to be devoted to private members' business, and it would be a great convenience if I were allowed to move the third reading of the Bill now in order that the Senate may get it without delay. </para>
