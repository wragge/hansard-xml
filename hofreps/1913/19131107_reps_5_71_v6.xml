                    <para>- I desire to make a persona&#93; explanation. I was not allowed during the turmoil on Wednesday night to do so, though I then endeavoured to put my complaint before the Chair, that Ministers had refused to carry out the promise that they had made to allow ample debate on the Postal Voting Restoration Bill. When I found that, instead of that promise being carried out, the closure was applied, I made use of a certain expression, applying it to the statement of those . on the Ministerial bench. I used it when smarting under a sense of injustice, because a promise which had been made had not been kept. </para>

                        <para>-  I should like to ask the Prime Minister a question. It does not relate to a matter of party importance, and is one which I think he will answer. I ask if he has noticed that1 the new President of China, to get rid of the Opposition, has ejected the whole crowd? Does he intend to follow that course <inline font-style="italic">1</inline></para>

                            <para>- I should like to know from the right honorable member whether there is any chance of soon putting a termination to the debate which he proposes to initiate ? There are two motions on the notice-paper, both of which are censure motions. Unless something is done in regard to them, there will be opened up an almost interminable debate, the end of which no one can foresee. We are nearly at the end of the year; our business is still uncompleted, and I&#39; do not think that we ought to tolerate much further debate on these matters. </para>

                            <para>- One might have expected the Prime Minister to know yesterday the policy of the Government and the course that he intended to pursue. When I gave notice of my motion, he asked me whether I thought the debate on it could be reasonably concluded today, and I said &#34; no.&#34; He asked when it would be concluded, and I said that I thought it would be finished in the early sittings of next week. I adhere to that, because it is necessary that honorable members should be afforded an opportunity of being heard on important matters of concern to the people of this country. The Prime Minister stated then that the Government were most anxious to get on with public business. But immediately the House rose, his colleague in the Senate, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> moved that the Senate, at its rising, should adjourn until the 19th inst. </para>

                            <para>- Does the honorable member for Grampians ask the House and the country to believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> acts on his own individual responsibility, and not upon instructions by his Prime Minister? Is that the way in which this Government carries on its business &#39;! Does the reputed leader in another place act upon his own responsibility, while the Leader in this House takes action upon his individual responsibility, and then corrects it next day? We are beginning to learn something. We are securing information which we did not expect. There is no justification at all for the plea of urgency in this chamber whilst another place is not sitting. But whether that be so or not, the promise made by the Opposition in this House will be kept. We keep our promises. </para>

                            <para>- I shall deal with that when it comes before the House. It is not before the House now, and it would be foolish for me to discuss that, or any subsequent business except the Government business, with which it is my duty to deal at present. I draw attention to the fact that the action of the Government has made this assembly no longer a deliberative one. It is just as well that the people should know that, unless this Parliament is restored to what it was, and must ever remain in a free community, the interests of the citizens of Australia will suffer. Corruption can, and will, creep in, unless honorable members are free to express their opinions in this House. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member knows that the Standing Orders place a time limit on speeches in this Chamber, and that no honorable member can trespass beyond that limitation which is provided for by this Parliament. If the Government were honest and straightforward in the matter - if they thought that the time allowed was excessive - they ought to amend the Standing Orders, as other Governments have done. The excessive use of the closure has been in the interests, not of public business, but of the political views of the present Administration. Speaking recently in his own Legislature on the matter of closuring even great questions, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Wilfrid</inline> Laurier, who is certainly an authority not to be lightly set aside, said that his Government, during his twenty years of leadership, had never once moved the closure, although it was provided for, and there was an occasion when the Opposition in the Canadian Parliament held up a measure for over six months without allowing a single line to pass. </para>

                            <para>- The Prime Minister asks why I supported the passing of the closure standing order. The closure, in my opinion, is a perfectly proper piece of machinery to prevent deliberate and wilful obstruction. But during our term of office we passed eighty odd measures without once applying the closure. One of those measures was passed only after the Opposition of that day had opposed it for twenty-three solid hours. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so. It was passed after a continuous sitting of forty-two hours, during which the Leader of the present Government kept his party here to oppose us. We never even thought of applying the closure so long as we believed that honorable members had anything useful to say. We maintained the traditions of Parliament as a deliberative assembly. This Government has lost them. I believe it was at the suggestion of the present Prime Minister that the closure standing order was brought in. </para>

                            <para>- I ask, is it contended that a reasonable debate took place on the Loan Bill before the application of the closure? If there are any Government proposals which ought to be left open to full, free, and open discussion they are its financial measures. The Loan Bill, which was introduced by the Treasurer provides for an appropriation of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;3,080,000.</inline> The right honorable member moved the second reading of the Bill one afternoon, and when he resumed his seat 1 replied to some statements made by him, which were likely to leave a false impression in the minds of the people, and which I thought should be at once refuted. Having made that part of my speech, I asked for leave to continue my remarks at a later date. </para>

                    <para class="block">The Minister of Trade and Customs was then the only member of the Government present. I subsequently asked the Prime Minister to be allowed to continue my speech in accordance with what has been the practice of this House from its inception. That request was refused. The question, &#34; that the debate be adjourned,&#34; was then put, and it was carried against the Government. At the very next sitting the closure was applied. It must be said to the credit of the Prime Minister that it was not moved by him. He did not seem to desire to support the moving of the closure. </para>

                            <para>- It was interesting to notice the eagerness with which the Prime Minister, the Minister of Trade and Customs, and the Honorary Minister vied with each other subsequently to get in first with the motion &#34; that the question be now put.&#34; Sometimes all three of them were on their feet at the same time trying to catch the eye of the  Speaker  or the  Chairman,  and to move &#34;that the question be now put.&#34; They seemed to think that there was honour attaching to&#39; it. They wanted to be in touch with the real leader of the party. I admit that the honorable member for Darling Downs, after making three or four unsuccessful attempts to get in with the motion, seemed to be very crestfallen until the following day, when he had the good fortune to catch the eye of the  Speaker,  and therefore, the privilege of moving for once the application of the closure. </para>

                            <para>- I am the last, as you know, sir, to come into conflict with an opinion expressed by the Chair - even if it be what I may call an extra opinion - but I understand that you can hear nothing unless you see something, and unless an honorable member catches your eye he cannot move even the closure. We shall, however, leave that matter, for it has nothing to do with this debate. The point that I wish to make is that the closure was moved by the Attorney-General, and was moved to stifle discussion, and not to secure the passing of the Bill. There is in the Loan Bill an item which is new, and for supporting which not one honorable member opposite has any warrant. The elections of 1910 were fought largely on the question of the Financial Agreement between the States and the Commonwealth, and, secondly, on the question of the use of loan money for defence purposes. The country gave us a substantial, solid verdict on that question. Under this Loan Bill loan moneys are appropriated in respect of ordinary defence expenditure. Yet no honorable member of the Opposition was given an opportunity to discuss that particular item. When the matter came before us in Committee - a place of which you, sir, have no cognisance - I tried to catch the eye of the  Chairman  because I desired, by moving an amendment, to enable a discussion to take place upon the question. Even then, the question was at once put, so that I had no opportunity to discuss it. There has been introduced into the Loan Bill a proposal which may lead to unlimited expenditure on ordinary defence purposes, and may thus violate the principle that has been agreed to by a majority of the electors. </para>

                            <para>- It is fair, I think, that I should explain. I have stated my position again and again, but I shall state it once more. A Government which pledges the credit of the country for ordinary annual defence services, except in time of emergency - o&#34;f war or impending war - is a Government that should not be permitted to remain in office in a country such as this. Ordinary defence expenditure means equipment, the purchase of land for buildings, and even rifle ranges and manoeuvre areas - these are ordinary services of the country. If we pledge our credit in time of prosperity, when there has been left to the Government a  surplus  of &#163;2,653,000, and when the Government are spending over &#163;4,000,000 more than we did last year, how can any one expect the resources of the country to meet the demands in future years? The Government have gone back directly on the verdict of the people, and they have done this purposely, willingly, and determinedly; indeed, I believe if they had the opportunity they would do it again. At the last election the cry was raised that the previous Government had been extravagant, and that if honorable gentlemen opposite were returned they would reduce expenditure and conserve the people&#39;smoney - that they would not go in for an expenditure of anything like &#163;21,000,000 or &#163;22,000,000, but would protect the interests of the people in this respect. Well, the present Government came into place - though not inter power - and they sit there to-day, not by virtue of a majority of the electors. They hold their places with a minority vote in this House, and in the other House, so far as the electors are concerned; and from that point of view they have no warrant,, in my opinion, for carrying on the affairs of the country. They are quite entitled, being in office, to carry on the government within the rules of this- House, and within administrative rules,, as they think best in the interests of the country; but beyond that they have no warrant at all. </para>

                            <para>- My contention is that the Government have no warrant in carrying on the government to alter the policy of the country, and, in endeavouring <inline font-style="italic">to do</inline> so, to suppress debate. Their attempt to rouse the country against the alleged extravagant expenditure of the previous Government has absolutely failed. They are asking Parliament to expend over- &#163;4,000,000 more than was even proposed on the Estimates last year, and the proportion set aside in the Loan Bill for defence expenditure is totally and absolutely unwarranted. I should like to- briefly refer to what the Treasurer said in introducing the Loan Bill. The right honorable gentleman certainly left the impression on the minds of honorable members and of the country that the late Government, during their term of office, had largely increased the loan indebtedness of the people of Australia. That is not so. According to the Constitution, the Commonwealth had to take over the transferred properties&#39; indebtedness, together with the Northern Territory expenditure, under an agreement, and all the loan expenditure, which it was undoubtedly due to the Commonwealth to take over. We expended out of revenue for loan purposes some millions of money, which, in my opinion, were properly expended in the services of the country. The Treasurer also said just enough to leave the impression that during our term of office we had added &#163;637,000 to loan expenditure in the Northern Territory. We did nothing of the kind. That was an indebtedness incurred by South Australia, and we simply took it over as part of the indebtedness of the people of Australia. In these matters we did not add a single penny to the debt of the Commonwealth; so that that may pass. We expended &#163;200,000 out of our annual income in reducing the transferred debt of the Northern Territory. The Treasurer stated that the indebtedness of the Commonwealth is now about &#163;22,000,000; and that is quite true. I mention this to honorable members, and to the electors, for the reason that a large number of the supporters of honorable members opposite, and their press advocates, have paraded the fact that, during our term of office, we incurred a liability on behalf of the Commonwealth of some &#163;20,000,000 odd. We have incurred no new liabilities; but the people of the Commonwealth, through this Parliament, have become responsible for that sum, instead of the various States remaining responsible to the money-lender. That is the absolute and known fact, although it lends itself very easily to misrepresentation. </para>

                            <para>- lt is a sorry matter that these things have to be stated again and again for the protection of honorable members, and for the benefit of the people of the country who do not know the facts. I come now to the Electoral Bill. When the present Government came into office, the first statement they made to the country - as the honorable member for Ballarat, particularly, will remember - was that it was their business to purify the rolls, and then go to the country. The Honorary Minister alleged that the rolls contained an excessive number of names, and that many thousands of persons had abused their trust by voting doubly. However, since that time, the Government have not proved a single one of those allegations. They submitted a Bill, in which they made provision for an alteration in regard to the attestation of postal votes, to the extent of preventing the attestator getting possession of the ballot-paper. We were told that  this  was an essential part of the amendment of the Electoral Act ; but later we find the Government coming down with a Bill of one clause, in which they eliminate that proposal, though it was said to be essential, and thus leave the practice just as it was before. On this point, we did not have the slightest explanation - not the merest information on the point, or any reason was given; and, although they said the old provision was unworkable, or, rather, was not safe, we find it proposed to be restored by the use of the &#34;gag.&#34; There is another Bill that we are promised, which might have met the same fate as the Loan Bill and the Electoral Bill if this motion had not been submitted. That is the Bill to be called the &#34; Government Preference Prohibition Act 1913,&#34; and its one clause is in these terms - </para>

The Attorney-General suggested that I was not in order in referring to the Bill in this debate, but you, sir, took no exception to my doing so; and I thought that, perhaps, the Attorney-General was going to raise a point of order. This important Bill, in my opinion, strikes at a principle by which the Labour party, at any rate, are prepared to stand. </para>

                            <para>- The proposal of the Government is that they are prepared to penalize private employers - if it is a penalty for the Court to decide a matter - but they are not prepared, to guarantee to the workmen in the Government employ the same protection as workmen in private employ can secure. This proposal, with a pretended plea to make every one equal, is, apparently, a determination on the part of the Government to differentiate between Government employe&#39;s and private employes, to the detriment of the private employer. Why should we put a burden on the private employer, a contractor, for instance, that we will not put on our own Government.  I  have often said that Parliament is the most incompetent Court to deal with industrial matters, and the transfer of the  decision as regards wages and conditions of labour from Parliament to a Court is one of the best things that has ever happened. The Court can examine every trade and every industry, and determine what are fair and reasonable wages and conditions, and if it does so every reasonable Government and Parliament will see that the award of the Court is carried out. But the Prime Minister went a great deal further in his earlier days before he came into contact with the gentlemen now surrounding him. He said that when he was the secretary of a union he took good care that no unionists would work with non-unionists. They took most drastic action to see that that was carried out. He also said in the Chamber later on that if he were in the same position to-day he would do the very same thing. But he is not in that same position; he is to-day with other people, and so he does the very opposite. He is a veritable Vicar of Bray in the matter; he will do anything for the company he is in. As secretary for a union he would fight for that union, and speak for it in the most manly way; he declared that unionists were better than non-unionists; he quoted Gladstone and Thorold Rogers to show that the unionists had done more for the world than, perhaps, any other body the world had hitherto known, and that they were expected to do more in the future; and he said that the attempt to victimize unionists was an attempt by selfish employers to degrade unionists and destroy them, and keep from them that to which they were justly entitled. But now that he is in a position of trust and honour, he is prepared to go back on all that, and to declare that unionists may fight in their unions, that they may be victimized, and that they may secure the passage of legislation through Parliament; but that when he gets the opportunity he will wipe out that legislation and prevent unionists being treated even as fairly as others.  His  colleague, the Attorney-General, is not in that position. He does not believe in any pandering or in any special legislation for the protection of unionists. </para>

                    <para class="block">Minister, on the plea that preference to unionists is unjust, because public money is used to discriminate between unionists and non-unionists, has gone back on every profession he made when he was a unionist and until he took office on this occasion; and he does not seem to be in the slightest way ashamed of it. It is too late in the day for any Government or any Parliament to try to crush out unionism or unionists. The path of the progress of the world is strewn with the bodies of those who have been victimized - and their children too - in getting to the stage of industrial unionism that we have now reached, and I feel sure that whatever the attempt of the Government may be, the Democracy of Australia will take care that the rights of unionists are protected, not only as regards private employment, but also as regards public employment. The proposal of the Government is intended to prejudice the electors of the country, and to hit at the unionist and place him at a serious disadvantage. . I pledge myself to do all I can to make it absolutely impossible for the Government to carry out their policy in this regard. </para>

                            <para>- The suggestion of the honorable member is that the proposal of the Government must be accepted in order to get honest work out of unionists. The charge is absolutely unwarranted, and it is one that the Prime Minister and his colleagues will not try to prove. In his earlier days, the Prime Minister said that unionists had to work harder than free labourers. I agree with him. The Prime Minister knows it is true to-day. Let any honorable member on the Ministerial side become a prominent unionist, and see whether he can get off with less work than the average free labourer. Let them experiment in that way, and see whether the Prime Minister was not right in what ha said in his earlier days. It seems to be a popular cry at present to denounce th&#39;e unionists as loafers, and so on. We heard a great deal of that during the election. What proof have we since the present Government came into office that it was so? There is not the slightest proof that any abuse followed the recognition of unionistic principle, or that during our term of office men were allowed to draw public money that they did not earn. As a matter of absolute fact the unionist has always to earn his money much harder than the privileged non-unionist. The Prime Minister at different times during the last fifteen years has said that he was against unionists working with non-unionists, the reason being that non-unionists were used by employers to reduce the wages and conditions of labour of unionists; and now he is doing his utmost to compel unionists to work with non-unionists in the Public Service. What right has he to do that? If he believes in the principles he has hitherto enunciated, he ought not to be a party to this measure. I can only conclude that he has been driven into this position by those with whom he is now associated . </para>

That was before this Bill was introduced; but now this Bill is before us as a declaration of policy, and the proposal, if it means anything, is to discriminate between unionists and non-unionists. At any rate, supposing that we brush that point to one side, what remains of his declaration that no unionist should be asked to work alongside of a non-unionist ? Underlying this proposal, I believe that more astute members of the Government than the Prime Minister himself have in view an industrial conflict by which they hope to gain politically. If the statement is true, that a unionist cannot honestly work with a non-unionist, there is bound to be trouble in the Public Service. </para>

If the unionist, who has only his hands between himself and the starvation of his wife and children, protests, a great body of the press, and a great number of the representatives of the people here, howl him down as a striker, but if he happens to belong to a learned profession, or be in a good position in society, he can refuse to perform the services of his office, and still remain a gentleman. The other day we learned from the honorable member for Wentworth that the Government, since they came into office, had saved the country &#163;126,000. Much has been made of this statement; but when the honorable member for Grey interrogated the Minister of External Affairs on the same point, the Minister said there was uo truth in that matter - that there was no saving at all. </para>

                            <para>- I do not want to misrepresent anybody. I wish to deal with several of the Prime Minister&#39;s statements, which I have had no opportunity to discuss. One is his statement, often, repeated, that, if the Opposition had been in office, they would have imposed extra taxation during this Parliament. That may be the Prime Minister&#39;sopinion, but it is against the public policy of the party. No such proposal would have been made, and no fresh taxation would have been imposed. It is a cunning insinuatory suggestion to the public that Codlin is their friend, and not Short. I think they will be inclined to change their friends soon if they get an opportunity. Another extraordinary and unusual statement made publicly by the Prime Minister was that* when he came into office he found a <inline font-style="italic">set</inline> of papers minuted by myself regarding the transfer of Admiralty House, and it was only by his strenuous action and careful consideration that the Commonwealth was not robbed of the value of that property. There is nothing in that file of papers to warrant the statement. It is another attempt to mislead the public as to the facts. I would ask the Prime Minister to put the papers on the table of the Library. </para>

                            <para>- A valuation is absolutely necessary in connexion with the transfer properties. For three or five years we were examining the values of the properties of the States for the purposes of transfer, and therefore, in this case, it was necessary to have a valuation, but there was no proposal with -the intention of coming to an agreement for the Commonwealth to pay for that property if it belonged to ourselves. The question at issue was whether the transfer was to the Commonwealth from the Imperial Government or to the State, and whether in the latter case it had to be transferred to the Commonwealth from the State as their property. I hope this debate will give the Government the opportunity they have been seeking for a long time to get to the country. If they have any honest intention to do so, I think they will get their opportunity. One cannot believe that they intend to suppress discussion in this House on the casting vote of the presiding officer. One cannot believe that it is the ambition of a party which claims to be a Liberal party to prevent free discussion here on matters of public finance. The Government have no policy. What they have is a mere tentative policy for the time being, and the spectacle that we have seen in this House lately must have been painful to most constitutionalists who have witnessed it. We have over thirty honorable members on the opposite side of the House representing various constituencies, holding divers opinions, sitting silent when important subjects are brought forward, being asked by the </para>

Occasionally we hear a murmur of dissent from one member or another, but it never goes beyond that. That is not the attitude of men who desire to again visit their constituents. That is not the attitude of a Government who feel themselves embarrassed by the present situation, and wish to consult their masters again. This taunt by the Government of a desire to go to the country when they are ready is the merest pretence. Theirs is the responsibility, not ours. The weeping and whining of the Prime Minister to the press, that he will not be allowed to go to the country on his own terms is not in keeping with the dignity of the office that he holds. He has often referred to my dignity, and he will pardon me if I refer to it once in respect to his office. He is Prime Minister, and, I believe, he is proud of it. If the Government think that the electors should be again consulted, why do they not consult them ? The Opposition are prepared to give them every opportunity to do so. There has never been a Government in this Parliament who have bowed their necks so much to the press of the country as have the present Government. From the most important to the least important member of the present Ministry, not one of them says anything in this House which he considers smart criticism of the Opposition without looking up to the metropolitan press gallery to see whether the press are taking notice of what is being said. The Government have been entirely guided by the press. By looking at what appears in the press from time to time, the Opposition can tell what the policy of the Government is to be. We have seen them change their policy in a day, and in an hour, at the dictates of the great metropolitan press of this country. What happened only to-day? The Prime Minister, taken off his guard yesterday, moved the adjournment of the House. It was evident that that did not meet with the views of his Cabinet or the approval of his press supporters, and to-day we have witnessed the extraordinary spectacle of a Prime Minister interrogating the Leader of the Opposition three or four times in order to cover his retreat and protect his position. Honorable members and the public should bear in mind that this humiliating spectacle has taken place in the National Parliament of Australia. It is a degradation to which I venture to say no previous possessors of the high offices held by Ministers have ever submitted to, and I trust none will ever submit to such a degradation in the future. It is due to Australia, and to the Federal Parliament, that those holding office as Ministers of the Crown should possess some sense of national responsibility. </para>

                            <para>- No. I have never courted or. sought office in the way the honorable gentleman has sought it. I was never induced to desert an unpopular party by the hope of office. I have never recommended my political friends on any occasion to take part in a coalition. I should never willingly be a party to a coalition whilst the Labour party have a definite platform of social, industrial, and national legislation.I believed in the policy of the Labour party, and believe in it to-day. It is a policy that will live, and will continue to be an inspiration to many men and women. It says to the tyrant, &#39; 1 You shall not tyrannize over the weak.&#34; It says to the sick, unfortunate, and afflicted, &#34;It is the duty of society to protect and succour you in every possible way.&#34; So far as has been practicable and possible we have put that policy before the people of Australia, and have given legislative expression to as much of it as we could during our term of office. Consideration as to the popularity or unpopularity of their policy would never influence members of this party to seek to attain office,  which  is a merely passing phase of public life. Their sole consideration is the promotion of legislation and administration which will lead to the improvement of the social conditions of the people, and will stand to the credit of the nation. I wish now to refer to a national phase of the Government policy. The Government propose to spend large sums of money from loan, as well as from revenue, on defence, but they have quite failed to grasp the national spirit of the defence policy of this country. Their policy on the naval side is absolutely flabby. They are shirking their responsibility in the most marked way. Fancy the Minister of Defence saying to our Admiral, &#34; Go and do as you like !&#34; The Minister has no right to take up such a position. The responsibility for the defence of the country rests with the Government. It was, I suppose, a mere accident that the people of Melbourne desired that the Fleet should come here at Cup time. The Government shirked their Ministerial responsibilities in dealing with the matter. Bigger and more straightforward men would have said, &#34; If the Admiral advises that the men of the Fleet should undergo training, instead of coming here to play, that is the policy of the Government.&#34; Instead of doing that Ministers shuffled out of their responsibilities in the most undignified way. </para>

No money would be expended on the Navy if I thought such expenditure could be avoided. The experience of the world in this matter has only one lesson for us. The lamp of the past is our only guide for the future, and I ask honorable members to tell me of any country, poor or rich, that has escaped the ravages of war or invasion. Is Australia to be the only country in the world to escape the experience of war ? </para>

I say that in connexion with social and national legislation the present Government have since they came into power absolutely failed to carry out the mandate of the country. In my opinion, they have no warrant to retain office if they cannot give effect to the policy they announced to the electors. I hope that the Prime Minister will take his courage in both hands, and, instead of continuously whining and talking about what he is going to do, will seek the first opportunity to consult those to whom he owes his presence in thi3 House.

                                <para>- The right honorable member for Wide Bay made some reference to another Chamber, and the conduct of business there. That, and perhaps another, are the only points I wish to clear up. In the first place, the Senate has been adjourned until the 19th of this month. It was adjourned on the motion of the Minister of Defence, who is the leader of the Senate. I believe a division was called for on the motion, and that fourteen members of the Opposition voted with the Government to close the Senate until the 19th of this month. Moreover, I believe that the motion was moved at the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. </para>

It is quite true that we are weak there, and therefore those who are strong - the Opposition - must take the responsibility of determining the conduct of the business in that Chamber.

                                <para>- Reference has been made to the enormity of the crime of applying the closure in this House. I shall not debate that matter, because I do not attempt seriously to reply to the statements which have been made by the Leader of the Opposition. They do not deserve a serious reply, for the reason that they have already been replied to scores of times during this session. Not one single new question was suggested or propounded by the right honorable member. He simply gave us a re-hash of the same old &#34;tripe&#34; that we have heard during the past four months. I wish to say that whatever has been done in regard to the application of the closure has been done in an attempt to expedite the public business of this country. My right honorable friend said that his Government passed eighty-three Acts during the last Parliament without the imposition of the closure. We have scarcely been able to pass one Act this session without its application. Why? Simply because of the difference between the attitude of the Opposition towards his Government and the attitude of the Opposition towards this Government. There can be no other reason. We have not been blocking public business. We have been endeavouring to push it through. If the right honorable member was able to get eighty -three Acts through this Parliament without the application of the closure, the Opposition to his Government must have treated him infinitely better than the present Opposition is treating us. His statement, therefore, carries its own condemnation, and is the clearest of all imputations on the fair and reasonable conduct of the Opposition in this Chamber. </para>

It was not, as my right honorable friend has suggested, applied without my consent, and in spite of me. Nothing of the kind. It was I who first suggested the application of the closure. I am responsible for its imposition, as any Prime Minister should be. I may tell the right honorable member something more - that the Attorney-General wished to be very much more gracious to the Opposition on that particular occasion. He was prepared to let them go for two or three hours longer. I thought they had gone long enough in the interests of the country, and I am responsible for the first application of the closure. Indeed, I am responsible for every application of it. I wish to say that the Government did but their duty. With these things cleared out of the way, while I had prepared a reply to an indictment of the Government had it been seriously made, I absolutely refuse to waste the time of the country in taking any further part in a discussion of this kind. </para>

                            <para>. - The Prime Minister, having nothing to say in answer to the charge made against him by the Leader of the Opposition, and being unable to trust himself to make the answer in which he usually indulges when charges are made to which he is unable to reply, has sat down. In doing so he is acting in harmony with the character which he has lately assumed of being furiously desirous of getting on with the business of the country. The most serious accusation which can be levelled against any man in public life is that he obstructs the transaction of the business of the people. I think, perhaps, that I may be permitted on this occasion to review the present position, so far as it affects the conduct of public business in this House. The Leader of the Opposition has reminded the Prime Minister that parties in this Chamber are evenly divided, but that, as a matter of fact, the aggregate votes recorded for members on this side of the House at the last election was greater than the aggregate vote recorded for honorable members upon the other side. </para>

                                <para>- In this House parties are evenly divided. In the other Chamber the position is very well known. There are twenty-nine senators who belong to the Labour party, and seven who belong to the Liberal party. It is a fact that on the appeal to the country at the last election the returns show a clear and overwhelming majority in favour of the Labour party. I am not now speaking of the eighteen men who remained, but of the results of the last election, and I say that in the Senate Labour was returned with an overwhelming majority. </para>

                                <para>- The figures are, as I have represented, so far as the aggregate vote is concerned. The Liberal senators went to the country, and were decimated. The Government are in office. They have a majority of one. The situation is unique in this Parliament, and almost unique in Australia. The Government are carrying on the business of the country. They came into office on the 25th June, and they have been in office ever since. They have had as full control of the business of this House from the moment that it met at the beginning of the session as they have to-day. We are now told - and the whole show that we have seen played here for the last week or so has been intended to create the impression - that the business of the country is being ruthlessly and relentlessly obstructed by the Opposition. What are the actual facts ? For the state of public business to-day the Government are entirely responsible. They put their programme in the Governor-General&#39;s Speech, and set it before the country. I ask honorable members to say what effort they have made to give effect to that programme? The most serious indictment I can level against the Government is that they have been absolutely treacherous to the constituencies of the Commonwealth. They were returned to power upon what I shall show to be false pretences. The greatest inducement which any party can offer to a man in these days is that it will - if returned to power - cost him less in taxation than he has been paying, and that it will reduce his cost of living. There is no argument known to man since first speech was given to him which is so effective as that which touches his pocket. The Government, headed by the honorable member for Parramatta, swept over the country on this one cry - that the Fisher Government had been guilty of reckless extravagance, and that if returned to power they would introduce economical and good &#39;government, and that they would reduce the taxation of the people. They said that the cost of living, which was towering so high, was due to the Labour <inline font-style="italic">regime,</inline> and the legislation of the Labour party. Upon that cry they were returned, and in spite of their pretexts, and of the fact that they have at their back the press of this country, by which alone they are enabled to live, and without which they would not be here for twenty-four hours, they have utterly failed to even attempt to fulfil their solemn pledges. I ask them to say what attempt they have made since they came into office to reduce the cost of living, or to decrease taxation ? They have done nothing. There has never been a Government which, in such short time, so completely violated its pledges to the people. The position would have some tinge of humour were it not so tragic. An Administration returned to reduce public expenditure has increased it at a greater rate than any that has ever occupied the Treasury bench in this Chamber. So much for that. Now for the charge of obstruction of public business levelled against the Opposition by the Government. There never was a more baseless charge. Ministers, from the day on which they met Parliament, have been able to determine the order in which public business should be taken, what the hours of sitting should be, what business pressed through, and so on. What have they done? They have adjourned the House on every conceivable occasion; they have sat as few hours as possible; they have done nothing to push on public business, They have deliberately wasted the time of this House by futile attempts at legislation, which were never honestly pushed home; and by leaving high and dry on the shoals of time the measure on which they had staked their existence, declaring it to be the first necessary step in the direction of reform - I refer to the Electoral Bill - they have exposed to every man who is not purblind the insincerity of their professions and the hollowness of their actions. They have introduced in place of what they promised two quack measures, with which they hope to delude the people into thinking that they are honestly carrying out their pledges. The Prime Minister spoke of the weakness of the indictment of the Leader of the Opposition. The only weakness of the right honorable member&#39;s indictment was this: that he spoke the truth, and was courteous, and, perhaps, too mild, in his language. He did not insult the Prime Minister. He did not remind him of the depth of the turpitude to which he has of late so frequently descended. The Prime Minister, confronted with his past, refuses to recognise ft. He has only one answer to every argument - I am wrong, he has two - his answers are, &#34; That the question be now put,&#34; or &#34; The honorable member is insulting.&#34; Upon those two answers he rests his case. </para>

                        <para>The Prime Minister pretends we have obstructed necessary legislation. Let us see. When the Labour Government took office in 1910, it had a programme of which it was not ashamed. Its measures having been put before the country, had received the indorsement of the people, and it came to Parliament to give effect to its mandate. The most important of these measures were those providing for land value taxation, defence, the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank, and the establishment of a note issue. Ministers resolutely set to work to place those and other similar measures on the statute-book. They did not place a Bill on the table merely to deceive the people. They pushed on with their measures day after day, and had the satisfaction of closing the session of 1910 with the bulk of their programme on the statute-book. That was the record of men who were in earnest and faithful to their pledges. But on the other side there is not a man who is not perjured, so far as his electoral pledges are concerned. Honorable members opposite told the people what they would do, but they have not kept their promises. They have made no attempt to keep them. But, on the other hand, they have done that which stifled free speech in this Parliament. The honorable member for Werriwa, for example, stood for independence of thought and action. He would have nothing to do with Caucus chains and fetters, that prevent expression being given to a man&#39;s inmost and best thoughts. He was for liberty of speech and action. He was for lightening the taxation of the people, and for reducing the cost of living. But to-day he sits behind his Government, manacled and fettered, and is not permitted to say that which he would give ten years of his life to be able to say, knowing that, if he said it, he would be blotted out from the political life of this country. What does the party opposite, that pretends to stand for freedom of thought and action, do when any of its members dares to say a word against the ukase or mere <inline font-style="italic">ipse dixit</inline> of its leaders ? What did it do to the honorable member for Flinders, the very apostle of liberty, when he made his famous speech at Korumburra ? It compelled him to eat his words. What did it do when the honorable member for Parkes stated that he was willing to follow <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> if he knew which way <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> was going? The press supporting the party at once said, &#34; This is not the time for independence,&#34; and he was made to eat his words. What is being done now in New South Wales, where <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> McMillan has declared that the Liberal leagues have been packed, and that there is no chance for independent thought and action? He is vehemently demanding freedom of speech and action, and is not tolerated by the Liberal party. Those of us who know the honorable member for Werriwa are aware that it is not his nature to sit quiet, and that he now does so because he dare not speak. For he cannot approve, yet dare not disapprove, the actions of this Government. What a position for a free man ! I would not do what he is doing even to stay in political life. The Attorney-General poses as a man of bold, independent thought. He came into the House a little while ago and said, &#34; Here is the Electoral Bill ; help us to make it a better measure; we shall welcome improvements.&#34; We know what happened the other night, and how the honorable member&#39;s promises were carried into effect. With other men what has happened might be excusable; with him it is inexcusable </para>
                        <para>We are charged with obstruction. The Government have made no honest attempt to carry on the business of the country. It has wasted its own time and the time of the House. It has not done what the Labour Government did in 1910. That Government sat until its business was finished. That is the proper way of transacting business. When we met Parliament in 1910 we had a big programme of work before us, but we sat in the morning and transacted our business in a business-like way, remaining until it was finished . When I hear from the present Prime Minister the charge of obstruction, I say that it is as out of place on his lips as the devil would be in a Methodist chapel. There was never a more deliberate waster of time, never a more persistent obstructor than lie. If this Government had desired to press on with its programme it would have met in the morning at half-past 10, and, if necessary have sat late, as the Labour Government did, but it has never made any effort to press on with its business. What happened yesterday is an instance of its readiness to waste time. Why did the Prime Minister adjourn the House when the right honorable member for Wide Bay gave notice of his motion of no-confidence <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> The Prime Minister says that it was customary to do so. Good God 1 Is precedent to be thrown in our faces by such a man at such a time ? Are the rules that govern debate amongst decent men in deliberative assembles, and which he has trampled under foot, to be made an excuse for the honorable member&#39;s action in wasting another day? After his action during the past week he should have some better excuse. Had he not been anxious to do what his friends wanted - to go to the races - he would have proceeded with the business of the country. He adjourned the House over Cup Day. That is to say, he has wasted two days this week. Yet he says we waste time ! </para>
                        <para>This is the state of public business at the present time : The Government have deliberately refrained from pushing on with the legitimate business of the country, and at the tail-end of the session not one of the pledges that it gave to the people has been fulfilled. But it wishes to create in the minds of the public the impression that it is desperately anxious to keep its promises, and now poses as a strong, resolute Administration determined, in the face of the most relentless opposition, to force its measures through- Parliament. What an insult to the intelligence of the people. If those measures were of national importance, affecting the lives and interests of the people, and necessary to prevent some great disaster, the situation would be entirely different. If the Opposition were holding up proposals for lightening the burden of the people and reducing taxation; if we were trying to strike a deadly blow at the Tariff, the position would be different. But the bulk of the people are not the least concerned about the two measures that have been paraded before the country, and are being used by the Government as a stalking-horse. </para>

It is the practice of this House that, before the expiration of the two hours, the honorable member speaking may move for leave to continue his speech when the debate is resumed, and, by order of the House, a date can then be fixed for the resumption of the debate. That has always been done, and it must of necessity be done before, and not after, the expiration of the two hours. That has not been done, in this case, before the expiration of two hours after the time fixed for the meeting of the House, when, as provided by standing order 119, the debate shall be interrupted. </para>

According to the traditions and practices of this Parliament, a motion of want of confidence in the Government takes precedence of all business on the business-paper. The Prime Minister seems to have anticipated that cotirse, because the moment the Leader of the Opposition gave notice of his motion yesterday, the honorable gentleman moved the adjournment of the House. If the Prime Minister wishes to avoid discussion on the motion, he ought to avoid it in the way in which the Standing Orders provide. </para>

I am satisfied that if he had done so, we should have been able to fortify ourselves to meet this point. I ought to have known when I saw the Attorney-General moving about the Chamber with the Standing Orders in his hands this morning that he was up to something. I submit, sir, that a motion of censure ought to be dealt with in accordance with the practice of Parliament. Having re gard to our own traditions, as well as those of the House of Commons- </para>

                                <para>- The adoption of the traditions and practice of the House of Commons was rendered necessary by the fact that we had no traditions or practice of our own, but I submit, sir, that, according: to our own practice, a motion of no confidence in the Government takes precedence of other business on the notice-paper. On no occasion has an attempt been made upon a motion of want of confidence to&#62; raise a point of this kind. There have probably been fifteen motions of want of confidence submitted in this House since the inception of Federation, and I ask the Attorney-General to notice this point.

                                <para>- Order ! Will honorable members be seated? I again emphasize the request that I have already made several times that when the  Speaker  is on his feet there must be absolute silence. If honorable members will not observe that standing order, I shall have to take serious notice of their conduct. I am not going to call attention, every time I rise, to the existence of the standing order in question. I have done so several times, and out of consideration for honorable members I have refrained from taking action, but there is a point at which forbearance becomes no longer possible. </para>

There have probably been fifteen motions of want of confidence moved since the inception of this Parliament some twelve years ago. Whenever notice of such a motion has been given, the Prime Minister of the day has immediately moved the adjournment of the House, and the motion has been placed first on the business-paper for consideration on the following day. That motion has always been taken as soon as the House has met, not even a question being put to Ministers. That is now, in fact, an established practice of the House of Representatives, and, having become the custom, has it not developed into the law? The Attorney-General will know- </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member for Maribyrnong is again out of order. I call upon the Prime Minister to take action. At the beginning of these proceedings, I gave honorable members fair warning that I would have order preserved in this House, and they knew what to expect if they would not regard the authority of the Chair. I have several times called honorable members to order, but, in spite of my repeated requests, they have persisted in disorder. I shall certainly see that the Standing Orders are enforced, in order to preserve the decency and dignity of our proceedings. Before calling upon the Prime Minister to take action, I shall ask the honorable member for Barrier to apologize for disregarding the authority of the Chair. </para>

                                <para>- I desire to suggest that, under the extreme and extraordinary circumstances, and in view of the tense feeling that prevails, the honorable member for Barrier might very well withdraw the words, as he has been requested to do. There is a great deal to be said in apology for anything that the honorable member may . have uttered.  His  language was not excessive, but the rules and practice of Parliament must be complied with. Only the  Speaker  can determine on whom he calls and when, and for that reason I ask my honorable friend, the honorable member for Barrier, to withdraw the statement he has made. </para>

I think it will be generally admitted that a no-confidence motion should be the subject of the fullest and freest discussion. How can an honorable member compress all his reasons for objecting to the policy of a Government, as well as to its acts of administration, within the comparatively brief period of one hour? I can readily conceive of cases arising when more than two hours would be necessary to enable a  speaker  to even enumerate, without discussing in detail, the misdeeds of a Ministry. </para>

They have relation to the closure; and the closure provisions were adopted as part of our Standing Orders subsequently to standing order 119, and, therefore, they override that standing order. </para>

                                <para>- The Attorney-General is not in the Chair yet. Standing order 119, whatever scope it had before the closure provisions were carried, is now limited by those provisions, which give the power to restrict debate. The closure provisions were evidently intended to apply to motions of censure, because you, yourself, sir, instanced that as one of the reasons why they should not be adopted. Before the closure provisions were adopted, there was no means of closing a censure debate within two hours, as is shown by the fact that you, yourself, said it would, under some circumstances, take a man at least two hours to express his views. You are to interpret these rules strictly, especially when it is suggested that there &#39; should be taken away from any member that right which is fundamental to his position in a deliberative assembly. When it is suggested that an honorable member&#39;s mouth shall be closed, you ought to ask yourself whether standing order 119, which has never been enforced in this way, can, and ought to, be so applied; and I submit that, in the circumstances, an honorable member&#39;s mouth ought not to be closed. </para>

                                <para>- I desire to hear no more speeches on the point of order. I am prepared to decide the point of order now before me. The honorable member for West Sydney said in his concluding words that I have to interpret the Standing Orders strictly; and standing order 119 makes no exception in any case. The nature of the motion is immaterial to the point. The standing order makes no exception, but distinctly says all motions. When a private member submits a motion, whether it be one of no-confidence or not, it is for the Government to say how they will regard it, and for the House to determine what they will do with that motion when it is put from the Chair for decision. All I am concerned about is the standing order as it is. It has nothing to do with the closure provisions, as argued by the honorable member for West Sydney; it was adopted long before the closure provisions were dealt with, and has been acted on many times in the procedure of this House. </para>

But, in the present instance, the Prime Minister has intimated that he intends to proceed with business, and has called attention to the expiration of the time allowed for motions under standing order 119. My attention having been called to the matter, and an objection having been taken by the Prime Minister to the continuance of the debate after the time named, I have no option but to&#39; put the standing order in force. </para>

In my experience it is without parallel in any British Parliament that the debate on a motion of want of confidence has been interrupted by the procedure adopted by the Leader of the Government. I wish to direct attention to <inline font-style="italic">May,</inline> which is considered an authority on practice and procedure in all difficult and unusual cases, and which we follow in the absence of any direct instructions in our own Standing Orders. </para>

                                <para>- No. There would be no right to complain on Tuesday. If by inadvertence, or wilfully, as suggested by the honorable member, I give up my right to-day to have the resumption of the debate fixed for Tuesday, I shall be unable to complain of losing that right on Tuesday, and had I not intervened before any other business was called on to-day I would probably have lost my right altogether. With all due respect to the Attorney-General, I would fail in my duty if I did not strive to protect the rights of minorities, when the law is, as it seems to be, according to the procedure laid down in <inline font-style="italic">May.</inline> I call the attention of honorable members to the fact that today&#39;s procedure is not only new, but has no parallel in any Parliament. I do not question <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker&#39;s</inline> reading of the direct standing order under which he has given his decision, but it is incumbent upon the Opposition, when the Government are not inclined to protect minorities, to see that every opportunity is availed of within our Standing Orders to protect the rights of not only the present Opposition, but of any Opposition that may follow. It is a mere statement of fact that Oppositions have a habit of becoming Governments, and Governments have, regrettably to them, the habit of becoming Oppositions all too soon. The principal purpose of standing orders, rules, practices, and usages of free Parliaments is not to protect majorities, but to protect minorities. I think it was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> Brand who, when charged by some honorable members of great influence in the House of Commons with having leaned in his decisions towards the Opposition, said, &#39; &#39; I feel it to be my duty to give the benefit of the doubt to Oppositions or to minorities, for the reason that the majority can protect itself.&#34; The basic principle of that decision has immortalized that  Speaker.  But if things go on here as are indicated, there is a tendency that only one party shall be heard in the House, and that is not the minority, and not the Opposition. The decision on this matter will affect not only the present, but the future, and I hope it will not be treated as a party matter. </para>

                                <para>- The Government were within their rights in asking <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> whether, under the Standing Orders, the want of confidence motion could continue more than two hours, treating it as a private member&#39;s motion, and the  Speaker  decided that the Standing Orders forbade the continuance of the debate more than two hours; but my point is that, according to <inline font-style="italic">May,</inline> the member in charge of the motion has the right to fix the date on which the resumption of the debate upon it shall take place. That is my point as to the Standing Orders, but I buttress it bv the statement from <inline font-style="italic">May,</inline> that the business under consideration at the moment of interruption stands over until the next sitting or such other sitting as the member in charge thereof may appoint. </para>

The honorable member for Wide Bay is perfectly familiar with the practice universally adopted, and always adhered to, that before the time expires for dealing with matters of this sort the honorable member in charge of it has the right to move that the business be made an Order of the Day for some other date. That was not done, and I submit that it cannot be done now. There is in the Standing Orders a clear, sure, and explicit answer to the question of order raised by the honorable member. The honorable member has read a passage from <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> to the effect that on every day of the week, except Saturday and Sunday, the working hours of the House are subject to the following regulations : Business is interrupted on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday at H o&#39;clock, when if the House be not engaged on exempted business the  Speaker  rises from the chair.

                            is merely a text-book, and we must naturally look for the authority for that statement. That is to be found in the margin which apparently the honorable member overlooked. The reference there is to standing order 1, appendix 1. In the same volume of

                                <para>- I do not think we are concerned with the practice of the Senate, because we have our own Standing Orders. The passage in <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> on which the honorable member relies is merely a transcript of Standing Orders in force in the Imperial House of Commons. We have not those Standing Orders in our own Standing Orders at all; but we have one specific standing order which prescribes that, &#34; If all business shall not be disposed of two hours after the time fixed for the meeting of the House, the debate thereon shall be interrupted, and, unless the House otherwise orders, the Orders of the Day shall be taken in rotation, but if there is no Order of the Day, the discussion of motions may be continued. &#34; It happens that there are several Orders of the Day at present before the House. </para>

                                <para>- It is not silent. It is explicit that, as soon as the Orders of the Day have been disposed qf, the consideration of motions may be resumed. That is the simple and clear answer to the honorable member&#39;s speech, so far as it related to a point of order. So far as it related to a motion, I submit that the time for moving that motion has passed. </para>

                                <para>- It is contended that the point of order taken by the Leader of the Opposition is invalid, in that it was not taken within the period set forth in standing order 119. That standing order obviously relates to motions which are treated in the usual way; but it was impossible for the Leader of the Opposition to have interrupted the proceedings in this case within the two-hour period, because he had the assurance, so he says, of the Prime Minister, that it was intended to carry the debate on until next week. In those circumstances, the honorable member is robbed of a real right by a technicality which is only operative by reason of the fact that an understanding between the Leader of the House and the Leader of the Opposition was not observed. </para>

                                <para>- It is not denied that the Leader of the Opposition&#39;s point of order would have been sustained had it been taken within the time. The whole question, then, is that, had he or some other person, before the expiry of the two hours, moved that the resumption of the debate be fixed for such-and-such a day, there would have been an end of it. You must take cognisance of the circumstances, which are these : The Leader of the Opposition on Thursday gave notice of his intention to move a motion of want of confidence. The Prime Minister then moved the adjournment of the House, accepting it as a want of confidence motion. Again to-day he put the question to the right honorable member, as he did on Thursday, as to what were to be the limits of the debate. The honorable member cannot deny that. Clearly, the last thing he contemplated was a proposal to apply standing order 119. The honorable gentleman has been in this House, as I have, since its inception, and he knows that standing order 119 has never been used in this connexion before. Therefore, the right honorable member for Wide Bay could not have anticipated that the standing order would be brought into force, and it was not enforced until the expiry of the time allowed under the standing order for the discussion of the motion. I submit that if justice is to be done, having regard to all the circumstances and to the practice which here lias the force of law- </para>

                                <para>- I hope the honorable gentleman, will permit me to proceed. 1 cannot move that little motion of his. I say that the practice has the force of law. Prom time immemorial the right of the Leader of an Opposition to move a motion of want of confidence has been recognised and honored. In this case it has been recognised by the Government, since the Prime Minister upon notice of the motion given moved the adjournment of the House and adjourned the consideration of public business, which, it is admitted, it is urgently necessary should be gone on with. This being so, and the motion having been recognised in the way in which all such motions are recognised, how can the Attorney-General contend that the practice of the House has been abrogated because the right honorable member for Wide Bay did not submit a motion for the resumption of the debate on his motion in time? He could not have done so. Standing order 119 has never previously been enforced in connexion with such motions, and he was told that this motion was to be treated as a vote of censure. As a matter of fact the standing order was not enforced against it until the expiry of the time. I call your attention, sir, to our own standing order 257a, under which it is provided that no member shall speak in a debate on a motion of &#34;no confidence &#34; for more than one hour and thirty-five minutes. I wish to look at the matter fairly, and ask whether that standing order can have any relation to a motion, the debate upon which must be begun and concluded within the space of two hours? </para>

                                <para>- Here we have a House of seventy-five members, every one of whom has a right to be heard, and if they occupied only five minutes they would more than exhaust treble the time allowed under standing order 119. If standing order 257a has any relation to the facts as we know them, it must exclude from the operation of standing order 119 a motion of censure. The right honorable member for Wide Bay had, therefore, the best of reasons for believing that his motion was not one which would be affected by standing order 119. Since he could not have known that it was intended to apply standing order 119 to the motion and set aside standing order 257a, I ask you to give him the right that belongs to him as a representative of the people - a right which he could have exercised had he known it was intended to resort to such practices as have been resorted to in this case - and permit him to fix a time for the resumption of the debate on his motion of censure. If that is not done the position of the Ministry will be unique. A motion of censure suspends all legislative and administrative operations. </para>

                                <para>- Order ! If every member of the House claimed the right to debate every point of order that was raised by another honorable member, there would be no end to the proceedings. There is no such right given under standing order No. 286, which requires the  Speaker  to give his decision after the member rising to order has stated his point. The  Speaker  does sometimes out of courtesy, or if there is a doubt in his mind, allow a limited debate, but in such cases it is usual for the  Speaker  to intimate when he is prepared to decide a point of order raised. </para>

With regard to the point raised, first as to the honorable member&#39;s right to move a motion fixing the time when the debate on his motion may be resumed, the honorable member is relying upon a reference to the practice of the House of Commons given at page 214 of the 11th edition of <inline font-style="italic">May,</inline> dealing with the interruption of business under the standing order.

This is a case in which provision is made under our Standing Orders to govern our procedure in connexion with motions. I call attention once more to the fact that the nature of a motion has nothing to do with the application of the Standing Orders. With regard to the point raised by the honorable member for West Sydney, directing my attention to the limitation put upon debate on a motion of censure, I remind the honorable member that standing order No. 119 existed before any limitation at all was put upon debate, and when a motion might have been debated for practically as long as the honorable member on his feet was physically able to continue debate. Standing order No. 119 says - </para>

I do not wish to traverse a ruling already given, but only to deal with the new point of order raised by the honorable member for Wide Bay. I have looked into our own proceedings in the past, and the practice has always been that whenever motions were liable to interruption by the expiration of two hours from the time of the meeting of the House, the honorable member then speaking, a few minutes prior to the expiration of the time, has asked leave to continue his speech, and that the debate on the motion be resumed or made an Order of the Day for a future sitting. </para>

                                <para>- I have already pointed out that the question whether the motion is or is not a motion of no-confidence does not affect the point, because the standing order distinctly applies to all motions, and makes no exception in favour of any motion, even if moved by a Minister. May I remind honorable members that no later than the closing days of last session a motion was on the business-paper in the name of a Minister of the Crown, relating to the electoral divisions of Queensland. The motion was moved, and I see by the report that, it being two hours after the time fixed for the meeting of the House in accordance with standing order 119, Orders of the Day were called on, and debate was interrupted on that motion. I mention that one case as being typical of many others, some of which I have marked in the volume of our records of <inline font-style="italic">Votes mid Proceedings</inline> before me. It is within the knowledge of honorable members that in the case of private members&#39; motions debated on Thursday afternoons, the debate automatically ceases at the expiration of two hours, and it is the usual practice, if honorable members desire the debate upon a motion to be continued, to ask that it be made an Order of the Day for another day before the expiration of the two hours. If that is not done  before the expiration of the two hours, it is too late to do it afterwards. </para>

                                <para>- I was just about to say that it seems to me to be imperative under the standing order that, if any action is to be taken to secure the continuance of debate upon a motion, it must be taken within the two hours specified under the standing order. That is my ruling. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> McDonald dealt with this very point in October of 1911, in connexion with standing order 119. It will be found on pages 1947-8. </para>

                                <para>- I rise to a point of order. I wish to deal with something entirely new. We have created a certain situation as the result of an unprecedented use of the Standing Orders. At the present moment I take no exception to your ruling, sir, or to the ruling just given to the effect that, the two hours having elapsed, the honorable member in charge of a motion cannot now say when that motion shall come on again. I desire to draw your attention to standing order 119, which provides that, after the expiration of two hours, the debate upon a motion, not having been completed, shall be interrupted, and then the Orders of the Day shall be taken in rotation. That is as clear as it is possible for language to be; but I ask you to note the intervening words &#34; and unless the House otherwise orders.&#34; First of all, the standing order interrupts the debate upon a motion, and that, in this case, has occurred. After the interruption, if nothing intervenes, the Orders of the Day are to be taken in rotation. But there is a possibility of something intervening after the interruption, and before the taking of the Orders of the Day in rotation, because the standing order specifically provides that the Orders of the Day shall not be taken in rotation if the House otherwise orders. It is therefore competent for the House to otherwise order. </para>

                                <para>- I am&#39; afraid that the Attorney-General&#39;s desire and prejudice are leading his thoughts. The standing order is as clear as it can possibly be. In the first place, at the expiration of two hours, if the debate upon a motion has not concluded, it is interrupted; and, secondly, the Orders of the Day must then be taken in rotation, unless something intervenes. I repeat that the standing order specifically provides for something else intervening, namely, for the House otherwise ordering. It is therefore possible for the House to intervene at the present juncture, because the debate upon the motion of censure submitted by the Leader of the Opposition has been interrupted. Subsequently, the Orders of the Day must be taken in rotation. I submit that it is competent for the House at this stage to otherwise order, so far as taking the Orders of the Day in rotation is concerned. </para>

I have already ruled that unless the House otherwise order in regard to those motions before the expiration of two hours from the meeting of the House, immediately after the expiration of those two hours, the Orders of the Day must be called on. </para>

The honorable member must see that the Standing Orders provide that notice of a motion to dissent from the Speaker&#39;s ruling must be given immediately his decision has been announced. If the honorable member for Wide Bay is now going to submit a motion of dissent from my ruling, he is too late. I understood him to say at the time he accepted the ruling. The honorable member for Adelaide rose and addressed the House on what he assured me was a new point of order, and he further assured me he was not going to deal with my ruling previously given. </para>

                                <para>- Order ! Here is another illustration of the way in which a situation may arise which may place the  Speaker  in a difficulty through his endeavouring to be more than fair to honorable members, and through his not strictly enforcing the Standing Orders. Since I gave my ruling, points of order have been raised, and I was assured that they were new points of order, and that there was no intention on the part of those honorable members who raised them to traverse my previous ruling. Yet they proved to be merely the same point of order, as I discovered afterwards. Speeches have been made since my ruling, and the time for the honorable member for Wide Bay to have dissented from my ruling was when that ruling was given  before the luncheon hour. However, I do not personally wish at this stage to interfere with what an honorable member regards as his right, and. if there is no objection, I will waive that consideration on this occasion. But in future I will not allow my rulings to be traversed irregularly by permitting debate upon them under an assurance that a new point of order is to be raised. I shall not allow a motion for dissent from my ruling in future to follow upon further speeches. </para>

                                <para>-The Prime Minister has no more right to interrupt than has any other honorable member. It is by the courtesy of the House that he receives the first call when he rises, and that he is given a little more latitude. But the honorable member for Wide Bay,  I  understand, has risen to give notice of  a  motion to dissent from my ruling. If order is not maintained, other honorable members will probably take exception to my correcting statements made when my mind is so disturbed that I, in the din of conflicting voices, do not make my meaning clear. But I will hear the Prime Minister&#39;s point of order. </para>

                                <para>- I have already stated that, in the exceptional circumstances - though, strictly speaking, notice of motion to dissent from my ruling should be given immediately that ruling is announced - personally, as a matter of courtesy, I am willing to waive that consideration. I do so because honorable members apparently rose to what they assured me, were new points of order, under an apparent misapprehension. Those points of order were really the same point of order, but debate ensued on them. </para>

                                <para>- &#34;According to my memory of what occurred in the babel of raised voices, the Prime Minister did rise on two or three occasions after I had called the honorable member for Wide Bay, and proceeded to speak, after stating that he desired to raise a point of order. The point of order that he has raised is that I have no right to make a concession to any honorable member which conflicts with the standing order. I have no right to make a concession . to any honorable member, except by leave of the House, and it is only by leave of the House that I can do it. I said that, as a matter of courtesy, I would overlook the fact that several points of order had been raised, and allow the honorable member to give notice of his motion, because it affected myself, but if an objection is taken to his doing so, I cannot allow him to proceed, because the standing order says that objection to the Speaker&#39;s ruling must be taken at once, and notice of dissent given. If there is an objection to the honorable member  giving notice of his motion at this stage, I cannot accept it. </para>

With the greatest respect, may I ask you, sir, whether I did not ask that I should have the right to do what you speak of, and whether you did not reply, &#34; Yes,&#34; no exception being taken by honorable members at the time to what was proposed ? You had just decided what I considered to be a point dealing with the same standing order. I shall be sorry if the matter cannot be adjusted, but I do not wish to press things any further. You having said &#34;Yes,&#34; I thought that I had the right to move my motion, but if that is not so, I have nothing more to say. </para>

I urge, moreover, that the Minister in charge of the Order of the Day has priority in any case. The Leader of the Opposition, therefore, has no right to intervene, and has no right to be permitted to intervene, to prevent priority being given to the Minister in charge of this measure. I submit that the Minister is entitled to proceed with this motion which has been made an order of the day, especially as he has been called on.

                        <para>- The decision just given is with regard to the time at which a certain proposal shall be discussed, and has nothing to do with the motion of censure, that includes charges of maladministration, as well as condemnation of the political proposals brought before Parliament. The Government have failed in their administration. They have intentionally and wilfully misrepresented the country in their administration of postal and other matters, and this has been brought home to the people of Australia clearly and distinctly by the many illustrations that I have given in the House. They came in ostensibly declaring that they would have pure rolls; but the only evidence of their intention in that direction is to strike off the names of people who are entitled to be on the roll, showing clearly that their administration is even worse than their proposed legislation. If the Ministry can go on with a motion of this kind hanging over them, the people of Australia are being represented by a Government with less conscientious scruples than any that has yet held office in any of the States of Australia. </para>

                    <para>.- I am sorry that, under your ruling, one is not able to refer to some of the things that took place to-day. I shall content myself by a reference to <inline font-style="italic">Rasselas,</inline><inline font-style="italic">the Prince of Abyssinia</inline> - a work written by that greatest of Englishmen, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Johnson.</inline> Abyssinia is a country which, in many respects, resembles this. It has had its ups and downs, and its waves of democratic government and autocracy. It has had men who fought and achieved liberty and progress, and it has had its petty and contemptible tyrants who have trampled the liberties of the people underfoot. Time does not permit me to quote more than one of the incidents in the history of that nation. After the rise of Prince Abouti, in the sixteenth and seventeenth century, a wave of Democracy spread over the country, accompanied by happiness, peace, and prosperity. But there arose a man who appealed to the people under the most specious pretexts, and brought about the country&#39;s downfall and the destruction of the people&#39;s liberties. The foundations of representative government were established in Abyssinia, and from that place we derive all those excellent institutions which distinguish our present era; but this alleged reformer, under a pretext of establishing freedom, denied even the right of free speech. On one memorable occasion, even a meek and orderly protest made against his intolerable tyranny was stifled under a blanket of technicalities, which were gathered up by his subservient tools. Although the story of the manner in which free speech had been stifled was a long time in finding its way outside the walls of the Parliament of Abyssinia, eventually it did find its way to the people, and the people were amazed and indignant. They then rose up and put an end to that Government and its subservient instruments. That is a brief episode from the history of an interesting period of Abyssinia, which I hope may have some bearing upon the present situation. I hope that when we meet again, wiser counsels will have prevailed, and that, at any rate, those who now masquerade as the friends of freedom and liberty will at least have the decency to show themselves as they are. </para>

There are plenty of men whom I can excuse, but the honorable gentleman is past excuse. I do hope that when we meet on Tuesday, we shall remember that this is a deliberative assembly, that free speech will once more be permitted, and that we shall not be mere pawns on the chess-board, moved about at the will of an intolerable tyrant. </para>

                    (East Sydney) T4.7&#93;.- I wish to bring under the notice of the Prime Minister a matter of very great importance. I refer to the continuance of the quarantine embargo upon Sydney. Last week the honorable gentleman stated that a Commission was to be appointed to consider the matter. I have my own views as to the object of the Commission, and I believe it is not creditable to those who have moved in the matter. Since the Commission was suggested, I understand that the State Government of New South Wales has decided not to be represented upon it, and&#39; as it cannot, in the circumstances, represent the whole of the State, I ask the Prime Minister not to appoint the Commission. I ask the honorable gentleman, on the contrary, to follow the precedent set in America. In 1900, the State of California was declared under quarantine owing to an outbreak of bubonic plague. The health authorities of California represented that there was nothing in the conditions then existing to warrant the quarantine of the State, and the  President  of the United States removed the quarantine within forty-eight hours. That is a precedent which I ask the Prime Minister to follow in this case. He must know, as well as any one else, that the epidemic at present existing in Sydney does not warrant the flying of the yellow flag over that city. I believe there is not a medical man in the whole of New South Wales who would advise the continuance of the embargo. Many persons occupying high and honorable positions in the State, and who have the interests of New South Wales at heart, are agreed that there is no warrant for the quarantining of Sydney. The embargo has been continued now for a sufficient length of time to justify the Government in removing it. I hope that other honorable members, who. like myself, have the honour to represent a portion of Sydney, will take action in this matter. Owing to ill-health, I recently spent a week in Sydney, and devoted my time to interviewing commercial, professional and industrial residents of that city. I found that they were all agreed that the quarantine should not be continued. The commercial houses there are having their Christmas trade absolutely blocked. Shop-keepers in certain towns outside Sydney are displaying cards in their windows notifying the public that their goods have come from Melbourne, and not from Sydney. When we find people taking such an advantage of the unfortunate condition of Sydney under the quarantine proclamation, I make an appeal to the Prime Minister, as a Christian, if he has any Christian spirit, and if there is a soft spot at all about him, to put an end to such a condition of things. From a sanitary point of view,. Sydney is one of the most advanced cities in the civilized world, and the yellow flag should not continue to fly over it. The cases of disease which are occurring there are not small-pox, but a form of German pox well known to the medical profession. I need not say that I have no great opinion of the members of the present Ministry. I consider them incompetent, but if there is one member of the Government who, more than another, deserves to be spoken of in that way, it is the Minister of Trade and Customs. I do not think any other Minister would have been so callous or would have so disregarded the advice tendered him in connexion with this matter. At the instigation of one official and a doctor in Melbourne, the honorable gentleman has done something which I feel sure he is now sorry for. We know the old saying, that &#34;the King can do no wrong.&#34; Ministers who represent Sydney and suburban constituencies have certainly remained extremely quiet in regard to this embargo. They have not discharged their duty, because the quarantining of an area within a radius of 15 miles of the General Post Office in that city not only affects the people who reside within that area, but casts a stigma upon the whole of Australia. Their action tends to create an impression that a portion of this continent is so dirty - that it is so far removed from the ideal of cleanliness which is next to godliness - that it is necessary to have the yellow flag flying over it. If you, sir, had not had such a difficult task to discharge to-day, I should have used stronger language in condemnation of the action of the Government, and probably would have provided you with an opportunity of calling me to order. I trust that I have made some impression on the Prime Minister. I have known him for a long time, and I never thought, when I met him in the coal mines, and when he looked as thin as a slate, that I would have to appeal to him in this way. I trust that even at the eleventh hour he will acknowledge that there is no necessity to continue the embargo which has been placed upon residents within an area of 15 miles of the Sydney General Post Office.

                    <para>.- I desire to place upon record my anxiety,. and that of a number of my honorable friends, to do business. We are prepared to go right on now. Why should we adjourn? I object to adjourning at this early hour, because we have done so little business to-day. I have been very disappointed. When we came here this morning I thought that, before we adjourned, we would have got well on with the censure motion, but I find that the Attorney-General succeeded in holding up the business of the country with the aid of the Standing Orders. Yesterday the Prime Minister led us to believe that he was prepared to take a certain course- </para>

                        <para>- I shall reserve my remarks on the Prime Minister until his return. I was about to refer to the habit which Ministers have developed of going round Victoria and making speeches to the Women&#39;s National League. I would direct the attention of our friends, who come from all parts of the State at this festive season, to the fact that the Government cannot carry on business. They prate about their desire to pass legislation, but their protestations are mostly sham. They are mere theatricalism, because there are plenty of measures which could be brought forward and discussed. But Ministers do not bring forward any measures to be discussed. They ought to bring forward some Bills which are practically of a non-party character, and which could be discussed in a cool way. But, instead, they bring forward measures which are calculated to excite the anger of honorable members on this side of the House. </para>

Europe, and that it has a population of less than 5,000,000, most of it congregated in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide, and the other capitals of the States. </para>

                <para>The great State of Queensland, comprising an area of some 666,000 square miles, is governed from its south-eastern corner. The people of my electoral division, which covers a great part of the central district of Queensland, do not get fair treatment from the Administration which holds the reins of power in the State. We say that we should have a new State, taking in the central portion of Queensland, and the people of North Queensland are anxious that there should be created another new State there </para>
                <para>Instead of wasting its time in wrangling over questions such as those which have been prominently brought before us by the Government, we ought to deal with great national questions like the creation of new States.

                        <para>- I hope that my honorable friend will not draw me off the track. What has occurred in another place is most irritating to me at the present moment. The Prime Minister, who professes to be anxious to do business, has caused that Chamber to be adjourned for a month at a time when it could be transacting business. If there were any sincerity in his professions - if he meant what he says when he goes through the country announcing his desire to pass legislation - why does he not allow business to be transacted in the Senate? Our party is perfectly willing to permit him to carry all the non-contentious, non-party measures that the country is crying out for. </para>

I do not generally agree with the honorable member for Grampians, but I appreciated the force of his remark that the Leader of the Government in another place is unintelligent. The Senate might have got through the Postal Voting Restoration Bill during the fortnight for which it has been adjourned, and it could then have proceeded with other business. The Prime Minister, and those pretenders who are supporting him, have no desire to do business; and it will be found, when we reach the end of the year, that this great Parliament, so-called, has done nothing but wrangle and apply the &#34; gag &#34; when the majority could do so.

But State Parliaments and Governments cannot be allowed to retard the progress of Australia. We should alter the Constitution to permit a given number of persons in Northern Queensland or in Central Queensland, to approach this Parliament, asking for the creation of new States. How can Australia be developed if it is to continue to be divided up into only half-a-dozen States, with its population mostly living in the State capitals? </para>
                <para>I invite the attention of honorable members to the progress that America has made, which has been due largely to the fact that there are there forty-nine States, each with its Parliament. I would not propose bicameral Parliaments for the new States, because I think  that  there should not be Legislative Councils like that curious excrescence which we have in Victoria, which is opposed to every proposal for democratic legislation, and objected to women&#39;s suffrage on thirteen or more occasions. We shall be quite satisfied in Central Queensland with a Parliament of one Chamber. </para>

                        <para>- There are members of the Ministry whom we are glad to know. If the Postmaster-General held office as Prime Minister, we should get along swimmingly. Having regard to the present state of the House, he would say, &#34; We have just a majority of one, and, therefore, we are not going to introduce legislation that will make the Opposition angry. We shall try to map out a commonsense programme of legislation which will be for the benefit of Australia.&#34; But the Prime Minister, and his colleagues, bring forward everything that is calculated to .annoy us. </para>

                <para>Returning to the question of the creation of new States, let me point out that, in Queensland, we have lands from which ten crops of lucerne are obtained in the year, as well as magnificent sugar country - vast areas of fertile soil. - What is wanted is local government. The honorable member for Lilley will bear me out when I say that, in southern Queensland, there is also very beautiful country - the rich lands of the Darling Downs, ^Nanango, Kilkivan, Maryborough, Gympie, and other centres, and all these lands have to be settled. In the south, we have a population of about 400,000; about 70,000 in central Queensland, and about 115,000 in the north. The 400,000 people of southern Queensland, however, have the majority of the representatives iu the State Parliament. </para>

I was saying, when interrupted, that southern Queensland has what is vulgarly known as the &#34; biggest pull &#34; in the State Parliament, if I may use that expression.

                        <para>- I thought that I heard the Prime Minister use that expression. The people of central and northern Queensland are not getting fair treatment in the matter of government. For instance, in central Queensland, in the Longreach and Springsure districts, there are lands which grow the very best wool in the world; but they are leased in large areas, for thirty or forty years, to big squatting companies, when they ought to be subdivided and thrown open to the small men. That is one of the great disadvantages under which the people of central and northern Queensland labour, and which is preventing the progress of this great country. </para>

                <para>I shall deal now with another question, which, -perhaps, concerns the greatest number of people in the community. I refer to the high cost of living. The Postmaster-General will not mind if I say that I think his efforts to reduce the cost of living have, so far, not shown any appreciable result. He has, I believe, introduced a reform in the postage stamp, hoping thereby to reduce the cost of flour, butter and bread; but the price of butter is fixed by the price in the London market. I have come to the conclusion that if we desire to reduce the cost of living, we ought to do so bv means of the States and the municipalities, because I do not see that we can do much in the matter federally. I am in favour of increasing the powers of the municipalities, and would advocate the payment of aldermen, in order to induce them to give greater attention to their business, and to have the choice of the people enlarged. I have no desire to reflect on any individual council or councillor, because, as a rule, the majority of aldermen are actuated by the highest public  motives  and patriotic spirit. </para>

The Government and their supporters, having placed the hall-mark of respectability on themselves by gaining their seats, are satisfied; and doubtless they will afterwards try to gull the public into the belief that the Labour party have prevented them passing a lot of legislation. </para>

                <para>I have been an alderman myself, and I never worked harder, though i do not think my work was appreciated as it ought to have been. I always seem to get into Parliaments or assemblies where there is trouble. I do not know why this should be, but when I became a member of the Brisbane City Council, three aldermen - Alderman McMaster,. Alderman Fraser, and Alderman Raymond - resigned as a protest against the conduct of Alderman Higgs; and I can only say that if I could do anything to bring about a similar result with my honorable friends opposite, I would most assuredly do it. </para>
                <para>Contractors, landlords, and others sometimes secure election to city councils, and then devote the whole of their efforts to keeping down the taxes on the landlord, or getting work done &#34; ag&#39;in their own door,&#34; so to speak. They have no desire to improve the cities, because that might mean that they would have to spend a little more on their own properties. </para>

                        <para>- Both town and country - the National party. I deem it my&#34; duty to endeavour to prevent slums in the towns, and in the country my desire is that the people there shall have all the comforts of civilization. It is often a great privilege for a boy or a girl to be brought up in the country, but I should like to give country people every facility in the way of education, improvement, and enjoyment. On all sides we hear cries about increased rents, and the increased cost of food and clothing. As to the rents, I submit that the municipalities ought to endeavour to get the ratepayers to consent to the expenditure of public money in the erection of cottages, and&#39; thus enter into competition with the landlord. As to the price of food, <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> direct attention to what is taking place in Europe. The American Meat Trust has control, pretty well, of the whole production of the world, and various causes contribute to keep up. the price of meat in Europe. Certain municipalities in Berlin, Charlottenburg, and elsewhere, I saw from a cable a few months ago, have decided to import Australian mutton in large quantities in order to meet the prevailing scarcity, and to reduce the present high prices. In -order to meet the trusts and combines, which, at the present time, are levying taxation on the public of Australia and elsewhere, I believe it will be necessary for municipalities to establish shops and distributing houses so that goods may he obtained at reasonable rates. </para>

                <para>The Western Australian Government have made an attempt by opening a butcher&#39;s shop in Perth, and, though I believe they did succeed in reducing the price by 3d. per lb., the combine has been  able to interfere and prevent their getting supplies. . However, we must not be in any way disheartened in the good work of municipalization by the action of a few trusts or combines; and before very long it will be necessary to adopt  some method of dealing with the American trusts. There is not so much cheering now amongst the pastoralists at the introduction of American methods into Australia. We cannot keep down the price of foodstuffs unless we act as I have suggested. Could not the municipalities distribute pure milk ? At present we see the spectacle of a dozen carts crossing one another fifty times in the morning, doing work that could be done regularly by two carts distributing from a municipal dairy, and thus avoiding the great waste of effort that now exists in the distribution of the commodity. The same would apply in regard to the distribution from butchers&#39; and bakers&#39; shops. Though honorable members opposite think these matters most heterodox, they must realize that what I suggest is bound to come. </para>

                        <para>- Trusts are all right up to a point. So long as they confine their operations to economy of effort in production and distribution, they are all right; but, as soon as they succeed in eliminating competition, and start to charge high prices and bleed the public, they must be dealt with; but all our laws trying to prevent trusts getting in their fine work will go for nothing unless we start in opposition to them, either through the States or through the municipalities. I am glad to see that the right honorable member for Swan is trying to keep a House for me. </para>

                        <para>- I am afraid I would not be as happy in that position as I am here. If the right honorable gentleman had only been elected leader of the Ministerial party, when he was beaten by ons vote only, I am sure we would get on very nicely, and we would not be subject to the virulent abuse we receive from the Prime Minister. There are items with which the Ministry could deal at a very early date which would not cause a great deal of trouble. All the chambers of commerce and business people in Australia are crying out for a Bankruptcy Bill. There would be no opposition to that measure. There would be no need to &#34; gag &#34; it through. There would be no opposition to any real, earnest attempt on the part of the Government to deal with the question of unemployment. I heard the Prime Minister tell the unemployed the other day that he believed it was the duty of the employing class to take a share in the burden of this question of unemployment. Why do not the Government deal with that point? Their scheme of insurance is a non-party question, and could easily be brought on, but, possibly, it is only an electioneering placard. Whatever it is, if they bring it down, we shall discuss it. Why do they not bring forward a Bill to establish a Federal Bureau of Agriculture, the Norfolk Island Bill, and a number of other measures? They would do so if they wanted to do any business; but they do not want to do any - they are anxious only to mark time. They want, if possible, to stop the progress of Democracy. I hope the people who come to watch the so-called deliberations of this House- </para>

                        <para>- The right honorable member&#39;s interjection bears out my assertion that all the ambition of Ministers is to attend banquets and garden parties. The Treasurer practically says, &#34; Stop the business of the country, so that I may get away to a garden party.&#34; It will not be very long before the public realize how shallow are the promises made by honorable members opposite, and how little they must expect from a Tory Government. Honorable members opposite are, for the most part, decent fellows personally, but they have to do the bidding of the capitalists of Australia and elsewhere. Of course, they will, therefore, do nothing, because the capitalists say, &#34;Do not pass any more legislation; we do not want any; we prefer things as they are.&#34; Apparently, therefore, all the ideas we offer from this side will be unwelcome, and all we can do is to protest against their action, in the hope that we will force them to the country. If the Treasurer is earnest in his desire to go to the country, why does he not take steps to do so? The Government could do so at any time. If they had let two men stay away to-day the thing would have been done; but they whipped up every man, in order to prevent an appeal to the electors. Honorable members opposite are afraid to go to the country, and come here better drilled than ever we were - thirty-seven of them, Caucus-bound, and all but the Prime Minister unable to say a word. </para>

                    <para>. - I regret that this is the only opportunity I have of expressing the wishes of my constituents. The National Parliament has reached a deplorable stage, when members who desire to bring under the notice of Ministers and the country the grievances of some of their electors have to wait for the motion to adjourn the House before they can be heard. All I regret is that I am keeping the officers of the House here by speaking at this late hour. Had the right honorable member for Swan been Prime Minister the trouble to which I wish to refer would not have happened, because he would have risen to the occasion like the big man he has always been in politics, and prevented it. During the <inline font-style="italic">regime</inline> of the Fisher Government it was decided that any man, no matter how poor or humble his parents were, capable of passing a stiff examination, could become a commissioned officer from the ranks. Many young men who are becoming officers in our Army to-day are the sons of poor parents; but since the present Government have been in power I am informed, on reliable authority -  namely, the father of one of these boys - that a lad, who passed an examination, and became a lieutenant, paid for his own uniform, on the understanding that the money would be refunded to him; but month after month goes by, and he cannot get a refund. The father, poor as he is, put his hand in his pocket to clothe this young man, who is taking his share in protecting the country. The reason this matter is not rectified appears to be that the Minister of Defence thinks more of adjourning the Senate and trotting away to garden parties, or elsewhere. Consequently, important defence matters no longer receive the personal attention of the Minister, with the result that people cannot get that to which they are justly entitled. I hope the day is not far distant when the Minister will bring his Department up to date, and not allow these unfair things to happen. I regret very much that the honorable member for Indi, the honorable member for Wannon, and other young members who have interested themselves in rifle ranges - something that suits their own class of people - do not say a word on . behalf of these young men, who are not getting a fair deal at the hands of the Minister of Defence. </para>

                        <para>- The Government &#34;Whip. Would not the honorable gentleman like me to be away? I know that my place is in this House just now, and it is most unfair for the honorable gentleman to twit me with keeping him here when I am ventilating a real grievance that many persons are suffering in the Commonwealth. The matter to which I have referred was brought under my notice by one of my constituents. He complained bitterly of his treatment. He says that he is a poor man, and cannot afford to pay a considerable sum to provide his son with a uniform, and that when he has done so the Government should refund the money. Honorable members opposite have now a Government in power that suits them, and they will not say a word. They are ruled by the iron hand of the Attorney-General. I never hear the honorable member speak or see him come into the House but in imagination I hear the clink, clink, clink of the leg-irons, which in the past were worn by people who lived in some countries. I am reminded also of the play in which Nell Gwynne and Judge Jeffries appear. I hope the Prime Minister will convey to the Minister of Defence my protest against the way in which young men who are willing to give up their time to the Defence Department are being treated. Some honorable members desire that only the sons of the rich should hold positions in our Army, but in these enlightened days, and in this country, we have done away with the class distinctions that used to prevail, and now the only way to secure promotion in the Army is by passing the necessary examinations. I hope we shall never have a return to the class distinctions of the past, but I cannot forget that there are members supporting the Government who would probably like to have a law adopted here like the law in force in Germany, where a young man is not allowed to become an officer unless he can prove that he has blue blood in his veins, and is not allowed to marry until the name of the lady he wishes to marry is submitted for the approval of a committee of the Army. In that country the officers are kept distinct from the rank and file, but, thank God, we have done away with such class distinctions in Australia. There are Conservative members of this House who would have things otherwise if they could. I have the greatest respect for the Attorney-General, who is true to himself. Being true to himself he cannot bo false to any man. He is true to the Employers&#39; Federation and the <inline font-style="italic">Argus.</inline> We know that immediately upon the appearance of a particular article in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> dictating to the Government what they should do, the policy of honorable members opposite was changed. </para>
