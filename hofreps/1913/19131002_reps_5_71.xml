              <para>- I want to know whether the Excise Tariff (Sugar) Bill, which is on the notice paper for the third reading is, in the opinion of the AttorneyGeneral, constitutional. May I say in explanation that I think that the House, as well as the country, is entitled to his advice and opinion on such a point? </para>

            <para>- I do not admit that I am either entitled or bound to answer legal questions asked in the House, or to disclose to honorable members the legal advice which I am bound to render to my colleagues. But in this particular matter, I think that I can answer without the slightest difficulty. I see no reason why the Excise Tariff (Sugar) Bill now before the House is not perfectly constitutional. Last session there was passed a Bill repealing the existing duties of Excise. It is always competent for Parliament in another session to pass a Bill imposing fresh duties of Excise. That is the case in this instance. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member has asked a number of questions already in reference to one subject. It is contrary to the practice of Parliament to allow a debate arising out of the answer given to a question, but a practice is growing up daily in this Chamber of practically conducting a debate on answers given to questions by means of a series of fresh inquiries in reference to the same questions and answers thereto. That is a practice which is quite contrary to all Parliamentary precedent, and should be discontinued. Though on occasions it is allowable to ask a further question if it is necessary to the elucidation of the answer given. </para>

              <para>- In this case the duty is not imposed at once, but after a certificate is given. I might remind the honorable member that the ordinary practice of collecting duties of Excise or Customs before the House has agreed to them, and afterwards getting, an indemnity, is one which, though irregular constitutionally, is adopted in order to prevent persons from taking goods out of bond, and thus causing a loss of revenue to the Commonwealth . That reason does not exist in the present case because the Excise duty imposed by this particular Bill does not depend upon the particular goods remaining in bond. It depends upon a certificate given as to certain facts, which remain the same whether any goods are taken out of bond or not. </para>

I told him that we were waiting for the supply of steel trusses for the roof, and I am now informed that tenders for these trusses were called on the 11th April, accepted on the 10th May, and the contract signed on the 23rd May. The first delivery was to be within five months, that is, on 23rd October; and the final delivery within seven months, that is, on the 23rd December, the weight of material being about 450 tons.

            <para>Although the execution has been stopped temporarily, it is an advantage to allow the floor foundations to consolidate (for concrete floors and machinery) before putting on the roof. From the point of view of completion of the factory, the stoppage will not entail a delay. The building will be ready to accommodate the first textile machinery when it is delivered in Australia in about next March. </para>

        <para>Mr.FENTON.- Last week I asked the Attorney-General a question in reference to an association of master printers known as the Typothetae. The master printers have been holding a conference in Brisbane, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Powell,</inline> a Brisbane master printer, representing the Western Australian master printers, moved, in reference to my question, that the pamphlet setting forth the case for the association should be forwarded to the honorable gentleman. I wish to know from him whether he has received that pamphlet; and, if so, whether he will lay it on the table of the House or of the Library, so that honorable members may see it? </para>

              <para>- I have felt for some time that the present system of working a large State from one centre demands too much from the Deputy PostmasterGeneral. I think that these officers have too much detailed work to do, and are tied up in their offices. What is in my mind, if I have an opportunity of doing it, is to cut up Australia into districts and to give the postmasters in each district more power and more responsibility, and if you like, to have a supervisor in each State. The postmaster at a place like Albury, for instance, would manage that district, and so at Broken Hill and other places. </para>

            <para>- I merely gave an outline of what was in my mind in regard to this matter. I feel that the  Deputy  Postmasters-General are overworked and tied to.i much to their office stools. If this change can be done by regulation I shall endeavour to have it carried out in that way. I shall be prepared to take the responsibility if I believe that it is the. right thing to do. On the other hand, if the change can be effected only by legislation, I shall have the necessary Bill drafted by-and-by. I propose to have a conference with leading officers in my Department to ascertain whether what is in my mind in this respect can be carried out. </para>

I think that the honorable member may allay any anxiety on his part, because the Executive will approach the matter with a very deep sense of responsibility. I have read the report, but of course it does not really touch the question of whether the death sentence in these cases should be commuted or not. </para>

              <para>- The honorable gentleman stated that the electoral officers would have to make inquiry into every case, and that the name of a person transferred from one district to another district would not be taken off one roll until his name was placed on another roll. Yesterday, I drew attention to some hundreds of names having been objected to in one subdivision of Cook, and wish to ask the Attorney- General whether the Returning Officer for the district has to personally institute an inquiry into every case, whether it is possible for him to do that with such a large number of cases to be inquired into? Will the honorable gentleman also see that his statement as to the names of persons not being removed from the rolls is sent out to the Returning Officers for the various districts ? </para>

            <para>- I think that there is a little misapprehension in the question. In the first place, instructions nave been issued by the Chief Electoral Officer, and have been laid on the table of the House. Upon those instructions, and those alone, as I understand it - certainly not on any other intimation from the Government - the Electoral Registrars are authorized to act. These instructions do not, and can not, under the existing law, authorize a name to be removed from one roll before it is placed on another. They expressly require that the officers - not the Returning Officers, but the Electoral Registrars, who, at the time of an election, are usually Returning Officers - shall make full inquiry before they take any action. If they do not, and have not time to make that inquiry they cannot remove the name. In other words, a name cannot be removed until the inquiry has been made. That is the position. For further information in detail, as to what is actually being done, I must refer the honorable member to the Department in which the Chief Electoral Officer carries on his work. </para>

            <para>-Order! I have already pointed out that it is contrary to the practice of Parliament as recorded by recognised authorities to permit answers given by Ministers to questions to be debated, and although a further question is permissible to make clearer a reply already given, a practice is growing up here of practically raising a debate on ah answer to a question by a series of further questions arising out of the answer already given, and upon subsequent answers. This practice is irregular, and should be discontinued. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member is asking two questions. Dealing first of all with the second question put to me - whether an honorable member is entitled to obtain a full answer to any question he may ask a Minister, I would say that that is a matter entirely at the discretion of the Minister to whom the question is addressed. As a matter of fact, a Minister is not bound to answer any question put to him without notice. It is entirely within his own discretion whether he shall do so or not. As to the first part of the question which the honorable member, on a point of order, has addressed to me, he desires to obtain certain information, and I have before me a number of extracts from various authorities on parliamentary procedure dealing with the subject-matter of his inquiry. He asked for guidance in regard to the asking of questions, and I would refer him to page 249 of the 11th edition of <inline font-style="italic">May,</inline> where it is stated that - </para>

            <para>The purpose of a question is to obtain information, and not to supply it to the House. A question may not contain statements of facts, unless they be necessary to make the question in telligible and can be authenticated ; nor should a question contain arguments, inferences, imputations, epithets, or controversial or ironical expressions. Nor may a question refer to debates or answers to questions in the current session. Discussion in anticipation upon an order of the day or other matter, by means of a question, is not permitted ; nor can a question be asked regarding proceedings in a Committee which have not been placed before the House by a report from the Committee. A question which publishes the names of persons, or statements not strictly necessary to render the question intelligible, will be refused a place on the noticepaper. The expression of an opinion cannot be sought for bv a question, nor the solution of an abstract legal case, or of a hypothetical proposition. Nor is it in order to ask merely whether certain things, such as statements made in a newspaper, are true; but attention may be drawn to such statements if the member who put the question makes himself responsible for their accuracy. No question can be asked which reflects on the character or conduct of those persons whose conduct, as stated on page 278, can only be dealt with on a substantive motion; and for the same reason a question is not permitted which makes or implies charges of a personal character. Nor can any question be asked regarding character or conduct, except of persons in their official or public capacity. A question also which might prejudice a pending trial should not be asked. </para>

              <para>- I am speaking now of a matter which is not related to my Department, and only from a recollection of the provisions of the Act and regulations. An official inquiry is made by the Registrar and, as I understand the position, the result is reported to the Chief Electoral Officer of the State. The question first put by the honorable member was whether names were being removed where there was not an opportunity for full inquiry. That is not possible under the law, nor is it prescribed under the instructions issued by the Chief Electoral Officer which, by the way, were laid on the table of the House the other day. Inquiries have to be made. As to whether the Electoral Officer in each division has the power under regulations or does, in fact, remove any names without reporting to the Chief Electoral Officer of the State, I am unable to state without refreshing my memory with regard to the provisions of the Act and the regulations. But no name can under the law be removed from a roll on the ground that the person concerned has removed from the district to which that roll relates until it is put on to another roll, and no authority has been given by the Government or by the Chief Electoral Officer for such a thing to be done. Inquiry must be made by the Electoral Officer concerned. </para>

              <para>- Practically, the point is that objections are being taken to names of electors who have been two and a. half, years in the same place and have never been away from their homes for three days at a stretch. I have in mind also the case of a railway station-master who removed to a new house in the same ground, and yet in this case a notice of objection has been served. I wish to ask the Minister whether he will instruct his officers not to harass in this way electors who are legitimately entitled to have their names on the rolls? </para>

              <para>- I am familiar with the passages in both editions, which are similar, though on different pages. With regard to the asking of questions without notice, I remind honorable members that, if we were to strictly follow the practice of the House of Commons, those questions would be limited to matters of urgeut public importance, and private notice of the questions would be given to the Ministers to whom they were addressed. We have allowed a very much wider latitude than that in the asking of questions, but there must be some rule governing the practice. This is a matter which is largely in the hands of Ministers themselves. It rests entirely with them to say whether they are prepared to answer questions without notice or not. I have no personal desire to impose any limit upon honorable members in asking legitimate questions with or without notice. I am concerned only to see that the privilege is not abused and that the procedure and practice of the House of Commons and our own practice and procedure are not unduly strained. </para>

            <para>- The information supplied to me did not really touch the question. This is not a revolutionary matter, as the changes involved, in giving effect to my motion would be comparatively unimportant. At present, when we have an unfortunate visitation in the shape of some disease or pest, the Inter-State trade is thrown into a state of chaos. The producer does not know whether his produce will be received on the market for which it is intended, while the merchant is doubtful about how or when to buy, or to otherwise regulate his business. Altogether, there is much indefiniteness and confusion; and it therefore seems to me that if Federal officers were used instead of the State officers, much uncertainty and undesirable anti-Federal feeling would be avoided. Produce is now inspected at the port of shipment, and also at the port of entry; and, if in the State of the port of entry there has been a good season for the particular produce shipped, and the imported produce is rejected, a suspicion arises that the inspection laws are being used for some ulterior purpose, such as &#39;reserving the local market for the local produce. </para>

            <para>- This is not a question of State rights, because all the powers that I suggest should be exercised are given to the Commonwealth under the Constitution. Inter-State trade is on the increase, and will continue to improve as the population grows, so that there can be no doubt as to the importance of the issues involved. When sound, wholesome produce, fit for human consumption, passes from one State to another, there should be some guarantee that it will be permitted to go on the market. My desire may not be so easy of accomplishment as one would like, but the constitutional, legal, and other difficulties are not insuperable. It is quite right that) the States should have powers of inspection, because it is their duty to protect the health of the community; and for that reason I limit my proposal to sound, wholesome produce. There will be no more danger of infection if my proposal be carried out than there is at present; the only difference will be that the produce will be inspected by officers with a Federal standing, and the producer will be satisfied that the inspection is impartial. As I say, there is much antiFederal feeling caused by the fact that the produce of one State is rejected in another State; and, however fairly treated people may be, they cannot get it out of their heads that the inspection laws are used for some ulterior purpose. Surely it should be possible for the Commonwealth and State authorities to come to some amicable and satisfactory arrangement, and thus bring about more settled conditions in Inter-State trade., Any surplus over the cost of inspection at present is, by section 102 of the Constitution, the property of the Commonwealth, and there ought to be sufficient to meet the expense of a Federal service. </para>

            <para>- At any rate, there would be very little increase on the present cost. The question is, bow far the Constitution will allow the Commonwealth to go before we arrive at the point where we run counter to the reserved police powers of the States, which are exercised chiefly by means of the inspection laws? For instance, in New South Wales and some of the other States there are Acts dealing with vegetation diseases; and I am not sure that we can go as far as I suggest in my motion. The Commonwealth, however, ought to have sufficient power to guarantee the producer that, when sound stuff is placed on the wharfs, it will be permitted to go on the market. Section 92 of the Constitution declares that Inter-State trade shall be free ; and any State law which conflicts with that section is void. By section 102 of the Constitution there is power to annul the inspection laws of the States if these are used for any purpose that is not regarded as legitimate; but still there is some difficulty as to how far we can control the produce if we decide to undertake the inspection ourselves. There ought to be power, when a Commonwealth officer has guaranteed the produce, to insure that it shall not be blocked on the wharfs by any State authority. </para>

        <para>I do not propose to speak at any length upon this motion, because it seems to me that it merely seeks to provide for an act of common justice. I recognise that if I wish to secure an expression of opinion on the part of the House upon it, it would be unwise for me to discuss it. </para>

I would point out that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> has already had the motion of the honorable member for Eden-Monaro under his observation, and it was for him to decide whether it was in order. Obviously, if it had not been in order it would not have appeared upon the business-paper to-day. Further, it seems to me that the motion does not come within the scope of the Electoral Bill, and therefore I rule that it is quite in order. </para>

            <para>- I am sorry that I cannot return the compliment. In Australia there are quite a number of places at which forty or fifty votes are polled, and under the electoral law as it stands at present we have to assume that the electors recording those votes are not honest enough to be intrusted with the counting of them. Very often ballot-boxes from these small centres have to be despatched, perhaps 100 miles, to a larger centre, where they are counted. This procedure involves great delay, and prevents the people in little townships from knowing what votes have been polled. </para>

          <para>.- It must be recollected that when it was first decided that votes should not be counted in small centres, the full effect of that decision on many polling places was not foreseen. In my opinion the counting of votes at small polling places will bring about that decentralization in these matters which is so absolutely necessary. Surely Labour supporters in the country are not so dreadfully ashamed of the way in which they vote, that they fear to have the votes cast at small centres counted there. </para>

            <para>- No. Where the total votes recorded at a polling booth number less than forty, they ought not to be counted there, but where they number more than forty they may with advantage be counted on the spot.If we are to Continue to hold our elections on Saturday the votes cast at all these small centres should be counted there. I know of places at which 200, 300, and 400 votes are recorded, and yet under the existing system those votes cannot be counted locally, but have to be forwarded, perhaps many miles, to another centre. </para>

            <para>- The honorable member may have good reasons for that. But under the existing law the chief disability falls upon the people in country districts. Although they could telephone the results of the polling in a few minutes, great delay occurs, consequent upon their ballot-papers having to be transferred to the larger centres. I submit that the proposal under consideration would not interfere with the secrecy of the ballot. In all the States the votes are still counted at the polling places. </para>

            <para>- If I told the honorable member he would not know, because he. has no acquaintance with the geography of New South Wales. The only places of which he has any knowledge are those in which he has actually been. He appears to think that only the places in which he has eaten and drunk should .receive consideration. He is unable .to grasp the meaning of numbers. Therefore, the claims of these places do not receive the consideration at his hands that they should. However, &#39;apart, from, that aspect- of the case, allow me to address, myself to other members, and also to .the honorable member, if he cares to listen. With the exception of the State of Queensland, the counting of votes goes on at these polling places in all the States, and at places sometimes much smaller than is suggested in the motion. It is manifest that in Western Australia and in New South Wales, in Which States the Labour party have been in power, the great bulk of the members of the Labour party <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> those States are not dissatisfied with the counting of votes in these  small  places;, or they would have amended the electoral law, especially when they had in front of them the example of the Federal Labour party. But they did not choose to follow the advice of members of the Federal Labour party. </para>

We know that in New South Wales, at all events, the recent distribution of electorates was carried out during the <inline font-style="italic">regime</inline> of the Labour Government, so it is manifest that in at least two great States of the Commonwealth the State members of the Labour party take no exception to the counting of votes in these small polling places. Again, we see that while the Labour party were in power in South Australia they made no change, so that it can be fairly assumed that there was no objection there to the counting of votes in the small places. </para>

In any event, thiscannot be made a party question in any way. On a question like this surely honorable members will exercise theircommon sense ; surely party government is. not to &#34; rule the roost.&#34; The motion is a proposition that honorable members on. both sides can support. Certainly Caucus rule should not prevail, otherwise it will mean a distinct interference with therights of the State Labour parties, who permit their members to vote as they please on all State matters. When wecome to deal with Federal matters we aredealing with larger rights, and we should give the electors larger powers by removing a=ny restrictions that may exist. </para>

The real difficulty of the motion lies in the possibility of exposing voters in country districts to risks, especially if the safeguards suggested in the interests of electoral administration, and included in the Electoral Bill, are accepted by this Parliament. I cannot accept the motion at the present juncture. </para>

            <para>- Because the honorable member has read the Bill. I doubt whether, honorable members opposite have done that, judging from their speeches. After this motion has been discussed today, in order that honorable members may realize its importance, I suggest that the debate should be adjourned. That course will not expose the honorable member for Eden-Monaro to any difficulties, because when the feverish zeal of honorable members opposite brings us to the Committee stage of the Electoral Bill the honorable member can move an amendment on the lines indicated by his motion. I hope he will not press the question to-day. He must recognise, the inconvenience and danger of such a step before the ultimate form in winch the Electoral Bill will emerge from its consideration in this Parliament is known. </para>

            <para>- No doubt, but at the same time we do not wish to have any one knowing how any other person has voted. The position is not the same in Western Victoria, where the comparatively close-settled nature of the country would debar any such risk, but in other places where there are such huge stations or properties, and where the employes of one station would possibly be the only persons  using  a booth, it would be undesirable to have the votes counted in that booth. </para>

            <para>- But because a man is a member of an organization it does not follow that he always votes the one way. Among my warmest supporters are members of some of the organizations which support honorable members opposite. They are sensible persons who recognise what my friends opposite are really doing, not what they pretend to do. I urge my honorable friend not to press the matter to-day, but to let honorable members be in possession of the facts and consider the subject of a change in our electoral system before we quite grapple with such a position. </para>

            <para>- With regard to the point of order that has been raised, I wish to say that, in going through the Bill to which reference has been made, I do- not discover that there is any provision covering the ground that is covered by the motion of the honorable- member for Eden-Monaro. If the motion had&#39; conflicted with anything in the Bill, or if it anticipated debate upon the Bill, the  Clerk  would no doubt have called my attention to it and submitted it to me for my decision. The motion itself is quite in. order. I understand that- a ruling to that effect was given by my  Deputy,  who was temporarily relieving me while I was engaged upon another official matter. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Colonel RYRIE</inline>(North Sydney) &#91;12.20&#93;. - I should like to say a few words in support of the motion. I know that it is true, as pointed out by the mover,, that there is great dissatisfaction in many small centres in country districts by reason of the fact that votes which are cast there are not counted there, and that consequently it is not known by those who voted what the result of the poll at their particular polling place was. . I will undertake to say that if the opinions of the people who had voted at any small centre were canvassed, the result- would be unanimously in favour of having the votes counted at those centres. There is hardly an individual who votes at a small centre who would not say, .&#34; We want to know the result of the poll at our centre.&#34; An election is a burning, question with them, and they want to know how their district voted. They cannot know under the present system. The contention of honorable members opposite that the counting of the votes at these small centres is open to objection, because pressure can be brought to- bear upon individuals, is one that has no substance in it. The honorable member for Maranoa has quoted instances of pressure &#39; which has been brought to bear by land-owners or squatters upon their employes. In my opinion, the day has passed when pressure can be brought to bear in that way, even if land-owners were disposed to exert it. Honorable members opposite are casting a reflection upon, and aTe slandering, both working men and landowners in making such an observation&#39;. They are practically accusing working men of being crawlers, and not men at all. They are accusing them of being under the influence of their employers in political matters, and of voting as their employers wish. I know that that is absolutely incorrect. </para>

Honorable members know that there may be a polling place at which only forty votes are&#39; cast. Of these six may be given to one candidate. Probably every one of the forty voters will, claim to have voted for the candidate who received only six votes. I remember that when I was a much younger man, I contested an election. There were twenty votes at one polling place. Only one was given to me, and the other nineteen were given to My opponent. But when the election was over, sixteen of those people came to <inline font-style="italic">me,</inline> and each one said separately that he was the man who gave me the one vote. </para>

          <para>,- If I thought that carrying, this motion into effect would interfere with the secrecy of the ballot in any way, I would not give it my support. But I do support it for several good reasons. The first, is that it is really a matter of some value in country districts to know the strength of political feeling at particular places. It is of great importance to candidates and political organizations, as well as to the public generally, to have an idea of the political identity of localities. It is really in the interests of country districts that the votes cast at particular polling places should be counted separately. It is advantageous to be able to locate interests and support given by various localities to the great parties in politics. For this reason alone, and without any intention whatever of interfering with the secrecy of the ballot, I give the motion my support. </para>

I venture to say that if the electors in country districts were circularized on the subject, the result would be almost unanimously in favour of the motion. I cannot see how it can create an evasion of the secrecy of the ballot. If there should be a risk of any such evasion, I suggest to the mover that he should delete the words relating to counting, and let us apply what he desires simply to the declaration. It seems to me that we ought to know how each centre votes. The divisional officers could count the votes as they do now, and afterwards make known to the public the result of the voting at each centre. </para>

            <para>- While there are many good metalled roads in my division, there are many roads which are not metalled, and which get into a very bad state in wet weather, but, notwithstand ing the rain that fell before the holding of the last election, no difficulty was experienced in bringing in the various ballot boxes. I have seen some of the new boxes, and think them splendid for their purpose; it being impossible to interfere with their contents when they have been locked. I do not agree with those who say that every one who goes into a polling booth is prepared to announce exactly how he is voting, and that it does not matter whether the votes are counted at the polling booths or not. I think it would be very dangerous to do the counting at the polling booths. Our friendsopposite frequently speak of the danger that voters would run if it could be found out by land-owners and squatters how they had voted, but I think that the voters would be in a worse position if they had to incur the risk of it being found out by the Labour organizations how they had voted. On a Queensland station it. was assumed that the manager, the bookkeeper, and the storekeeper will vote for the Liberal side and the men for the Labour side. If the ballot boxes were emptied, and the votes counted at thestations, it might be found thatsome of the men had voted for the Liberal party, and that would cause trouble. I do not think that any man would be game tovote for the Liberal party if there were a chance of the Australian Workers Union finding it out. Liberal voters would probably be subjected to persecution under snch circumstances. I hope that the honorable member for Eden-Monaro will withdraw his motion, dr postpone it. I shall have to vote against it. </para>

            <para>- I should have liked an opportunity to discuss this motion at some length. It is by no means a new matter. The subject has been discussed on several occasions with more or less warmth, and since some honorable members entertain the fear that a proposal of this kind would, if adopted, in some way violate the secrecy of the ballot-box, very considerable warmth is likely to be engendered during its discussion. The whole question of voting by ballot engaged .public attention for many years, and the recognition of the principle was secured only after a great deal of tyranny, oppression, and coercion had been exercised. There was much suffering, and even loss of life, before the inestimable boon of the secret ballot was secured. As I understand that there is now no objection to the adjournment of the debate, I ask leave to continue my remarks at a future date. </para>

Owing to the wantofconfidence motion, my notice of motion could not be taken on the day for which it was originally set down, and its consideration had to be adjourned until the 9th instant.

            <para>- It is disorderly to interrupt the  Speaker.  On the first day of the sitting, a number of notices of motion were given, but amid the hum of conversation it was almost impossible for the  Speaker  to catch their purport. If the honorable member for Wilmot, having given uotice of his motion, afterwards heard notice of another motion dealing with the same subject, he should have called the attention of the  Speaker  to the fact at that time. These&#39; two notices of motion were given on the same day, and almost atthe same time. It is my duty now to call on the notice of motion which is on the business-paper for this day&#39;s sitting. The motion standing in the name of the honorable member for Bass is set down for discussion to-day, and, therefore, it must have precedence. </para>

            <para>. - In presenting the last Budget to Parliament on the 1st August, 1912, the Treasurer announced that, in order to meet his expenditure during the financial year 1912-13, itwould be necessaryto expend, not only the revenue estimated to be received during that year, but also the accumulated surplus amounting to &#163;2,261,673, which was on the 30th June, 1912, at the credit of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Fund and the Naval Defence Account for Construction of the Fleet. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Instead, however, of this surplus of &#163;2,261,673 being required to supplement the revenue of the year, the revenue exceeded the expenditure by &#163;391,550, the accumulated surplus on the 30th June, 1913, amounting to &#163;2,653,223. In the Budget-papers, it appears on page 69, under the head of Trust Fund - </para>
          <para class="block">
            <graphic href="071331191310024_21_0.jpg" />
          </para>
          <para>An explanation of the surplus is also given on page 7. The reason of this large surplus being left at the end of the year was that the revenue received was in excess of the estimate by &#163;1,477,413, and that the expenditure was less than the estimate by &#163;1,175,678. Adding to these amounts the sum of &#163;132, which was an addition to the surplus of 1911-12, disclosed when the accounts for that year were finally made up, the total accumulated surplus on the 30th June last was, as previously stated, &#163;2,653,223. It is, therefore, clear how the credit balance of &#163;2,653,223 was made up, viz., by, the Treasurer receiving &#163;1,477,413 more than was anticipated, and expending &#163;1,175,678 less than was estimated. This amount of &#163;2,653,223 accumulated out of the revenue of 1910-11, 1911-12, and 1912-13, and is available for expenditure this year, 1913-14. </para>
          <para>Of this amount, however, only &#163;195,450 was held in cash on 30th June, 1913. . </para>
          <para>The balance of &#163;2,457,773 was invested to the extent of &#163;1,310,000 as part of investments of &#163;3,448,015 of General Trust Funds, and the amount of &#163;1,310,000 will mature between 30th November, 1913, and 20th June, 1914, viz :  - </para>

          <para>While the investment of this &#163;2,457,773 (which it ought to have been foreseen would soon be required), except at call, was, I think, unwise, I feel sure the inconvenience which will be only temporary will be easily overcome. </para>

          </para>
          <para>It will be noticed that the estimate . of Customs and Excise Revenue is &#163;14,900,000, as against &#163;15,553,033 actually received in 1912-13. For various reasons, I came to the conclusion that it was reasonable to expect during the present year some reduction of Customs and Excise Revenue. Already this important source of income shows a tendency to decline, as the receipts to the 30th September show a falling off of &#163;228,563, as compared with those of the previous year, but as a sum of about &#163;158,000 is outstanding in respect of Sugar Excise, the falling off is only really about &#163;70,563. </para>
          <para>On the other hand, I expect a considerable increase, say, &#163;325,000, in Post Office revenue. </para>
          <para>The total estimated revenue for the current year, as I have shown, amounts to &#163;21,462,000, which, added to the surplus of &#163;2,653,223, makes the total amount available for this year&#39;s expenditure &#163;24,115,223. </para>
          <para>Full particulars of the Estimates of revenue will be found in the Budget-papers. </para>

          </para>
          <para>I have shown that the total revenue which we expect to receive during this year is &#163;21,462,000. </para>
          <para>To this is to be added the accumulated surplus which was, on the 30th June, in Trust Fund for expenditure in future years, viz., &#163;2,653,223. Adding these, we have for expenditure the total amount of &#163;24,115,223. </para>
          <para>The estimates of expenditure, it will be noticed, absorb the whole of the estimated revenue available. </para>
          <para>There is &#163;24,115,223 available for expenditure (not including items in Loan </para>
          <para class="block">Bill), and the following five items absorb &#163;21,396,231: - </para>
          <para>The estimated expenditure 1913-14 does not include proposed expenditure from loan on Defence and Post Office for 1913-14, amounting to &#163;1,070,000 (page 31 of Budget Papers). </para>
          <para>The balance of the total estimated expenditure 1913-14, viz., &#163;24,115,223, including that for all the other Departments of the Commonwealth, absorbs &#163;2,718,992. </para>
          <para>These five items make us realize the rapidity of our advance in expenditure. In 1909-10, on these five items the expenditure was &#163;14,908,395. </para>

          </para>
          <para>It has been accordingly determined to provide for these items in a Loan Bill. I do not think that Parliament will take exception to this course, as the works are of a permanent character, and such as are properly chargeable to loan. </para>
          <para>With regard to the purchase of machinery for dock at Cockatoo Island, honorable members are aware that the transfer from the State of New South Wales to the Commonwealth was ar ranged by the late Government. The arrangement made was that the total cost of the property, viz. </para>

          <para class="block">should be treated as if it were transferred property under clause 85 of the Constitution; that is, it would be treated as a debt to the States, on which interest would be paid. In other words, it was treated as loan money. The machinery has been found inadequate for the purpose for which it. is required, and it is proposed to obtain modern machinery, at a cost of &#163;175,000, so that the original intention, viz., the construction of vessels of war, can be proceeded with. </para>
          <para>In other words, the Government consider that this amount is a part of the original purchase, and that it is a proper charge (in the same way as the original purchase) to loan expenditure. </para>
          <para>It is evident that it is not possible to provide for the immense growing expenditure on the public works of the Commonwealth altogether from revenue. This Parliament has already assented to. the principle that railways, land purchases, and the Commonwealth Offices in London, should be made chargeable to Loan Funds, and the present Government are only slightly extending a principle which has already been begun, and of which they approve. </para>

          <para>Defence. - The total expenditure provided for Defence for the current year, including Construction of Fleet, is &#163;5,746,853, as compared with the expenditure of &#163;4,079,590 in 1911-12, and &#163;4,331,498 in 1912-13. In 1912-13, &#163;166,600 was expended for Naval Subsidy, which item does not appear in 1913-14. </para>
          <para>In this comparison I have included &#163;300,000 for purchase of land, and &#163;175,000 for purchase of machinery, Ac, Cockatoo Island, to be provided from loan. The Naval expenditure (exclusive of construction of Fleet) has grown from &#163;513,397 (including &#163;200,000 for Naval Subsidy), in 1911-12, to &#163;1,031,831, in 1912-13 (including &#163;166,600 for Naval Subsidy), and &#163;1,453,166 in the current year (without Naval Subsidy). </para>
          <para>Construction of the Fleet cost &#163;1,108,171 in 1911-12, &#163;604,397 in 1912- 13, and will cost &#163;1,002,432 in the current year. </para>

          <para>The total estimated expenditure for this year for Military and Naval Defence equals &#163;1 3s. 6d. per head of population. In 1912-13 it was 18s.3&#190;d. per head. </para>
          <para>Owing to the rapid growth of this Department, consequent upon the development of the Universal Training Scheme, it has been found necessary to considerably increase the clerical staffs in the Central Administration.

          <para class="block">The provision for ammunition is &#163;252,500, which exceeds last year&#39;s expenditure by &#163;80,290. The increase is due partly to the rise in price of ammunition, and partly to the increased amount required. &#163;14,500 has also been provided in excess of last year&#39;s expenditure for free issue of practice ammunition to members of rifle clubs.

The instructors, mechanics, and machines are at present in Australia; and, as soon as the necessary buildings are completed, for which a provision of &#163;10,000 is made in &#34; Additions, New Works&#39; Estimates, the School will be established. </para>
          <para>A sum of &#163;81,800 is provided on the Estimates this year for the Royal Military College - &#163;49,000 being for expenses, &#163;30,000 for building, and &#163;2,800 for field guns. Up to 30th June last, the College has cost &#163;150,352 for building, and &#163;80,871 for general expenses, In all, therefore, including this year&#39;s estimated expenditure, the total will be &#163;313,023. There are at present 112 cadets resident at the College, and it is anticipated that thirty-eight more will be admitted during this year, thereby completing the establishment of 150. The estimated cost for this year of each cadet is about &#163;393. </para>
          <para>The reports and balance-sheets of the Cordite, Clothing, and Harness Factories for the period ended 30th June, 1912, were recently presented to Parliament. </para>

Several thousand sets of parts have been completed, but, so far - 30th June, 1913 - only forty finished rifles, and 2,250,000 steel chargers have been manufactured.

          <para>The Fleet unit has already cost &#163;3,860,000. &#163;300,000 is provided this year, and a further amount of &#163;102,266 will be required to complete the work and pay for it, the total estimated cost being &#163;4,262,266. </para>
          <para>Coming now to the question of the establishment of the Australian Navy, the proposal of the then Government as communicated by myself as Treasurer to this House on the 1st December, 1909, was to provide a naval unit consisting of one armoured cruiser, three unarmoured cruisers, six destroyers, and three submarines; and it was arranged with the Imperial Government to co-operate with two other similar units - one on the China and the other on the East India Station - to be supplied by the Imperial Government, and which together would form the Eastern Fleet of the Empire. The cost of the Commonwealth unit was to be &#163;3,695,000. It is now estimated that the Commonwealth proportion of the fleet will cost &#163;4,262,266. </para>
          <para>The Commonwealth has been active in providing its unit on practically the above basis; but, for some reason or other, of which the present Government is unaware, two units of similar strength on the China and East India stations have not as yet been provided.

          <para> Post and Telegraph Department. - The revenue of the Post and Telegraph Department is increasing at the rate of about 7 per cent, per annum - the Telegraph Revenue at about 6 per cent., the Telephone Revenue at about 13^ per cent. </para>
          <para>The total revenue received in 1911-12 was &#163;3,916,254, and in 1912-13 &#163;4,224,916, showing an increase of 7.9 per cent. The estimate for 1913-14 is &#163;4,548,000, showing an estimated increase of 7.6 per cent. </para>
          <para>If we examine the expenditure figures we find a much greater rate of increase. Not taking into account NewWorks and Buildings, the expenditure in 1911-12 was &#163;4,330,896, and 1912-13 &#163;4,783,744, the rate of increase being 10.4 per cent. The estimated expenditure for 1913-14 is &#163;5,189,265, the estimated rate of increase being8.4 per cent. If we add to this expenditure of &#163;5,189,265 the amount proposed to be expended from revenue on New Works and Buildings, &#163;1,350,113, and the amount of &#163;595,000, which it is proposed to obtain from Loan Fund, also &#163;15,897, the balance of the Special Vote of &#163;600,000, we have the immense sum of &#163;7,150,275 to be expended this year, as compared with a total of &#163;6,284,053 expended last year - an increase of &#163;866,222, or nearly 14 per cent. </para>
          <para>This vast expenditure shows, I think, the wisdom of the Government in proposing to appoint three Commissioners to conduct the affairs of this large trading concern. I hope no time will be lost in obtaining parliamentary authority for making this great reform. </para>
          <para>The increase of business, the increased rates of pay, the higher cost of material, and the higher costs of contracts for mail services are the chief factors bringing about this large increased expenditure. </para>

But, as the business of the Department is rapidly extending, it has been found necessary to provide an additional new staff, numbering 2,606 officers, at a cost of &#163;125,328. To enable full benefit to be taken of the wireless stations, an increase of &#163;17,680 has been provided.

          <para>Tasmania: Additional Grant. - The Government propose to increase the special payment to Tasmania, under clause 96 of the Constitution, by &#163;400,000, making the total payment &#163;900,000, as unanimously recommended by the Royal Commission, and a Bill will at once be submitted to Parliament for the purpose. </para>
          <para>The proposed method of paying this additional &#163;400,000 is by paying &#163;5,000 this year, and increasing the amount by &#163;10,000 every year for eight years, and for the ninth year paying &#163;80,000, thus : - </para>

          <para>Pubic Debts. - The public debt of Australia (Commonwealth and States) on 30th June, 1913, was &#163;301,903,435. Of this large amount, &#163;206,054,787 was floated in London, and &#163;95,848,648 in Australia. </para>
          <para>It is a remarkable fact that during the last thirteen years the increase of the public debt floated in London &#34;has been only &#163;32,821,894, while the increase floated in Australia has been &#163;73,854,135 - showing that during that time only 30 per cent, of the loan money was obtained out of Australia. While this, on the face of it, looks satisfactory, it would seem, however, to imply that there is a great tendency to invest in Government securities rather than in industrial enterprises. </para>
          <para>On 30th June, 1900, only 11 per cent, of the public debt was floated in Australia, while on the 30th June, 1913, quite 32 per cent, was so held. </para>
          <para>I think that the opportunities for enterprise in Australia are not availed of to the extent it would be desirable, and this, I think, has its root in the fact that there is a good deal of friction in industrial enterprise, which is very regrettable and injurious. </para>
          <para>This, I think, is one of the causes, and perhaps the principal ono, why the savings of the people have, during the last twelve years, gone into Government securities rather than into enterprising developmental works. </para>

          <para>A sinking fund of <inline font-style="italic">h</inline> per cent., vested iu trustees, for the redemption of the debts will be provided. The Bill will be a very simple, and not in any way complicated, measure, and should, I think, meet with approval. </para>
          <para>There will be no financial complications between the Commonwealth and the States, as the interest and sinking fund will be provided from the surplus revenue paid to the States. </para>
          <para>In the case of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, and Western Australia, the annual contribution of 25s. per capita by the Commonwealth will always be more than sufficient to meet the interest and sinking fund required on their respective loans; while in the case of South Australia and Tasmania it will be sufficient up to the years 1940 and 1922 respectively, and after those years there will be only a small deficiency. </para>

          <para>Taxation. - It is not proposed to resort to any fresh taxation, or to place any increased burdens on the people. </para>
          <para>The Tariff question has been remitted to the Inter-State Commission, and it is not considered advisable to deal with it till, it reports on the matter; , and there has not been time to consider other financial matters that require consideration. </para>
          <para>During the Federation period, both Commonwealth and State taxation have increased considerably, both in actual amount and also in amount per capita. </para>
          <para>For the financial year 1901-2, the first complete financial year under Federation, the Commonwealth receipts from taxation aggregated &#163;8,900,000, as compared with a total of &#163;16,100,000 for the year 1911-12. Similarly, the aggregate of State taxation amounted to &#163;2,700,000 in 1901-2; totalled &#163;5,400,000 in 1911-12. The total increase in Commonwealth and State taxation combined has thus increased from &#163;11,600,000 in 1901-2, to &#163;21,500,000 in 1911-12. </para>
          <para>The corresponding amounts of taxation per head of population (through Customs and Excise) were &#163;2 5s. 6d. in 1901-2, &#163;3 4s. 5d. in 1911-12, and &#163;3 5s. 8d. in 1912-13, an increase of 44 per cent. in eleven years. </para>
          <para>The entrance of the Commonwealth Parliament into the arena of land taxation, which heretofore was reserved for the States, has raised difficulties not previously anticipated, owing to there- being now three separate authorities enforcing taxation on the same land - the three valuations of the same land are all dissimilar, and general dissatisfaction is the result. At the present time, the same land is valued and taxed for municipal, for State, and for Commonwealth purposes by three separate authorities, and the cost of valuation is three times what it should be. </para>
          <para>An effortwillbe made to enter into an arrangement with the States so as to arrive at a uniform system of land values assessment for all State and Commonwealth purposes, and thus save a great waste of time and money. </para>
          <para>The estimated amount of revenue for 1913-14 from this tax is &#163;1,400,000, and it is paid by about 14,000 persons. </para>
          <para>The machinery of this taxation measure makes its operation&#39; exacting, and, personally, I hope it may be possible to amend it so as to, at any rate, repeal the company and leasehold aggregations, which, though increasing the revenue, are very troublesome and difficult, as well as unnecessary. </para>
          <para>It is not possible to do anything this year for obvious practical reasons. Besides which, thelargeincrease of revenue during the last three years has resulted in immense expenditure and commitments that have to be met. </para>

          <para>Northern Territory. - A very difficult problem presents itself as to the best way of making the Northern Territory of the Commonwealth self-supporting and settling a permanent white population there. </para>
          <para>A large Government establishment is in existence, and the total estimated cost this year, with Oodnadatta railway, is &#163;721,556, but, as yet, nothing has been done in the direction of making the country productive or in settling people on the land. </para>
          <para>As far as I could gather, only seven settlers had actually gone to their holdings, and seven others were on their way. Practically very little work has been done as yet. </para>
          <para>In addition to the amount of &#163;721,556, loan authorization for &#163;400,000 will be asked for the construction of a railway in the Northern Territory, from Pine Creek to Katherine River and southwards, the ultimate object in view being to connect by railway with Oodnadatta in South Australia, and with Camooweal in Queensland. </para>

          <para>Loan Flotation. - It may be asked, How are we going to obtain our loan moneys? </para>
          <para>It is intended that the loan moneys required shall be found by making investments of the Australian Notes Fund and the General Trust Fund in Commonwealth Inscribed Stock. </para>
          <para>The late Government loaned to the States and banks &#163;5,720,000, viz., &#163;3,130,000  from  the Notes Fund for long periods maturing from 1919 to 1926, and &#163;2,590,000 for shorter periods, maturing between 17th September, 1913, and 30th September, 1914, and, in addition, lent further sums to the States amounting to &#163;1,310,000 from the General Trust Fund. </para>
          <para>It seems to me that it would have been wiser, in view of the demands on the Trust Funds for the purpose of these funds, and also for the railways and other works to be charged to loans obtained from these funds, if it-he investments had been, for shorter periods. </para>

          <para>Banks and Savings Banks. - &#39;The growth of the business of Savings Banks in Australia during the past twelve years has been phenomenal. On the 30th June, 1901, the number of depositors totalled 965,000, but by .the 31st March, 1913, the number had grown to 1,896,000, an increase of nearly 100 per cent, in the twelve years. During the same period the total amount on deposit in Savings Banks grew from &#163;31,000,000 to &#163;73,000,000, an increase of about 140 per cent., while the average per depositor increased from &#163;32 to &#163;38 10s., and the average per  head of population of the Commonwealth increased- from &#163;8 3s. to &#163;15 6s. la 1901 the number of depositors per 1,000 of population was 255, as compared with 397 in 1913. </para>
          <para>The growth of business of chequepaying banks during the twelve years has also been very great. The deposits have increased from &#163;91,000,000 in the June quarter of 1901, to &#163;152,000,000 in the March quarter of 1913, the current accounts having grown from &#163;37,000,000 to &#163;65,000,000, and the fixed deposits from &#163;54,000,000 to &#163;87,000,000, during that period. </para>
          <para>Similarly, the advances have grown from &#163;94,000,000 in 1901 to &#163;121,000,000 in 1913, and the banks&#39; holdings in coin and bullion from &#163;20,000,000 in 1901 to &#163;29,000,000 in 1913, notwithstanding the gold withdrawn from the banks for the Australian Notes gold reserve. </para>
          <para>The Government have not yet been able to do anything in the direction of preventing the duplication of the Savings Banks throughout the Commonwealth, and the consequent large, unnecessary, and wasteful expenditure. There was, in the opinion of the Government, no necessity for the Commonwealth to enter into competition with the Savings Banks of the States, which were beneficent and going concerns, whose operations greatly assisted the agricultural development of the Commonwealth. </para>
          <para>It is proposed to consult the State Governments with a view of placing the Savings Bank on a basis which will prevent duplication, and, at the same time, meet the requirement! of the people. </para>
          <para>On the 30th June last the deposits in the Commonwealth Savings Bank amounted to &#163;2,693,971, of which &#163;820,441 belonged to Tasmania. Of this &#163;2,693,971, a sum of &#163;1,945,367 was in-  vested, the interest accruing being &#163;27,133. </para>
          <para>Old-age and Invalid Pensions and Maternity Allowances. - It is proposed to amend the Old-age Pensions Act so as to provide that, when a pensioner enters a benevolent asylum, he shall do so as a free man, and as a &#34;paying guest,&#34; and any surplus above what is charged by the institution will belong to himself, and this will also apply  to an inmate of a benevolent asylum who becomes a pensioner while in the asylum. This will, it is thought, be con sidered a valuable provision, and will have the effect of making more happy and comfortable the aged pensioners of the Commonwealth in the evening of their days. It will, however, increase the oldage pensions expenditure by probably &#163;140,000 per annum. </para>
          <para>I think, however, that this proposal is both logical and fair, and I have pleasure in introducing and recommending it for the favorable consideration of honorable members. </para>
          <para>On 30th June, 191 3, there were 82,943 old-age pensioners and 13,739 invalid pensioners, and 82,556 maternity allowances had been paid. The &#39;total amount paid for these three classes during 1912-13 was &#163;2,701,828, and the estimated expenditure this year is &#163;3,270,000. </para>
          <para>In regard to the maternity allowance, it is not proposed to attempt an amendment this session. The estimated payment during this year is &#163;650,000. The Government is of opinion that the maternity allowance should be only given to those in need, and that the whole community should not be taxed to give money to those who can very well pay for themselves. </para>
          <para>There is no doubt that this maternity allowance cannot continue to be paid for very long, and that a system of social insurance must soon take its place. A system is under consideration which, it is believed, may secure all that is needed, on a contributory principle, by which the allowance could continue to be paid from the Consolidated Revenue for a short time to all contributors, subsequent benefits being drawn from the Social Insurance Funds. By this means those who do not&#34; need the allowance would be eliminated. </para>
          <para>The Government are most anxious to help those who are in need of the allowance, but are opposed to those who do not require it being a burden on the taxpayers. </para>
          <para>Railways. - The Commonwealth has embarked on railway construction, and the railway to connect Western and Eastern Australia is in progress, and, it is hoped, will be pushed forward with rapidity. Up to 30th June, 1913, a sum of &#163;606,985 had been expended on this work. </para>
          <para>Provision has already been made by loan authorization for &#163;1,000,000, and a further loan authorization for &#163;1,400,000 will be submitted at once. </para>
          <para>Papua. - You will also be asked to authorize &#163;60,000 being expended from loan funds on a railway from Port Moresby to Astrolabe, and for the construction of wharfs at Port Moresby and Samarai, in Papua. </para>
          <para>It is proposed to provide the &#163;60,000 as a loan to Papua. It is believed that this railway will greatly assist agricultural development, as well as the copper mines which exist in the district to be served. </para>
          <para>By the 30th June, 1914, the Commonwealth will have made grants to Papua (including &#163;78,125 for this year and the proposed loan of &#163;60,000 for railway purposes) of &#163;455,436. </para>
          <para>The estimated revenue of Papua for this year is &#163;45,598, and of this sum &#163;32,000 is raised from Customs duties. </para>

          <para>The Sugar Industry. - I come now to what has always been a rather difficult question, namely, that of the sugar industry. The consumption of sugar in Australia for this year is estimated at about 260,000 tons. The estimated production for this year is 226,991 tons, as compared with the production for last year of only 130,059. The amount of bounty paid last year was &#163;370,306. The net revenue from sugar last year, after paying bounty, was &#163;839,770, while for this year the net revenue will be only &#163;397,000, a loss of revenue owing to the abolition of Excise and bounty on 25th July, 1913, of &#163;442,770. The number of white men employed in the industry, including in factories, on 31st December, 1907, was 41,800, while on the 31st December, 1912, it was only 27,380. On 31st December, 1907, there were employed in the industry, including factories, 4,068 coloured persons, while on 31st December, 1912, there were only 1,383. The sugar produced in 1907 was 214,244 tons, while in 1912 it was 130,059 tons, and estimated for this year 226,991 tons. On 31st December, 1912, it appears that there were 14,420 fewer white men employed in the industry than in 1907, five years previously. The number of white men em- </para>

          <para>The sugar industry is suited to our northern lands, and must continue to be assisted in every way possible. Efforts must be made to induce its cultivation in the Northern Territory. This, I am certain, is the wish, as well as the duty, of every one. So long as our production of sugar does not exceed our consumption we can, by the barrier of Protection, secure the Home market by taking the burden on ourselves; but, so soon as our production exceeds our requirements, which is now imminent, we shall have to enter into competition with the production of sugar by the cheap coloured labour of the tropical world - labourers accustomed to another civilization altogether. Herein is our position and our difficulty, in regard not only to sugar, but to many other industries. It is difficult to suggest a remedy. Two suggest themselves to me. The first of these is that we should fill up our country with people who will be both producers and consumers, while the other is to continue to avail ourselves of the most up-to-date appliances so a3 to insure economical production. </para>

          <para>Agricultural Dairying,- ite. - During the past twelve years agriculture has made satisfactory progress, the total area under crop having increased from 8,400,000 acres in 1901 to 13,000,000 acres in 1912. The wheat yield for 1912 was 92,000,000 bushels, a yield for Australia which has only once been exceeded, viz., in 1910, when a total of 95,000,000 bushels was obtained. Large as it appears in itself, Australia&#39;s wheat yield is only about 2 per cent, of the world&#39;s production of this cereal. For the past ten seasons, Australia&#39;s average wheat yield has ranged between 8J bushels per acre in 1907, and 13f bushels in 1909, and has averaged 1 1 J bushels over the whole period. </para>
          <para>During the past twelve years the number of horses in Australia increased by 800,000, namely, from 1,600,000 in 1900 to 2,400,000 in 1912. In the same period the number of cattle increased by 3,000,000, viz., from 8,600,000 to 11,600,000, while the number of sheep increased by 13,000,000, viz., from 70,600,000 to 83,600,000. The extensive increases are the more remarkable in view of the fact that progress has not been continuous, owing to the severe drought of 1902, and the less severe, but still serious, adverse conditions of the early part of 1912. </para>
          <para>Rapid progress has also been made by the dairying industry during the past twelve years, as shown by the fact that the dairy herds of the Commonwealth, which in 1901 numbered 1,200,000, had by 1912 increased by 1,000,000 to a total of 2,200,000. During the same period the production of butter in Australia increased from 102,000,000 lbs. in 1901 to 187,000,000 lbs. in 1912, and the production of cheese from 11,600,000 lbs. in 1901 to 16,100,000 lbs. in 1912. </para>
          <para>Population. - At the initiation of  Federation, on the 1st January, 1901, the total population of Australia was 3,765,339, while on the 30th June,. 1913, it had grown to 4,801,946, a gain of 1,036,607 during the intervening twelve and a half years. This total advance in population comprised an increase of 524,922 in the case of males, and one of 511,685 in the case of females. At the last-mentioned date there were in Australia. 92 females to every 100 males. This rate of increase represents a gain of nearly 2 per cent, per annum, and, if it is maintained, the population of Australia will double itself in about thirty-six years. The rates of increase per annum of England and Wales are 1 per cent. ; Germany, lj per cent. ; United States of America, if per cent. ; and Canada, 2J per cent. </para>
          <para>During the twelve years, 1901 to 1912 inclusive, the total number of births in Australia was 1,329,000, and the total number of deaths 555,000. This gives a gain in population by natural increase of 774,000, and represents a natural increase of 1.6 per cent, per annum. This rate of natural increase is the highest in the world, and compares with 1.5 per cent, for Holland, 1.4 per cent, for Germany, 1.2 per cent, for England and Wales, and 1 per cent, for Ontario, the only Canadian Province for which data are available. </para>
          <para>A feature of the growth of population in Australia during the past twenty years has been the tendency to become more and more Australian-born. Thus at the census of 1891 the Australian-born represented 68 per cent, of the total population; at the census of 1901 they represented 77 per cent.; while at that of 1911 they represented 82.33 per cent, of the total. </para>
          <para>Conclusion. - This Government came into office only a week before the expiration of the financial year. In the last three years, during which the Liberals had been out of office, the annual expenditure of the Commonwealth increased from &#163;8,155,666, in 1909-10, to &#163;15,387,933 in 1912-13, the increase being &#163;7,232,267. </para>
          <para>The result of the termination of the Braddon clause, and the substitution of a contribution of 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> to the States, during the three financial years 1910-11, 1911-12, and 1912-13, was that &#163;14,190,095 more of the Customs and Excise revenue was retained by the Commonwealth. </para>
          <para>If we add to this the land tax revenue, which for the same three financial years amounted to &#163;4,152,676, we have the enormous sum of &#163;18,342,771 received by our predecessors (the Labour Government) which would not have been received if the Braddon clause had continued, and there had been no Federal land tax imposed. </para>
          <para>The unexpected possession of &#163;18,342,771 of extra revenue naturally encouraged a vastly increased expenditure that could not have been possible, or even thought of, otherwise, and, consequently, large expenditure has taken place from revenue, which would have been impossible under the conditions existing for the previous nine years of Federation. </para>
          <para>The Government do not intend to interfere with the expenditure to which the country is committed. We intend to administer the affairs of the Commonwealth on safe and economical lines, doing justice to all, and showing favoritism to none. We will do our best to restore public confidence, to stimulate enterprise, and give security to the whole people. &#34; I have performed my task.&#34; I have tried to place the financial position of the Commonwealth before honorable members, and &#34; a round, unvarnished tale deliver.&#34; Treasurers come and go, but millions of Australians will be here when we have all gone &#34; to the undiscovered country.&#34; </para>
          <para>If we seek to do our duty, our aim and object must be to act faithfully as trustees of a great inheritance, to be singleminded and patriotic, strenuously labouring for the present and for future generations. </para>

            <para>.- I have to congratulate the Treasurer on his Budget effort. I am sure he will pardon me when I suggest that, if he has the honour to deliver another Budget speech, he will not fail in that courtesy which has been invariable since this Parliament was instituted. I mean that I hope he will not fail to supply at least the Leader of the Opposition with a copy of the speech he proposes to read. In every other instance of the delivery of a Budget speech that has been done; but in the present instance the press was furnished with absolute copies, while I could not, by request, obtain one for myself. </para>

As I say, I congratulate the Treasurer on his effort, and particularly on his peroration. We have been told that the Government are here to do their best to restore confidence, and, no doubt, they are conscious of the fact that not only tho Ministry, but the party, need the confidence of the country. The Treasurer, by his Budget, proposes to expend over &#163;5,000,000 more than was expended by. the previous Government. The present Government came back from the country to initiate economy, restore the public finances to a proper condition, reduce taxation, and to clean up the maladministration of the late Government; but, true to Liberal instincts and the Liberal policy, their first Budget runs the country into debt. When the first Fisher Government came into power they were met with a deficit left by the late Liberal Government, and whoever succeeds the present Government will undoubtedly also have to meet a deficit. </para>

              <para>- No, I do not, because we secured a surplus purposely; we conserved the public finances in every instance. The honorable member for Hume ought to know that, in addition to that surplus, there is &#163;340,000 odd earned, in the Australian Notes Trust Fund, making practically &#163;3,000,000 of accumulated surplus left by the previous Government, which, as I say, began with a deficit. During our three years of office we expended in works, out of tho annual revenue, a sum of &#163;9,227,286, or, practically, &#163;10,000,000, in addition to the &#163;3,000,000 we left as a surplus The Treasurer points out that the late Government had over &#163;15,000,000 more during their three years of office than the previous Liberal Government had in the three years prior to 1910. </para>

              <para>- Which is not correct, in the sense in which the Treasurer puts it, because, if the honorable member for Hume knows anything of the finances, he must know that in 1910 no old-age pensions were paid, and that the party at present in power, when they succeeded the Fusion, passed a Loan Act for the purpose of raising &#163;3,500,000 to pay for the Fleet, whereas the Labour Government paid for it out of revenue. The mere fact that &#163;700,000 odd was not paid during the financial year was because of the delay in the construction of the ships. Before I left office, I asked the permanent, officials to pay every penny that could be paid, and my successor, the present Treasurer, undoubtedly did the very same thing. This&#39; was not an occasion when Treasurers were trying to keep back accounts; but, on the contrary, they were desirous to get every account in and to meet it. There was no lingering debt left to the present Government. I am sorry that the Treasurer has left the Chamber without waiting for a reply to his statements, but 1 must say that he either wilfully or ignorantly misled the House in at least one financial matter. I challenged the Treasurer regarding the investment of the Australian Notes Fund, and the General Trust Fund, and he emphasized and reiterated the statement that the investment of these two funds was long-dated and that the money would not be soon available. The figures in this connexion can be seen on reference to pages 67 and 68 of the Budget-papers. </para>

              <para>- On page 68 of the Budget-papers, under the heading of Trust Funds, we find, Western Australian Treasury Bills, &#163;100,000, due in 1913; &#163;100,000, in 1913; and &#163;200,000, in 1914; and fixed deposits, New South Wales Government, &#163;750,000, due in 1913 ; and Queensland State Government, &#163;160,000, due in 1914. The total amount available in less than sixteen months from those sources for re-investment by the Treasurer is &#163;4,440,000, plus &#163;2,653,000 which was left him as a surplus, making a grand total of &#163;7,093,000 available within that period. Could outrage in financial matters go further? This is the kind of thing the Treasurer desires shall go to the country; and he seeks to prevent, as far as possible, my getting a word in before Parliament adjourns for the week. The statement of the Treasurer would leave a false impression if it were not corrected. Does the right honorable member now say that those investments are longdated ? </para>

              <para>- The amount is &#163;3,130,000 in the first items that I quoted, but that is the amount available before the sixteen months. On the next page you have &#163;400,000 in Western Australian bills; and there are amounts of &#163;750,000 and &#163;160,000 on fixed deposit with the New South Wales and Queensland Governments. The total sumthat I have given, plus the surplus of &#163;2,653,000, makes over &#163;7,000,000 available for investment by the Treasury within sixteen months. Is not that enough? The Treasurer endeavoured to make capital out of comparisons between the expenditure prior to 1910 and since 1910, but those comparisons are worthless, and no one knows it better than the honorable member. Comparisons of that kind must, in anycase, be detrimental to Australia. I congratulate the Treasurer on his determination to pay &#163;5,000 this year towards the grant to Tasmania. The Tasmanian Customs Leakage Commission recommended that &#163;900,000 should be paid. The previous Government gave Tasmania a grant of &#163;500,000 towards that sum. The present Government are going to supplement the remainder, and are meeting their difficulties with fortitude by paying &#163;5,000 this year, and an additional increasing sum each successive year, so that, if they exist as a Government for the next ten or twelve years, they will make a substantial contribution to that fund. Our attitude was somewhat different. We commenced our payments with &#163;95,000 to begin with, providing for an increasing amount afterwards. If this money is to be paid, the time to pay it is when the State needs it - whenit is facing itsdifficulties. The Treasurer speaks about undertakingobligations without meeting them. What is he doing now but entering into an obligation without the energy or courage to face it? &#39;Why should the present Government leave this burden to another Government&#93; They are doing nothing in regard to the great question of looking after the lighthouses. Not much political capital can, be made out of neglect to look after shipping interests and the lighting of the coasts- </para>

              <para>- It is important; but it is not a vote-catching matter, and, therefore, it has been absolutely neglected. The Government provide actually less for lighthouses and quarantine than we did during our term of office, when we were initiating the services and expending every penny we could. They have actually put down a whole &#163;15,000 on the Estimates for lighthouses for this year, during which they are going to spend over &#163;5,000,000 which they are notearning. Does any honorable member believe that that is faithful government in the interests of Australia? We brought out an expertto report on these matters, and when his report was received, the honorable member for Yarra, as Minister of Trade and Customs, had a perfectly free hand to expend every penny he could legitimately spend in the improvement of the lighting of the Australian coast. The report, which is a very good one, is available, but the Government seem determined to do nothing with it, but for all practical purposes to hang it up. Such an attitude is not to their credit. What do they propose to do in the way of expenditure on quarantine, about which we have heard so much lately ? The late Government sent the Director of Quarantine all round the world to investigate the best ways of protecting the health of Australia, and his report was received and adopted, although with certain variations. We put a sum of &#163;50,000 on the Estimates, and expended a large part of it. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member had a perfectly free hand to expend it all. The present Government have placed only &#163;40,000 or the Estimates for this important purpose. We have heard a great deal about the necessity of courageous action on the part of the Government in regard, to quarantine for the protection of the health of Australia, but the Government are spending only a paltry sum on the two important questions of the safety of our shipping and the protection of the public health from diseases from abroad, although they are expending &#163;5,000,000 morethan their revenue. Reference has been made from time to time to the borrowing by the previous Government for certain public works. It has never been the policy of the Labour party at any time to refrain from borrowing money to expend on legitimate public works, but it has been their practice, which is much better than a policy, wherever practicable and possible, to expend on permanent public works any surplus revenue which was made available. During their three years in office our Government expended over &#163;9,000,000 in that way on such works, including defence, and a large part of the success of the Postal Department at the present time is due to the fact that during those three years a great deal of the revenue was put into capital expenditure. As a result the annual revenue is now increasing proportionately to the amount of services rendered. The Treasurer was good enoughto say that the service was of increasing value to the Commonwealth, and that the annual returns were increasing, notwithstanding the introduction of penny postage. I believe it is a matter of indifference to the people of Australia whether the Department actually pays or not, so long as the services are faithfully managed. </para>

              <para>- I will not press that word, but he meant that all these increases in expenditure brought about the difficulty that the Treasurer would find himself in to provide money for .the various services of the. Commonwealth. What did he expect? Does -the Treasurer desire that the remuneration of the employes shall be less in times of prosperity, or that the people who perform services for the Department, outside the permanent officials, shall receive less, for their labour than they did. before ? Does he expect that material will be cheaper in times of prosperity? I do not see how he can expect it, nor do I see what complaint he has. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member followed that statement up, as nearly as I can recollect, by saying, &#34; This&#39; makes a very grave situation, which must be- looked into&#34;; and speaking subsequently, he added, &#34; As regards that large expenditure, I am glad that we shall soon have a committee of public accounts to look into all these matters.&#34; Did not the right honorable gentleman say that? I think he did. In this regard he either said too much, or said too little. He left on my mind the impression that the present payments for Post Office and ether services were too high; but I do not believe that there is any waste in the Public Service of the Commonwealth worth talking about. A certain amount of waste is inseparable in a progressive country, and the marvel is that there have not been more blunders. In 1908-9, the National Parliament, from being merely a Parliament receiving revenue, and returning it to others, took on obligations of every kind, and did so without organized Departments and organized staffs, and it has expended over 50 per cent, more of revenue without any seriousblunders that I am aware of, which is a credit to the permanent heads of the Departments, apart altogether from any reflected glory on the Ministry that had to undertake it. Honorable members of the present Ministry are in a great deal better position than their predecessors, because they have organized Departments to deal with this expenditure. They have been searching the records for blunders and suspicious transactions that they told the public were bound to be discovered. I invite them to immediately detail everything they can discover, but though the previous Government were called upon to expend these millions, so far they have discovered nothing that is worth revealing in a political or any other sense. I believe there are too few people in Australian public life who take an optimistic view, of the possibilities of development on safe lines of the Governments of Australia, and especially of the National Government. Five years ago there, were few members in this House who would have done anything but shudder had they been told what functions the Federal Government are now undertaking, but to-day there is no responsible member in this House who is. prepared to go back again to the old state of affairs&#39; The national idea is worth something, but it must have Ministers to give effect to it. The present Government, like all their predecessors called Liberal, seek to beat time and do as little as possible. They, will pledge the public credit in loan expenditure for some contingency years in the future. But the people know them. They remember when Liberal Governments were in power in the States how soup kitchens were in vogue in the great cities, and how shifting sand and dipping water was the work given to those who could not otherwise be remuneratively employed. Probably if they have their way and the power, they will get back to that state of affairs, but I do not think the Democracy will allow it. </para>

              <para>- I am not objecting to that. I say that whatever the people desire they can have, but I say that the people will not be obsessed all the time. The honorable member forgets the privileged position he occupies as a member of his party. It is an old-established party with old traditions, and a name earned, not by the present members of it, but by the grand traditional party of past years, though I must say that the former name is not borne by the present party. It has the aid of 80 per cent, of the press. Anything honorable members say that is likely to have a favorable effect on their political existence will be duly recorded; anything they&#34; say that is likely to have an unfavorable effect will be carefully edited ; anything their opponents say that may have a detrimental effect on them will undoubtedly be suppressed or toned down, and any little blunders or slips their op- portents may make will receive Hue prominence. But, giving all that in - and I am not complaining of it, because it is party warfare - we stand by our principles, and are glad to have the opportunity of being the exponents of them. Let me again express my thanks to the Treasurer for the manner in which he has delivered his Budget. I am sure he felt proud when he was dealing, not with millions, but with tens of millions. I could see his swelling pride when he spoke about being able to spend this money in the defence of the country, and that money in the development of this great continent. It is true that he is &#34;going to do it on money that he has not collected himself; he is going to do it in the same handsome way he has always done it - on money borrowed from others, or accumulated during the period of office of another Government. But giving all that in, I congratulate the Treasurer on his effort, and I join with the right honorable gentleman in wishing for the welfare of the people of Australia, the prosperity of this great country, and its development on sound lines, and in the hope that every person who honestly gives his labour to the production of commodities of necessity, comfort, and pleasure, will have an ample and full reward. I propose to continue my speech on some future occasion. </para>

          <para>.- I do not wish to detain honorable members, but I have a very important matter to bring under the attention of the Home Affairs Department, and, in the absence of the Honorary Minister, I trust the Minister of Trade and Customs will make a note of the matter. I refer to the way in which electors are receiving notices about being struck off the roll. I have a copy of a notice served on a farmer in my electorate. This man has been living in the same place for two and a half years, and has not been away from his residence more than three days at a stretch. It would seem that some one is exceptionally eager to have people struck off the roll, though these people have every right not to be objected to. This is the notice my constituent has received - </para>

            <para>- I am telling the Minister of what has occurred. My constituent wrote to me on receiving this notice. He wished to know why he had been objected to though he had not been away from his domicile. I immediately replied, advising him -to write to the Registrar, giving the full  particulars,  when, no doubt, the matter would be rectified; but later I received a letter from my constituent informing me that no reply had been received from the Registrar, and my correspondent said it was time he had heard something about the matter. Upon this, I communicated with the Registrar, and asked how it was that a man could reside in one place for two and a half years and be objected to. I received a letter from the Registrar telling me that everything had been fixed up all right, and that the elector&#39;s name had not been expunged from the list. But why should a man be harassed in that way ? I cannot conceive of electoral officers doing these things on their own initiative. I have another case - that of a railway employe. This man was living in one of those humpies, or miserable hovels, the State Railway Department supplies for some of the stationmasters, but, in this case, the Department saw fit to be a little magnanimous and liberal, and built a new residence a few yards away, in the same railway grounds. Because this man and his family moved out of the old hovel into the new house, four names on the roll for the old place have been objected to. This is a condition of affairs in connexion with electoral matters that should be stopped at once by any reasonable Government, and if I continue to receive more notices of objection like this, I shall go as far as to move the adjournment of the Souse on every day it is sitting to call attention to every objection I receive; and I shall advise my electors, if they are to be objected to in this manner, that the best thing they can do is for &#34;the whole of them to send in fresh claim cards to the Electoral Office. Then there will be a nice picnic. But I am not going to have these people disfranchised, and I bring this matter forward now, even at the risk of trespassing on the patience of honorable members; because to take away from a man a vote to which he is entitled is one of the worst things that can happen to a community. I hope that the Minister will take notice of the matter. </para>

          <para>. - I wish to bring under the notice of the Minister a similar matter. Last election day, in the Yarra division, a lady was prevented from voting, the objection being taken that her name had been struck off the roll. Afterwards I made inquiries, and found that it had been struck off because she and her granddaughter had the same names, and the latter was on the Ballarat roll. I wrote to the Electoral Department, and her name was subsequently placed on the roll again for the Abbotsford subdivision, but a day or two ago she received a card saying that it had been objected to a second time and her name had been struck off again, although she has been continuously residing in. the same house for many years. I have, of course, written to the Returning Officer for the Division of Yarra, asking him to have matters put right. I draw attention to the case here because, if names are to be struck off simply . because they are the same as other names, electors who possess names that are very common will run great risk of being disfranchised. If an elector can be struck off the roll, reinstated, and struck off a second time, although attention has been called to her case, goodness knows what may happen to those with regard to whom no notice is taken. </para>

          <para>.- Having looked at the Budget-papers again, I find that &#163;7,093,000 of invested money will be available for the Treasurer within twelve months. I overstated the time when I said just now that it would be available within sixteen months. There is another matter to which I draw attention. The Prime Minister, when interrogated this morning regarding a very important act of administration - the relieving from duty of the second member of the Naval Board, who came to this country with the highest recommendations from the Admiralty to assist in the development of the Naval Unit - asked for notice of the question, and gave no information. There are some administrative acts which ought not to be paraded in Parliament, but this is not one of them. An officer cannot be suspended or relieved from duty, which is practically the same thing, and the fact be kept secret. This officer occupied important positions before he came here, and has enjoyed the confidence of two Governments in an important Commonwealth position. &#39;  His  standing is such that we ought to know what is the difference between him and the Executive. Had I been present when the question was asked, I should have myself desired information from the Prime Minister. To-night, of course, we have sworn a truce, it being agreed that no controversial matters would be entered upon, but I ask the Minister of Trade and Customs to be good enough to inform his chief that I consider that he should take&#39; Parliament and the country into his full confidence in regard to this matter at the earliest moment. Whatever may be the views of the Government, I regard this action as a serious one. We should know whether Captain Onslow&#34; has been suspended for incapacity, or because of some difference on a question of policy. The Government cannot use its power to  do an officer injury without giving an opportunity for the discussion of the action taken. I do not wish to press the matter further now. I am not speaking for Captain Onslow, because I have not been in communication with him, either directly or indirectly, nor have I been in communication with any of his friends, but things cannot be allowed to remain as they stand. I do not want to be informed privately what the trouble is; the information should be given to Parliament. I venture to say that Parliament will demand the reasons for the action taken. The creation and management of the Australian Navy is a matter of the first importance to the people of Australia, and Parliament cannot be safely left without the fullest information on any matter concerning it. </para>

            <para>- The honorable member for Lilley was recommended as a candidate worthy - of support. If he objects to the use of his name, why does he not rise in his place and condemn what was done? Why does he not join with me in denouncing the issue of a secret circular of that kind ? We are perfectly willing to meet circulars that are published openly, but it is only rarely that we have an opportunity of knowing of the existence of secret circulars. That such circulars have been issued for some time past is apparent, because of the statement, in the circular to which I refer, &#34;that information is contained in previous circulars stating that the Labour party is more pliant than any other party in regard to pandering to the Roman Catholic vote.&#34; In the report of my speech which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> of 24th September - I do not complain of the length of the report, which extends over twenty or thirty lines, because that is as much as one can reasonably expect in a telegram, no matter how long the speech may be - it is stated that I said that the issue of the circular would have been all right in the days of Henry VIII. I did not say that it would be right at any time. I do not think that at any period of history any body of men should issue a secret circular condemning parliamentary candidates, and appealing to sectarian prejudices. The same report that was sent to the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> seems to have been sent to the Brisbane <inline font-style="italic">Telegraph,</inline> and the passage to which I take exception appears in that newspaper. If the source of a report is inaccurate, the inaccuracy is published over a wide area. Probably the same report will appear in several country newspapers in Queensland. I wish, therefore, to make this correction, so that it may be printed in the pages of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Maughan</inline> was the only Labour candidate in Queensland whose name was recommended by the Loyal Orange Institution of the State. </para>

            <para>- It appears to be their practice to take up one Labour candidate and put him on their ticket, to try to make the public think that they are impartial, and not opposed root and branch to  the Labour party. I warn wageearners - me a who are working for 8s. a day, and have been working for that wage for twenty years, the men who are .suffering from those diseases which attack the workers in mines for long  periods - that they should not be misled. I warn them against the practices of individuals opposed to the Labour party, who are using the Loyal Orange Institution in favour of my Tory friends opposite,  including the Minister of Home Affairs. I ask them not to think that this institution is impartial because it recommends the giving of support to one Labour candidate. There can be no doubt that the political wire-pullers who issued this secret circular are totally opposed to the Labour party, and every wage-earner in Queensland ought to be made aware of that fact. </para>

          <para>.- I desire to explain that it was absolute news to me that there had been issued in Queensland such a circular as that referred to by the honorable member for Capricornia, and that the organization by which it was issued had connected with it a political committee. I shall not question the right of that organization, or of any other body, to issue to its members a confidential circular. </para>

            <para>- No but I would not question the right of an association to issue a strictly private circular to its members, although I should object to its making a circular of this kind public. I hold the opinion that the honorable member should not have made use of the circular without first ascertaining whether it was issued with the consent or knowledge of the men affected by it. That is the course which a regard for the ordinary relations of life would dictate. In every-day life one would not think of making use of a confidential communication, except in so far as it related to oneself. That, however, is what the honorable member for Capricornia did not do. He would have been justified in quoting it in so far as it affected himself; but by his action he has compelled one of his own colleagues to make an explanation, and will cause others to do so. The honorable member has given to this circular a publicity that it would not have secured if he had not read it here. It will cause a lot of mischief. </para>

            <para>- It is news to me. As an old newspaper man, the honorable member for Capricornia ought to have known that, if he had a grievance against the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> or the Brisbane <inline font-style="italic">Telegraph,</inline> the proper procedure for him to follow was to write to those newspapers correcting the misstatement, instead of availing himself of the forms of the House to do so. I am amazed, however, to find that the practice followed by him is quite a common one in this House. Speaking as a new member, and as a journalist, I do not think it is the correct course to follow. </para>

            <para>- In this circular they gave the honorable member for Capricornia and others a political stab, and I gather, from the honorable member&#39;s reading of it, that at the same time they recommended my candidature. But, so far as I can recollect, no reference whatever was made to my opponent, so that it is incorrect to say that he received a stab. For some reason they appear to have preferred me. </para>

            <para>- In deference to your request, sir, I withdraw it. So far as I am aware, I have never met this officer, and am not holding a brief for him. My sole desire is to see that justice is done where I believe that an injustice has been perpetrated. If there is any good reason for. the action taken in relieving this officer of his duties, and giving information of that fact to the newspaper press, why not let us know of it at once ? Why does the Prime Minister say, &#34;Yes, I will give you the information next week &#34; ? Captain Onslow was drawn from the British Navy, and appointed to the position of second member of the Naval Board because of his ability and bis recommendations. Surely he is not to he removed, from such a position and a stigma allowed to rest upon him. But the Prime Minister says, &#34; I will give you a statement of the case next Tuesday.&#34; There is nothing decent about that. IE is just such an attitude as might be adopted towards an individual unworthy of the slightest consideration. We know that the Prime Minister is now on his way to Sydney. I see that the Treasurer is now present, and I therefore repeat my request that honorable members may be supplied with a proof of the right honorable member&#39;s speech to-morrow morning. </para>

The honorable member for Kalgoorlie informed us &#39;that he did not speak as one holding a brief for this officer, and any one who followed his remarks must have recognised that he was not speaking in this officer&#39;s interest. It was abundantly clear that he was using this unfortunate incident as a means of attacking the Government, and was not considering the best interests of the Australian Navy. </para>

However, I do not wish any heat to be introduced into this discussion. I point out to my honorable friends opposite that circumstances as unfortunate have arisen on previous occasions, and have not always been treated as an opportunity for the exhibition of party feeling. I can remember, for instance, that the ex-Minister of Defence had to dispense with the services of a very distinguished sailor. </para>

            <para>- And so was the last a Ministerial act. We do not ask for any better treatment than was cheerfully and freely accorded to the&#39; preceding Minister of Defence, the then Opposition recognising that discretion and temperance were the best assistance we could give in view of the welfare of the Australian naval administration. In due course, I have no doubt, honorable members opposite will receive the replies they are expecting. Let them wait until there is an opportunity to ask the questions, to which the Prime Minister has promised to give consideration on Tuesday, when we can have the matter dealt with free from party feeling and heat.- </para>

          <para>. - I should like to say a few words in connexion with the naval sensation,&#39; and in doing so I do not seek to make any attack on the Government, or the&#34; Minister. I have always contended that the Minister of Defence should be a member of the House of Representatives. This is one of our greatest spending De- partments, and, therefore, the political head ought to be in the Chamber which has control of the public moneys. Honorable members, in dealing with the Defence Department, are always weakened by the fact that the Minister is represented by another honorable gentleman in this House, who is not fully familiar with all the affairs of the Department,  and has really no responsibility in connexion with it; and I quite understand the position of the present Honorary Minister, and also the position that the honorable member for Adelaide occupied in the previous Administration. What I object to is that, whenever a man is appointed to the Naval Board who has proved of any use to the Navy of Australia, he is got rid of, by hook or by crook. Captain Hardy, an efficient sailor and organizer, with a faculty for managing men, came out from the Old Country with credentials as long as my arm, in order to take superintendence of the Naval Depot at Williamstown. We all know how hard it is to satisfy a body of men; but it was admitted that Captain Hardy used every endeavour to secure efficiency at the Dep6t generally. However, he fell foul of the Naval Board, and it was a question whether he or the Naval &#39; Board should go, and, of course, he went. I have met Captain Onslow several times, and it is evident that he is a sailor, and not a social man.  His  record proves his. efficiency and capacity for the position to which he was appointed. I do not wish to speak slightingly of the other members of the Board; but, as a matter of fact, he was the only sailor amongst them. Almost the whole of the naval work is done in my electorate of Melbourne Forts, and these matters come under my notice; but I have always found that, try as one will to get justice, no matter what Government are in power, nobody can get justice from the .Board. By hook or by crook they have always managed to get the best of the Ministry. If the Naval Board is the best system of running the show, we might as well give it up at once ; and I would suggest to the present Go,vernment that we ought to bring a man from the English Navy out here who &#39;will be able to undertake the management of affairs, in place of the ineffective system, and the ineffective men, we have at the present time. Al-* though the Minister of Defence for the time being is always the  Chairman  of the Naval Board, he is hardly likely to have a great knowledge of naval matters; and&#39; it is certain that, up to the present, so far as the Naval Board is concerned, there has been nothing but dissension, which, if it continues much longer, will lead to chaos. It would have been better if the Government, instead of suspending only one man, had suspended the whole crowd of .them until some improvement was made. I do not want to use threats, nor to take advantage of my position in this House to make a cowardly attack on any member of the Board, but they certainly take advantage of their position on the Board to make cowardly attacks on other men. It is highly necessary for the Government to introduce some system of controlling the Naval Department that would be beneficial to Australia, instead of continuing the hybrid system in existence to-day. </para>
