                    <para>- I desire to make a personal explanation. Speaking on the adjournment motion on Friday last, I referred to the small-pox epidemic in Sydney, but was called out of the Chamber to attend to a very important matter before the motion was put. I understand that the Prime Minister, in replying, referred in a disparaging way to my absence, suggesting that the small-pox epidemic was of no importance to me, as I was not then present. If such a remark was made, it was disparaging to me, and unworthy of the Prime Minister. </para>

There has been some delay in agreeing to the exact wording of the deed of contract, but the document is now with the West Australian Government for signature. </para>

It is a serious thing to have perishable products delayed on their way to market, and a strike is serious for all parties. I regret to learn that there is a strike. I thought that the terms and conditions of employment on the wharfs had been settled by the Arbitration Court, and that no strikes were possible under its awards. We are frequently told that no award of the Court has ever been disregarded. </para>

                            <para>- It was laid down in the original agreement that the State Parliament should pass legislation providing for certain industrial conditions. The State Parliament has passed those laws dealing with the industrial conditions, and the effect of the legislation is that "the schedule of wages prescribed by the Act is regarded as an award of the Industrial Court. Therefore, any breaches of the award, or any failure to fulfil the conditions, is a matter for administration by the State authorities in connexion with their enforcement. It is not within the scope of the Federal authorities to inquire into the conditions or any breach of them. However, if the honorable member will give me specific instances of any breach or failure to fulfil the conditions, I shall be glad to make the necessary representations with respect to them. </para>

The sorters on the trains will sort the letters, as far as they can, and if the public post more letters than can be sorted, they will be carried on to the capital cities of the States, and will not go out until later deliveries.

                        <para>- It has often been the subject of complaint that the authorized reports of the judgments of the High Court are not published immediately after the judgments are delivered. But I would remind the honorable member that that is impossible, because the authorized reports have to be carefully scrutinized by each of the Judges who  have taken part in giving them, and that can only be done at times when their other duties will enable them to do so. The corrected proof is the final record of the decision of the law, but there are available to lawyers and Courts, some considerable time before the revised reports come out, reports which are usually quite accurate. For instance, there are the <inline font-style="italic">Argus Law Reports,</inline> the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Law Times,</inline> and other reports which are very largely used. </para>

                            <para>- It would be a desirable thing to do, but I do not think that the Commonwealth ought to issue anything that is not an authorized and certified report. In my opinion, it would be foolish to do so, and the difficulty might be got over by fuller newspaper reports, or by some other means. For the reasons I have stated, the authorized Commonwealth reports cannot be published immediately after the decisions are given. </para>

We all regret deeply that there should be any suffering or loss in Sydney, but I would repeat that the loss being sustained in that city is chiefly due to the existence of the disease there. The Commonwealth regulations only deal with the passage of persons from that city to other States. All that we require, with the intention of preventing the spread of the disease, is the vaccination of persons going from the quarantined area to other States, </para>

                            <para>- Is the Minister of Trade and Customs aware that every day in New York, New Orleans, and other cities, more people are suffering from small-pox than are now suffering in Sydney, and that the only steps taken in those cities is to isolate the patients, and hang out a red flag. In view of the summer coming on, and the great things that are going to happen in Sydney shortly, is it not possible to remove the present ban of exclusiveness, so that honorable members may be able to go to that city by the 4th of next month? </para>

                                <para>- I have only the honorable member's statement of the condition of affairs in the United States, but if the disease of small-pox is always there, it is probably because the authorities do not take the same precautions that have been taken in Australia. My information is that all immigrants to the United States have to be vaccinated, and that in the Philippines, and other areas, the authorities, by vaccination and revaccination, have completely eradicated the disease from very seriously infected districts. Experience shows that panic vaccination is not enough, but that a steady course of vaccination and revaccination is the best method for completely eradicating the disease. </para>

                            <para>- Is the Minister of Trade and Customs aware that in Sydney there is a growing feeling that the quarantine area should be reduced to the small districts in which the disease is known to exist? At present, 650,000 people have an embargo placed upon them and are prevented from travelling into other States, whereas the suggestion made would confine the quarantine arrangements to a small number of people, as was done in the case of the plague. </para>

New books are received from the booksellers on approval, and the Librarian examines these and makes three lists of them, recommending such books as he thinks should be added to the Library. In addition, he and his principal assistant receive certain newspapers devoted to literature, which are examined, and recommendations made from them. Booksellers' catalogues, which are sent to the Library by all the leading London booksellers, are also examined for second-hand books whose acquisition is desirable. All recommendations of the Librarian are laid before a book selection committee appointed by the Library Committee, which indorses, rejects, or adds to the recommendations as its members see fit. In addition, members' recommendations of books for purchase are also decided upon by the subcommittee. </para>

A few duplicates in the twelve years since the Library was founded, and before the catalogue was complete, have been bought in error, but of many books it is necessary to have duplicates. And in a Public Library, such as the Parliamentary Library will become in the Federal City, it is very advisable to have reserve copies of a large number of books, especially of those relating to Australia which are now out of print. </para>

                    <para>That this Bill be now read a second time. </para>
                    <para>Honorable members will notice that in this Bill expression has been given to the policy of building up from existing things, and remodelling existing things, rather than of destroying and starting anew; and that, in order to endeavour to avoid any confusion that can possibly be avoided, we have made as few changes in the original Act as possible, consistent with administrative efficiency, electoral security, a free franchise, and a free press. I hope that honorable members will not be in any way discouraged by the number of clauses contained in the measure. A very considerable number of them are clauses of a purely consequential nature. Indeed, sir, this Bill in one respect is suggestive of those daring ladies who are at present taxing the endurance of American magistrates by " bumping up against " the dress regulations of some of the States; because by means of these consequential amending clauses, the Bill, like the ladies to whom I have referred, has a pretty extensive covering of immaterial things. </para>
                    <para>In order that honorable members may be able to separate, in their minds, the consequential clauses from the remainder of the measure, I will give a bare recital of them. Clauses 3, 4, 6, 9, 16, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, and 34 are either consequential in a verbal way or consequential upon some alterations effected by other portions of the measure under review. </para>
                    <para>The clauses which aim at administrative efficiency are as follow - numbers- 5, 7, 11, 13, 14, 15, and 17. I may add that all these proposals would necessarily have been suggested by the Electoral Office whatever Ministry had been in power. No. 5 deals with the appointment of electoral inspectors. I do not desire at this stage to emphasize the point - which I am sure needs very little emphasis amongst honorable members; but I may say that- the Chief Electoral Officer hasreported strongly in regard to this matter. Consequently, I think it is rather a matter for supplying honorable members with information from his report if they desire to have it during the Committee stage. Clause 7, dealing with the appointment of emergency officers to the position of Returning Officer and assisting Returning Officer, is a proposal that has become necessary owing to a defect that has been found to exist in the original Act. Under the principal Act an appointment could be made only when a vacancy had occurred,and in cases where a Divisional Returning Officer or an Assistant Returning Officer had become suddenly ill it was not certain in law that a vacancy had occurred. The result was that the Electoral Office was placed in a very awkward position in the absence of the immediate opportunity of securing Executive action. The amendment proposed will obviate that- difficulty. The next proposal of a machinery nature is that set out in clause 11. It aims at preventing the glutting of the rolls immediately prior to a general election. The Chief Electoral Officer reports on this matter as follows: - </para>
                    <para>Unless the law is amended as proposed, it will always be impracticable, on the eve of an election, to make the necessary adjustments consequent upon duplications resulting from the errors of electors, and upon transfer and changes in the rolls to be used at the elections. Under the existing law, the Commonwealth Electoral Officers are unable, in the limited time at their disposal, to adjust a large number of these duplications (the result of errors by ' electors), which occur during the period immediately pieceding the issue of the writ for an election, and the Electoral Registrars are unable, in many cases, to remove the names of persons who have secured change or transfer of enrolment immediately prior to the issue of the writ. </para>
                    <para class="block">I may say that the statistical returns, when contrasted with the number of persons actually enrolled at the last general elections, show the pressing need for some such alteration in the machinery of the Act as is indicated in this Bill. If honorable members will bear with me for a moment, I would like to point out that whilst on the 31st May last there were no less than 2,885,000 names on our electoral rolls, only 2,710,000 persons of adult age, and eligible for enrolment, were estimated to be in the Commonwealth. So that there was the great surplusage of 175,000 persons to be accounted for, and it is to prevent any repetition of that sort of thing that the Electoral Office desires this provision to be included in the measure. </para>

We desire every person whose name ought to be on our electoral rolls to have every chance of recording an honest vote, but we do not wish our rolls to be inflated with the names of persons who do not exist in fact. Nor do we desire our rolls to be swollen by voters' names being duplicated. . </para>

                            <para>- No, I learnt it at nightschool. I am sure honorable members will see that the measure is a fairly comprehensive one. I wish to give them all the information that I can, but I do not desire to be interrupted by an honorable member who is not seeking information, but who is merely endeavouring to establish as a fact that which does not exist. The next amendment aiming at reforming electoral administration deals with the abolition of the 5s. deposit required in connexion with objections to names which appear on the rolls. Other safeguards are proposed in its stead. The abolition of this deposit is intended to bring to the Electoral Department the assistance of every person in Australia in regard to these objections. It marks a very important step, but it does not wipe out a section of the Act which has been availed of to any appreciable extent. Indeed, I am informed that the only case in which an elector has paid 5s. with the object of securing the removal of another person's name from the roll is that of a lady who felt it worth her while to prove that an elector whose name was given on the roll as <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Jones</inline> was not, in fact, <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Jones.</inline> Every other person has shirked the trouble of lodging a deposit of 5s. for the exercise of what, after all, ought to be a civic duty- </para>

In this measure we have followed the logical course by placing objections upon a similar basis. As a result, any person residing in a particular locality, and being aware that another elector has quitted that locality, will be able to assist the Department with his knowledge. I would remind honorable members that, in a country like Australia, some such provision is absolutely essential if we are to secure the assistance of the public in such matters. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- If the honorable member does not want the Australian public to take any interest in the purity of our electoral rolls, by all means let him resist this proposition. He will then be in the position which he ought to occupy if he is honestly of that opinion. If, however, he does wish the public to take an intelligent interest in the purity of our electoral rolls, he ought to give them every possible facility to object to the names of persons improperly appearing there. If he does not wish to see double enrolments, if he desires an honest electoral system, of which the public may be proud, I take it that the only course that can be properly adopted , is that in which the Electoral Department now concurs. To draw attention to the size of some of our electoral divisions, I might mention that Dampier embraces a larger area than the United Kingdom, Prance, Germany, and Austria. Manifestly, it is impossible for an elector residing in that division to be certain that another elector who has left his neighbourhood has gone out of the division. Under the Act, an elector lodging an objection must make sure that the person whose name is objected to has departed from the division, but under the amending provision the person objecting will be asked to make sure only of a matter that can reasonably be expected to be within his knowledge - that is, of departure from the subdivision - and the Department will, under such circumstances, welcome assistance. Another administrative amendment which I am afraid will occasion my honorable friends opposite some displeasure, but which is none the less urgently necessary, provides for the abolition of Saturday polling. </para>

I come now to the two main policy provisions of the measure, by which we destroy nothing, but by which we hope to recreate  principles which are essential to any Liberal electoral measure. That flower of Democratic initiative, the freedom of the press, is sought to be reinstated in this Federal measure; and the franchise is again to be extended to a large body of persons, from whom it ought never to have been taken away, persons who, lying on beds of sickness, or who, pioneering far from polling booths, are laying the milestones of our country's progress. </para>

For no nobler purpose, then, than to hit at a press that was criticising his party, the honorable member for Wide Bay struck at that basis of free institutions, the freedom of the press. </para><para>But what could he be thinking of when he said that the party had no press to defend it? Did he forget that throughout Australia there are newspapers specially subsidized by Labour organizations which turn out, week by week, the most glaring betrayals of the truth that have ever been consistently published in any part of the world ? I do not wonder that he sought to deny the Labour press; but it, nevertheless, exists, and is paid for by the same forces that return him and his followers to Parliament. It was because he wished to curb the criticism of the other  unsubsidized  newspapers in Australia, Liberal and Independent, that he supported the electoral " gag." </para><para>What the honorable member put in a guarded way the honorable member for Gwydir expressed unguardedly. He admitted that the Labour Administration was fearful of any criticism whatever regarding its methods. "The press," he said, " cannot injure a party that is fighting to win a position, but it can, by ite misrepresentation of words and actions, injure the reputation of a party in power." I can only say in regard to that naive admission that the present Administration fears no criticism. Ministers regard a free press as the basis of free institutions, and we would rather lose our positions as the result of unjust criticism than deny the right of criticism to the press. Here is another statement by the honorable member for Gwydir - </para><quote>
                        <para>If we were to say outside what the journalists write of us, we would be called to account by the Courts of the country, but those who control the newspapers are too wealthy, and can command too much legal talent for it to be possible for us to attack them with much chance of success. </para>
                    </quote><para>What is that but an admission that the press "gag" was specially provided to give the honorable member and his brethren the opportunity to intimidate individual newspaper writers. These comparatively poor men, who have not financial support commensurate with the wealth of the organizations supporting the Labour party, are to be victimized, or to be driven by fear of consequences from expressing what they believe to be the truth. The statement shows that the press "gag" was devised deliberately by the Labour Administration as an engine of terrorization and victimization, and it is, therefore, one of the first duties of this Liberal Administration to wipe it off the statute-book. The honorable member for Capricornia said - </para><quote>

                            <para>- I am glad to think they are beginning to weaken a little on this matter ; but the honorable member will remember the confidence with which they wiped out that privilege to the sick and the infirm only a few years ago. Why did they do so? For no better reason than that, out of 84,000 votes cast under this system in 1910, 49,000 odd were cast for the Liberal party, whilst only 33,000 odd went to honorable gentlemen opposite. For no nobler purpose than merely to abolish a vote that was of no party advantage to them they actually denied to the sick people of this community the right to express their verdict on the country's affairs. </para>

                            <para>-I think that, if honorable members opposite do not give us a chance of doing business, they will have an election very quickly, but I hope that we shall first have a chance of putting our electoral law in order. I have read to honorable members the list of authorized witnesses. Why do we specially choose these persons? Because, in connexion with this vote, we place very material responsibilities on their shoulders. Take, for instance, the first duty of an authorized witness. Under the Bill, subject to a fine of £50, or one month's imprisonment, he has placed upon him the responsibility of seeing that the postal voter makes proper application for his vote. He has to know personally the applicant, or satisfy himself as to his identity. He has to satisfy himself as to the facts set out in the application, and he must witness the proper signature of the applicant. The applicant, I may say, is equally liable to a fine of £50, or one month's imprisonment, if he exceeds or evades any of the obligations under the Bill. Now, honorable members who have been saying of recent weeks that the electoral affairs of Australia are absolutely safe in the hands of the most honest public, I believe, that exists throughout the world, must surely be making a somersault with extraordinary celerity if they now say that specially authorized witnesses, subject to these fines, pains, and penalties, will deliberately do a dishonest thing to secure for some other person than themselves a benefit. Unless honorable gentlemen had their tongues in their cheeks during the last few weeks, they must recollect that it is nothing but hypocrisy and cant to suggest that these persons cannot be trusted in this regard. </para>

                    <para>Let us see what next happens in regard to the postal vote. After having been specially witnessed by an authorized person, with all these safeguards, the application is sent to the Returning Officer, who, after he satisfies  himself  that no previous application has been put in, whether for an absent voter's certificate or for a postal voter's certificate, can send to the applicant a postal voter's certificate and ballot-paper. When the ballot-paper reaches the applicant, he again has to call in an authorized witness, and to show the ballot-paper and the envelope to the witness. The witness is to see these things, but is specially instructed, under pains and penalties .amounting to a fine of £100 or three months' imprisonment, that on no account must he see or know how the voter votes j and - if it is a question of having to help an illiterate person - under the same pains and penalties he is bound down not to betray the information. </para>

                    <para>After the placing of the ballot-paper in the envelope and its despatch by the voter in the way set out, the vote is to go to the Returning Officer for the division, and his duty is to compare the signature on the application form with the signature on the outside of the envelope covering the ballot-paper, to see that the applicant is really the person who is voting. Right from beginning to end, therefore, the system is thoroughly safeguarded, and it is the safest method in electoral law of which I personally have ever seen or heard. But, in order that the last remaining shadow of doubt may be taken away in connexion with the measure, we have introduced one reform in these proposals. Now, the voter himself may post his ballot-paper; he may make himself responsible for posting the document which he gets under the provision. </para>

                    <para>Honorable members opposite declare that it is almost inhumane to ask persons who are sick to interfere in party politics; and we have heard the honorable member for Cook make use of that argument with great force. It might be a fair argument, and worthy, at any rate, of passing consideration, if it were not for the fact that we do not propose to force people to vote, but only to give them an opportunity to do so. Further, the argument comes with singularly bad taste from a party that, at every election for the last six  years,  has consistently endeavoured to worm its way to place and pay by appealing to the fears of the aged poor. If honorable members opposite think that the aged and infirm ought to be left free from party conflict, why do they constantly endeavour to work on the fears of old-age pensioners? We do not propose in any way to invade the sick room, but we do propose to give those who wish to exercise the franchise the right of which they ought never to have been deprived - the right to take an interest in the affairs of the country, which means so much to all of us. </para>

                    <para class="block">Do honorable members opposite indorse that statement ? Well, then, let  us for a moment look at what has actually happened in the way of corruption in connexion with the postal vote. I have given honorable members some indication of the enormous scope there is for corruption, and it was to be anticipated that there would be some few cases of malpractice. As a matter of fact, those cases are very few. From a return that I hold in my hand I find that the first charge made was against Henry Ellis, J. P., of Melbourne, but the case was dismissed. The first conviction, though the conviction was not ultimately upheld, was that of Stephen Barker, J. P., who is a member of the Senate, and a colleague of honorable members opposite. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member is also James Page, J. P. The next case I have is that of personating an elector to secure a ballot-paper. A lady was charged with this offence in Melbourne in 1903, committed for trial, but found not guilty in the Supreme Court; and in another case of a lady the charge was abandoned. It will be seen that, at the 1903 elections, when the safeguards were not so well known as they have been ' since, there were only four cases, without a single ultimate conviction. As I have already pointed out, the first person to be fined was a colleague of my honorable friends opposite. </para>

                            <para>- Honorable members opposite do not seem to like these references to Stephen Barker, J. P. In connexion with the general election of 1906, a man was fined in the Gwydir electorate for attempted dual voting under the postal voters' provisions. It is obvious that anybody who plays such tricks under the system must be caught; and this, apparently, was a person who tried it on. Another man was fined £5 and costs, under section 1096, for having failed as a witness to satisfy himself as to the identity of an applicant for a postal voting paper. </para>

                            <para>- In Victoria. It will be seen that all the charges of corruption that were hurled against the honorable member who used to represent Melbourne boil themselves down, apparently, to one case. What a slander on the electors of  Melbourne  ! The next case is that of a man named Noakes, in Calare, who was fined £5 for failing to satisfy himself as to the identity of an applicant. That is a pretty heavy fine, but one that is properly imposable for such an offence. For improperly assisting an elector, a man was fined in Victoria, and another was fined for permitting an elector to be improperly assisted - for looking on at the fault of another person. For making a false statement as a witness, a constable was fined in Victoria, and a charge was made against a lady, but was withdrawn on the advice of the Law officers. In connexion with the 1906 election, there were seven cases, and five where penalties were imposed, but the offences arose obviously from a lack of appreciation or understanding of the provisions of the Act. For interfering with an elector, in relation to a postal vote on the referenda of 1911, a man in Queensland was fined £5, and another man was fined for failing to be present when an elector voted, and for failing to take charge of the postal ballot-papers. In the Wannon electorate, the very heavy fine of £25 16s. was imposed on a witness for failing to satisfy himself as to the truth of the statements of an applicant. I have given honorable members the whole of the records that we have in connexion with malpractices under the postal voting provisions; and because of those few trifling cases, honorable members opposite would disfranchise 77,000- electors. </para>

                            <para>- If I am doing the honorable member an injustice, I shall be the first man to withdraw the accusation, but I find him on the register, and, so far, he has not denied the fact. In the caseof South Australia, the justices of the peace in this House are the honorable member for Hindmarsh, the honorable member for Boothby, the honorable member for Grey, the honorable member for Adelaide, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie, Senator McGregor, Senator Newland, Senator O'Loghlin, Senator Senior, Senator Story,</inline> and last, but not least, the honorable member for Darwin. In the case of Western Australia, every member of the Labour party but one in the Senate is a justice of the peace, and amongst the brethren is the honorable member for Kalgoorlie. My point is that justices of the peace are carefully selected as men worthy of confidence and credit at the hands of their fellow citizens. I read those names to prove that honorable members opposite recognise that the position is indeed one to be desired and greatly sought after, even by gentlemen who profess to be scornful of all honours. Yet, in the face of the fact that thirty-two out of the forty-one justices of the peace in the Commonwealth Parliament are members of the Labour party, honorable members opposite have the impudence to say that justices of the peace are a discreditable class who cannot be trusted with the exercise of the highly responsible and important duties to which I have referred, and whose political inclinations apparently are all on the side of the Liberal party ! We now see how evenly those positions are distributed over the Labour party, and yet how unevenly they are represented in the Federal Parliament. I do not say, because of the fact that so many of them will be exercising these privileges, that the electors of Australia are not able to look after themselves if they do occasionally meet a justice of the peace who is not honest. There is only one member of the House whom I have not mentioned as being a justice of the peace, and that is the honorable member for Bass, who, most appropriately, appears on the register as hailing from Beauty Point. </para>

                    <para>I come now to the steps taken under this Bill to safeguard the rights of a self-governing people to have a safe, sure, and clean electoral system. Honorable members will find in clauses 8 and 10 the first of the provisions taken by the present Administration to safeguard our electoral system. Under those provisions we seek to escape a repetition of the spectacle that some of us saw in the last Parliament, when the majority sent here for other purposes did its best to escape the obligations resting upon it under the Constitution and the Electoral Act to give the electors of New South Wales equal electoral boundaries so as to secure the principle of one vote one value. We saw the Electoral Commissioners for New South Wales sending up scheme after scheme, and scheme after scheme being sent back to them, until the then Opposition publicly announced that it would hold up all public business until the rights of the electors in this regard were given a chance of expression by means of legislation. That was the only time that the party to which I have the honour to belong, during the whole of the life of the last Parliament, took such a step; and that step had to be taken because the Government of the day disregarded its plain and simple duty to the Australian people - the duty of giving, under the law of the land, the principle of one vote one value to the people who intrusted them with the administration of the affairs of the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- When my honorable friend speaks, he speaks so timorously that one wonders why he is here. Clause 20 of the Bill seeks to surround the absentvoting provisions with reasonable safeguards. I believe that, whatever Government had come into power, it would have been forced to deal with this question. Under the absent-voting provisions, as proposed to be amended by this Bill, any person who wishes to vote as an absent voter will have to put in a prior application for an absent-voting certificate, and having done that he may vote wherever he likes under the absent-voting provisions. But there is this guarantee against any possible reckless abuse of the system - a guarantee welcomed, I believe, by the Electoral Department, and one that will be thoroughly appreciated by all persons desiring that we shall have, as far as possible, an absolutely faultless electoral system. </para>

I do not want to give them too many opportunities. My honorable friend will see that, so far as regulations are concerned, another clause of the Bill gives the Parliament penal powers in regard to breaches of administration - a position which the Administration of the day has not hitherto occupied. Clauses 30, 32, and 33 provide penalties for wrong-doing under the Act; but clause 19 is the principal provision to secure the proper recording of the national verdict in Australia. </para>

                            <para>- Have I ever said anything else ? I am sure that neither I nor any member of our party has said anything else. What I do say is that the Leader of the Opposition must indeed be a disingenuous person if he can ask the people of Australia to believe that there is no occasion to safeguard the rights of the honest many from the invasion of the dishonest few, with regard to a general voting system, when he says, practically, that no justice of the peace in Australia is fit to be trusted with postal voting - when he says that the postal-voting system is an engine for enormous and tremendous corruption. Although that system is hedged about with restrictions it is capable, according to him, of widespread abuse! A man who takes up those two positions shows that his opinion is no longer worthy to be seriously regarded. </para>

                    <para>If the postal-voting system, hedged about with these restrictions, is pregnant and bristling with possibilities of fraud, I ask honorable members to consider the possibility of fraud under the present electoral system. Under the Act as it stands to-day, any man on polling day can go to a polling booth in his own subdivision, and without signing a piece of paper - without leaving any trace of his identity - he may, by merely saying that his name is on the roll, and that he has not previously voted, obtain a ballot-paper and record his vote. He can then go to another polling-booth ' in the same subdivision - and in many of our city divisions there are five or six polling places in one subdivision - and vote again. He can walk from polling place to polling place, and record a vote at each with absolutely no check except his own honesty. </para>

After recording a vote in each separate polling place in his subdivision, a man an then vote as an absent voter outside his own subdivision. Thus any person who is dishonest can vote as many times as there are polling places in his subdivision, and then cast an extra vote for luck as an absent voter. </para>

                            <para>- In my humble judgment, it has not been done, although there are some dishonest persons in the community. The records of the Courts bear witness to that fact. This country is the most honest on the face of the globe, yet, as in every other country, there are in Australia a certain number of persons who are ready to- commit offences against the law. We had in 1811 - the last year for which particulars are available - 144,764 convictions in the Police Courts of this country, and 2,631 committals for trial. These were not serious offences; they were trifling Police Court offences. But the fact remains that a proportion of these men who will commit trifling offences against the law, might be led to commit what they might regard as trifling offences against the electoral system if they thought that honorable members opposite were in danger. Nobody believed at the last general election that honorable members opposite were in danger. The honorable member for West Sydney himself told the people, as reported in the Sydney newspapers, that his party, instead of losing any, was going to win more, seats; and people who did not know him believed him. They thought they were in no danger. There was, in other words, no inducement to do any of the improper things that can be done with absolute safety under the existing electoral system. Since then some of these people have, unfortunately, found out the way to commit these petty crimes, and have learned of the safety accompanying any such breach of the law. We have had the newspapers full of the opportunities for fraud given by the present electoral system. Every one is now educated up to the opportunities for fraud which it offers. </para>

                            <para>- I can assure honorable members opposite that I do not make any personal reflection upon them, nor do I intend any reflection upon the party to which they belong. We say, however, that the mere existence in this country of a number of persons who are prepared to commit petty offences makes it absolutely essential that when the shortcomings of the electoral system have 'been displayed and the loopholes for fraud have been advertised throughout the land, both political parties shall see that the law is put right. I therefore ask honorable members to join with the Government in endeavouring to amend the existing Act in this regard. I do not say that any fraud has been committed. I do not know. All that I do know is that there was no inducement for fraud in Any sense or form at the last election. There was on that occasion no keen or intense bitterness of feeling. But I do say that in the future, judging from present indications, we are. likely to have a far more bitter and intense display of feeling than we have ever had in Australia before; and I therefore ask honorable members opposite to assist the Government in putting the law right by adopting the provisions which we have inserted in this Bill. </para>

                    <para>Under the measure, when an elector comes into the polling booth to vote, he or she will simply have to sign his or her name on the butt of the ballot-paper. He will make one signature for the ballot-paper for the Senate and the House of Representatives. The ballot-paper will then be given to him, and, after he has voted, it will be deposited in the ballot-box. The purpose of the signature is to insure that we may have no double voting. We shall be able, on the order of the Court of Disputed Returns, to contrast the signature on the butt with the signature of the claimant for enrolment, which will be kept at the central Electoral Office. This is simply an extension of the card system. We have not turned down the system already in force. We have engrafted on to the existing card system a means of attaining electoral security. The new system will, undoubtedly, give rise to a certain amount of trouble in the Department. </para>

                            <para>- There are difficulties in connexion  with electors' rights associated with the difficulty of keeping them securely. Under this system the elector's right to his own vote is absolutely safe guarded. The actual nature of his vote can only be revealed before a Court of Disputed Returns - in other words, when there is an appeal against an election to the High Court. In no other way can the votes in question be traced. But where double voting is suspected we shall be able to check the signatures on the butts of the ballot-papers with the signatures on the application forms, and shall very easily be able to tell who was entitled to vote and who voted wrongfully. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, on the butt. These butts will be kept by the presiding officer. We shall have a long ballot-paper. The butt will be 6 or 8 inches long. The balance of the paper will be small. As soon as the elector has signed his name on the butt, the ballot-paper will be torn off, and taken to the ballot-box, and when the elector has voted he will fold it, and drop it in the ballot-box, with the same secrecy as prevails at the present time. The change which this system will make is that a comparison will be able to be made between the signature on the butt and the signature of the elector when he claimed to be enrolled. Furthermore, if an election is challenged before the Court of Disputed Returns, the Court will have the right to examine the ballot-papers and to compare them. This is a right which is necessary in order to check the purity of any election in this country. Honorable members must recognise that, without a secure system, you cannot guarantee representative government. With a system such as exists,, which is capable of abuse - even if it has not been abused - you will, undoubtedly, eventually have persons of a mischievous nature who will utilize that system to influence elections improperly by the recording of bogus votes, by impersonation, by double voting, treble voting, and quadruple voting. </para>

                            <para>- Oh, no ! The honorable member is thinking of the English system, where every man's ballot-paper bears the number opposite his name on the roll. But that is not to be our system. The number on the ballot-paper will be quite independent of the elector's number on the roll. He will get a ballot-paper in exactly the same way as he gets it to-day. Suppose, for instance, that the honorable member went to vote, and found that some one else had voted in his name before him, he would, nevertheless, claim his right to vote. The presiding officer would say, " Some one has voted in your name; are you the <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Best whose name appears on the roll?" The honorable member would say, " I am," and upon that declaration a ballot-paper would be given to him. He could not be deprived of his vote under this provision. But if, after that, the election was disputed and the Court of Disputed Returns ordered the ballot-papers to be examined, it would then find which vote had been improperly cast in the name of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Best, and would reject the vote of the impersonator. Thus, by opening the ballot-papers afterwards, the Court would find out and discard the vote illegally and dishonestly cast. </para>

                            <para>-I think I oan satisfy the honorable member on that point. A presiding officer conducting an election is, under the present system, able to serve 350 electors during the course of the election day. Under the proposed system, his limit will be brought down from 350 to 225 or 250. The experts hold that view. </para>

                            <para>- Of course we shall. The main trouble and difficulty will be in the administration; but the administrative officers do not shrink from any trouble and difficulty that will give us a secure and pure electoral system. In 4,000 polling places, at present, there are no assistant presiding officers at all. These are the country places, where "not many votes are cast, and there will be plenty of time for devoting the little extra trouble which the new system will entail. But we shall require an additional 1,500 assistant presiding officers, and 1,500 poll clerks. Those officers can be provided, and will be provided. It is desirable that they should be provided, in order to obtain the additional security which we shall get if this Bill becomes law. </para>

                            <para>- It is estimated that the actual cost of inaugurating the new system will involve an increase of less than one-eighth. That is the estimate of the Electoral Office. But as against this the Act as a whole will lighten the duties of presiding officers very materially. At present, delay is caused in attending to infirm persons. Under the new system, those persons will be able to vote by post. We have all seen a polling booth held up for a considerable time while people who, actuated by a sense of public duty and patriotism, have, though infirm, come out to vote, were attended to - persons who have been driven by the action of our friends opposite to come to the polling booth and register their votes in person. These persons will now be able to vote by post - a privilege which any humane Government would have accorded to them before, instead of compelling them to drag their misfortunes out into the public gaze before they could discharge a public duty. </para>

I am deeply indebted to honorable members on this side of the House, who, despite constant interruptions, have accorded me a patient hearing, which, under the circumstances, I could hardly have expected. I regret that my honorable friends opposite have not given me so free an opportunity as I should have liked to place so comprehensive a measure before them in proper consecutive order. But, at any rate, I have been perfectly frank. I have given honorable members opposite the fullest information within the time at my disposal, and I ask them most seriously to consider the dangerous position which the country will occupy if, after a public advertisement of the faulty nature of our electoral system, we do not tighten it up, with a view to preventing the interests of the vast majority of Australian electors being invaded by a dishonest infinitesimal minority. In this Bill the Government seek to make our electoral system safe, our press free and fearless, and our franchise the widest in the world. </para>

                    <para class="block">In 1909 the honorable member for Darling Downs, who was then Minister of External affairs, introduced into this House a Bill for the taking over of Norfolk Island - a Bill which contains a great deal of information that honorable members will find helpful in considering this measure. I will endeavour, as far as possible, to keep clear of the ground which he trod on that occasion. I am sure honorable members will excuse me if, with a view to completing the information which they should have, I refer to some documents connected with Norfolk Island. The preamble of this Bill is a long one, and fairly expresses  its  object and the title of Norfolk Island. But to supplement the synopsis there given, I must touch on certain events and OrdersinCouncil. In 1788 Lieutenant King took possession of Norfolk Island under Royal proclamation. On the 28th February, 1814, it was abandoned. In 1826 the island was again occupied, and maintained as a place of detention until 1844. Then, by Act 6 and 7 Victoria, it was placed under the control and administration of Van Diemen's Land, as Tasmania was then called. That Act was described as " An Act to amend so much of an Act of the last session, for the government of New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land, as relates to Norfolk Island," and under it the island was. severed from New South Wales and annexed to Tasmania. In 1855, just before the penal settlement of Norfolk Island, the Australian Waste Lands Act was passed. It contained a provision empowering the separation of Norfolk Island from Tasmania. An Order in Council was issued in accordance with the Act of 1855, dated 24th June, 1856, which in effect declared that from Che date of the proclamation, which was subsequently issued on the 31st October, the said island, called Norfolk Island, should be separated from the said Colony of Van Diemen's Land, now called Tasmania, and made a distinct and separate settlement. The Order in Council goes on to state, " the affairs of which should, until further Order in that behalf by  Her  Majesty, be administered by a Governor, to be for that purpose appointed by  Her  Majesty." The Governor in New South Wales was appointed by the Order, as the Governor for the purpose. Speaking generally, from the date of that proclamation till 1897, the Order in Council remained unchanged. During that period Norfolk Island was under the administration of the Governor for the time being of New South Wales. In 1896 <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid, who was then Premier of New South Wales, agreed to pay the cost of government/ - that is to say, in effect, any deficiency between the revenue and expenditure of the island. About this time, 1897, the Imperial Government contemplated a change, and some little trouble occurred in the island. Its settlers did not know exactly what was contemplated. Some thought that the titles of the lands vested in the original settlers were to be interfered with. In a few years, however, their anxiety, I think, was allayed by their actual experiences. On the 15th January, 1897, a proclamation was issued, from which I desire to quote a few sentences. It states - </para>

                        <para>And whereas by an Order in Council dated the fifteenth day of January, 1897, made in pursuance of the said last-mentioned Act,  Her  late Majesty, after reciting that it was expedient that other provision should be made for the government of Norfolk Island, and that, in prospect of the future annexation of Norfolk Island to the Colony of New South Wales or to any Federal body of which that Colony might thereafter form part, in the meantime the affairs of Norfolk Island should be administered by the Governor of New South Wales as therein provided, was pleased to revoke the said Order in Council of the twenty-fourth day of June, One thousand eight hundred and fifty-six, and to order that the affairs of Norfolk Island should thenceforth, and until further Order should be made in that behalf by  Her  Majesty, be administered by the Governor and Commander-in-Chief for the time being of the Colony of New South Wales and its Dependencies. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">That was modified by an Order in Council on the 18th October, 1900, which was published 011 the 1st January, 1901, and the effect of which was to change the word " Colony " into " State," so as to bring it into line with the fact that Federation had been accomplished. That is about how the matter stands at present, so far as title is concerned. In 1897, the question was raised as to what should be done with the island, and it was pointed out that there could be no annexation by New South Wales or the Commonwealth except by an Act of the Imperial Parliament. But, by an Order in Council, the island can be placed under the control of the Commonwealth. When that Order in Council is issued, the administration of Norfolk Island will be transferred from the Governor of New South Wales to the Commonwealth, and become a Territory which will be administered by the Commonwealth in accordance with section 121 of the Constitution.. In 1909, the second reading of the Bill for the transfer of Norfolk Island to the Commonwealth was merely moved. It did not reach another stage. Subsequently, some communications were exchanged in regard to it between the Governor of New South Wales and the then Minister of External Affairs. The Imperial Government was also communicated with by the Governor of New South Wales as to the establishment, on transfer to the Commonwealth, of freedom of trade between Norfolk Island and Australia. The Bill, as it is now drafted, was finally submitted for the approval of the Governor of New South Wales, and it has recently been revived. It contains a provision which satisfies the Imperial authorities that we desire to allow the produce of Norfolk Island coming direct to Australia to be admitted free in all cases in which there is not an Excise duty on similar commodities here. </para>

' I think honorable members are fairly familiar with the history of Pitcairn Island. About 1787, the <inline font-style="italic">Bounty,</inline> a sloop of about 250 tons, was commissioned by George III., who desired to transplant some of the bread-fruit tree, of which a favorable account had been given by Captain Cook, who was in Tahiti in 1769, to the West Indies. On going Home, Captain Cook reported that in Tahiti he had found an amiable, peaceful population, a fertile soil, and a genial climate, and that there flourished there a fruit which was exceedingly nutritious. Bligh was commissioned to transplant some of this fruit to the West Indies. He reached Tahiti, remained there about six months, and then started on his voyage. We all know that soon after a mutiny occurred on board his vessel. Some say that it was brought about by the stern and Draconian discipline of Bligh himself. Others say that it was due to different causes. At any rate, Bligh and his companions were turned adrift, and eventually reached the Island of Timor, and Christian, a man of virile and at tractive character, although chief of the mutineers, some of whom belonged to the best and most adventurous blood of Great Britain - as might be said of many of the officers associated with Bligh - went to Tahiti, and, after calling twice at Tau.bonai, returned to Tahiti, and eventually, with seven or eight companions, started on the ocean to seek some uninhabited land - one of those - </para>

                            <para>- I do not believe in surrendering what seems to be our domain. I hope that the interests of Australia in the Pacific will be more manifest in the future, and I say it with the greatest respect to other nations, whose ideas of government, if applied, may tend as much to the amelioration and advancement of the natives as our own. Placed as we are, the greater the control we have of islands like Norfolk Island, the better it may be for the people there and here. And we must look ahead. In addition to the land alienated in fee simple, 967 acres are  locked up in reserves, 850 acres have been leased, and 1,311 acres remain Crown land, and unused, but 80 per cent, of the area is hilly, and part of it is heavily timbered. I find from looking at the map that in 1859 the island was parcelled out by Governor Denison into allotments of about 50 acres.. Only 400 acres are under agriculture. I do not wish to enter into the reasons for the backward state of agriculture, but I hope that under our fostering care it may develop; though it should be possible for people to be happy if they are secure, even where the population is comparatively small; and we do not wish to carry the fret and worry of modern life to Norfolk Island. </para>

                        <para>However, maize, among grain crops, and oranges, lemons (Lisbon), bananas,  guavas  passion-fruit, melons, and custard apples, among  fruits, are at present the staple products of the soil, and with encouragements such as might fairly be claimed by the farmers, could be grown over very much larger areas, and in much larger quantities, than now. Without encouragement of any kind, and, indeed, with the certain prospect of producing what he cannot profitably sell at home or abroad, or find some profitable use for, it is hardly reasonable to ask these farmers to increase their output of any State-taxed commodity. Since the establishment of the Australian Com'monwealth, Norfolk Island exports have, as might be expected, shrunk in value in a very marked degree, and at present the excess in value of imports over exports is very nearly, if not quite, as 10 to 1. The island, therefore, is very far from being self-supporting, economically considered, and but for the Melanesian Mission and Cable Station, expenditure on local products would exhibit a most unsatisfactory balance-sheet from a business point of view. </para>

                    <para class="block">The island has a capital of £5,700, of which £4,800 is invested in the funded stock of New South Wales, and bears interest at the rate of 3 or 3 £ per cent, per annum. The stock is redeemable only with the consent of the New South Wales Government, but possibly, as in taking over the island we shall relieve the State of an expenditure of more than £1,500 a year, its Government may consent to the redemption of the stock, in which case it should be possible to re-invest it on terms giving a return of I or 1 per cent. more. The revenue from all sources for the financial year beginning 1st July, 1912, and ending 30th June, 1913, was £2,520 0s. lid., and the expenditure £2,319 lis. 5d., showing a surplus of £202 9s. 6d.  I  need not give figures for other years. The revenue of the island was made up  in  this way: - Interest on funded stock, deposits, and loans, £273; Customs duties, £460; postage stamps and postal notes, £197; land revenue, £108; timber royalties, fees of Court, and other revenue, £182; and an annual grant from New South Wales, £800; making the total £2,020. When the necessary deductions and additions are made, we get the total revenue for the financial year £2,520. New South Wales, besides making an annual grant of £800, pays the salary of the Chief Magistrate of the island, £450; that of the principal teacher, £250; and that of the teacher's wife, £30; so that the minimum outlay which we shall be called upon to meet if we take control of Norfolk Island, and of which we shall relieve the State of New South Wales, is £1,530. For the financial year ending 30th June, 1912, the imports from New South Wales were valued at £8,296; from New Zealand, £810; a total of £9,106. The exports were, to New South Wales, £798; to the South Sea Islands, £432; and to New Zealand, £135; a total of £1,415. I think that the Customs collected in Sydney amounted to £375. The two principal exports were, I think, whale oil, £399, and skins, £287. I have not the other figures, but those figures, with the quotations I have already given, show their general character.

                            <para>- By the Governor of New South Wales, who has absolute power. As I mentioned, in 1896 New South Wales took upon itself the responsibility for the deficiency in the revenue, and since then I think the Governor has always consulted the Government of New South Wales. As a matter of fact, under the documents I have referred to, the Governor really is Administrator of Norfolk Island, but, I think, he does recognise the essence of responsible government through the Governor in Council, although "responsible government" is not absolutely mentioned in any of the documents. The communications are principally in the hands of Burns, Philp, and Company, and are not very frequent. I might give honorable members some idea of the class of legislation which has been passed. A sort of Constitution was established by the Order in Council of 1897. The first clause provides for the appointment of a Chief Magistrate - </para>

                            <para>- The Bill contains no provision on that point. I gave the figures deliberately to show how comparatively small a question it is. There are only a little over 1,100 acres of land unsold. As the area under freehold is 5,400 acres, practically, the freehold has gone. I wish that had not occurred. I do not believe in small places being handed over to outsiders; but that is not the case in regard to Norfolk Island, and I hope it will not be. I deliberately went into their history to show that these men were transferred under exceptional conditions to Norfolk Island, and that they did regard it as their place of settlement, and not subject to outside exploitation. </para>

When we find that 80 per cent. of the unsold land is fairly good, but hilly and partly timbered, there is very little left for us in a Parliament like this to quibble about. The total area of the island is, as I said, 8,528 acres, of which about 5,400 have been sold in fee-simple. </para>

                            <para>- I think we may proceed too quickly. I am a thorough believer in responsible government. If there have been any troubles at Norfolk Island to an extent it may have been from the lack of a sense of local responsibility, which comes from the outside control of the Governor, who cannot, in the nature of things, often visit the island. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, but in a good sense. I hope that that word " mutineers " will not be attempted to be used invidiously. I have such a respect for honorable members opposite that I hesitated to pay a compliment to them by taking a quotation from a book on the character of descendants about 1856, of these so-called mutineers, which I read a few nights ago. Perhaps I ought to read the extract, and as they listen, honorable members will see almost the counterfeit presentment of themselves - </para>

                            <para>- That, perhaps, is why questions are asked sometimes for three-quarters of an hour nowadays. The  Deputy  Administrator gets a salary of £450 per year. The  Deputy  Administrator was a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Murphy,</inline> in Sydney. Captain Elliott, the Chief Magistrate, is, I think, about to retire, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Murphy</inline> is to take his place at £600. There is a Government medical officer with a salary of £200 and quarters, and the right of private practice. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Patton</inline> also receives £12 10s. a year for acting as Government auditor. There are teachers of schools, &amp;c. It will be seen that there is not a big staff. As regards the legislation that has been passed, I went through the documents and found that about sixty-four Orders in Council have been issued. They deal with such matters as Customs, registration of titles, births, marriages, and deaths, commons and public reserves, liquor permits, pasturage, enclosure of lands, extirpation of noxious weeds, and public schools. </para>

                            <para>- It must be dealt with by the Governor on report. As a matter of fact, the appeal provision is that, if there is an appeal - and that lies in all cases where £30 in value is involved - the appeal is sent by a sort of case stated to the Governor, who nominates some one to hear it, probably one of the Judges in New South Wales. The Bill contains a provision vesting jurisdiction in the High Court, and doubtless all these cases will go before the High Court or, if necessary, some other Judge appointed by the Executive. The question of land title would be dealt with similarly by the Governor. He would get his advice from the Judges on the matter. </para>

                            <para>- Very little, I think. There may not be the same necessity for lawyers there as here. The Ten Commandments were not created for that purpose - only on account of the prevalence of sin. As regards the lands, the leases are for twenty-eight years, subject to renewal under certain conditions. No one can hold more than 25 acres for cultivation and grazing unless the Governor, in special circumstances, permits that to be done. And there are provisions against aggregation beyond the declared area. There is a provision - I have not been able to find the Order in Council - that every person after a residence of six months must pay a tax of £3 to the Council or do fifteen days' work on the roads. As regards the liquor Ordinance, honorable members may wish, perhaps, to take some guidance from it. Regulations were issued on the 21st September, 1904, as follow - </para>

                    <para class="block">Two wharfs have been put up, but I do not think that the wharf and jetty contemplated then has been erected. There has been some, but there seems still to be a good deal of work to be done in the way of keeping down noxious weeds, and in general development, so as to encourage the slight use made of the soil; but the people have been hampered by the fact that they could not compete with Australia under theduties that obtained, and I hope that by allowing the produce to come in free we shall remove the chief obstacle to commercial development. As regards the Bill, there is very little that I need tell honorable members. It provides for acceptance of Norfolk Island as a territory under the authority of the Commonwealth, as provided in clause 3. That will take place when the Order in Council has been issued by the Imperial Government and a proclamation accordingly made. The existing laws will continue until modified or repealed. There is a provision for a jurisdiction in the High Court, which I have also mentioned. </para>

                            <para>- That, I think, is a matter to be dealt with in an administration Bill; at any rate, I do not see any necessity to enter upon it at present. The existing Acts are the Imperial Acts adopted, together with some of the State of New South Wales, supplemented by sixty-four Orders in Council. It will not be necessary to apply many of our Acts at present, though I must say that the people of Norfolk Island have kept fairly up to date in some respects. They have adopted our Copyright Act of 1911, and have also passed legislation for the protection of young girls. I have already dealt with the chief provisions of the Bill excepting clause 15, which provides that duties of Customs shall not be chargeable on goods imported into Australia from Norfolk Island if the goods are the produce or manufacture of the island, are shipped direct to Australia, and are not goods which, if manufactured or produced in Australia, would be subject to any duty of Excise. As to the reason for taking over the island, one is ample, namely, that it was an obligation contemplated in 1897, when the Order in Council was passed placing the island under New South Wales. Then the island is an important repeating station of the Pacific Cable Board, and the operations of the cable we hope will extend when the Panama Canal is opened. </para>

                            <para>- They are to come in free. I have already mentioned, as a reason for taking the island over, our interest in the development of the Pacific, and there is, of course, the consideration that there should be vested in the Commonwealth the control of all islands at present under the control of the States - that dependencies of the Commonwealth that are not part of a State ought to be passed over to the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think so. Our aim is to maintain - and, as the founders of the most advanced and beneficent system of responsible and Democratic government, in some respects to better - the traditional working of British administration, which, in the main, is ever directed to the welfare, security, and rational freedom of those to whom, in many places and forms, but wjth one spirit and efficacy, its principles extend. The system has been a success elsewhere, and there is no reason why Australia should not make it an equal success in the case of Norfolk Island. </para>

                    <para>.- Has the Treasurer, at any time during his long parliamentary career, and especially in this House, ever taken into consideration the desirability of altering the date for the ending of the financial year ? I understand that in Great Britain, the financial year finishes on the 31st March; but, apparently, the Commonwealth has simply followed the lead of the States in ending the year on the 30th June, which, in my judgment, is a very awkward time. It is the coldest time of the year, when employment generally is very slack. Unfortunately, State Treasurers, and some Federal Treasurers, show a great desire, towards the close of the financial year, to cramp operations, and to suggest that applications for money for public works made by heads of Departments should be held over until the new year. This means great delay, for, before money can be made available in the new year, two or three months may elapse, during which time there is considerable want of employment. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">Under the circumstances, I think the Treasurer might consider the feasibility of altering the date, because it so happens that private employers seem inclined to take the cue from the Government, and also curtail operations. I understand that the Treasurer has some further information to impart to us on the third reading of this Bill, and we know that he usually gives us the fullest information possible in regard to financial measures of which he may be in charge. When the Treasurer came into office, towards the close of the last financial year, there was a big surplus in prospect; and I understand that he himself gave orders that all possible accounts should be paid prior to the 30th June. I say that, not so much by way of criticism, as to show how sometimes, even for party political purposes, it is desirable to have as big a surplus as possible, while on other occasions it may be desirable to limit the surplus. If the honorable gentleman had been in office all the time, and knew there was the possibility of a fine surplus, he might, under the circumstances, have felt inclined to request the heads of Departments and others to wait until the year had closed for the money they required. There is too much of a desire on the part of Treasurers, both State and Commonwealth, to show what wonderful financiers they are by finishing with as big a surplus as possible; but this often entails considerable hardship. In the States, large numbers of men are thrown out of employment at the coldest and most severe time of the year, and an alteration of the date would obviate considerable distress. My own opinion is that it would be most advantageous to observe the calendar year, and finish on the 31st December, when the weather is more genial, and employment, as a rule, plentiful. Our harvests are then being reaped and garnered, and there is much other work of the kind that can be carried on only in the fine months. </para>

                        <para>- I fail to see why we should not meet as soon as the cool weather sets in. If we did so, then, assuming that we had the usual session of six months' duration, we should prorogue before the hot weather was upon us. If the financial year closed on 31st March, there would be no reason why we should not meet in April, except the position created by the Constitution in regard to the election of senators. But I am looking at this matter from the point of view of employment. During the winter through which we have just passed there was a great deal of unemployment, due to the cheese-paring policy adopted by the State Treasurers throughout Australia. I shall not say that the Federal Treasurer adopted such a policy- </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that orders for prompt payment should be exceptional. Against every Government, whether Federal or State, the charge can be justly brought, I think, that they keep the contractors and others from whom they obtain supplies waiting too long for their money. As a rule, even when a work has been passed, the Government are the last to pay. </para>

                        <para>- It is remarkable that the Auditor-General has not rebuked some of the Government Departments for keeping contractors and others too long out of their money. Why should there be any delay? I should like the Treasurer to give us his opinion regarding my suggestion that the financial year should close on 31st March. I do not think there are any insuperable difficulties in the way, and I believe that if it were adopted we should not have so many people out of employment as we have had during the winter months. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not object to this measure passing, but I do object to members of the Ministry going into the country and telling the people that the Opposition are holding up the Audit Bill. It is the practice of the Prime Minister and other members of his Government to go through Victoria telling the people that the Labour party are holding up non-contentious legislation. Ministers seem to attend a banquet every other night. I wonder where the funds come from to supply the gorgeous feasts in which they indulge? It is the Treasurer's duty to contradict the statement that we are holding up his Audit Bill. He knows that he brought the Bill into the Chamber in an imperfect condition. He, with other members of his Ministry, was so busily occupied with something else that he had not sufficient time to give to the preparation of an important measure like this. It is more important than it looks, and I have yet to learn what is the reason for its introduction, unless it be that the Treasurer wants more time in which to prepare his Budget-speech. If I had thought that the Melbourne newspapers would publish a letter from me, I should have written to them, pointing out that the Bill was brought down in such an imperfect condition that it had to be amended, and that it was the consideration of its amendment that had occupied our time. </para>

                        <para>- But the right honorable member, with " an eye on the main chance," said that it would be a mistake to make the principal provision in this Bill apply only in a year in which there was a general election. The Government wanted it, he said, to apply every year. It seems to me that the Ministry are steering the ship of State straight for recess, and that, having once got into recess, they hope to have a fine old time until next August. I rose, however, principally to object to the slander uttered by the Prime Minister as to the opposition shown by our party to non-contentious legislation. What took place this afternoon ? Was any objection offered to the Norfolk Island Bill ? None at all; and there has not been a protracted debate on this measure. Have we done anything to warrant the statement that we are opposing non-contentious legislation ? All our protests are against what the Attorney-General knows is legislation likely to make a political cry for him in the country. He wants a battle-cry in regard to the postal vote and preference to unionists; and the Government are bringing forward such legislation as soon as possible, so that there can be a row about it in the country. </para>

                    <para>.- I wish to supplement the remarks made by the honorable member for Capricornia regarding the slanderous utterances of people iu high positions who ought to know better. While I do not agree with the honorable member that the whole blame rests with the Government for not agreeing promptly to the amendment of the Audit Bill that we suggested, I consider that there is no justification whatever for the statement of the Prime Minister that the Opposition are opposing non-contentious legislation. The debate on this Bill has been largely due to the inexplicable manner in which the Treasurer introduced it. I  followed the right honorable member very closely, and, just when I thought I was about to get a grip of the purport of the Bill, I found that I had lost it. The Minister of External Affairs-the Assistant Attorney-General, as he is now known - tried to make clear that which the Treasurer had diligently attempted to explain; and, after he had laboured very hard to give us the legal interpretation of. the Bill, the Attorney-General himself, to whom I gave way, came to the rescue. </para>

                        <para>- I have already mentioned that I listened with interest while the Attorney-General was trying to throw some light on this measure. I did so with all reverence for his keen legal acumen. I fully expected that he would be able to remove the mysteries surrounding the subject in my mind. But after he had spoken I quite realized that if four lawyers had addressed themselves to the question instead of two I should have been, not merely mystified, but paralyzed. The Treasurer has a habit of looking over to this side of the House with a reproachful air as if we were of the moleskin pants, the flannel shirts, and the slouch hats order, who represent the views of the multitude, understand nothing about finance, and therefore are not competent to discuss the merits and demerits of a Bill of this character. I should like to remind the right honorable gentleman that there are none in this community who understand more about finance than those who have been reared by a mother who has had to spend the wages of a toiler. There are no greater financiers than the wives of the workers, who are practised in making thirty shillings go as far as two pounds will go in the hands of others. We have  a  practical acquaintance with finance that  is  not enjoyed by honorable members opposite. The Treasurer has tried to make it appear that to embody provisions regarding a Supply and Tender Board in an Audit Bill is quite consistent with ordinary usage. I can only say that I am sorry that, having had time since last week to reflect, the Treasurer has not had the wisdom to withdraw the Supply and Tender Board clauses from the Bill. He would be wise even now to apprehend the responsibilities of his position, and to realize that by forcing the Bill through he will be making a serious mistake. What makes it worse, the Supply and Tender Board is to be established by regulation. Honorable members know what that means. We all know that departmental regulations are poured in upon us by the hundred. To read them all is more of a task than it would be to follow Jack Johnson through his peregrinations in the fistic world, or the Prime Minister in his perambulations through the country when he is denouncing this party for wasting time on non-contentious measures. This Bill non-contentious ! Does any member of this House think that it is ? To put provisions regarding a Supply and Tender Board in an Audit Bill is a departure from the custom and usage of Parliament throughout the British Empire. It is our duty as the watch-dogs of the people to be on the alert and to protect their interests in matters of finance. The Treasurer professes that the Bill is only required to enable him to tide over a time of difficulty which may arise when Parliament is not in session. But he has not told us whether he_ wants to use the power next year. Is it possible that the right honorable gentleman has some premonition of disaster threatening his occupancy of his present noble position ? Surely he does not imagine that next July it will be necessary for him to get Supply in order to enable him to carry on till August. Surely this is not a covert move to protect his party and keep it longer in recess than the country would wish ? 1 see the, Prime Minister sitting there, cool, calm, and collected. He has been recently charging the Labour party with obstructing legitimate, business. If he had a shred of conscience left he would apologize. Now the honorable gentleman is leaving the chamber. There is one thing that always marks the course of a man who has not the courage to face his opponents. As soon as he is confronted with them he turns tail. The Prime Minister goes out and leaves the Treasurer,  the weak man of the Ministry, to bear the brunt of the battle. With all deference to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> I can imagine you occupying the position where I now am. Suppose that a Treasurer of another party were in the position that the right honorable member for Swan now occupies, I venture to say that you would not be slow to point out to him the error of his ways. I am sure that you, sir, sympathize with me in my desire to discharge my duty to the people, as you always did, with a determination-- </para>

                        <para>- This is not a matter for levity. It is a serious matter of finance. We are asked to empower the Treasurer to expend, in July of any year, a sum of money which may be out of all proportion to the amount which has hitherto been expended during that month. Fortunately, we have been able to limit that expenditure to one-twelfth of the expenditure for the whole of the preceding year. The only virtue which the Bill possesses is to be found in that amendment. We have no guarantee that the Treasurer will not use this money to suit the purposes of the political party to which he belongs. </para>

                        <para>- I will not use the word " bludgeoned." This Bill will apply, not only to the people of to-day, but to posterity ; and, on behalf of posterity, I protest against such legislation. If the Treasurer wishes to bring his grey hairs with honour to the grave, he will not attempt to foist upon us legislation which will open the door to maladministration. Whilst I respect the honorable gentleman as a man, I am deeply sorry" that he has fathered a measure of this kind. Thank God there is a Senate, which, I hope, will see the wisdom of preventing him from inflicting this injury upon the people. If the proposal to establish a Supply and Tender Board had been embodied in a separate Bill, it would have passed through this Chamber without any opposition. The Treasurer, having put his hand to the plough, will not turn back. With that, I shall not say stubbornness but, persistency which is characteristic of the race from which he sprang, he tries to force the Bill, which he does not understand, through the House. There are a good, many reasons why it should not be carried . </para>

                        <para>- The Bill is full of contentious matter. I remember how the Prime Minister, when in Opposition, used to condemn the Labour party for making laws by regulation. I wish I had his talent for logical, but cruel, denunciation. Yet his first act on assuming office is to introduce a measure perpetuating the evil which he has condemned so strongly. Did inconsistency ever go further ? The honorable gentleman goes from place to place in the country, protesting that we, the watch-dogs of Parliament, are delaying legislation by preventing non-contentious measures from passing. I wonder that his words did not freeze on his lips when he tried to utter them. No one knows better than he does that every man on this side would have justification for protesting against this measure until he could no longer stand. </para>

                        <para>- I am glad that the honorable gentleman is not permitted to interject, but it is unkind of him to leave the chamber, because I had something important to say to him. The Postmaster-General must have been warned by telepathy, and informed his chief. However, I am glad to see the honorable member for Parkes here, because, although he has never known it, I have knelt invisibly at his foot-stool, studying the words of wisdom that fell from him on questions of finance, and I thought, when this measure came before the House, that my education would be advanced a further step; but I have waited in vain for his pearls of wisdom. He has protested time and again against legislation by regulation, but now he sits still as a statue. What has frozen him into silence? If there was one man who might have been expected to assert himself, it was the honorable member. I have always felt that when I failed he would succeed; but now we listen in vain for his utterances. Is the Treasurer prepared to remove what is objectionable from the Bill ? </para>

                        <para>- The Treasurer has grown callous to the welfare of the people. Nothing but callousness could produce such a characteristic as we see in the Treasurer to-night. Will he tell me who are to constitute the Tender and Supply Board; will he give me an insight into the <inline font-style="italic">-personnel</inline> of the board ; will he say whether any outside persons are to be appointed, or whether it is to be composed of public servants or not? Not a word will he say. That is the sort of treatment we get when we plead for information. We are trying to solve the problems of this community, to understand the provisions of the measure, and to ascertain what is in the mind of the Treasurer, but a corkscrew will not draw the information out of him. I do not know whether he is looking for the information or not, but I hope that he will find it very shortly, as I am getting tired of appealing to him. In my judgment the Government has started off in a manner which is destined to overwhelm it. Any Government that begins by resorting to legislation by regulation is foredoomed. If the Treasurer would only hearken to the words of wisdom which fell from the honorable member for Capricornia, the pleading way in which he put his case, and the logical manner in which he represented the equities of this proposal, he would announce to the House, I feel sure, that he intended to get this Bill amended in another place. </para>

                        <para>- With a majority such as the Government has in this House I would not submit Ministers to the indignity of withdrawing the Bill. I would not ask my worst enemy to submit to a proceeding of that kind. I have too much respect for the Treasurer, even though he is fathering a piece of legislation which I would not like to father, to ask him to withdraw it. He takes my remarks quite calmly. The country may go, the finances may go, and the Auditor-General may take control of everything. Here is a Bill which hands over to that officer, not only the right to audit the public accounts, and give a true representation of the finances, but also the right to regulate the purchase of all supplies for the Commonwealth, and their distribution through the different Departments. Here is a man who, while on the one hand he is to be charged with the duty of directing the way in which' purchases shall be made, stores be issued and checked, has to audit that which he directs. What an anomalous position that is ! The Treasurer is not acting fairly to the Auditor-General. I have met that officer. He is only an Auditor-General; he knows nothing about anything else ; he has devoted his whole life to the question of auditing. When it is proposed to hand over to a specialist a foreign duty, of which he knows nothing, there is a danger to the community. It is not fair to the Auditor-General to tell him that he is to be " boss " over the purchasing of stores, the distributing of them, the checking of the audit, and the analyzing of the provisions of this great measure. I ask the Treasurer, out of his humanitarian sympathy, to have a little thought for that officer. Has the Auditor-General indorsed this Bill as the head of the Electoral Department has agreed with every provision in the Electoral Bill ? ' Has this Bill been drawn by the Auditor-General as the Electoral Bill has been drawn by the electoral officers, according to the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs? If the Auditor-General has told the Treasurer that this measure is necessary, he must have been not quite in his right mind, because he is taking upon himself a  responsibility  too great for any man, or dozen of men, to be charged with. I want the Treasurer to think over this matter. In days gone by, I have appealed to him, and he has not only listened, but paid attention. He has been open to conviction at times. </para>

                        <para>- I ask the Treasurer, has the Prime Minister gone to another meeting to proclaim the opposition of this party to non-contentious legislation ? Has it become a disease with the Prime Minister to ever go on prating about the action of the Opposition in that regard ? The Treasurer may well look at me. I know that he does not agree with the Prime Minister in leaving his seat in the chamber and shirking the responsibility which is his. I know that the right honorable member is quite prepared to carry the whole load on his broad shoulders; but I do not want him to bear a load which he is not entitled to carry. </para>

                        <para>- We shall soon get rid of the Ministry if he has to bear the whole load. Through you, sir, may I make one final appeal to the Treasurer before he commits this act irrevocably? May I ask that he should retrace his steps, and that a Bill of this character should be put into the waste-paper basket at once, and another measure prepared more in accordance with the necessities of the times ? If he cannot for shame's sake consent to back down at this stage, will he consider the advisability of asking another place to cut out the objectionable clauses, to tri-n the measure in such a way that it will be acceptable to the people ? Will he do credit, to the Government, or will he allow the Government to go down to posterity denounced as one that had indorsed, when in Opposition, the principle of legislation by regulation? With all seriousness, I say that this is one of the most perplexing problems that have ever been offered for consideration by honorable members, and it behoves every honorable member on this side to do his duty. I am unable, apparently, to move the Treasurer. 1 know that I am feeble. I realize that my appeal is not strong enough; but there are on this side honorable members who can appeal with tears in their eyes which will move the Treasurer to submit.

                        <para>- I feel sure that the Prime Minister has sent the Whip into the chamber to advise the Treasurer to take a certain course of action. I am positive that the Whip would not be here but for an inspiration from the Prime Minister, to indicate to the Treasurer that he would be wise in backing down, even at this late hour. Whilst the visitors from the Mother of Parliaments are in this State, in the name of all that is holy, I ask the Treasurer not to tempt them to condemn us by the action which he is perpetrating here to-night. Think of what they will convey to the Old Country when they find that the Treasurer is prepared to foist upon this Parliament a measure for the auditing of the public accounts which will enable a Supply and Tender Board to be created ! Why, sir, the members of the House of Commons here will feel that we are in our infancy or dotage ; but, however they feel, I appeal to the Treasurer to hide the Bill from their sight, not to allow this discussion to come to the ears of men who belong to the Mother of Parliaments. Let us all uphold our reputation as men of common sense, who understand what sort of legislation should be enacted in this country. My constituents do not, and never will, understand the Treasurer, but they understand their representative, and when they read of my appeal made here tonight to the Prime Minister and Treasurer, they will say, " What kind of men are these who could withstand the appeal of our member?" While I may not have any effect on the Treasurer, I shall have a wonderful effect on the people who send me here, and who know I am fighting for them and their country. </para>

I do not know how this clause will be regarded and treated by another place; but, at any rate, it ought to be enacted in another Bill. I was very glad to hear the Treasurer say the other evening that it was impossible to spend a penny without the supervision of the Auditor-General. 1 have informed .the honorable member for Gippsland that I intended to refer further to his utterances in this connexion, and to show whether or not this or any other Ministry have handled the money of the country in a way that it should not be handled.

                        to ^6,000, making a total of £45,000. A new item was the Prime Minister's Department, and that cost ,£50,000, while another new one, items towards cost, totalled £1,000,000. In connexion with these figures, the Auditor-General complained that the balance-sheet only came before him nine months after it was due, and the time then at his disposal did not permit of him going fully into the items. The people were entitled to know what became of this money - how it was used.

The first report of the Auditor-General, for the year ending 30th June, 1901, was presented on 25th May, 1903, a year and eleven months after the expenditure. The second report of the Auditor-General war presented after a similar interval. I have taken the trouble to look up .the dates on which the Auditor-General's reports have, been presented; and all the reports, with two exceptions, have been presented, either on the last day of sitting in the session, or the day before, and only on one occasion has the report been presented in time to have any discussion upon it. I am sorry the ex-Treasurer is not here to explain why the Treasury was unable to make the accounts available earlier for the Auditor-General. This delay was not the fault of the Treasurer. </para>

                    <para>That <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bennett</inline> has had the audacity to deny that he ever uttered statements made only four months ago is not a very high compliment to the electors of Gippsland, and is a very serious reflection on the conductors of an old and respected newspaper published at Yarram, the <inline font-style="italic">Standard,</inline> which reports him as having said: - "Who received this sum no one knows; it amounts to over £3,000,000 sterling." Does <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bennett</inline> deny the accuracy of the <inline font-style="italic">Standard</inline> report, and, if he does, did he issue a correction of it in the press prior to May 31st? He had plenty of time to do so, but I have yet to learn that he did. If, however, any doubt exists of the accuracy of the <inline font-style="italic">Standard</inline> report, let it be dispelled at once. I have before me the transcript of a report taken of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bennett's</inline> speech at Meeniyan, only a few weeks prior to the election, in which he is reported to have said : - " Altogether, a sum of over three million pounds has been spent, and no one knows where the money has gone." The honorable member proceeded : - " If the directors of a butter factory or a bacon factory had done anything like that they would be prosecuted and sent to prison." </para>

                        <para>- I could tell the honorable member something more about the Meeniyan meeting, and the rent of the hall, but I shall not worry about it. I take the word of the Treasurer that every penny spent, from the inception of Federation until to-day, has been accounted for to the Auditor-General. When, for political purposes, a man tries from the public platform to make his hearers believe that millions have been spent by the party in power in a way for which there is no warrant - that they have practically taken the money out of the Treasury and used it for some unauthorized purpose - he must know that he is stating that which is absolutely false, because every' penny must be, and has been, accounted for. If the honorable member did make this statement, that £3,000,000 had disappeared, and that if members of the Ministry of that day had been directors of a butter or bacon factory, they would have been prosecuted and gaoled, he was stating that which is absolutely inaccurate. Every penny has been accounted for. I rose mainly to refute this statement, because the people of Australia have a right to know that, no matter what party is in power, every penny of public expenditure must be audited by the Auditor-General. I am as bitterly opposed to the present Ministry as they were to the late Administration. They were anxious to get us out of office, and we are anxious to turn them out. We believe, however, in fighting fairly. When statements such as those I have read are made and are scattered broadcast - statements that a set of Administrators are alleged to have made away with millions of public funds - we may expect to find the people saying of Australia that which is said of other countries. It is when the fight is hot, and wild statements are made, that we are in duty bound to step forward and to try to protect the honour of every mal in public life. I think that the Attorney-General, bitterly as he may oppose us, and bitterly as we fight him, will credit the late Administration with absolute honesty. I am sure that he would not say, either inside or outside this House, that a penny of public money had ever been spent by any Administration in respect of which an accurate account had not been kept and audited by the Auditor-General . </para>

                        <para>- I have quoted the statements alleged to have been made by the honorable member for Gippsland, and reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> as well as in three Gippsland newspapers. Surely all could not have lied.The statements which are made concerning maladministration, bribery, and corruption on the part of political parties in America were, no doubt, uttered in the first place in the heat of political battle, and if they were analyzed, I think it would be found that they had not as much foundation as many imagine. Such a statement as that made by the honorable member for Gippsland - that £3,000,000 of public money had been expended by the late Administration, and that if the members of that Administration had been in charge of a butter or bacon factory they would have been prosecuted and gaoled, is absolutely degrading to public life, and might very well lead the people to believe that corrupt practices are being adopted in Australia. When every member knows that, there is no foundation for the statements made. </para>

I was under the impression that, in this honorable House, the explanation or denial of a member would be accepted. I stated, in my first speech in this Chamber, that, on the occasion in question, I said nothing at all about the Auditor-General not having audited the accounts. What I said was that £4,000,000 had been expended in respect to which the people had received no adequate return. I repeat that statement. I also asked where the money had gone, and what the people had got for it. </para>

                        <para>- Such a statement reflects, not upon the late Treasurer, but upon the Auditor-General. If the Auditor-General is capable of allowing accounts to go through without being audited he ought to be dismissed at the earliest possible moment. Coming to the Bill itself, we were told that it was a non-contentious measure, designed merely to enable the Treasurer to carry on the financial obligations of the Commonwealth for some four or five weeks after the close of the financial year without finding it necessary to interrupt the debate on the Address-in-Reply in order to obtain Supply. The Treasurer's argument was that the Government's predecessors in office resigned so late in the financial year that they were unable to meet Parliament earlier, and to obtain the Supply necessary to meet certain obligations. </para>

                        <para>- The Government could come down and obtain Supply on the first or fecond day in July; so that there is noohing in the point raised by the right honorable member. My next objection is that the Government have thought fit to tack on to this Bill a provision for the creation of a Supply and Tender Board - a matter that is totally foreign to the Bill itself.. Both sides of the House are anxious that a Supply and Tender Board shall be established at the earliest moment, so that proper control may be exercised over the purchase and distribution of supplies. But the Government, in tacking on such a provision to the Audit Bill, gave rise to the impression that the Auditor-General would have something to do other than the mere auditing of public accounts in relation to this board. We were led to believe that he was to be the  chairman  of the board. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot justify what has been done by others. Hundreds of regulations are issued every year, and I do not think they are read by a solitary member of Parliament, except by the Ministerial heads who are responsible for them. It is one of the faults of our parliamentary system that we allow so much to be done by regulation. I admit that there are some things which cannot be very well controlled by Parliament. The Government should have power to make regulations in such cases; but when we can give a clear idea of what we want, as in this case, it is not wise to provide for doing it by regulation. Under the circumstances, I enter my protest against the third reading of the Bill. </para>

                    <para>. - All the arguments that we have heard to-night,with the exception of a few observations from the honorable member for Maribyrnong, have been stated before, and I do not propose to allude to them again. In regard to what the honorable member for Maribyrnong said, I quite recognise that our system is not perfect, and that the Estimates and the Appropriation Act are passed too late in the year. But we have not been able to overcome that difficulty up to the present; indeed, difficulties will arise whatever we do. If we followed the honorable member's advice, and terminated the financial year in March, we might have the Estimates brought before Parliament at the beginning of July. But, even then, Parliament would be no nearer to them than it is now. The financial year would be nearly half over before the Appropriation Act was passed. </para>

                        <para>- The object is to bring the finances before Parliament as soon as possible, but whatever we do there is a difficulty in the way. When I first entered Parliament in Western Australia, the financial year ended on the 31st December. Parliament used to meet in the middle of the year. The Treasurer had to estimate the revenue, not only for the remainder of the financial year in which the Budget was delivered, but for the whole of the coming financial year. That is to say, he had to estimate the revenue for nearly eighteen months. That was very inconvenient. It is necessary that the Treasurer should know the total amount of revenue and expenditure for the past financial year when estimating for the next financial year. I admit that the Commonwealth system is inconvenient from the Treasury and departmental bookkeeping point of view, because the halfyear has gone before the final appropriation takes place. But I am not prepared at the present moment to say that the limits of the financial year should be altered. All the States are in the same position. Their financial year ends on the 30th June. It would be inconvenient if the Commonwealth's financial year ended on a different date from that of tne States. I do not think that a Treasurer would deliberately hold back accounts from payment towards the end of the financial year for the purpose of making the finances) look better. He could not hide what he was doing from the officers of the Department, and it would soon be apparent to any one examining the accounts, and especially to the Auditor-General. The public creditor would complain that he was doing it for political purposes. The law, as well as the usual custom, is that all accounts that are ready for payment on the 30th June shall be paid then. <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> do not recall any case in which that has not been done. If the revenue of the year is falling off, or is not coming in as anticipated, care is taken not to commence works as early as might otherwise be done, in order that the whole of the expenditure on those works might not fall due within the financial year. That might even be done when works had been authorized by Parliament. Indeed, it is quite right that a Treasurer should not embark on works, although he may have a vote of Parliament for them, unless he can see his way to pay for them. T have myself, as a State Treasurer, delayed works because the revenue was not coming in satisfactorily. After all, the management of the finances of a country is a business affair. A Treasurer should manage the finances as he would manage his own affairs. He should not spend money which he has noli  got, and should not authorize expenditure unless he can see his way to meet it. From that point of view, to delay works is perfectly straightforward, and there is no subterfuge about it. Within my own experience as Federal Treasurer, we were short of money in the year 1909-10, owing to the introduction of old-age pensions. In other years we have always had enough money. There was always a balance to spare out of the one-fourth Customs and Excise revenue which, under the Braddon section, we were permitted to retain for Commonwealth purposes; and we always returned to the States more than we were compelled to return. The general desire at that time was to assist the States as much as possible. But a change came over the spirit of the dream. Afterwards all that was available was appropriated. But in the year when the old-age pensions were introduced, the Government were placed in the position of not having quite enough money to meet engagements. Then a new arrangement was made by which the Commonwealth returned to the States 25s. per head of the population, and that left the Treasurer with an immense additional revenue for Commonwealth purposes. I can see no such objections to this Bill as the honorable member for Kennedy sees. There is no objection to regulations for such a purpose. I have before me the regulations made under the Public Service Act of Victoria for the control of stores. A board administers the matter. Here we propose that when necessary a board shall be established for the same purpose, and that the Auditor-General shall have the same statutory power over stores as well as over funds. The Auditor-General has to audit the whole of the expenditure of the Commonwealth. On rare, extraordinary occasions, such as the impossibility of getting the voucher, the Auditor-General reports to the Treasurer and asks him to allow the account to be passed without the voucher. I can see no reason why this power to make regulations for the purpose of the control of stores should not be contained in the Audit Act. It is the power that is needed, and I do not care what A.ct provides the power. In Victoria it is provided for in the Public Service Act. We propose to provide for it in the Audit Act. In any case, the Auditor-General will scrutinize accounts affecting the control and issue of public stores just as he scrutinizes accounts in regard to the expenditure of money. He will have no more power over this matter than he has over any other financial transaction of the Commonwealth. Every Treasurer has experienced inconvenience in meeting accounts which fall due at the beginning of the financial year. If Parliament were summoned to meet a month before the close of the financial year, there would be no need for this Bill. It has been urged, but I do not think seriously, that we desire to force the measure through the House. We have no such desire. Naturally, we wish to carry it ; but to suggest that we are particularly interested in that direction is not justified. Our one object is to make the machinery of government run smoothly, not for our own advantage, but for the advantage of the Commonwealth . </para>

                        <para>.- I rise to support this measure with enthusiasm, and to compliment the Government upon its early introduction. Australia is a land of production. I listened attentively to the remarks of the Prime Minister in moving the second reading of the Bill, and I gathered that its object is, not to establish a costly Department which will be encumbered with demonstration work, but to develop the science of agriculture, and to place at the disposal of our primary producers the best world-wide information that it is possible to secure. It is a measure that brings us back to the genesis, so to speak, of the science of agriculture- to the work undertaken by that eminent man, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Bennett Lawes, at his Rothamstad Estate, some sixty years ago. Then the American States set to work. There, however, the position is rather different from that which obtains in Australia. The first effort in developing the science of agriculture in. the United States was undertaken by the Federation. Here, the first work in that direction has been done by the various States. I wish to place on record my appreciation of the work which they have been able to perform with the limited funds at their disposal. I hope that there will be healthy co-operation between the States and the Commonwealth in this connexion. I am certain that the Prime Minister was right when he said that the object of the Government was not to invade the field which is at present being covered by the various State Agricultural Departments, but rather to widen the scope of the science of agriculture. The States, by reason of their financial position, are somewhat; cramped in their efforts. The operation of each State is naturally circumscribed by financial considerations, so that, under their guidance, there can be neither the acquisition nor dissemination of knowledge that is possible under the Commonwealth. I take it that this Bill has two objects in view. In the first place, it aims at increasing the production of Australia; and, secondly, at dealing with the pests and diseases which are common to plant and animal life here. Take the production of wheat, for example. The most common pests which affect wheat are red-rust, flag-smut, ball-smut, takeall, white-heads, and the wheat grub. I may tell honorable members that I have had a recent experience of the ravages of the wheat grub. It was my bad fortune, on returning home about a fortnight ago, to find that I had lost about 300 acres of self-sown wheat through the depredations of this grub. My experience is not a singular one. In many parts of the northern district this year the wheat crops have been very much affected by the grub, a specimen of which, by the way, I submitted to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. French,</inline> the Entomologist, who describes it as the climbing cut worm. The ravages of this one pest alone may reduce the value of the production of Australia in one year by hundreds of thousands of pounds. I may be pardoned for mentioning, as an illustration of my good fortune, that, round a paddock of wheat adjacent to that to which I have referred, I seeded a chain of oats, which proved an effective barrier against the grub. </para>

                            <para>- My action, was prompted first by a desire to obtain clean seed oats, and secondly by the assurance of my neighbours that it formed an effective barrier to the grub. Here is the result of a practical effort. The fact that the grub did. not thrive in the oat crop, when conveyed to the scientist, may lead to some valuable discoveries. I come now to fruit cultivation. We all know that fruit-growers are subject to very many pests, and the last word in the methods to be adopted for their destruction has surely not been uttered. What the little lady-bird was able to do in America in connexion with the scale there illustrates what may be accomplished if science has full play in Australia. I come now to the natural enemy of lucerne. In our district, it is a new arrival, which is known as the lucerne flea. If this little flea gets its way amongst the lucerne of Australia, very serious results will follow. Let me touch now upon the veterinary side of the project. Sheep, for example, are affected with many diseases, notably fluke, tick, maggot-fly, lung-worm, anthrax, and foot-rot; while cattle are attacked with pleuro, tick fever, contagious abortion, and tubercular trouble. </para>

                            <para>- No. I wish rather to increase the opportunities of the States to cope more effectively with these diseases. The point which impresses me most in regard to the establishment of a Commonwealth Bureau of Agriculture is that Australia is competing with many other nations for land users and agriculturists. How are we to attract them to our shores ? By being in a position to put the best proposition before them. There is no patriotism about the man who is looking for the best spot to land upon. If we can increase the production of Australia in any one of the lines to which I have referred, we shall render good service to every one engaged upon the land here. We shall also do good work for others outside, including the supporters of my honorable friends opposite, in increasing employment and cheapening food supplies. </para>

                            <para>- The lands of Australia are reserved to the States by the Constitution, and we must co-operate with them. My idea is that the Commonwealth Department should acquire all possible knowledge, and disseminate it, using State organizations to demonstrate its value. I have already spoken informally to State officials, who welcome attempts to throw more light on the science of agriculture. Victoria, for example, should not be confined in matters of research or of demonstration to her own territory, and it seems to me that the widest investigation can be made by a Commonwealth Bureau. What a great advantage it would be to Australia if the Bureau could provide our pastoralists with knowledge that would enable them to make two blades of grass grow where one grows now. It is not sufficient merely to kill the timber on a piece of land ; much more can be done to improve its pastures. Cultivation and the use of manures may produce 2£ tons of fodder where the natural pasturage would not amount to more than 5 cwt. Surely honorable members see what a wide field there is for increasing our knowledge, and thus increasing our wealth in this and other directions. But as I did not know that the Bill would be called on to-night, and as the hour is getting late, I beg leave to continue my speech on another occasion. </para>

                        <para>.- I wish to know if the Prime Minister has anything to say about his remarks at a recent banquet, when he accused the Opposition of obstructing the Audit Bill. He should withdraw his slanders. He continually misrepresents this party to the public, accusing us of delaying legislation. He does not tell them that the Audit Bill was brought forward in an imperfect condition, and that our criticism was necessary, the result being that the Bill was amended. Not only did the Treasurer move an amendment in the Bill as the result of criticism, but after more criticism he moved a further amendment. I think it is time that the Prime Minister told the public the exact truth about what is taking place in this House. The Audit Bill, which is, without a doubt, to a considerable extent, a contentious measure, called for some criticism. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, contentious. It received that criticism, and the honorable member knows that no  speaker  on this side took up more time than did some of the speakers on his own side. I hope that the representatives of the daily press who are here this evening will note our objections to the Prime Minister's remarks at the banquets which are being held all over the country, and that they will point out that we have allowed the Audit Bill to go through and the Norfolk Island Acceptance Bill to be introduced without any opposition. We will allow any measure of a like character, which is calculated to advance the interests of Australia, to go through with reasonable despatch; but, of course, if the Prime Minister, prompted by the Imperial Caesar I spoke of this evening, brings down contentiousmeasures for the purpose of making political capital out of them, he will be met with full and free debate. I trust that he will not make it necessary for me to delay the House on the motion for adjournment in protesting against his repeated slanders of this party. </para>

                        <para>.- I am sorry that the Honorary Minister is not present, for I wish to bring under the notice of the Minister of Defence that certain boys who have been tried in New South Wales for not putting in a sufficient number of drills have had passed upon them very extreme sentences. Somehave been sentenced to twenty-four hours in the cells, and then fifty-one days in camp, away from their work and their  homes. If the system of compulsory training is going to succeed, it will not succeed by harsh treatment like that being meted out to the boys. Not only do the boys feel this harsh treatment, but the boys' parents do, too. I ask the Prime Minister to favorably consider the question of remitting the sentences on the boys tried in Newtown. </para>

In reply to the honorable member for Capricornia, I will say " guilty," and I will not do it any more - until the next time.
