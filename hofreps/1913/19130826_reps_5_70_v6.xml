Australia as against the Commonwealth. To that I replied, &#34; Not as against the Commonwealth&#34;; but the Prime Minister answered, &#34;Yes.&#34; I ask the honorable member whether he is now prepared to withdraw that statement, which appears in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and has been published in the press of the various States, seeing that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Isaacs did not represent the South Australian Government as against the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- I withdraw the statement; my recollection is that I made the correction later in the speech in which the statement was made. I withdraw the statement absolutely. I wish to say, too, that I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Isaacs, when Attorney-General, did not accept a brief from the South Australian Government, though he furnished to that Government an opinion for which he received payment. </para>

He also objected to the Commonwealth, through the Naval Board, finding well-paid jobs for half-pay Navy officers&#39; in connexion with the administration of the Navy Act, as had been done in the case of the lighthouse expert. </para>

                    <para>. - Before submitting the motion which I intend to propose in regard to the business of the day I should like to make mention of the death of an old and respected member of this House - I mean the Honorable William Knox, who, for many years, was one of our most highly-esteemed representatives here, and one of the most useful members withal that this chamber has known. He was a man of patriotism and zeal in the public service of the country - one whose example all may worthily emulate, though few certainly will excel. It seems as if death has laid a heavy toll on the members of this Commonwealth Parliament. One after another is to be counted amongst those who have gone hence, and left their labours to be carried on by others. We can but acquiesce in these visitations from time to time, and hope that we may do our duty as faithfully as he did who has just gone from amongst us. I am quite sure that I voice the feelings of the whole House when I say that we tender our sincerest sympathy to the bereaved ones, and pray that a kind Providence may assuage their grief and soften the blow to them. </para>

                    <para>.- The Prime Minister quite correctly said that he spoke for the whole House when he expressed sympathy with the widow and family of the late Honorable William Knox, who, both in a private and public capacity - especially in his own State - has rendered valuable service to the community. The head of the Government also very fittingly referred to the severe toll demanded by Nature of the people&#39;s representatives in this Parliament. I have expressed my views on that subject before, and I do not wish to repeat them. Our sympathies go out to the bereaved ones. Nature demands that we must all go hence at some time, and however much we may differ as to the methods which should be followed in carrying on the government of the country we all recognise faithful service by any honorable member, no matter what political views he may hold. It is very important for us to recollect that every person who enters this Chamber enters it as the choice of a majority of the electors of his constituency. The position which he holds is, therefore, a very honorable one. I join with the Prime Minister in offering our sympathy to the widow and relatives of the late Honorable William Knox, and in placing on record our recognition of the public services which he rendered. </para>

                    <para>.- I wish to add a few words to what has already been said by the Prime Minister and my respected leader, because the late Honorable William Knox was the oldest friend I had in politics. It is more than forty years ago when he, one of the handsomest men in Melbourne, took my part as one of the youngest officials in a bank in this city, and thus rendered me a kindness which afterwards cemented into a friendship that was never broken. Later on, I followed the study of another profession, whilst he remained associated with the bank. Few men have filled as large a position as he has, and though we differed politically, our friendship was never estranged. I wish, therefore, to pay my meed of praise to one who proved himself a true friend and a kindhearted gentleman, especially when I brought the unemployed movement under his notice - a movement which he assisted monetarily and in other ways. I join in the hope which has been expressed, that his bereaved ones may have God&#39;s help to enable them to bear their affliction, and, in conclusion, I would say, as every one else here will say, &#34; God rest his soul.&#34; </para>

                    <para>.- I enter my protest against the suspension of the Standing Orders - a procedure to which, both in Federal and State politics, I have always objected. To my mind, there could be no more serious invasion of our parliamentary privileges than is involved by the suspension of the Standing Orders. The Government of the day, whether it be a Labour or a Conservative Administration, should protect to the fullest extent the procedure of the House. A time may come when party feeling is running high, and when the one side or the other, having behind it a strong servile majority, will by this means rule the House in a way that the people do not desire. This is a proposal against which every honorable member in ordinary circumstances should take a stand ; but as I understand that on the present occasion the suspension of the Standing Orders is desired in order to obtain Supply, I do not intend to take very strong exception to it. I shall, however, continue to protest, as I have always done, against the suspension of the Standing Orders from time to time. </para>

                    <para>.- I indorse the words that have just fallen from the lips of the honorable member for Kennedy. The motion which the Treasurer would like to move is, I think, one that was heard in the early history of this House, when an enthusiastic pressman leant over the gallery, and said, &#34; I move that this House adjourn for forty purple years.&#34; Such a motion would probably suit the Treasurer. I do not propose to offer any objection to the taking of the steps necessary to enable the Public Service to be paid, but I wish to emphasize the point that the present Government have no desire whatever to do any business. If they had they would speedily get out of the way the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply, and would push on with the business of the country. I learn from to-day&#39;s newspapers that it is proposed to ask for the adjournment of this House at an early date to enable honorable members to entertain our parliamentary visitors from Great Britain. The Government, apparently wanting an excuse for not pushing on the business, intend to avail themselves of this opportunity to secure an adjournment, on the plea that members of the Commonwealth Parliament should be able to tour the country with their guests, who, by the way, we are most anxious to see enjoy themselves while in the Commonwealth. In the circumstances, I do not offer any objection to this motion. The Treasurer to-day is so very mild and courteous that one really finds it difficult to offer any objection whatever. </para>

                    <para>.- I wish to express my pleasure that some honorable members have at last learned the lesson that the Standing Orders should not be lightly suspended. I quite agree with what has been said by the honorable member for Kennedy, but regret that when from time to time, during the first five years of the Commonwealth Parliament, I objected to the Standing Orders being suspended I did not receive the support of honorable members now sitting in Opposition. At that time they sat behind another Administration, and gave it their full support. On almost every occasion on which such a motion as this was submitted I pointed out that it was not in accordance with the best parliamentary practice, and should not be encouraged ; but I cannot say I ever received the support of a member of the Labour party. In this instance there is some excuse for the action proposed.  Who delayed the last general election so long that a Supply Bill could not be brought forward until the financial year bo! which it related had already been entered upon ? The elections should rightly have been held last March or April, We should then have been able to meet by the 1st June - before the beginning of the present financial year. I do trust that now that we have in power a sound Administration they will correct this &#39; procedure at the first opportunity, and that we shall at last have the granting of Supply, as it ought to be, within the control of the House. I, therefore, welcome the support of honorable members opposite, who have announced their objection to the suspension of the Standing Orders, and have no doubt that Ministers will gladly receive it in bringing our procedure in this respect into that full and proper order from which it ought never to have departed. </para>

                    <para>.- It is obvious that the honorable member for Werriwa is trying to score off the Opposition by urging that the general election should have taken place at an earlier date. The honorable member, who professes to be a student of the Constitution, ought to know that under the Constitution the Senate continues to exist until the 30th June, so that if the general election had taken place in April, and Parliament had been called together, as the honorable member suggested, early in June, any members of the Senate who had been defeated at the polls would have been able to take part in the passing of the Supply Bill. That is what is advocated by the enthusiastic constitutionalist who has been returned - temporarily, I hope - by the electors of Werriwa. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that the honorable member is particularly pleased that the honorable member for Werriwa has been returned. The Government has far more docile supporters. The honorable member for Werriwa urges that the late Government were responsible for keeping the House in existence longer than was necessary, with the result that we have now to pass a Supply Bill when we ought to be dealing with the Estimates for the current financial year. He must have forgotten his constitutional knowledge, of which he used to give us the benefit when he was a member of the House on a previous occasion. Apparently, he recognises and approves of the pernicious principle that defeated senators should continue to take part in the legislation of the country. </para>

                        <para>- It is another matter in which even the honorable member, in his indiscretion of to-day, would accept no responsibility. Here was a case where no Government could, under any consideration, be justified in allowing a Senate, composed of some members who might have been rejected by the popular votes of the various States of Australia, to deal with a Supply Bill for the current financial year. The argument of the honorable member was all intended to show that the late Government were interested in making the elections as late as possible - That was not the case. Recognising the constitutional position, the Government wished to meet Parliament with the new Senate. Supply had been granted only till the end of June; and as soon as the result of the elections was known, the late Government resigned in order that the present Government should be free from embarrassment and able to call Parliament together early in the financial year. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. The refunds are required to pay cable receipts, which come to the Government in the first instance, and have to be paid to the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company and the Pacific Cable Board, and also for postage on postal notes, and the repayment of money paid into the revenue iti error. As to the Treasurer&#39;s Advance, honorable members are aware that the first Supply Bill provided for &#163;400,000, and I now ask for &#163;250,000 more. This is no doubt a large amount, but the reason is that until we have an appropriation for works and buildings the numerous works throughout the Commonwealth have to be paid for out of this Advance. All these works, I may say, have been authorized by Parliament, but they were not completed by the end of the financial year ; and the course followed in regard to them is the course taken in previous years. I may point out that, although &#163;650,000 may be approved by Parliament, for Treasurer&#39;s Advance, it is not intended that more than &#163;500,000 shall be voted under this head when the Estimates for the whole of the financial year are before the House. As I say, the course now taken is exactly the same, I believe, as that taken last year. </para>

                        <para>- I am speaking from memory, but I think the late Government asked for as much as we are asking for. As soon as we have an appropriation for works and buildings, the money now voted to the Treasurer&#39;s Advance will be debited to that appropriation, and the Treasurer&#39;s Advance will be relieved of nearly the whole of the liability. This is merely a temporary measure to enable us to pay for works and buildings from the beginning of the financial year until we have an appropriation. This Supply Bill, like the last one, is based on the Estimates of the previous year. The only increases of salaries which will be paid under it are the ordinary statutory increments, due to officers whose salaries do not exceed &#163;180 a year. There is nothing novel or unusual in the Bill. </para>

                    (Wide Bay) &#91;3.37J. - The Treasurer, of course, needs money to meet the obligations of the Commonwealth, and it is the business of Parliament to pass this measure, whatever our views may otherwise be as to the administration. It is very interesting to hear the Treasurer deprecating any criticism in relation to the amount for the Treasurer&#39;s Advance, and suggesting that it is not much, and that later on the matter will be adjusted.

                        <para>- But the honorable member is only asking for Supply for one month. Our highest for one month was &#163;200,000; but honorable members, in addition to getting &#163;400,000 in the last Supply Bill, are now asking for &#163;250,000 more. I am not questioning the utility or necessity of this amount of money being granted, but I am dealing with it from the attitude the honorable member assumed when he was in Opposition. </para>

                        <para>- I do not complain of the way in which the Treasurer has made his temporary financial statement in asking for Supply; but, in view of the remarks made so prominently in the country concerning the state of the Treasury, it is time we asked the Government or the Treasurer to make a statement regarding the finances generally. It is. difficult to interrupt a discussion such as is going on in the House to deal with it now, and I shall not attempt it; but it is incumbent on the Government to make good the statement they made throughout the country regarding the state of the finances. It was about the fifteenth time of interrogation before we were able to get the Prime Minister to admit the actual facts of the case. It was only about a week ago that he admitted there was a net cash surplus of about &#163;2,500,000 in the Treasury. </para>

                        <para>- It is only quite lately that the Prime Minister admitted it; but. there were many statements published and reprinted in the country press, where, I believe, they were intended to do good service, claiming that there was an actual deficit ; and it was only the other day that the Prime Minister admitted that when the present Government came into office there was a net cash balance of &#163;2,474,323, plus a net cash balance of &#163;291,025 in the Australian.

                        <para>- The outgoing Government were the first Government to leave a surplus of that extent in any part of Australia; but so far from using these financial resources to placate supporters and spend money heavily, we conserved the public finances and safeguarded the public interest as far as practicable, with the result that, though State Governments are financially embarrassed, the Commonwealth is to-day in a very happy position financially. We can search in vain for records of Liberal Governments going out of office leaving a state of affairs like that. It is no part of our duty to extol our own administrative virtues, but it is just to those who were associated with the Labour party that the absolute facts should be made known. The Treasurer knows that I am stating facts. I would remind him again of the manner in which he issued his first financial statement at the opening of the session. He put down the actual amount of credit balance for the last financial year as so much, and said that the balance brought over from other years was so much, hiding as far as he could the actual aggregate money accumulated in the time the previous Government were in office. </para>

And there on the Government benches are the accusers of the people of Australia. They who made the reckless charges are not more honorable. Idle, cynical laughter will not rid them of the charge. There is not a tittle of evidence produced. </para>

The Prime Minister and others have referred to an official statement by the Commonwealth Statistician, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs,</inline> to the effect that there is a greater number of names on the electoral roll than of people of voting age in the Commonwealth.

                        <para>- The honorable member has made two distinctly different statements. The Government will have to discharge their public duty regarding the allegations of corruption on the part of the electors of Australia. I repeat what I said when the charge was first made. I know the people o&#176;f Australia, and I know also some of the other peoples of the world, and I express my opinion that in connexion with the elections, the people of Australia are more honest and straightforward than are those of any other country in the world. That is a big thing to say of them. I will not say that in Australia we are entirely free from those who will, perhaps, take advantage of the rights and privileges they enjoy, but I do say that the number of such people in Australia is smaller than in other countries, and they are not confined to any one political party. Honorable members opposite, whom I congratulate upon having the press largely on their side, have influenced the newspapers to create an atmosphere that induces many honest people- to believe the thing which is not. It is&#60; not to their credit that they have done so. Let me turn now to the question connected with the sugar industry. What, would have been said of a Labour Government if they had done something wrong, without knowing it was wrong, at- a time when Parliament was in session, and it was possible to right the wrong? That aspect of the matter has never yet been dealt with by the Government. This Parliament met early in July, and it was late in the same month before the proclamation to which reference has been made was issued. Ministers were roaming about the country. They obtained an adjournment to enable them to look into matters. We presumed that they were looking into all matters; but they missed the most important. They had time to go about accusing the people of corruption, but no time to look into essentials and to protect the revenue of the country. Now they whine that what occurred was due to the oversight of the previous Government. This Government was in office for a month before the proclamation in regard to the repealing Acts was issued. They had at their disposal officers who knew everything about the business. </para>

                        <para>- That is not the point with which I am dealing now. It was their duty to ask the responsible officers of the Department how the matter stood. If the whole of the sugar made from Australian products in 1911-12 had been placed on the market, there would have been no surplus Australian sugar in bond after April of this year, because last season was a short one, and the consumption of sugar was largely in excess of the quantity produced in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- The Customs officers know every pound of Australian-made sugar that is in bond at any particular date. Therefore, the Government could have been in possesion of the information. There would have been no loss to the sugar industry if the Minister had taken the right course. The bounty could have been paid in the meantime, and the sugar-growers protected, whilst a short Act of Parliament could have been antedated to deal with all the sugar produced from this year&#39;s crop. It was as simple as A B C if the matter had been looked into properly. It has been suggested by the Minister of Trade and Customs that I said that I would issue the proclamation when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Denham,</inline> the Premier of Queensland, carried out his agreement with the Federal Government. Certainly; but that applied entirely to the new year&#39;s crop. As regards the future, two things were possible. One was to equalize the bounty and the Excise, and the other was to enter into an agreement with the Government of Queensland to abolish the bounty and Excise on certain conditions. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Denham</inline> preferred the latter course, and it was carried out. I have always held the view - and I am sorry the sugar producers did not agree - that the true remedy was to equalize the bounty and Excise. By that means I believe the sugar-grower, who is the person to be protected primarily, would have been properly protected. But the other course was adopted. </para>

                    <para>.- I am entitled to a second period during this debate, and should like to take the opportunity now of finishing what I have to say on the sugar question, since the right honorable gentleman has been good enough to resume his seat to give me that opportunity. I have said that I regret that the industry is now under the control of two Parliaments. The sugar industry in Australia can only exist by the good will of the Federal Parliament and the people of Australia. Without full and ample protection at the seaboard it cannot survive. </para>

                        <para>- Some industries have even more, and they are not primary industries, nor are they tropical industries. They have a hope of existing without protection, but the sugar industry has no such hope. It has to meet competition from two sides - from Hawaii and from Fiji and Java, which are natural places for sugar production in the tropics, and where white labour is not employed. The Australian Parliament is determined that the industry shall be carried on by white labour. Thirteen years ago it was difficult to make people in the southern parts of Australia believe that it was possible to produce sugar by white labour. The denunciations that came from the press, and those interested, were all in the direction that it meant a disaster to the industry, and failure to those who had put their money into it. We on this side were the one party that stood solid, and predicted that the industry would succeed under reasonable Protection, with white labour conditions. The Government of the day - the Barton Government - brought in the present Tariff with the addition of the bounty and the Excise, differentiating between white and coloured grown cane. By the economic operation of that legislation, without any coercion at all except the repatriation of the Polynesians, the industry has prospered as a white labour industry. It has settled about 700 miles of the north-east coast line of Australia in a way which could not have been done under other circumstances. Twenty years ago one could not persuade people even in Queensland that sugar could be successfully grown with white labour north of Mackay. To-day, they all admit that it is practicable to do so in nearly every part of Australia. There is another point in this matter that I wish to deal with; then I will be finished. We have heard a great deal about the powers of this Parliament under the Constitution. We have also heard a great deal about the great American Republic, and how its people are going to remedy their troubles with regard to trusts, combines, and monopolies. How does the  President  of the United States intend to act? He proposes to deal with the sugar question in the way that some honorable members opposite proposed to adopt here, and that was to wipe out the duty, and have free competition. In America, sugar-growers have coloured labour, and yet those interested there say that by the act of the Senate in passing a measure to wipe out the duty by degrees, they would destroy the industry. How is it possible in a country like Australia, where there is a determination to provide that every white man who is engaged in a productive industry shall get fair wages and have reasonable conditions, the sugar industry could compete against open ports? The suggestion is impossible. Whatever our opinions may be on this question, they will have to be put to the test. Australian people, I believe, are ready and willing to pay more for sugar to enable the industry to continue. I believe that the Protection at the seaboard will be sufficient to allow fair and reasonable conditions to the workers, and fair and reasonable returns to the growers and the investors. </para>

                        <para>- They have a fair return this year. The question is not whether they can produce enough sugar for Australia, but whether they can produce enough sugar to export. In my opinion, it will not be economically possible for them to produce sugar and sell it overseas. Therefore, it lies with the  Australan  people to say what Protection shall be given to the industry. Certainly the Protection should be sufficient to give each party a fair return. In my opinion it would not help the producer if the Protection were such as to make the production in excess of the requirements of Australia. These requirements will grow with the population, and it will be a very large and important industry which will supply them. Whatever the Protection is, I believe that the majority of the people of Australia will demand that it shall be given rather than  that we should lose the industry. That is my reply, not only in regard to the sugar industry, but in regard to every other. If an industry is essential, then the Protection must be adequate. I do not wish to trespass further on the time of the Committee. I should not, perhaps, have enlarged so much on this question had it not been for the kindly interjections of the Prime Minister, but I am glad that the Ministry, now that they have had time to reflect, admit cheerfully, as they are bound to do on the facts, that not only were the finances of the country carefully conserved by their predecessors- </para>

They thought that they would be able to get out of the trouble without the knowledge of the public. No other reason for their silence can be given.

                <para>Colonel RYRIE (North Sydney) &#91;4.18&#93;. - I would not have risen had it not. been that the ex-Prime Minister could not refrain from indulging in abuse of this side of the House. There has been nothing else from the other side since we commenced to work this session. I feel sure that new members, of whom we have a good crop, must wonder whether they have really succeeded in taking a seat in the National Parliament. They must wonder if they are really in an assemblageof men who are supposed , to be moulding; the destinies of this great Commonwealth, because they have heard nothing but abuse and misrepresentation from start to finish. The Leader of the Opposition, even on the Supply Bill, could not refrain from abusing this side of the House. He said that we are the slanderers of the people of Australia. Simply because, owing to persistent reports in the press, it appeared that great abuses of the Electoral Act had been indulged in, and this side of the House took steps to see whether that was the case, we are called the slanderers of Australia. The party on the other side have given, I suppose, as great an insult to a respectable community in Australia as has ever been given to any section of a community in the world, and that is to the landowners. The land-owners of Australia were deliberately insulted by an instruction issued by the ex-Minister of Home Affairs. </para>

                    - Many selectors term their holdings stations. Selectors and all who hold land are as good as told that they are liars, perjurers, and dishonorable men. Before a man accepts electoral work he takes an oath to discharge his functions according to law, but the ex-Minister of Home Affairs has said that the land-owners of Australia are liars and perjurers, who, if appointed for the conduct of elections, would abuse their positions. This is an insult that the landowners will not forget. When Labour members go to the country again, the insult will be avenged. Labour members have an intense hatred of the man on the land. They wish to drive him off the land, to nationalize it. They like to get the farmers&#39; votes, but when there is an opportunity to insult them, they do not let it pass. Am I, as a station-owner or manager, to be told that if I were appointed to the position of assistant returning officer or poll clerk, I should, in spite of my oath, abuse the confidence reposed in me?

                    - I own land, but I do not call myself a squatter. As a landowner I have been stigmatized by the last Government as belonging to a class of persons who would be false to their oath ; who are dishonorable and dishonest. There are a good many land-owners, managers, and overseers in Australia, and they regard the instruction of the ex-Minister of Home Affairs as a deliberate insult to them. They are men who have risen from the ranks for the most part. Because they possess energy, brains, and intelligence, they are told that they are not fitted to occupy positions under the electoral law. Honorable members opposite are always ready to abuse those who hold land in considerable areas. Such men as

                    McCaughey are always being abused by the Labour members and the Labour press.

                    - It was recently stated in the press that
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline>
                    McCaughey had purchased a huge property - something like 200,000 acres - from a financial institution, and the comment was made that probably he would manage the place with the help of an overseer and two or three black boys. In conversation with me he has spoken of the unfairness of such comment. Speaking of this particular land, he said, &#34; When purchased it was absolutely a barren waste, overgrown with scrub and overrun with rabbits. It had not a drop of water on it. I am having erected on it 70 miles of wire-netting fence; I am having two artesian bores put down at a cost of &#163;3,000 each, and I am employing thirty men on it in digging out the rabbits.&#34; That man deserves credit for what he is doing. He is making waste land available for settlement later on. What poor man could touch such land? No one can take up country of that kind unless he has a large amount of capital at his command, and is prepared to spend it. Yet the men who have capital, and use it in making valueless country useful, are abused by the members of the Labour party. The ex-Minister of Home Affairs stigmatized the land-owners, managers, and overseers of Australia as persons who are corrupt and dishonest, liars, and perjurers.

                    I say that the landowners of Australia are as honorable as are those who are engaged in the same occupation as the honorable member, whether they be Scotchmen or Irishmen. He would not like to have those who are in his line of business stigmatized as unfit to hold positions under the electoral law. What was done was absolutely unjustifiable.

                    - I always get the vote of the respectable and honest. It is the boss rabbiters and rouseabouts whom honorable members opposite would make  deputy  returning officers and poll clerks. I gave a list once before of the men who vote for honorable members opposite and whom they favour. It is the tugs, the toughs, and the touts, the race-course spielers, whom they would appoint to positions of trust. The men whom they would appoint to positions under our Electoral Act are the Darling whalers, the sundowners, the pinky-drinkers, and the whisperers and tick-tackers on the pony courses, rather than those who hold land in this country. The land-owners will not forget these honorable members when it comes to their turn to judge them.

                    <para>.- It is not my intention to attempt to reply to the choleric outburst of the honorable and gallant  Colonel. I  will deal rather with the action of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer in regard to the repeal of the Sugar Bounty and Sugar Excise Acts. Later on, I may have a few words to say upon electoral matters. The Prime Minister stated the other evening that he did not promise to repeal the sugar bounty and sugar Excise legislation unconditionally. Of course, one may be excused for doubting the honorable gentleman, because he appears to make so many statements, and to forget all about them, that a denial on his part is quite a frequent occurrence. But I would remind honorable members that about a fortnight prior to the declaration of the poll at the recent general elections there appeared in the Brisbane <inline font-style="italic">Courier</inline> the following - </para>

                        <para>- If the Government acted up to that promise, we can understand the action of the Minister of Trade and Customs in proclaiming the repeal of the sugar bounty and Excise legislation without making due inquiry as to the quantity of sugar which was in bond at the time. Nobody in a deliberate assembly ever appeared more uncomfortable than the Minister did on the day that the honorable member for Yarra revealed his. action in allowing the stocks of sugar in bond to be released without first having paid Excise. It is all very well for the Government and their supporters to say that it was the duty of the late Administration to have inserted in the Sugar Excise Repeal Act a provision to remind the Minister of Trade and Customs that duty must be paid upon the sugar which was in bond at the time of the proclamation of that Act. By doing so they would have made themselves ridiculous in the eyes of Australia. It would have been necessary for them to have inserted a section which would have read somewhat as follows - &#34; Whereas it is probable that this Government will vacate the Treasury benches on the 31st May, and that a Liberal Government will take its place, it is hereby expressly declared that all sugar in bond upon the proclamation of the Sugar Excise Repeal Act shall pay Excise.&#34; We have to recollect, too, that this is the Ministry of all the talents. It includes the Attorney-General, an eminent lawyer, who seems to have taken a very great interest in his work. The moment he was sworn in, he rushed away to introduce quite a new feature into our electoral administration. He at once instituted a search with a view to ascertaining all the information that he could regarding the electoral administration of the honorable member for Darwin. Where was he when the repeal of this sugar legislation was proclaimed ? And where was the Treasurer, who is so anxious about the funds of the Commonwealth, that he did not keep an eye upon the Excise due upon the sugar in bond ? Surely these Ministers were not foraging amongst the dust-bins to see what they could find to the detriment of the late Ministry ! They had important public duties to perform, and one of them was to see that the millers and others interested in this sugar paid duty upon it. The Minister of Trade and Customs must know - and, indeed, anybody who takes an interest in Customs matters knows - that people like the Colonial Sugar Refining Company are perfect artists in their endeavours to pay as little duty as possible. Any person whose trade renders it necessary for him to pay duty is always watching the Tariff, and always making preparations to avoid paying Customs duty. Without doubt, some of those interested in sugar were awaiting the time when they could release the stocks which were in bond without paying Excise upon them. The Government seem to have been reminded by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knox&#39;s</inline> own showing, that they had made a mistake. I can well understand that that company, out of gratitude for the defeat of the referenda proposals, and the return of the Liberal Government to power, would be inclined to be magnanimous. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knox</inline> stated at a meeting the other day that on the 25th July, the date of the repeal of the Sugar Bounty and Sugar Excise Acts, he informed the Government of their mistake. </para>

                    <para>Sydney, Wednesday. - At a meeting of the shareholders of the Colonial Sugar Refining Co. Ltd., the <inline font-weight="bold">chairman (Mr. Kater, M.L.C.)</inline> made the following allusion to the discussion about Excise duty on sugar in the House of Representatives : - &#34; When we obtained a copy of a proclamation issued on this subject, it was evident to us that unless some further action was taken all the sugar produced this season before 25th July would be freed from duty, although the bounty was payable on the cane from which it was made, and the revenue would thus have to suffer. Accordingly, we gave at once to the Customs all the particulars we possessed as to the quantity of sugar in which we were concerned that would be covered by the proclamation, and pointed out that whatever steps might be taken to protect the revenue, th&#233; growers who had made early deliveries of cane should receive the same advantage in respect thereto as those whose crops were cut after 25th July. These representations were made by us three weeks ago, and since then the Comptroller has on several occasions seen our Melbourne manager about the position.&#34; </para>

                <para class="block">I join with the Leader of the Opposition in emphasizing the point that, though the Government knew this three weeks ago, nothing was said about their proposed legislation in the statement .which was thrown on the table of the House by the Prime Minister without any explanation whatever. Was it that they wished to hush the matter up ? Did they expect the Colonial Sugar Refining Company&#39;s example to be followed by the other millers; and if the whole of the Excise due upon the sugar in bond had been collected, would nothing have been said about the matter ? The Minister of Trade and Customs stated on the night that he endeavoured to reply to the honorable member for Yarra - </para>

                <para>But they are not all as liberal as the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. It must be admitted that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company is a very powerful corporation, and that it has gained a great deal by the defeat of the referenda. One of the principal stockbroking firms in Australia - that of Messrs. Palmer and Son - stated that if the referenda were defeated the Colonial Sugar Refining Company&#39;s shares would go up. That prophecy has been fulfilled, shares in the company having increased in price by some &#163;3 or <inline font-style="italic">&#163;A</inline> each. It has been made possible for the company to bleed the people to a greater extent than they would have been able to do if our referenda proposals had been carried. The company is, apparently, grateful, an&#39;d intends to return this money, which ought to have been collected by the Minister of Trade and Customs and his officers. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, it has promised to do so. There are, however, others who have declined to pay. A meeting of the farmers and millers of Mackay was held about 15th August last - just about the time when the Minister said he was sending away telegrams to see if the matter could not be arranged - in other words, to see if his mistake could not be rectified quietly before the honorable member for Yarra had spoken. </para>

                    <para>The millers contend that the Government is in  a  difficulty through having paid bounty on cane sugar which paid no Excise, owing to not having gone into consumption, and wants to shelve the liability on the millers. A motion was proposed that the Federal Government should be  asked  to refund. to the refineries all the Excise collected on this season&#39;s sugar up to July 25th, the date of the abolition, and that the refineries should  be  asked to pay the equivalent to the millers, in which case the millers would pay the growers gs. 2d., except where the growers have already received the bounty from the Government, in which case 7s. would be refunded to the Government. The motion was not carried, some of the millers stating that they would not support the proposal, which would mean  a  loss to their companies of several thousands of pounds. The following amendment was carried .- &#34; That the Federal Government  be  asked to arrange the matter with the refineries.&#34;  To return to the point that this matter should have been attended to by the late Government, and that there should have been inserted in the Sugar Excise Bill a clause providing for the collection of duty on the sugar, I hold the opinion that the whole thing would have been arranged by the ex-Minister of Trade and Customs, the honorable member for Yarra. He would naturally, as any intelligent and active Minister of Trade and Customs would have done - I am not suggesting that the present Minister is not intelligent, but I do say that he was neglectful. </para>

                        <para>- I suppose that his assistance was being sought by the Attorney-General and other members of the Government in their efforts to find out something against the late Ministry, whilst they neglected their important public duties. In all probability the ex-Minister of Trade and Customs, knowing the habits and customs of those who deal with the Department, would have said to those interested, &#34; The Queensland Government having passed certain legislation, we now propose, on a certain date, to proclaim the Acts repealing the sugar bounty and Excise legislation. Will you clear all your sugar up to 12 o&#39;clock midnight on the day preceding that date?&#34; Naturally the refiners and all others interested in the repeal of that legislation would have said, &#34; Certainly, we shall do so,&#34; and that is all that would have been necessary. The Government could have said to these people, &#34; Unless you clear your sugar up to the date named we shall have to suspend for a period - until you come to your senses - the issue of the proclamations with regard to the repealing bounty and Excise legislation.&#34; There is yet another point to be considered. I venture to say that the ex -Prime Minister and the ex-Minister of Trade and Customs would not have issued the proclamation without first asking from the Queensland Government something more in regard to the promise made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Denham.</inline> It will be remembered that the honorable member for Wide Bay, when Prime Minister, addressed to the Premier of Queensland  a  telegram stating that the Government of the Commonwealth would abolish the sugar bounty and Excise legislation if the States concerned would pass an Act - <inline font-style="italic">&#91;a)</inline> to confer upon the Commonwealth Parliament the power to legislate in respect of the employment of coloured labour and regulation of wages and conditions of labour,- or <inline font-style="italic">{b)</inline> to abolish coloured labour in the industry and establish tribunals for the regulation  of  rates of wages and conditions of labour. </para>

                    it will be remembered, said that he preferred the proposal contained in paragraph (6), providing for the abolition of coloured labour in the industry. But have the Queensland Government abolished coloured labour? No. They have passed three measures dealing with this question, and one of these will interest the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General, as well as the honorable member for Gippsland and others who have said that it is impossible for  a  Parliament to regulate wages. The Act is cited as &#34; The Sugar Growers Employes Act of 1913,&#34; and contains  a  schedule declaring that the weekly rates of wages for forty-eight working hours shall be, in the case of adults - without keep, &#163;2 8s. ; with keep, &#163;1 16s. Youths (sixteen to eighteen), &#163;1 4s., and so on. This is an attempt, and a successful attempt, apparently, to fix rates of wages. It is not the first time that a Parliament has fixed the wages to be paid in an industry. This Parliament, as well as the Parliaments of the States, has fixed the rates of wages payable to barristers. It has done so, if not directly, at least indirectly.

                        <para>- Quite so. If it is in the power of a Parliament to decide that a solicitor may charge 6s. 8d. for giving a little advice, and 3s. 4d. for reading a letter, it should be an easy matter for a Parliament to decide what are fair rates of wages to be paid in certain industries. The Queensland Parliament passed the measure I have named, fixing the rates of wages to be paid in the sugar industry until such time as they should be altered by an award made under the State Industrial Peace Act. Another Act, the Sugar Cultivation Act of 1913, was passed providing what persons may be employed in the sugar industry. Certain persons are prohibited from growing cane, and certain others are not to be employed, but there is not a single word in the Act which complies with the request of the ex-Prime Minister that Japanese, Chinese, and Hindoos shall be excluded. The Act lays it down that unless a man can pass a dictation test of about fifty words, he is not to get a certificate; but administration depends very largely on a Government which was in favour of the. employment of coloured labour in the industry. </para>

According to a telegram that, I received the other day, coloured labour is certainly not being excluded from the industry in the Bundaberg district, because, at Pemberton, six coloured men are employed there as carriers, and between twenty and thirty other Asiatics are scattered over the district. In all probability, there are more Asiatics employed further north than in the Bundaberg district. The honorable member for Yarra, when Minister of Trade and Customs, before proclaiming the repeal of the Acts, would have asked the Queensland Government what had been done to carry out the promise made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Denham;</inline> and that request would have been altogether apart from the attention that the ex-Minister would have given to the quantity of sugar which was in bond at the time, and which would escape duty if the proclamation went forth before the duty was collected. I notice that an attempt has been made by the supporters of the Government to put the blame on the Labour Government and party for not introducing a certain clause into the sugar legislation ; but that cannot save the present Government from the charge of blundering. The attempt to fasten the term &#34;incapacity&#34; on the ex-Minister of Trade and Customs will not shield the present Minister from the great blunder he committed in allowing the loss of revenue, variously estimated from &#163;150,000 upwards. </para>

                        <para>- The Government may not have any great difficulty in finding out the amount of duty which ought to be paid, but there will be great difficulty - if they succeed, as I suppose they may, in passing retrospective legislation - in ascertaining how much was grown by white labour, and how much by black - how much sugar ought to escape the bounty. I hope that the Minister of Trade and Customs may get out of his difficulty^, but he will certainly have some trouble if the millers refuse, as they apparently are refusing, to consent to the refiners paying the Excise that is due on the sugar. I shall avail myself of another opportunity to deal with the statements of the Treasurer regarding &#39; the Department of Home Affairs. </para>

                    <para>.- I was much surprised to hear the Leader of the Opposition claim the production of sugar as a primary industry, which it is the duty of this Parliament to encourage ; otherwise I do not understand the action of the honorable member for Capricornia. If the history of the sugar industry, as related to us to-night, shows anything at all, it is that, whatever class of industry it belongs to, it is not a primary industry in the sense that it is able to depend on itself. Furthermore, what we have heard shows that the action of the Labour party in this Parliament has been very detrimental to the interests of Australia as * whole. The Leader of the Opposition says that years ago the Labour party were instrumental in introducing this legislation. I, for one, take pride in the fact that, along with others - and notably the honorable member for Angas - I opposed the legislation; and it would be very instructive to compare the prophecies then made by honorable members opposite with the prophecies made by honorable members on this side. After nearly eleven years we find that this industry has cost the Commonwealth over &#163;14,000,000, while the total production, in addition to what it has cost the owners of the sugar lands, has been only &#163;11,000,000. Manifestly, there has been a loss of nearly &#163;4,000,000 of money, but, as some of this has gone into the Treasury, and has been expended for general purposes, we may take it that the cost to the community, in order to keep going a business that is not suitable to Australia, has been &#163;10,000,000. In fact, the more we go into the matter the more we realize that this is what might be termed a blacklabour industry. </para>

For each of such young men, &#163;300 would have been quite sufficient, and we know that every sugar producer is costing a great deal more. On the average, those to whom this money could have been advanced would&#39; have been able to repay it in about three years. In the first three years, with an advance of &#163;1,000,000, employment would have been given to 10,000 men in sharefarming, and those men would have become the backbone of the country. In the second three, with the advance of another &#163;1,000,000, and re-lending out of the first million, employment would have been given to 20,000 more, and in the third three years to 40,000 more. </para>

Under such a plan as I have indicated, we should, at the end of ten years, have given employment to 70,000 farmers, who would have been returning the money advanced, and not costing the country a penny. The money would then have been available to advance to others. </para>

By granting them assistance in the same manner in which we have built up the sugar industry, and at practically the same cost, we could have placed 70,000 young farmers on the land working on shares, who would all be of great benefit to the country, earning something for themselves over and above the cost of production. </para>

                        <para>- I am talking about the sugar industry passing out. Take poultry and eggs; they return three and three quarter millions, nearly three times the value of the sugar production. The average area under sugar is 140,000 acres, and we contribute &#163;7 per acre to keep that land under cultivation, though I have been told this land is the richest land in Australia, or, some say, in the world. If we have to contribute &#163;7 per acre to keep rich land in cultivation, then the more rich land we have the worse off we are. We ask the man on poor land to contribute to the owner of the rich land. But this is the monstrous proposition that is assented to by Parliament, that the richer the land is the less it is able to support itself, and the greater the contribution demanded from the man on poor land in order that the rich land may be held under cultivation. </para>

                        <para>- I merely incidentally mention this, but if the honorable member went into this matter be could obtain evidence from the very best men engaged in the business. The late member for North Sydney, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. 6.</inline> B. Edwards, speaking from his experience as manager of a large jam manufacturing concern, pointed out what a serious hindrance the duty on sugar was to the jam manufacturing trade. My point is that we have 140,000 acres under cultivation, and we have collected the money for its cultivation from other people not engaged in the growing of sugar. The competition does not cease. We find roughly that it has cost the Commonwealth Parliament &#163;10,000,000, which could have been used in other directions. If we were anxious to encourage people on the land, we could have made an advance of &#163;300 to every share farmer, allowing three years for repayment, as is usually done, and thus we could have had 70,000 young fellows employed on the land developing it, and engaged in a primary industry that would return a great deal to the country over the cost of production. </para>

                        <para>- Only in the matter of bananas. We should look at this from the point of view of cost, apart altogether from Free Trade and Protection. I have shown that, in poultry and eggs, we produce three times the value of the sugar output, and that is an industry conducted on the poorer lands of the Commonwealth. From this time forward, the sugar industry will depend upon the Tariff only. The production may be 190,000 tons, but the people of the Commonwealth will still pay not less than a million pounds sterling, which is, no doubt, to be a continuing payment. In an ordinary business concern, people may consider the advisability of advancing a million or two to get a return of &#163;10,000,000, but we have a definite statement from the Leader of the Opposition that there is no hope for the sugar industry, except with the introduction of new machinery. Are we to call on the poorest citizens to pay for machinery for this industry? </para>

If that be so, this House assents to the proposition that 140,000 acres of land in Queensland, which is some of the richest agricultural land in the world, requires a contribution of &#163;7 per acre from people living on poorer land, and people who have no land at all to keep it in cultivation.

                        <para>- They show that the Labour party have never grasped the situation. They could never have had any idea of the true position, or surely they would not have permitted such a state of affairs to continue. That it has continued for so long is very much to the blame of all Governments of the Commonwealth. I hope that this Parliament will look at the matter from a common-sense point of view, and will not try to further encourage what seems to be a black-labour industry. I have heard the scale of wages read out, and it appears that it has been absolutely necessary to pass an Act of Parliament to enable men to receive 8s. a day in harvest time in the sugar districts. Hearing that, I was astounded to find that it was thought necessary to still continue a bonus to preserve such an industry. If the sugar industry cannot pay better wages, except under compulsion, than that to those employed in carrying it on, it ought to be abolished altogether. Honorable members opposite have frequently said that -an industry which cannot pay proper wages should be abolished. The yearly sum which we are called upon to contribute to the up-keep of this industry, would pay the wages of every one employed in sugar cultivation a dozen times over. If honorable members opposite are content that the money of the Commonwealth should be dissipated in this fashion, what becomes of their claim that -their object is to help the poorer citizens of the community? We are casting unfair burdens upon them, and I am astonished that honorable members do not see that it is the duty of Parliament to look at this matter in that way. From the point of view of defence, will any honorable member contend that by the expenditure of &#163;1,000,000 we could not provide a better defence than could be put up by the 3,000 or 4,000 small farmers engaged in this industry? </para>

                        <para>- They could grow grass upon it, and might feed two head of cattle per acre upon it, as they are now doing in the Richmond River district. I am satisfied that these lands as far north as Maryborough would be placed under some sort of cultivation. &#39;Every one must see that it would not make the slightest difference to the value of the lands in the Richmond River district whether they were used for growing sugar-cane or not. Do not honorable members know that the value of those lands is determined, not by the artificial sugar returns from them, but by the genuine returns produced by their occupation for other purposes ? We might have the lands in these districts occupied by men whose industry would be an absolute gain to the country, but we have by a high Tariff, and the payment of bounties, diverted their industry into an unprofitable channel. </para>

                        <para>- To any productive, instead of to an unproductive, industry. We should have in the occupation of these lands substantial farmers, who would be a gain to the community, men who would be able to pay their share of the taxation of the country, instead of men who must call upon other sections of the community to help them; upon persons who are not owners of rich land, but of poor land, and upon every infant in the community. I did hope that after ten years&#39; experience of this method of dealing with the sugar industry Parliament would have been willing to retrace its steps, but I find that, as in times past, the interests of a small section of the community, provided that it be a fighting section, prevails over the interests of a larger number of people who are unable to fight for themselves, and who do not appear to have the representation they deserve in this House, even from the members of the party terming itself a Labour party on the opposite side. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for North Sydney tried to fasten on this side of the House a charge that they have maligned the land-owners of Australia by reason of some action taken by the ex-Minister of Home Affairs in connexion with the conduct of the recent elections. I want to say at once that I do not know what order was issued by the ex-Minister of Home Affairs, but I believe that the honorable gentleman will be found quite capable of giving an explanation which will be satisfactory, not only to honorable members, but to the whole of the people of Australia. After suggesting that we had insulted the land-owners, and did little honour to this National Parliament, the honorable member for North Sydney, almost in the same breath, grossly insulted every elector who voted for honorable members sitting on this side. He practically designated all who supported honorable members on this side as spielers and loafers. That is language which ill becomes any member of this Parliament. So far as the land-owners are concerned, I confidently assert that, upon inquiry, it will be found that, in proportion to their numbers, the number of land-owners who occupied positions in polling booths throughout Australia in connexion with the recent elections will compare very favorably with the numbers appointed to such positions from other sections of the community. I understand that the order issued by the ex-Minister of Home Affairs did not in any way refer to small land-owners. </para>

                        <para>- It referred to the big squatters and farmers in a large way, for reasons which, no doubt, were held to be sufficient by the honorable gentleman. I should like to say that, so far as honorable members on this side are concerned, they have always endeavoured to deal out even-handed justice to the farmers, as well as to other people in Australia. In the Parliament of New South Wales, as well as in the Federal Parliament, I have represented districts in which there are a great many farmers. Very many of them realize that the Labour party is the political party that looks best after their interests, and we consequently get a very large measure of support from them. It would be well if the honorable member for North Sydney were more careful in the statements he makes in this House, and did not endeavour to fasten a stigma upon this side, while at the same time insulting every elector in Australia of a different way of thinking from himself. The honorable member for Werriwa takes exception to the amount of money expended in connexion with the sugar industry. The honorable member is of opinion that it would be far better for the Commonwealth, instead of fostering that industry and encouraging the production of sugar by white labour, to expend the money in some other direction, and preferably by inducing people to take up land on the share-farming system. First of all, we would require to find the land on which to settle the 70,000 farmers the honorable member spoke about. But, apart from that difficulty, I venture <inline font-style="italic">t&#38;</inline> assert that the legislation enacted by the Commonwealth Parliament some years ago to deal with the sugar industry has rendered a splendid service to Australia. The honorable member for Werriwa pretended that the industry is fit only for black labour, and I may take it from his remarks that he is an advocate of black labour, so far as sugar growing in Queensland is concerned. This Parliament in its wisdom took the view that the industry could be carried on by white labour, and it has been abundantly proved that Parliament was right in taking that view. At the time when this legislation was brought in we had something like 10,000 kanakas producing sugar in Queensland. To-day there are considerably fewer than 1,000. In place of the kanakas we have white men working in the sugar fields. We have a population of nearly 40,000 supported by the production of sugar. In addition to that, we are told by the Queensland Government that there is room for still greater settlement in the sugar-growing districts. There are large areas of land available for people desirous of taking it up for sugar production, so that within the near future we can look forward to becoming self-supporting in this respect. Yet the honorable member who has preceded me advocates that we should repeal the duty on sugar and allow it to come in free. What would that mean <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> It would mean that sugar production in Queensland and on the Richmond River would be a thing of the past. It would not be possible for the farmers there to compete with sugar imported from abroad. Consequently, the Commonwealth would lose, because, after all, we all know that every inhabitant of the Commonwealth is a source of wealth, and, if we shut up avenues of support for 40,000 people in an industry that is capable of being extended to support as many more, it will certainly be a bad thing for an Australian Legislature to do. The honorable member&#39;s argument is purely a Free Trade one from start to finish, and if applied to any other industry would have equally injurious results. In fact, it would mean paralyzing hundreds of industries in Australia, and we should lose a considerable part of our population. It is only by fostering our own industries  that we can hope to find employment for a large population. I rose particularly, however, for two reasons. One is that I wish to impress upon the Minister of Trade and Customs the desirableness of giving attention to the matter of the erection of a testing station for explosives. He promised that he would do so. </para>

                        <para>- I hope that the Minister will consider it without further delay, because it is a very important question. In Australia we use explosives freely, but we have no means of testing them. We have to accept tests made in the Old Country. In mines giving off gas there is constant danger of explosions taking place from the use of defective explosives. We ought not to rely upon tests made elsewhere. For years past explosives have been coming in by the shipload, and we do not know whether, when used, they will give off fire or not. A permitted explosive is supposed to give off no fire at all, owing to the danger to life if an explosion of gas should occur. A testing station would, I believe, cost something like &#163;10,000 a year to erect and maintain. Nothing has been done in this direction at present. The previous Government had it under consideration for at least twelve months, and promised that something should be done, but it had to be left over until the present Parliament met. </para>

I think it is a Commonwealth question, because explosives are used throughout Australia. I trust that the Minister will deal with the subject as soon as possible, in order that the States may know what the intentions of the Government are. Recently the Government of New South Wales have declared that they do not intend to go on with a project for erecting a testing station, because the Minister of Mines there lias been in communication with the Federal Government for some time. If the Commonwealth Government is not going to move, the States should be informed as soon as possible, in order that they themselves may- take the necessary steps to have all explosives that come within their borders properly tested.  The  present state of things is highly dangerous. We may, of course, go on for years without an explosion, but a serious one may take place at any time because of defective explosives being used  in  mines. The sooner the Government rises to the occasion and erects a testing station, the better for all concerned. There is another matter which I wish  to  bring under the notice of the Treasurer. In the Old-age Pensions Act there is  a  provision to the effect that a blind person may receive a pension. The amount  is  10s. per week. In New South Wales,  influences  are exerted to induce blind persons to go into an institution in Sydney. The Commonwealth Government takes 6s. a week from the pension, thus reducing it to 4s., and blind persons  are  informed that if they go into the institution the full amount will be paid. The hardship of the practice is this : If a blind person resides up country - say, 200 or 300 miles away from Sydney - it is unfair to expect him to go into the institution  in  the city, where he will be so far away from his friends. </para>

                        <para>- I feel sure that the Treasurer will be inclined to listen sympathetically to what I have to say on this matter. In New South Wales  a  practice the reverse of that followed in Victoria prevails. I quite agree that every blind person should be trained to do some work useful to the community. But while it is easy for a blind person living within easy distance of the institution to make use of it, it is quite otherwise with persons living 200 miles away. </para>

                        <para>- I had a case of the kind in hand to-day. I was endeavouring to get satisfaction in regard to  it.  This poor fellow is thirty-one years of age; he is unable to do anything, and has been a drag on his mother for years* The authorities tell her that he ought to go to an institution, but she knows that it would not be possible to maintain&#39; him there out of &#163;1 a week, and consequently she thinks that he is entitled  to  a full pension. I ask the Treasurer  to  look  into these cases, and give an instruction that where persons reside at some distance from an institution, they shall be paid the full amount of the pension. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not wish to delay the Committee, but I would like to refer to some of the observations which have been made by the ex-Treasurer, and to point out to him the reason why &#163;400,000 was asked for the Treasurer&#39;s Advance last time, and &#163;250,000 is asked this time. It is because works are going on of which Parliament has approved. The Treasurer&#39;s Advance has been almost wholly required to finance works and buildings authorized by Parliament and in course of erection. I am sorry to say that there is a very small balance available at present. On other occasions we nave had to grant large sums to the Treasurer&#39;s Advance for that very reason. I hope that there will be some means found by which these large sums may in future be otherwise provided. Works are going on; there is no vote of Parliament for the works, and therefore the money required has to come out of the Treasurer&#39;s Advance temporarily until we can get a grant. I find that in 1910-11, up |bo the 12th August, the Treasurer had &#163;600,000 for this purpose. Last year, certainly, the amount was not so much; up - to the 3rd August it was &#163;350,000 ; but I am told by the Treasury officials that there was the greatest difficulty in managing with the sum until a further advance could be obtained. This year wre are asking really for more than was asked for in 1910-11, namely, &#163;650,000 in all. My right honorable friend was very touchy. </para>

                        <para>- No. I find that &#163;702,000 less than the amount voted for the Fleet was unexpended, &#163;93,000 less on the military, &#163;39,000 less on the Navy, &#163;71,000 less on postal buildings, &#163;9,000 less on telegraphs and telephones, and &#163;25,000 less on lighthouse building - in fact, there was &#163;940,000 less expended than was voted. There were  underdrafts  to the amount of &#163;940,000, and an overdraft of &#163;81,000, so that &#163;859,000 voted by Parliament was unexpended last year. That sum has to be provided for this year. Although the year was a good one for my right honorable friend, still he must remember that his revenue was &#163;1,353,000 more than the revenue of the previous year, so that he had a very fortunate year. He had a large amount more than he estimated he would have, and spent a good deal less than he estimated he would spend. </para>

                        <para>- My right honorable friend said that I did not give him much credit - or, at any rate, that 1 was not as gentle as I could have been ; I stated the facts only. I would like to say a few words about the prospects of this year. It is too early to say much about the revenue, but I may mention that the revenue from Customs and Excise up to the 21st of this month has not been quite equal to that of the previous year. I do not take much notice of the figures for a small period like six weeks, and therefore it is too early to make an estimate. I think that so far as Customs and Excise revenue is concerned, we are about holding our own, and I hope that we will continue to do so. These are, I think, the only points which have been referred to. As regards the blind, I will have the matter looked into. I shall be glad if the honorable member for Hunter will write me a letter stating the facts. Perhaps I could get them from his speech, but it will be more convenient if he will write to me on the subject. </para>

                    <para>. - There are one or two points in the speeches of honorable members which I wish to reply to. First, the Leader of the Opposition asked whether the action we took in repealing the bounty and the Excise on sugar was taken with the knowledge of the responsible head of the Department. I may say that it was, although I want it to be distinctly understood that it is a Ministerial responsibility, and not that of the head of the Department. </para>

                        <para>- Nearly all. It has been charged against us that, as a consequence of that proclamation, repealing the Acts, there was loss of revenue to the Commonwealth. There will be no loss of revenue, and we intended that there should be none. We propose to take action which will secure the revenue which the country should get, and the instruction to which I have referred is evidence of that. On the 2nd August, we attempted to make an arrangement with the mill-owners which would enable the growers to get the full benefit of the repeal of the Excise at the earliest possible date. That arrangement could  not  be completed, and I gave verbal, and afterwards written, instructions for the preparation of a Bill several days before the honorable member for Yarra took action in this Chamber. I said, when the subject was brought up here, that before Parliament assembled an instruction had been telegraphed which was evidence that we intended to take legislative action to secure the Excise revenue to the country. </para>

                        <para>- That was the earliest date at which it could begin. We honoured the agreement to which I refer, and, on the Queensland Parliament passing legislation stipulated for, repealed the Commonwealth Acts. The Leader of the Opposition says now that, instead of repealing the Commonwealth Acts in accordance with the agreement that had been made, the proclamation should have been kept back until after the meeting of Parliament, and that then action should have been taken similar to that which we now intend to take. The position is , this: We have repealed the Excise and Bounty Acts, as agreed upon with the Queensland Government, and intend now to ask this Parliament to impose taxation which will secure the Excise Revenue, and at the same time give the benefit of 2s. 2d. a ton to the cane-growers up to the date of the repeal. The action that we have taken has been dictated by our regard for the welfare of the growers. So long as the Commonwealth Acts remained unrepealed, the growers were subject to the Tudor regulations, which increased their labour cost. </para>

                        <para>- No. When the Liberal party was in opposition, its members refrained from making the sugar industry the football of political parties, remembering its importance, and the value of the interests at stake; but the members of the Labour party are incapable of showing that consideration for it. The interjection of the right honorable member for Wide Bay was intended to convey the meaning that I object to the wages conditions. </para>

The Tudor regulations increased the cost of production borne by the growers. </para>

                        <para>- The Tudor regulations increased the cost of producing cane, and the growers naturally said, &#34; We think Parliament should make it possible for us to pay this increase in cost.&#34; They desired to receive the benefit of the difference between the amount of the bounty payable and of the Excise collected. The whole of the legislation enacted by this Parliament towards the close of last session was intended to achieve that end. It was intended to insure that the grower should receive an extra 2s. 2d. per ton for his cane. The position is perfectly clear. If, as the Leader of the Opposition has suggested, we had deferred action till some future date, the grower in the interim would have been denied the benefit of this additional 2s. 2d. per ton for his cane. </para>

                        <para>- They are getting it in Queensland, and in New South Wales too. If the honorable member for Wide Bay had been Prime Minister, he would have delayed proclaiming the Sugar Bounty Abolition Act and the Sugar Excise Repeal Act until a later date, and would then* have introduced legislation which would have produced the same result. We have given the grower the benefit of the additional 2s. 2d. per ton from the 25th July last, whereas my honorable friends would not have given them that advantage until a much later date. </para>

                        <para>- By proclaiming the repeal of the sugar bounty and Excise legislation, we have given relief to the cane-growers at the earliest possible moment. The suggestion has been made that we have been&#39; guilty of a want of straightforwardness because our intention to introduce legislation for the collection of Excise upon the sugar which was in bond when the Sugar Bounty Abolition Act and the Sugar Excise Repeal Act were proclaimed was not mentioned in our statement of Ministerial policy. There was no necessity to mention anything. We had taken public action. Everybody knew that we had repealed the two Statutes in question, and a notification to that effect had gone out to the mill-owners. Paragraphs had also been published in the press, so that there was no concealment whatever. Further, it is not usual to insert in a statement of Ministerial policy every detail relating to matters of administration. </para>

During the past three years, whilst my honorable friends have been in office, have they been administering an Act to exclude coloured labour from Australia ? </para>

                        <para>- Upon what is that Act based? Is it not upon an educational test? When I entered this Parliament I was called upon almost immediately to take part in an historic division, the question at issue being, &#34; Shall we exclude coloured labour from the Commonwealth by direct legislation, or shall we endeavour to achieve our object by means of an educational test?&#34; At that time it was pointed out by our leading constitutional advisers that if we adopted the method of direct exclusion we should offend the susceptibilities of other nations, and that, further, we should require Imperial assent to our legislation. There was an international aspect of the matter which we had to consider. My honorable friends opposite voted for direct exclusion, as did some honorable members on this side of the chamber. Honorable members opposite said that the education test could not be made effective. Has it been made effective ? If it be defective, why were they content for three years to administer a White Australia policy upon an educational test? Undoubtedly that test has proved a thoroughly effective method of securing the end which we had in view. In Queensland that test has been introduced into several Acts, and has proved effective. In the sugar legislation which was recently enacted in Queensland the Commonwealth method of prescribing this test has been adopted. The Leader of the Opposition stated that he was opposed to the sugar industry being handed over to Queensland. He said that he regretted that the industry has been divorced from Federal power. </para>

                    <para>.- Honorable members who have had the advantage of hearing the two speeches upon this subject which have been delivered by the Minister of Trade and Customs will admit that if I have failed to convince them that he has made a blunder, he himself has succeeded in convincing them of the blunder which he has committed. On Thursday last there appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> a statement by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company in reference to this matter, but it must be remembered that not one word as to the blunder which has been committed by the Government was published by any newspaper until after I had exposed it in this House. The 800 newspapers, which the Government boast of having behind them, and which are ready always to back up everything they do, and to find fault with anything we do, try to show that this mistake was made, not by the present Administration, but by the previous Government. The Minister of Trade and Customs went even a little further last week when he said that I knew that there was a mistake in our legislation. Since reading the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report of his speech, I have informed the Minister that I have never made any such statement. I have never said that I knew that our legislation dealing with the abolition of the bounty and Excise was defective. I made my attitude perfectly plain, not only when I first brought this question before the House, but in the course of a personal explanation that I made regarding a statement in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus.</inline></para>

                        <para>- I do not. What I da know is that, if it is possible now for the Minister to make an arrangement with the companies concerned, it was equally possible for him to fix up the matter before the proclamation was issued. The honorable member for Richmond knows very well that the Government could have arranged the whole matter before issuing their proclamation. The Minister himself has said that, on the evening on winch they intended to proclaim this legislation, the Department  practically  took stock of the quantity of Australian sugar in bond. Why was not this action taken a few days before ? The Minister&#39;s excuse is that it would have involved the sending of telegrams all over the Commonwealth. Is it not a fact that the Department has often to send telegrams to different parts of the Commonwealth in regard to departmental matters? </para>

                        <para>- I shall not be surprised if they make fifty-five blunders if they remain in office much longer. If the Government knew before they issued the proclamation what would be the effect of their action, and yet failed to take any steps to ascertain the quantity of Australian sugar in bond, then they were fooling with the finances of the country. The Minister has said that when the proclamation was being issued inquiries were made as to the quantities of Australian sugar in bond. On this point I should like to make a quotation from a report of the half-yearly meeting of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, which was held on the day after I brought this question before the House. According to this report, the <inline font-weight="bold">chairman, Mr. Kater,</inline> M.L.C., said - </para>

                    <para>You will have noticed in the papers a reference in the Federal Parliament to our company, in connexion with the repeal of the Excise duty on sugar, and I may as well take advantage of your presence here to tell you the facts. When we obtained a copy of the proclamation issued on this subject, it was evident to us that unless some further action was taken all the sugar produced this season before July 25th would be freed from duty, although the bounty was payable on the cane from which it was made, and the revenue would thus have to suffer. </para>

                <para class="block">It will be noticed that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kater</inline> makes no reference to last season&#39;s sugar, some of which was&#39; also held in bond. He refers only to this season&#39;s sugar. The Minister should lay upon the table a statement showing the actual quantity of Australian sugar in bond at the time. Some &#169;f the desired information is obtainable from the public press. The <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> every Wednesday gives the quantities in bond, whilst the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> about once a week publishes a statement showing the stocks in bond. When the papers are available it will be found that duty has not been paid on the whole of last season&#39;s sugar. Some of it was held in bond right up to the day of the issue of the proclamation, yet <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kater</inline> proposes only to deal with this season&#39;s sugar. </para>

                        <para>- The whole of the Australian sugar, raw or refined, that was in bond at the beginning of this season could reasonably have gone into consumption. Last season&#39;s crop was a very small one, and every ton of Australian sugar should have gone into consumption before the present season started. There was no need to pile the sugar up, as apparently it was being piled up. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that, but the Government could have said to the people who were holding the sugar that they would have to pay the Excise on every hundredweight or ton before the Act was repealed. That would have been a proper stand to take; and I believe it is the stand that would be taken to-day if the Government could &#34; put the clock back.&#34; I do not believe for a moment that the members of the Government, when they issued the proclamation, realized what they were doing. The Minister of Trade and Customs has said that the issue of the proclamation was purely a Ministerial act of policy, and not one for the officers of the Department to take. </para>

                        <para>- It is not a good record. There is absolutely nothing in the assertion that the legislation was defective. If it was so, and these honorable gentlemen knew it, then it was their bounden duty, as soon as Parliament met, to take steps to remedy the defect. They would have found every member of the House anxious to protect the revenue, because there are no parties in it when it comes to a matter of a fair, honest deal in protecting the revenue and in seeing that the taxpayers get their just dues. We know as to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, but I am anxious to know what legislation will be introduced to compel the four or five other companies I mentioned the other day to pay Excise on the sugar affected by the proclamation of the Sugar Excise Repeal Act. </para>

                        <para>- I am doubtful about one or two of them. I am anxious to see the legislation by which we can compel them to pay. If the Attorney-General had a general retainer for John Drysdale, I can imagine him arguing that the whole of the sugar had been freed by the proclamation of an Act of Parliament, and asking whether the Government could then come in and enforce payment of Excise on it. I believe the Attorney-General would have the best end of the stick in saying that the Government had deliberately forfeited this amount of revenue, and that there was no power to snake the companies pay up once the sugar went into consumption - because they could rightly say that all the sugar had gone into consumption. </para>

                        <para>- If one man came&#39; into the House to-day with the hope that we would get through the Supply Bill during the sitting, it was the Prime Minister, and I know he will agree to a bargain that we should adjourn as soon as the Bill goes through, so that it does not matter whether I have a few words to say on it or whether any other honorable member speaks. For instance, the honorable member for North Sydney spent some time denouncing some of the hardworking men of the country as &#34; beer  sparrers  spielers, whisperers, and  tick-tackers:&#39;  I would like to know what company the honorable member has been keeping to become acquainted with all these nice, expressions. But I am anxious to see this proposed legislation, because I know it will be difficult to prove that the sugar has not gone into consumption, if these persons say it has, at &#163;2 or &#163;3 less per ton than they would have charged if they had had to pay Excise. They would certainly have a good case in Court. </para>

                        <para>- As I said the other day, it does not affect the price of sugar one farthing to the retailer or the wholesaler. If there is one item in the Tariff which is kept right up to the amount of the protection, it is sugar, as has been proved time after time. No other monopoly takes such complete advantage of the Tariff. They keep the price at 5s. or 10s. a ton under that at which sugar can be landed in the Commonwealth. If German, Fiji, or Java sugar is landed at &#163;14 a ton, less the duty, their price will be &#163;19 10s. or &#163;19 15s. They boast about it; they advertise it right through the papers. Finally, dealing with this aspect, I repeat that I would like to see the legislation proposed to be introduced to ascertain how the Government intend to compel these people to pay once the sugar has been freed from paying Excise. I am sorry the member for Gippsland is not in the chamber, but I wish to point out to him the great amount set forth in the schedule for Contingencies. </para>

                        <para>- Members can see it. The Auditor-General will not pass any item under Contingencies unless he is assured as to how the money hasgone, and a voucher has to go in for every shilling that is spent. In the schedule before us, I find the following sums provided for Contingencies: - Treasurer,  &#163;7,980;  Attorney-General,  &#163;5,095;  External Affairs,  &#163;14,927;  Defence,  &#163;45,880;  Customs,  &#163;6,270;  Home Affairs,  &#163;5,975;  Postmaster General,  &#163;92,100.  Thus, eliminating the Prime Minister&#39;s Department, the Auditor-General, the Public Service Commissioner, and the Houses of Parliament, the items under Contingencies amount to  &#163;170,000  for one month only. But the honorable member for Gippsland is reported to have said - </para>

                        <para>- I do not know that I have much to add to what I said&#39; before the adjournment on the. subject of the blunder made by the Government in connexion with the sugar Excise. If any of the sugar refining companies are paying Excise into the revenue at the present time, it proves that the Government made a mistake, and forfeited revenue to which they were honestly entitled. It is a most unusual course for the Colonial Sugar Refining Company to propose to make payments to the revenue because the Government were so neglectful of their duty as to permit them to retain Excise which they should have paid. We know that people occasionally send a few shillings or a pound or two to the Customs, Post and Telegraph, and Railway Departments as conscience money, but I think that no one has ever heard so far of conscience payments amounting to  &#163;100,000  or  &#163;200,000.  I am anxious to see the legislation by which the Government propose to get this amount back. </para>

If they succeed, it will be proved that by their own act theydeliberately forfeited revenue which they had a right to collect, and if they do not succeed it will prove that they are unable to collect money which rightly belongs to the Commonwealth, and which might have been recovered if the Government had exercised proper caution. </para>

If the moneys forfeited represented Excise on whisky or tobacco, and&#39; the Minister of Trade and Customs came down with a Bill to repeal that Excise duty after the excisable articles had gone into consumption, I should like to hear some of the lawyers on the other side express their opinion of such a proposal.

                        <para>- No; telephone construe- &#62; tion is provided for in an entirely different way. This is a vote for contingencies for the Department for one month. The honorable member for Gippsland, when we come to consider the Budget and the Estimates, will find that a vote of nearly &#163;200,000 is required for departmental contingencies for one month, and he will easily learn from that how the millions with which he tried to mislead his constituents are accounted for. But every member of the Ministry is able to inform the honorable member that Ministers must produce vouchers for every penny expended under the contingency votes. Though he may have believed that there was no adequate return for money so spent, the Auditor-General must be provided with vouchers covering every penny of it. The honorable member said that he quoted figures given by the Prime Minister, and that had not been contradicted. As the Attorney-General admitted to-night, members frequently object to votes for contingencies appearing on the Estimates and in Supply Bills, because it is not evident where the money goes to. These votes are set out at greater length in the Estimates, but it is impossible, even on the Estimates, to give complete particulars of the expenditure. I direct the honorable member&#39;s attention to the matter to-night in order that he may go back to his constituents aud tell them that when he said that the Fisher Government had spent this money without furnishing any return for it, he said something which he now discovers to be absolutely incorrect. </para>

                        <para>- No, it was not. They would scarcely make that mistake, any more than they would be likely to attribute a speech made by the honorable member for Wentworth to me. The honorable member for Gippsland must be very young if he thinks that because there is no reporter present at a meeting there will be no report of the proceedings published. The honorable member has no idea of the amount of imagination which these newspaper men possess in getting up the reports of meetings, particularly those which happen to be favorable to their own candidates. </para>

As to his statement that charges made were not contradicted, I would remind him that they may have been contradicted a dozen times, but that the press which backs up honorable members opposite will not give honorable members on this side the fair play which they accord to the Ministerial party. </para>

                    <para>. - After listening to my honorable friend, the member for North Sydney, who addressed the House in a state of spiritual hilarity, I must say that I thought he must have believed himself to be at the Modder River in command of a brigade charging Cronje. I could not have imagined that my honorable friend would, in such a state of excitement, stand up for the squatters - those very squatters who not long ago elected a Labour man, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hall,</inline> in preference to him. During the time when I was stumping the country at the last election, numbers of Fusionists said, &#34; Those Labour men have robbed Australia.&#34; One lady declared that King O&#39;Malley made all his wealth out of the Home Affairs Department. Charges of that kind have been repeated often since then. When I entered the Home Affairs Department as Minister, I was advised to search the files, and find out what I could about my predecessor, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fuller.</inline> I said, &#34; No ; I have been in the House with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fuller</inline> since the opening of the Federal Parliament, and I know him to be an honorable gentleman. I have not come into this Department to be a Pinkerton detective ; I have come here to make reforms, to turn the Home Affairs Depart ment inside out, to put it on a business basis.&#34; Now, I am going to make a challenge to my honorable friends opposite. I will ask the Prime Minister to pick a man on his own side, to inquire into this subject. I will pick the honorable member for Henty. I might pick the Postmaster-General, but he is an old friend of mine, and I want this matter to be made dead sure. Let the honorable member for Henty and an honorable member chosen by the Prime Minister pick a third man - a banker - as arbitrator, and I will give &#163;100 to any institution that may be named, if these men, after inquiry, find that the Home Affairs Department, when I left it, was not on a business footing of efficiency equal to that of any Department in Australia. I will undertake to go down to the Department and point out the reforms which I carried out. I do not want a man on my side to be chosen. I am quite content that the inquiry shall be made by honorable members opposite. I am not much of a politician. I am a business man, and that is why I have been a success in Australia. </para>

                <para class="block">Let us consider the question for a moment without any ill-feeling. We are all trustees for the people. The House is a great national corporation : we have been elected directors, and are getting on very badly as business men. Now, to start with, is it fair and honest that a number of employes on a station where we want absolute secrecy in the ballot, should feel that their very existence depends upon whether they vote as the station-owner likes ? I am opposed to the employment of partisans. I am a partisan. I would not wish to be the judge of any of my honorable friends opposite, nor of many of my own friends on this side. I think that a manager or a presiding officer ought to be like a British Judge - fair and impartial. My opposition is to partisanship, not because I am not. a partisan. Why, the House handed over to the High Court the testing of a charge against a member. It would not leave him even to his own brethren. The next thing is that the Electoral Department will not even let men count the votes at small places. The boxes are sent in to the big places so as to make sure that there will be no victims. </para>

I claim that there  is  not  a man in the  House  who  is  net  above reproach. We have different ideas of business, but that does not say that we are not all honest. I am very sorry that the Americans have got  a  bad name through men making charges in the House. These charges flew all over the  world, and  we  could  not contradict them. </para>

                    <para>.- The ex-Prime Minister has&#39; stated that Australians are an honest people, and I was therefore glad to hear the honorable member for Darwin explain that no . reflection was intended to be cast on station managers and overseers by the electoral instructions which he issued, and to which reference has been made during this debate. The use of station homesteads for polling places is unavoidable in many country districts. Were they not so used, many bush workers would be unable to record their votes. The ordinary landowner, large or small, or station manager, does not desire to act as a Returning Officer, or in any other electoral capacity. For more than twenty years the office  at  the station homestead where I reside has been used as a polling booth, :md only once has any one connected with <inline font-style="italic">i</inline> he  station acted as a poll clerk ; on that occasion the bookkeeper so acted. It has been our custom to put  Up  the Returning  Officer and  his poll clerk, and to give  1  hem every facility for the carrying out f their duties, although we have known  &#60; hat  a great many votes are recorded for  I  he other side. I protest against the gibes :&#39;nd jeers of Labour members against the squatters. &#34; Time and chance happeneth to all men.&#34; We are not all born squatters. Some of the station managers in :ny_ district  were  shearers only a few years  igo,  and squatters were selectors. Many of  I  he squatters  in  Australia have risen from (.he ranks, and, as a class,  the  landowners are as honorable as any in Australia. It would not be true to say, as the ex-Prime Minister has said, that Australians are an honest people if the  Australian  station-owners, managers, and overseers were not honest - they are so large and influential a body. If those of us on this side who own land were to attack Labour members as we have been attacked, charging them with living on the game, with being union secretaries, and the like, they would bitterly resent it. We do not make these charges, however, and I do not think that they should be made in an assembly purporting to be the House of the National Parliament of Australia. Pastoralists are essential to the welfare of the country, and are doing good work in outlying districts, where many of the men who live on Labour politics would not go. Having listened to the sugar discussion, I hope that we shall have . no more of it, and. as a new comer, I trust that no more will be said against the land-owners of Australia. </para>

One might fancy from the remarks of the honorable member for Riverina that the squatters are the most maligned persons on the face of the earth, and that they are all pure merinoes who could not do wrong if they tried. The rottenest class that was ever in Australia is the. squatter class in Queensland to-day. At the last elections some of them refused to allow polling booths to be erected on station property, and would not permit their permanent employes to have anything to do with the conduct of elections by acting as poll clerks or the like. </para>

                        <para>- They are the puppets of the squatters. They put me in mind of a lot of the swagmen who, while they are on the creek, are Democrats, but when they become boundary riders getting &#163;1 a week are masters&#39; men, and ask &#34;How do you want me to vote, sir?&#34; The last election was the first occasion in the history of Australia on which rent was charged for offices on stations in the Maranoa division used as polling booths. From Aramac to Stainburn Downs, and out on Clare Station, no one could be got to act as poll clerk or presiding officer at the stations. A man was sent out in a motor car to erect a tent on the public road near Stainburn Downs and Clare Stations, for the purposes of polling booths. The station property used to belong to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fairbairn.</inline> At that time things were different, but the place has since &#34;been sold to a gentleman who has been away in the Old Country. While He was away the Australian Workers&#39; Union came into existence. He was like Rip Van Winkle, having been asleep while this change was taking place, and said that if any man dared to leave his shearing-shed on election day he would be handed his cheque. On the Saturday morning the bell rang, but no one answered it. It was some miles from the shed to the main road where the polling booth was, and those who had not horses were given mounts by others, so that all day there was a continual cavalcade passing to and fro. The stationowner found that if he dismissed his men he would not get his wool off, and wool being the price that it is now, the first thing that those of us who own sheep wish to do is to get their wool off and take it to market. </para>

                        <para>- As a matter of fact, I do not own a station or a sheep. But I know a bit about sheep. The honorable member for Riverina made a great joke the other night of the  President  of the Arbitration Court, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins, having referred to &#34;adult&#34; sheep. He called the &#34; stag &#34; an adult sheep. Well, for the honorable member&#39;s information, I may say that that was what the pastoralists used to feed the fools upon before they banded themselves into an organization. But they do not feed the fools on it today. The shearers have the best wethers on the station. I can quite understand the honorable member for Riverina saying that he fed &#34; fools &#34; upon the adult sheep. But we are no longer fools - we are members of one of the grandest and best organizations in Australia. Thanks to the industrial body to which I am proud to belong, those times have passed. Were it not for the Australian Workers Union, I would not be here to-day. I have nothing for which to thank the squatters. They do their level best against me, and, to be frank, I do my level best against them. If I can settle them politically, I do it. But there is one thing of which they cannot accuse me, namely, of exhibiting party bias as their representative. I come now to another subject - that of telephone construction in Western Queensland. Successive Governments, irrespective of whether they have been Liberal, Fusion, Tory, Protectionist, or Labour, have told us that they were going to offer greater postal and telephonic facilities to residents in remote rural areas. My experience is that they have done just the opposite. They have saddled men with guarantees which they knew very well they could not pay. To me it was amusing to listen the other day to the honorable member for Kalgoorlie relating what he had done for country districts when he occupied the position of Postmaster-General. As the representative of a country district, I have to thank him for nothing. During the debate upon the censure motion, almost every honorable member opposite has prided himself upon representing a rural constituency. As far as Queensland is concerned my honorable friends do not represent the country electorates. These are represented by Labour men. I have been talking of the necessity for granting greater telephonic facilities in our outback areas ever since the inception of Federation, and I have no hesitation in saying that country representatives have  not had a square deal in this matter. If the Government are sincere in the statements which are contained in their manifesto, the least they can do is to erect those telephone lines upon which the people of Western Queensland are willing to guarantee the Department against loss. There is one matter in particular to which I desire to direct the attention of the Postmaster-General in the hope that he, will look into it. It is the necessity for erecting a line midway between Charleville and Augathella, a distance of 27 miles. There is already a main trunk line running across the continent through Charleville and connecting the outside districts. When the coastal lines break down it is used to send messages through from Charters Towers to Sydney. The people there have offered to guarantee the Department against loss upon the proposed additional line. After corresponding for two or three years with the Department, and after having thousands of interviews with the  Deputy  Postmaster-General and with the Secretary to the Postal Department, I was assured that if I could get the necessary guarantee the line would be built. I got the guarantee, and then, after all these years of tribulation and trial, the officers had the audacity to tell me that the main trunk line, which carries only one wire, was not in a position to carry another wire for a distance of only 27 miles. I told the  Deputy  Postmaster-General that if the Department had allowed the main trunk line to get into such a state it certainly was not fit to be used for the purpose for which it was being used. The reply I received was that, if another wire were attached to it, it might assist in breaking down the first wire by inducing galahs to rest upon it. </para>

                <para class="block">I had another experience which I might as well relate, because it shows that although we are a Federation in name we are not a Federation in reality. &#34;Upon the border of New South Wales and Queensland there is a town called Mungindi. It is situated in the electorate of Gwydir. Prior to the consummation of Federation there were two post offices there, one on the Queensland and the other on the New South Wales side of the border. That on the Queensland side has since been done away with, but the office on the New South Wales side of the border still remains, and is to-day a terminal station for the electric wire. The people made a request that telephone communication should be established between there and Thallon, a town 27 miles distant, to which a railway is built along the southern borders of Queensland. The Department in Queensland was quite willing to do its share, but the New South Wales branch would not agree to place an instrument in the office a short distance over the border, merely because the revenue would not be credited to the Department in that State. </para>

                        <para>- I did, with the result that he brought about the construction of the line. If he had not repeatedly interviewed the  Deputy  Postmaster-General in Sydney I should not have got it to this day. This shows that we have a Federation in name, but not in fact. Why should the Department pay any consideration to the imaginary boundaries between State and State ? Then, again, there are many stations oh the border of Queensland and New South Wales which desire to be coupled up by means of the telephone wire; but because the route runs now in Nev/ South Wales and then in Queensland, as the river flows, the Department will not do the work. It is thus missing a good chance to secure revenue. The Postmaster-General&#39;s De- partment ought to take action to remedy this state of affairs. As it is, it calls for reports from the responsible officers in the two States, and these are so conflicting that the work is allowed to slide, with the result that the people cannot obtain the conveniences they desire. So far as mail services out-back in Western Queensland are concerned, up to the present time we have been doing very well, but when I tell honorable members how satisfied are a lot of the men who go into the out-back portions of Queensland, when they get a mail once a fortnight, and in some instances only once a month, they will recognise that something more should be done for them. These men have many trials and tribulations, not only in times of flood, which are comparatively rare, but in times of drought. They have had to wait as long as four and five months for their mails. Representatives of the more favoured electorates - more especially those who represent our big cities - ought surely to be prepared to give some consideration to those who are out-back making history. I hope that the Postmaster-General will think seriously and deeply of doing something for the people in the back-blocks of Queensland, and, in fact, of all the States. These people are not supplicating for something for nothing. They are quite prepared to pay. Not one of the telephone lines that I have obtained for my constituents in the vast electorate of Maranoa has failed to pay. Surely that is ample proof that still better facilities should be afforded. If, in the early days, the Queensland Government had done what successive Governments of the Commonwealth have been doing since the inception of Federation in regard to the extension of telegraph lines into far Western Queensland - if it had refused to erect a line because it would not pay - the country would still be undeveloped. There is in far Western Queensland country which is being taken up for the grazing of sheep and cattle, and as soon as it is stocked thousands of men, women, and children will be settling there. The railways, too, are stretching out west, and in time we shall have no out-back country at all, except in the Northern Territory. I ask the Postmaster-General to give consideration to these matters, and to ascertain whether better and easier methods of telephone communication cannot be given to the people, not only in the far western dis tricts of Queensland, but in the whole of the sparsely populated areas of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so; but the work could be done more expeditiously, as well as under better conditions, than at present. While the honorable member for Kalgoorlie was speaking a few days ago on the question of the appointment of a Board of Commissioners to control the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department, I interjected that I would not vote for placing the Department under a Commission. I am not prepared to vote for such a Commission, because this is the one Department of the Commonwealth which can help the people in the bush. All our other Departments exist to obtain revenue, to administer punitive legislation, or to deal with kindred matters. The one Department of the Commonwealth which can give facilities to those who go into the backblocks of Australia is that of the Postmaster-General. The great mistake hitherto made in administering this Department is that, in considering extensions, we have been guided too largely by the state of the departmental balance-sheet. Such a question should never be considered when we are dealing with the extension of postal, telegraphic, and telephonic facilities to the people. The whole guarantee system is wrong. From one end of Australia to the other the one desire is expressed, by means of press and platform, that people should be encouraged to settle in the outlying parts of the country. </para>

Unless we extend more conveniences and facilities to the country districts we shall have fewer people remaining there.

                        <para>- And others are cut off entirely from any telephonic communication. Telephonic and postal facilities should not be measured by the balance-sheet of a commercial ledger, any more than should the extension of an educational system or the Judiciary. Wherever it is necessary, schools are established in order that the rising generation may get the benefit of education. What would be said of a Government who would consider whether or not a school would pay? I regard the telephone as as much an adjunct of present day civilization as education. Valuable lives may be saved or lost owing to the presence or absence of such communication; not only may a doctor be summoned immediately, but, in case of any sudden change of temperature in a patient, he is able, without leaving his house, to give invaluable directions. The telephone should no more be regarded from the point of view of a balance-sheet than should the provision of a school, a policeman, or a magistrate. I am pleased to observe from remarks by country members on both sides that they intend, if possible, to insist, for the first time in the history of Federation, that the Post Office shall be made what it ought to be - a means of benefiting the people - and that it shall not be regulated by the balance-sheet of the Departmental officers- </para>

                        <para>- If my vote will defeat that proposal, it will be defeated, I promise the honorable member. I suggest to the Postmaster-General that, instead of placing the Post Office still further under officialdom, he should take his courage in both his hands, and shake the Department free of that very officialdom which has proved so detrimental in the past. If the Deputies in the various States were made responsible to a much greater extent than at present, we should have better work and service. In my opinion, no greater mistake could be made - and it is just as well to clear the decks now - than to place the Post Office of the Commonwealth under Commissioners. This would mean for country districts, not greater, but fewer facilities. In the large centres of population we know that anything done by the Post Office will pay; but if Commissioners were placed in charge they would be tempted, just as all other Commissioners are, to make the service pay, so as to be able to present to Parliament as good a balanceas possible. The real reform lies in striking out in an entirely different direction; and the Postmaster-General ought to come to this House with a progressive policy for extending telephonic communication all over Australia. Such a policy would, I believe, secure support from both sides of this chamber. Those of us who have been battling in that direction for years hope that at last there is a Postmaster- General who sees eye to eye with us, and who is ready to make his name by giving to the people of Australia those means of communication they have not been able to obtain in the past. At present, people who go out into the bush, and who live hard and work hard, are called upon to provide a guarantee when they apply for the telephone. At first, when they make their desires known, possibly through their representative, the stereotyped reply, which we know so well, is received that the inspector will report; and he does so to the effect that he regrets he does not think the business obtainable would warrant the construction of a line without a guarantee. And it is the very poorest classof the community upon whom this call is made. We hear about the low wages received by workers, but I believe that the men who get the smallest remuneration for their labour for some years after they make a start on the land are those who go out into the bush. The cursed conservative policy of the Department, under both Liberal and Labour Governments, has been to compel the very class who, above all others, can ill-afford it to guarantee money before they are given a necessary adjunct of civilization. The Post Office should be used for the benefit and convenience of the people, and not as a revenue-producing machine ; and no greater mistake could be made than to remove it from the operation of the policy of the Government, and place it under the castiron rule of Commissioners. </para>

And it is a policy I believe of which the country is in favour. If we are short of revenue there is an item of half-a-million for a post-office in Sydney. Defer that expenditure for a few years and spend the money on postal facilities in country districts, and we shall be doing good work. </para>

One who goes round the country saying that the. workers are &#34; beer sparrors and wasters&#34; should be the last to interject. The honorable member had nothing to say when the wine drinking took place at the Savoy a little while ago. It is by piecemeal statements from honorable members on the Government side that we get some idea of their policy. We find the honorable member for Grampians enunciating the policy of the Government in regard to electoral reform. He tells us that the basis of voting should be the ratepayers&#39; roll, but I wonder will he be prepared to go further when the matter comes on at a later period. I regret that the honorable member for North Sydney should have made the statements he made this afternoon. It is not the first time. A session or two ago he referred to the workers in the Australian Workers Union as &#34; bounders &#34; and &#34; wasters.&#34; </para>

                    <para>- No other deduction could be drawn from the honorable member&#39;s remarks. The honorable member for Riverina has told us what good fellows the squatters are and what good they have done for the country. I say unhesitatingly that in Queensland, as the honorable member for Maranoa has pointed out, before the Australian Workers Union came into existence, the squatters tried to house men worse than swine are housed in some parts of the world. It was the conditions that prevailed then that brought about the trouble that occurred in the early nineties, and so I commend the member for Darwin for the action he took as Minister of Home Affairs in relation to returning officers on pastoral stations. I have represented a squatting constituency for over twenty years, and I have known the time when men were discharged and had to wander hundreds of miles for employment because it was ascertained that the proper proportion of hands did not vote to suit the management. I have seen this also on the mining fields. Two hundred men were discharged at Charters Towers in the same way. I have no personal grudge against the squatters - though they fight me as bitterly as they can, I have received a great deal of courtesy at their hands - but the condition of the men working in the industry at one time was such that it was a disgrace to those who had the management of affairs at the time. However, the old squatter is practically gone. The great pastoral concerns are owned by big joint-stock companies, find the old squatter is a thing of the past. I commend the honorable member for Darwin for bringing about the regulation dealing with returning officers on pastoral stations. The sugar Excise business is a matter the Government seem to have tried to gloss over. The Minister made a stupid blunder in throwing about &#163;128,000 into the coffers of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. A few days ago Ministers came down and told us that they did not know how much sugar was in bond at the time the proclamation was made relieving the industry of the liability to pay Excise duty, and that the proclamation was issued without making any personal inquiry, and now they claim that they had full knowledge. It was not until the last moment, when they were pressed upon the point, that we could get any information. Why was it covered up? Was there anything shady about it that it was necessary to cover the matter up as the Government did for some little time ? They practically placed &#163;128,000 in the coffers of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and now they tell us that the company is an honorable one. Was it an honorable company when it was fighting this Parliament, when it did everything  possible  for it to do to try to frustrate any attempt we made to get evidence from it? Under the present constitutional limitations we have, it used the full force of its powers to prevent certain information being dragged from it, and as soon as the referenda were defeated we found it paying a bonus of &#163;250,000 to its shareholders, and increasing and watering its stock by a million pounds sterling. </para>

Its annual dividend of 10 per cent, represents a sum of &#163;98,000; and it is clear that nearly two years&#39; dividends have been handed to the company as the result of the action of the Government. Whether the blunder arose through the ignorance of the Minister of Trade and Customs or not I do not know; but&#34; the fact remains that, as the result of their stupid action, the Government have lost &#163;128,000. </para>

                        <para>- Unfortunately, we are in this position : The Government said, only the other day, that they did not know how much sugar was in bond at the time the proclamation was issued; and to-day they tell us that there was 32,000 tons in bond. Several days after our inquiries were made, we get this information; and we do not know what consultations were held to enable the Government to fix up the statement on the matter to be made by the Minister of Trade and Customs. We do know, however, that at least &#163;128,000 has been put into the pockets of the shareholders of this company. Previous to the granting of the last bonus to which I have referred the same company, not very long ago, declared a bonus of &#163;250,000, and a few days later put up the price of sugar &#163;2 per ton. This meant that in a few weeks they recovered the bonus of &#163;250,000 from&#34; the pockets of the people. This is the sort of company which our friends opposite seem to be desirous of supporting. I do not, after all, know why I, personally, should growl at the Government in connexion with this matter. They are practically in the hands of these people, and have to do what they are told in this respect. </para>

The present Government owe their position to the fact that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and other financial companies, are practically behind them. Had it not been for the assistance given them by financial institutions and monopolies in this country, I do not hesitate to say that honorable members opposite would not be where they are. </para>

                        <para>- All I can say is that the Premier of Queensland is, with another prominent member of the Liberal party there, a trustee of a secret fund, from which amounts are doled out as required by the Liberal League. The Treasurer has come down with a second Supply Bill; and the honorable member for Gippsland has, no doubt, had his eyes opened as to the way in which things are done here, and knows how far he was correct in saying that the late Government locked the doors in order to keep the Auditor-General out. There are some things which I should like to learn from the Treasurer. First of all, I want to know what he has done to curtail the power of the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank. The honorable gentleman said that this officer&#39;s power should be curtailed to a very large extent. I want to know what he is doing in that respect. </para>

I may be allowed to say that I do not think the honorable member for Darling Downs is a very important man in the Cabinet at the present time.

                        <para>- Yes, I believe he has been. As a matter of fact, he has been prepared to go with any Government that came along, and was not particular as to what the brand of the Government might be. He fluttered around the late leader of his party to an extent that has been unparalleled in this House, and he will do the same with the honorable member for Parramatta. We are about full up of the sneering and insulting remarks addressed to this side by honorable members opposite, and they should be informed that we intend to defend ourselves on every occasion. Insults have been hurled at this side of which honorable members on the other side, and particularly the Prime Minister, ought to be ashamed. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for Riverina has, to-night, treated the House to some rather beautiful sentimental expressions already referred to by the honorable member for Kennedy. I wish also to enter my protest against the advice he has given us. Let the honorable member set an example himself, and induce his friends to follow him. The particular occasion which gave rise to his remarks was the speech by the honorable member for North Sydney, who, this afternoon, when complaining of the ex-Minister of Home Affairs, referred to supporters of this side as tugs, toughs, tick-tackers, and such characters. The honorable member for Riverina is quite right in suggesting that these gibes, sneers, and reflections on honour and honesty are oat of place in a Parliament like this. There are some of us on this side of the House who deprecate them as much as he does, and we shall be very glad, indeed, to join a Coalition to stop that kind of thing, whether it comes from the one side or the other. But as long as mud is thrown there is always danger of some being thrown back. Folk who live in glass houses should not throw stones. </para>

                        <para>- If the Prime Minister cannot have fifteen minutes in the form of a speech, he generally manages to get in a great deal while others are speaking. I do not know of any other honorable member who is so prolific in interjections as he is. My remarks apply as much to him as to any member on his own side, because the attacks made by the Prime Minister during the recent contest, especially in regard to finance, were altogether outrageous. Speech after speech, as recorded, resounded with nothing else than abuse, and abuse, and abuse, of the Labour party and all its ways. There was nothing that Andrew Fisher did that was right. There was nothing that the Labour party had done that was right. There was nothing that any Labour member had done that was right. There was nothing done by any Labour party in any part of the world that was right, according to the Prime Minister. In regard to our financial administration, in particular, he was abusive. Fortunately, the intelligent portion of the community estimate that kind of political warfare at its true value, and I was delighted to know that upon his visit to Brisbane he simply disgusted the electors there by the abuse which he heaped, during the whole course of hit speech, upon the Labour party and its leaders. </para>

                        <para>- I can bring up this matter later on. I was merely referring to points that had already been alluded to by the Treasurer. I am particularly anxious to refer to one matter, wherein he pointed out that the surplus of the ex-Treasurer was so large because lie did not spend money. He stated that about &#163;940,000 was unexpended. I wish to point out that throughout the criticism levelled at the finance of the Labour Administration, the whole complaint of the Ministerial party during the last Parliament was that we did not spend enough money. But their complaint when they got outside was that we spent too much. In Parliament they asked why we did not spend a million on the Federal Capital, and why we did not push on more speedily with the Port Augusta railway? </para>

                        <para>- The Prime Minister and the Treasurer never lost an opportunity to say these things. They spoke with one voice in Parliament about Labour finance, and with a different voice when they got before the people. If the Treasurer is correct in saying that there is an unexpended balance of &#163;940,000 in the Treasury, what becomes of their argument in regard to extravagance ? The complaint to-day is that we did not spend enough, whereas outside they told the people that we spent too much. It seems as if it is almost impossible to please these honorable members. There are one or two other matters to which I wish to refer. One is the question of reciprocal trade between Australia and New Zealand and Australia and Canada. That is a subject of the utmost importance to this country. The ex-Minister of Trade and Customs was in negotiation, as we all know, with the Canadian Minister of Customs, who visited Australia in the early part of this year. The negotiations fell through. I do not know whether that was caused by the result of the elections. At any rate, it seemed as if the ex-Minister of Trade and Customs was unable to negotiate without authority, and a new Minister of Trade and Customs had not yet been chosen. I wish to call attention to a statement which has been made on the subject, and which, in my opinion, is neither overstated nor extravagant. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Arthur</inline> Kidman, one of the squatter friends of honorable members opposite, by the way, has declared - </para>

                    <para>That there is the greatest possible demand in Canada for Australian products, but under present arrangements such trade is going entirely to New Zealand. If Australia does not decide to establish reciprocity and a steamer service she will give New Zealand a gift of ^500,000 worth of trade in foodstuffs alone. Something ought to be done immediately with the New  South  Wales and the Commonwealth Governments. The time is propitious. </para>

                <para class="block">I have already invited the attention of the Minister of Trade and Customs to this very important matter, and should like to know what is being done in regard to it? The weeks and the months are going by. There are business firms in Queensland, and New South Wales particularly, as also to some extent in Victoria, who have spent a good deal of money in building up a very satisfactory and growing trade with Canada in certain lines of Australian produce. We can ill afford to lose that trade. Unfortunately, however, through the lack of reciprocal arrangements with Canada and New Zealand, we are practically out of it at present. There are now sufficient motives to encourage the Minister of Trade and Customs to persevere ; and I hope that before long he will be able to give us a satisfactory statement informing us that negotiations have been resumed, and that we are likely to enter into a treaty at an early date. There is another matter to which I wish to invite the attention of the Minister. A few months ago the Dominions Royal Commission visited Australia, and the ex-Prime Minister made an offer of &#163;500 to its  chairman  to secure the visit of. a representative of the British Cotton-growers&#39; Association in order to advise as to the establishment of the cotton industry here, but up to now nothing further has been heard of the matter. I do not know if the Minister is prepared to give us any information. </para>

                        <para>- I will come to that point. There is a belt of country stretching across the greater part of north Australia, including not only Queensland, but the Northern Territory and Western Australia, where there is land of exceptional quality for cotton culture. The cotton which has already been, grown in northern Australia, and particularly in the district represented by the honorable member for Capricornia, has. been tested and proved to be equal to that grown in any part of the world, and in many cases superior. A sum of &#163;500 was offered to the  Chairman  of the Dominions Royal Commission to bring an expert here to advise the Government as to the cotton industry. </para>

He replied, after the lapse of some days, that he had opened up negotiations with the  chairman,  and &#163;500 had been offered to secure the visit of a representative of the British Cotton - growers&#39; Association. This is a matter of great importance to Australia. The honorable member for Echuca has asked whether cotton can be grown under Australian labour conditions.

                        <para>- Cotton will grow on inferior land, but we have vast tracts of country eminently suitable for cotton culture. I ask the Prime Minister or the Minister of Trade and Customs if this matter comes before his notice to follow it up, so that we may get the earliest possible advice and information, and see if something cannot be done to establish the cotton industry in Australia on a reasonable basis. I want to refer to one or two other matters, otherwise I would devote more time to a statement of facts regarding the cotton industry. I wish to call attention to two matters in connexion with naval affairs in Queensland. One of the old Queensland fleet, H.M.A.S. <inline font-style="italic">Gayundah,</inline> is used for training purposes. I have to complain that the boat has been ordered to go from Brisbane to Sydney in order to be docked for her annual overhaul. Why should it be necessary to go to the expense and delay of taking the ship to Sydney, when at Brisbane there are a Government dock and also private slips where the work could be done as expeditiously and as economically as at Sydney? I object to this idea of centralizing and getting work done in a particular place which could be done just as easily in another place. There are plenty of men going about Brisbane today in want of employment, whose services could be secured for the overhaul of this boat. At Brisbane we have the expert ability and accommodation, and could do the work well. No satisfactory reason has ever been adduced to me for incurring the expense of sending the boat to Sydney. Next, I want to complain about the boat itself. She is used now for the annual training of naval men, but she is absolutely unsuitable for the service. I have here three foolscap pages of complaints in regard to her unsuitability. </para>

                        <para>- No, but if the honorable member would do me the honour to peruse these pages, and learn the conditions under which men have to carry on their training, he would agree with me, I am sure, that it is time we had a better boat. The Minister of Defence should make inquiries as to the suitability of the ship. We are trying our best to encourage naval training amongst the Australian youth, but we cannot secure the best results unless we offer reasonable conditions for the purpose. I suggest that the Minister of Defence should get a boat from the Imperial Government. I think that he could easily get a boat of the P class - the <inline font-style="italic">Pyramus</inline> or the <inline font-style="italic">Psyche</inline> - and there would be no difficulty in getting her fitted up to carry on the training work. The present ship is small and entirely unsuitable. If the Minister or his representative here wishes to see these pages of complaints, and will respect the confidence of the writer, I shall be very pleased to afford him an opportunity. At the end of last session I asked the Minister of Defence to favour me with a return showing the results of the efforts made to secure the use of State school grounds throughout Australia&#39; for training the cadets. I feel sure that every honorable member must have been dissatisfied and to some extent disgusted, that the cadets should have to train on the streets and vacant pieces of land. In some cases the cadets have actually got into danger, and some lads have died as the result of the injuries they received while drilling on the public roads. That, it seems to me, is entirely unnecessary, because in every town in Australia there are, iu connexion with the public schools, reserves belonging to, and kept up by, the public, and I see no reason why these areas should not be available for drilling purposes. The return I got disclosed a remarkable state of affairs. In New South Wales, there are twenty-nine grounds now in use, while one has been withdrawn. In Victoria, there are three in use, and one has been withdrawn; in South Australia, there are two in use, and three have been withdrawn ; in Western Australia, there are two in use, but none have been withdrawn; in Tasmania, there are none in use, but one has been withdrawn; and, iii Queensland, there are four in use, and two have been withdrawn. Altogether, there are forty-one school grounds in use throughout Australia, and nine have been withdrawn, making fifty that have been in use. The reasons for the withdrawal of the grounds are given, and all assign misconduct. In some cases statements most uncomplimentary to young Australia are made. Personally, I think that the average Australian boy behaves himself as well as any boy in any other part of the world, and had sympathetic consideration been shown to the boys, there would have been no need to withdraw any of the school grounds from use. In some instances - I am not speaking without the book - political influence has been at work, grounds being withdrawn because the authorities did not wish to assist the late Government in carrying out its defence policy. If this Government can secure grounds from its friends on the school committees, I hope that it will do so. Boys should not be asked to drill in the streets, or be thrown on the kindness of some one who is willing to lend a paddock as a drill ground. I wish now to make some reference to the sugar question. Of all the statements made in connexion with it, none was more damaging to the Government than that of the Minister of Trade and Customs this afternoon. It is unfortunate for us that Ministers decline to lay papers and reports upon the table until the censure amendment has been dealt with. Some papers have been laid upon the table, but Ministers will not produce those which would help us in discussing the matter that is now before us. I should like an opportunity to read the correspondence which passed between this Government and the Queensland Government regarding the sugar legislation. It has been reported in the press that there was such correspondence, but we are in the dark concerning it. Last week, the Minister of Trade and Customs said that he had taken action regarding the repeal of the Bounty and Excise Acts just before Parliament met, and to-night it slipped out that on the day before the repealing proclamation was issued, inquiry was made as to the quantity of sugar in bond, and it was found to be 32,074 tons, on which &#163;128,296 of Excise was payable. Knowing that that amount of revenue was at stake, the Minister caused a proclamation to be issued making all the sugar in bond free of duty. </para>

                        <para>- You cannot continue to levy duty after the Excise has been repealed. Every honorable member knows that it will be only by the grace of the companies concerned that we shall be able to recover one penny of the Excise at stake. Had the Minister had as much regard for the revenue as he should have had, he would not have made sugar free until he had got an undertaking from the companies that they would pay the duty on it upon withdrawing it from bond. I am certain that there would not have been any difficulty about that. The companies are not desirous of evading payment of just dues, and I do not blame them for the action they took. It is certain that they anticipated the action of the Government. Last year, the production of sugar in Australia was only 130,000 tons, and the requirements of the country 226,000 tons, so that 96,000 tons had to be imported to make up the shortage. Why was it that on the 24th July, 32,000 tons of Australian sugar was in stock? Why were the companies selling imported sugar, and keeping Australian sugar in bond? They would not have done that had they not thought that there was a chance of the Excise being repealed. It was not necessary to repeal the Excise and Bounty Acts at the same time. The Queensland Government must have felt that those Acts would not be repealed, because the measures .passed by the Queensland Parliament are so worded that I am sure the Labour Government, had it remained in power, would not have repealed the Commonwealth sugar legislation. One of the terms of the agreement with the Queensland Government was that the employment of coloured labour in Queensland should be prohibited. It is a mere quibble for the Minister to say that, had such a prohibition been enacted, the Bill containing it would not have received the Royal assent. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. It is a mere quibble for the Minister of Trade and Customs to argue that if the employment of black labour had been directly excluded by the Act it would not have received the. Royal assent, and that, therefore, a dictation test was imposed. As a matter of fact, Queensland already has upon her statute-book Acts which specifically exclude Asiatics aud coloured aliens from employment in certain undertakings, and those Acts received the Royal assent. </para>

                        <para>- The fact that they were passed years ago is an additional reason for believing that the Royal assent would not have been withheld from the Sugar Cultivation Act, because the present King has been much more liberal in expressing his views upon these matters than have previous rulers. The Royal assent has been given to democratic mea sures which have almost surprised the people, because a few years ago it would have been impossible to have obtained that assent. What about our Navigation Bill ? New Zealand could not get the Royal assent to the provisions of its Navigation Bill, and yet that assent has been given to our Navigation Bill, which contains even more drastic provisions. I would further point out that the dictation test will fail in its purpose unless we can depend upon the administration. That is where it will fail, because the administration of that test is now in the hands of those who all their political lives have been associated with what is known as the black-labour party. It is an easy matter to put a dictation test to any coloured alien that he can pass. If, for example, a Japanese presented himself, the officer administering the Act could easily impose a dictation test in Japanese. A dictation test is practically useless from the stand-point of safeguarding the sugar industry from the employment of coloured labour. </para>

                        <para>- No. The honorable member is doubtless thinking of what was said this afternoon to the effect that under our Immigration Restriction Act a dictation test is applied. But as that dictation test is applied by men who have no particular interest in any other part of the world, it is naturally applied in a much more reasonable and expeditious manner. In this particular instance we set out to accomplish one thing. The payment of the sugar bounty and the imposition of the Excise duty were intended to accomplish only one object - to do away with the employment of coloured labour and to establish the sugar industry on a white-labour basis. We wish to insure the continuance of that policy, and the  Sugar Cultivation Act passed by the Queensland Parliament does not give us the guarantee that we had a right to expect. No wonder that the Queensland Government made section 1 of that Act read - </para>

                <para>When these Acts were in their final stages in the Queensland Legislature, the Premier of that State is reported to have made a remark to the effect that &#34; If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> does not like to take these he can carry out the work himself.&#34; It is evident, therefore, that the Premier of Queensland had a suspicion that the measures would be objected to. I have another complaint to make in regard to them. We wished to guarantee to the growers that they would receive the bounty, and, in addition, the difference between the bounty and the Excise, which is estimated at 2s. 2d. per ton. But all that the Sugar Growers Act of 1913 provides is that in No. 1 district the grower shall receive 9s. 8d. per ton for his cane, that in No. 2 district he shall receive 9s. 2d. per ton, that in No. 3 district he shall be paid 8s. 8d. per ton, and that in No. 4 district he shall receive 8s. 2d. per ton, in addition to the basic price, but there is no stipulation as to what shall be the basic price upon which those payments shall be made. At the present time, there are contracts which are not affected by this Bill. But there is no guarantee that the cane-growers will get a basic price which will give them the advantage of the difference between the bounty and the Excise. If the basic price in No. 1 district is settled at 12s. per ton, the grower will get on the top of it 9s. 8d. per ton. But there is nothing to guarantee that the millowners will not reduce the price to 8s. per ton, and that would make the amount which the grower would receive 17s. 8d., instead of 21s. 8d. per ton. That is a weakness in the Act which the Labour Government would not have allowed to pass, and consequently the two Statutes which we passed last session would not have been proclaimed. I entirely object to the suggestion of the honorable member for Kooyong, that it was necessary to automatically proclaim the Sugar Bounty Abolition Act and the Sugar Excise Repeal Act. The honorable member stated that immediately the Queensland Parliament enacted certain legislation we were in honour bound to issue the necessary proclamations. I dissent from that view <inline font-style="italic">in toto.</inline> We came to a certain arrangement, and we had a perfect right to say whether that arrangement had been faithfully carried out. If each of two parties agree to perform certain undertakings, each must be satisfied that the other has faithfully carried out his part of the agreement before it can be consummated. The Queensland Government failed to carry out their part of the agreement with the Commonwealth in a manner which can be regarded as satisfactory to this House. If the Minister of Trade and Customs discovered a defect in the Acts passed by this Parliament at the instance of the Labour Administration, there was no reason why he should have hurriedly proclaimed them. This House met on the 9th July. The Queensland Bills were not then through the Parliament of that State. An adjournment of this Chamber took place on the 9th July, and if there be any force in the Minister&#39;s contention that he was acquainted with a defect in our legislation, it would have been the easiest possible thing for him to have put through a Bill on that date to guarantee the payment of the Excise on the sugar of the past season. There is yet another aspect of this matter : Some honorable members appear to think that the payment of the sugar bounty was dependent on the collection of the Excise, and that the Sugar Excise Repeal Act had to be proclaimed because the bounty had to be paid. The idea is ridiculous. The sugar bounty was paid out of the Consolidated Revenue, and was absolutely guaranteed to the growers, even though a single shilling of Excise had never been collected. Consequently the Government are quite out of court. They are absolutely without an argument when they suggest that the two Acts passed by this Parliament had to be proclaimed simultaneously. </para>

It is equally unfortunate that the Minister of Trade and Customs should have been in such a hurry to please his political friends in Queensland that he was induced to take action without realizing what he was doing. Of course, he was quite consistent, because during the last session, when this matter was before the House, there was no member of the Opposition who was more insistent than he was that we should repeal both the bounty and the Excise, and be content to accept the word of the Queensland Premier that he would pass the promised legislation.

My point is that the Minister of Trade and Customs continually insisted that both the Sugar Bounty and the Sugar Excise Acts should be repealed on the strength of the promise of the Queensland Premier. Some of us expressed a doubt as to whether we could accept that promise as one that was likely to be faithfully honoured. Subsequent events have absolutely justified our fears in that respect. </para>

                        <para>- But we kept in reserve this power to protect the interests of the Commonwealth and the sugar-growers. We said that our repealing Acts would not be proclaimed until the Queensland Legislature had carried out its part of the bargain. That is the difference. The suggestion of the honorable member for Darling Downs was that we should pass our repealing Bills, &#171; leaving the Queensland Parliament to carry out its part of the compact in accordance with the promise of the Premier of that State. We objected to that, saying, &#34; We shall hold in reserve this power not to bring our legislation into operation by proclamation until Queensland has carried out its part of the bargain.&#34; If the Labour Government had been in power these two Acts would never have been proclaimed until Queensland had passed more satisfactory measures. Queensland&#39;s legislation in this regard is not satisfactory, but the Minister of Trade and Customs, in his anxiety to accommodate and oblige his political friends in Queensland, rushed in, proclaimed the repealing Acts, and the Commonwealth has suffered a loss of revenue amounting to &#163;128,296. </para>

                        <para>- The facts support it. It is not a matter of doubt. Action was taken by the present Minister of Trade and Customs, and the loss of revenue has been suffered. The Government now come down with the suggestion that in some way or other they are going to collect the money, but it is remarkable that in the statement of Ministerial policy submitted to the House there was no suggestion that this was going to be part of the programme for the session. There was no hint of such a thing. This only goes to bear out the statement made from this side of the House that the Ministry have blundered. Little by little they are trying to get out of the difficulty, with the result that they are becoming more deeply involved. The statement made by the Minister to-night in regard to his knowledge as to the sugar in bond at the time of the issue of the proclamation is, to my mind, the most damaging admission he has made. I must, however, keep my promise to my honorable friend, and will reserve for a later occasion further remarks that I desire to make in regard to this question. </para>

                    <para>. - I have followed very closely the debate on the Supply Bill, and more particularly the remarks made by the honorable member for Kennedy and the honorable member for Brisbane.  The latter opened his speech with a reference to the abuse which he said had been heaped upon the Opposition by honorable members on this side of the House. He then referred to the financial proposals, to the cotton industry, to matters of defence, and, finally, to the sugar question. I do not know that there has been from this side of the House any abuse of the Opposition which has not been exceeded by that which the Opposition has heaped on us. I am quite certain that throughout the length and breadth of Australia during the recent election campaign no statement was made by honorable members on this side that could not be verified. Speaking for myself, I made no statement in public that I am not prepared to support and substantiate with evidence at any time. Coming to the question of finance,  to which reference has been made by the honorable member for Kennedy and the honorable member for Brisbane, I have heard the ex-Prime Minister and members of the Opposition speak of the deficit which they found on taking office, and which they claim to have converted into a surplus. During the election campaign there were many references to the unex-  &#93;3ended  earnings received from the taxpayers which were placed to the credit of the Commonwealth. Members of the Labour party said that when they came into power they were faced with a deficit of &#163;451,000, and the present Leader of the Opposition declared that he converted that deficit into a surplus of from &#163;2,000,000 to &#163;2,500,000. That, he said, would be the surplus shown at the end of the financial year which closed on 30th June last. I have verified his figures, and know that they are correct. But the point that I .wish to make is that the right honorable gentleman never told the people of his great inheritance as the result of the expiration of the Braddon section in 1910. The people of Australia know that under the .Braddon section of the Constitution it was provided that 15s. out <inline font-style="italic">pi</inline> every &#163;1 collected from Customs and Excise should be returned to the six States which created the Federation. But neither the present Leader of the Opposition, nor any of his supporters, to my knowledge, referred to that fact, or to the expiration of that section. Of the small deficit of &#163;451,000, a sum of &#163;450,000 exactly was provided by the Deakin-Cook Government for old age pensions. The Deakin-Cook Government knew, when they were going before the electors in 1910, that although that deficit existed the Commonwealth, as the result of the expiration of the operation of the Braddon section, would in future receive from Customs and Excise a much larger revenue than had ever been obtained before. While the Fisher Government were in office - and I say, clearly and distinctly, that it was a period of misrule - the Commonwealth received from Customs and Excise over &#163;16,000,000 more4 than had been received during the administration of any previous Ministry. The Fisher Government also collected about &#163;4,500,000 from the land tax which they introduced, making in all an additional revenue of about &#163;20,500,000. And yet they talk about the small deficit of &#163;451,000! If I were Treasurer of the Commonwealth, and knew that within three years the Commonwealth would receive an additional &#163;20,500,000, I should not worry much about leaving a small deficit of &#163;450,000, more especially when the deficit, as in this case, was incurred in providing for national works, and in carrying out other national purposes. The Deakin-Cook Government knew, when they went to the electors in 1910, that the Braddon section was about to expire, and that a larger revenue would consequently be available to the Commonwealth. Honorable members opposite, who, in reality, are only delegates - delegates of an irresponsible body outside Parliament - should have been truthful in their statements^ They should have made reference to the expiration of the Braddon section; but in no newspaper published in Australia did I ever see any evidence that they had done so. What they did claim was that they were Heaven-born financiers, who had brought the country out of a state verging on ruin, and had converted a deficit into a substantial surplus. </para>

                        <para>- No. The Fisher Government during their three years of office practically ruined the country. The honorable member for Wide Bay, when Treasurer of the Commonwealth, in 1912, brought down a statement showing that he estimated to receive &#163;20,422,000 in that, the year of our greatest prosperity, and that the expenditure would be &#163;22,681,541. In other words, in the year of our greatest prosperity he proposed to expend &#163;2,261,541 more than he would receive. And yet the Labour party call themselves heaven-born financiers. To the individual their policy means increased taxation and a decrease in the purchasing power of the sovereign. The Labour Government undertook to perform great things, but we now find employment scarce and money dear. And what made money dear? The policy of the Fisher Government and their sup1porters. Money is dear all over the world ; but in Australia, up to June,  1910,  there was probably the cheapest money in the wide world, considering the size of the country. Nearly four years ago  I  remember money being sent from Melbourne to New York, where it is earning  7  per cent., and yet at that time money  here, on gilt-edge security, could be obtained at 3| per cent. </para>

                        <para>- There was no stagnation here; but at present we have financial crucifixion, all through the Labour party, who do not know what finance means. The late Government set to work on financial reform, and, first of all, introduced a Commonwealth note issue, which had the effect of filching from the banks, and taking out of circulation, about &#163;10,000,000. This was the chief factor in making money dear, because, when money is drawn out of circulation, it must cost more. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs</inline> tells us that during the last three years the purchasing value of the sovereign has  decreased by to 15 per cent., so that for&#39; what a man could purchase for &#163;2 lis. three years ago he has now to pay &#163;3. </para>

                        <para>- No; I support the Australian Navy. And here I should like to point out that it was not the Socialist party, but the Liberal party, who instituted the Australian Navy. It was a Liberal Government which brought out Admiral Henderson and Lord Kitchener, and the schemes of those two experts have been adopted. Yet the Labour party, from probably every platform throughout Australia, have been guilty of the misstatement - of the wilful perversion of the truth - that the credit for the establishment of the Australian Navy is due to them. Then, again, wherever I went in my electorate I found that statements had been made by Labour candidates that if the Liberal party were returned to power, old-age pensions would go. But who introduced old-age pensions ? The Liberal party. Over sixteen years ago an old-age pensions scheme was operating in Victoria, where it was introduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner, as Premier of the State. As a matter of fact, the old-age pensions scheme is in existence to-day because of the efforts of the Liberal party in the past, when there was no Labour party in existence. Now the Prime Minister proposes to extend old-age pensions, and make them even more beneficial to humanity by means of the insurance scheme he has foreshadowed in his memorandum. However, it was the question of finance with which I desired to deal. When the ex-Prime Minister submitted his Budget on 3rd August, 1912, he proposed to take from the accumulated unexpended earnings of the previous year a sum of &#163;2,261,541 to make the public ledger balance. There is marvellous finance ! </para>

                        <para>- I was away from Australia with the full consent and concurrence of my electors, and I am here to-day, in spite of remarks made by honorable members opposite, and to their great surprise, with a larger majority than I ever had before, and I prophesy that I shall have even a larger majority on the next occasion. What the people of Australia think of the finance of the Labour Government is shown in the &#163;act that that Government was deservedly &#34; turned down.&#34; I have said on the platform, and I repeat here, that in reality the Labour party and Government committed Australia, during their three years of power, to a capital expenditure of over &#163;100,000,000, which the taxpayers of Australia will have to provide. We have heard honorable members opposite talk about clean rolls, clean administration, preference to unionists, and so forth; but the great heart of the people of Australia has declared clearly and distinctly that there is to be no preference. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs,</inline> there are about 430,000 unionists in Australia, with an estimated population of 4,600,000. Roughly, this means one unionist to every twelve of the population, and the other eleven have to bow the knee to the Labour party. They are to have no right to live or work ^unless they join the unions of which honorable members opposite are delegates. </para>

Is this coercion to continue? No. There is in the Government&#39;s declaration of policy a clear and bald statement which is a gauge of battle, such a gauge as the country wishes. We shall fight for a double dissolution, and the sooner we get that double dissolution the better it will be for all. It is not to be a &#34; heads we win, tails you lose&#34; dissolution, as honorable members opposite wish, if we can avoid it. We wish to have a dissolution of the Senate as well. It is no earthly use our legislating for all our measures to be thrown out in the other Blouse. Certainly we have the powers of administration, but we must also have the powers of legislation which the people wish us to have.

                        <para>- I shall be satisfied if the honorable member will tell me the date, but I have never seen those reports, so I could not have been very anxious concerning the matter. I never dispute any statement I have made. I remember that I was asked a question in connexion with universal suffrage, the ratepayers&#39; roll, and various other matters at a meeting at Avoca. I was asked whether I meant to say that the man in the street who refused to work, the beer-sparrer, the loafer, and waster was as much entitled as an industrious man to a vote in the government of the country. I said, &#34; No,&#34; and I said further, &#34; Judging by what I know of men who will not work when they can get work, if we confined ourselves to the ratepayers&#39; roll, it might be better.&#34; I would point out to honorable members who interject that the ratepayers&#39; roll can be stuffed just as easily as the ordinary rolls, and that the Chief Electoral Officer could strike out any bogus names that should not be there. I do not wish to take any unfair advantage, but I wish to be clearly understood that I do not repudiate my remarks. I do not think that the man who refuses to work, who will not take an interest in affairs, who is practically a waster, should have the same power in the government of the country as the man who will work. That is practically all I rose to say. I do not deny the statement of the honorable member for Kennedy, and I think he will agree with me. </para>

                        <para>- It will. I wish it to appear in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> It is evidence that I did say so, and that I do not deny it. I can tell the honorable member for Brisbane that in connexion with the sugar Excise there will be no loss to the people of Australia. The honorable member was speaking with the book, and I am speaking without the book. I have no figures, but the facts I have mentioned I am prepared to verify. They are perfectly true, and I am satisfied that the people of Australia will lose no money because the Cook Government fulfilled the implied promise of the late Fisher Government. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable member should be the last in the world to talk about men being loafers, or men who will not work. He was not in the chamber during the whole of last session, and I have yet to learn that he did not take his salary. He should be the last in the world to rise under theprotection of the House, and vilify men who go on to his estate and work during his absence. I am told that better work is done, and better wine made during the honorable member&#39;s absence from his estate, because he is not there to interfere with the men. I have also to learn that the honorable member is a born financier. He does not know that the Deakin Government and previous Governments were compelled by their masters in the States to return more than the three-fourths of the Commonwealth revenue. They gave back to the States &#163;6,000,000 more than should have been paid to the States, and to do this they starved&#39; the Departments throughout Australia. The telegraph system is in a bad state owing to the way in which the Department was starved at that period. I was working in the Postal Department at that time, and know of it from practical experience. Electrical engineers in the States made recommendations to headquarters, but they could not get the money because the masters of Parliament, those who pulled the strings in the States, told Ministers that they must return more money to the States to save the people paying taxation to the State Parliaments. We hear this great financier, the honorable member for Grampians, quoting <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs,</inline> and stating that money had been withdrawn from Australia. </para>

                        <para>- According to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs,</inline> there is more money in the savings banks to-day than ever before. He says that, per head of the population, there is more money in the banks to-day than ever there was before. The advances ave larger, and more money is being expended in industries. Why is there a shortage of money in Australia at the present time? Honorable members know that immediately the Fisher Government came into power, Australia started to progress. There were huge expenditures upon public works, and private people launched out as they had not done before for many years. Industries sprang up everywhere. This state of things arose because the Fisher Government caused &#163;1,400,000 per year to be added to the revenue of the country in the form of land-value taxation levied upon people who were never before asked to pay such taxation. The standard of living in Australia was raised, and we were told that, on behalf of every family, &#163;10 more was paid in Customs revenue than was paid previously. In my State, the Prime Minister led the people to believe that the Fisher Government imposed additional taxation upon the people. </para>

                        <para>- They did nothing of the sort, but they did make ib possible for the workers of Australia to raise their standard of living. Immediately they secured a fair and reasonable wage, the workers raised their standard of living, and business people throughout the length and breadth of Australia benefited thereby. These are the reasons for the prosperity which we find to-day in Australia. Money is tight throughout the world, and not in Australia alone, and we know the reasons for it. We know of the great demand for money for development in Canada. We know of the Balkan War and of the awakening of China, which has drawn huge sums of money by way of loans from all parts of the world. Advancement and progress in all countries has increased the demand for capital throughout the world, with the result that to-day we find that money is costly everywhere. The talk to which we have listened from some honorable members may do very well for outside districts, but it is not of much use here. I am glad to see the honorable member for Wilmot in his place, but I know that one night, when he got away into the back-blocks of Tasmania, where there was no press, he started telling the people about the dreadful Caucus of the Labour party. </para>

                        <para>- I am told that two daughters of a settler in the backblocks, after reaching home one night from one of the honorable gentleman&#39;s meetings, started looking under the bed for the Caucus. When honorable members talked in that way in my State, I may assume that the honorable member for Grampians talked in the same way in his district. Such talk may be all right outside, but it is no use to bring forward these old tales in this Parliament.  Money  has not been withdrawn from this country, and the honorable member for Grampians knows it. I regret very much that the Fisher Government has been displaced because of the development which was carried on during their term of office. I admit that they spent money, but they have something to show for their expenditure. The way in which members of the Fisher Government organized the Departments was simply wonderful. The Home Affairs Department was the fifth wheel of the State coach when the Fisher Government took office, but no sooner were they in command than we found heaps of work put upon the various branches of that great Department, and it is surprising to me that they did as well as they have done. The administration of the Post and Telegraph Department has been criticised tonight, but I can say that in the district of the honorable member for Franklin more telephone work was carried out in three years by the Fisher Government than was carried out in nine years by previous Governments. Metallic circuits have been put in, transposed every quarter of a mile, giving practically a silent line from Franklin to Hobart, and through to Launceston. I have spoken from Port Cygnet to Launceston, and could hear the person with whom I conversed as distinctly as I can hear honorable members in this chamber. Why was I able to do so? It was because a metallic circuit has been provided throughout the length and breadth of the island, which enables people now to converse on a practically silent line. The honorable member for Franklin seems to possess some fortunate way of dealing with the Postmaster-General, no matter on what side of the House he sits. He will admit that more telephone work has been done in his district than in any other electorate in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- No doubt the honorable member does, but he has had a fair share of work done in his district. The source of trouble in the Department seems to be that they have adopted a fixed specification for the whole of Australia. It does not matter whether a pole is to carry one or a dozen wires, the Department insists on one being erected much larger than the strain put upon it warrants, and that the ground shall be cleared for 20 feet around the bottom of all poles. I know from practical experience that it is sufficient to clear 6 feet around a pole to prevent it catching fire, so long as the brush is cleared right away for that distance and is not left to dry in a circle round the pole. We find now that men are engaged in clearing 20 feet around each pole, and there are from twenty-five to twenty-eight poles to each mile. Work of this nature adds considerably to the cost of line construction. I supervised the construction of one line, which was surveyed by my father and myself. 1 refer to the line from Circular Head to the Montagu. It was constructed over twenty years ago, through some rough country as well as plain country, and was carried out at a cost of &#163;12 6s. per mile. I am informed that, at the present time, a similar line would cost from&#163;26 to &#163;30 per mile. </para>

                        <para>- They were not very much cheaper, but the increased cost arises from the fixed specification for all lines. The engineer is adopting the ideas of engineers in the Old Country and in Canada, where, as honorable members are aware, snow settles on the insulators and wires and brings down the lines. Here we have no snow heavy enough to damage any of the lines. I am of opinion that the Postmaster-General might safely adopt a more economical system of construction, and still secure very effective lines. The line I speak of running to the Montagu, was up for seventeen years before it was necessary for any of the poles to be replaced. It carried only one light line, and the strain was not very great. We require cheap telephone construction to open up the country, and should adopt cheap lines similar to that to which I have referred. I wish to appeal to the Postmaster-General to carry out the construction of the line which I asked him to undertake soon after he came into office. I presented a petition to him from residents in a district called Ridgeway, in my electorate. If the work is carried out I feel certain that it will be immediately reproductive and a boon to the people. With reference to the payment of the hands engaged upon construction work, it is remarkable that casual labourers should be paid 8s. a day in Hobart whilst they are paid 9s. a day in Brisbane. The climate in Tasmania at this time of the year is very severe, and a man engaged on trenching in the stony ground of Hobart is entitled to the full amount paid in any part of Australia. Again, I appeal to the Postmaster-General to provide the men engaged on outdoor work with overcoats. Interruptions of the service always take place in stormy weather, and the men have to leave immediately to carry out repairs. The Department is, apparently of opinion that overcoats should be provided, but it adopts a very cheese-paring policy. I find that one overcoat is provided for every three or four men. Surely the Department can afford to give these men one overcoat each. The present system is unfair, unjust, and, from a hygienic point of view, entirely wrong. </para>

                        <para>- I do, undoubtedly. I feel sure that as soon as the Postmaster-General has this matter brought under his notice he will insist on coats being provided, because a generous man such as he is would not for a moment countenance the present state of things. I wish also to refer to the mail service between the mainland and Tasmania. Had the Fisher Government remained in office they intended to give us an up-to-date line of steamers running between the mainland and Tasmanian ports. Those steamers were to be owned by the Commonwealth. Since the present Government came into power practically nothing has been done. Statements are published in the newspapers every few weeks to the effect that the Government intend to do something, but we never learn what they intend to do. When the right honorable member for Swan was on this side of the House he complained about the Treasurer not being prepared to spend money usefully. What is he going to do now he is in charge of the Treasury? Is it his intention to give the company that has a monopoly in carrying mails between the mainland and &#39;Tasmania an extension of their contract with an increased subsidy? At present, I believe, the company is receiving &#163;13,000 per annum for carrying the mails. I believe it is intended to pay them an additional &#163;2,000, making &#163;15,000 in all. That sum would pay the interest on three new vessels equal to the <inline font-style="italic">Loongana.</inline> We should then have an up-to-date service, run for the convenience of the public. I am of opinion that we should have much cheaper fares than at present rule. Apparently nothing is to be done to improve the service  between  Hobart and Sydney. I understand that a large sum of money is paid, but the boats are not what they should be. A person wishing to travel from Sydney to Hobart has to book weeks in advance. In addition to that, I am informed, passengers are sometimes made to pay cabin rates for steerage accommodation. That is most unfair. The shipping companies should be induced to put on an up-to-date service. I venture to say the day is not far distant when Hobart will become one of the principal shipping ports of the Commonwealth. At the present time a wharf is being constructed which will be able to accommodate the great ocean liners. It is being built by day labour, and will be a credit to the Marine Board of Hobart and to everybody connected with it. The Tasmanian authorities are rising to the occasion in making provision for an increased traffic; but the shipping companies, with the monopoly that they enjoy, are doing nothing to bring about an improved state of affairs. I hope that the Government will do something in this matter. I can assure them that nine-tenths of the people in my electorate desire a Commonwealth line of steamers. Practically everybody is in favour of such a scheme. Why not drop this party fighting altogether, and say at once, &#34; We will give Tasmania a Commonwealth line of steamers &#34; ? If the Government did that they would make a name for themselves. I also think that it is most unfair that the sergeant-majors, a body of able men who are training our youths, should be called on to provide their own uniforms. Indeed, it would be unfair that they should be called upon to buy their own caps. The Commonwealth has a clothing factory of its own, and surely the Minister of Defence could make arrangements for these men to buy their clothes from the factory, even if they paid for them out of their own pocket. They will get them cheaper then thai they do now. Another matter which has come under my notice is that the best Area Officers - sergeant-majors - are being continually drafted into the office. They are excellent clerks, no doubt, but I think that they should be kept outside, where it is essential to have good instructors. I am sure that the sergeant-majors would prefer the outdoor work, but the pay is not high enough. If we give them fair remuneration the attraction will be sufficient to keep the men in their proper place, and that is training the boys. </para>

It is in connexion with the question of preference to unionists. When I heard the honorable member speak a few days ago, he gave us the impression that he was being misrepresented before the country, and that what he had agreed to previously was some kind of conditional preference to unionists. He gave us to understand that he was never in favour of that whole-souled preference to unionists which the ardent unionist advocates, whereas, in looking up the records of a not very recent date, I find there has been no stronger supporter of unconditional preference to unionists than the Prime Minister. He said, in effect, in quite a dramatic fashion, &#34; When next these Labour men are referring to my attitude on preference to unionists, let them give the context of my remarks, let them quote me as a whole, and not choose a sentence here and there which does not correctly state my position.&#34; I find, to put it shortly, that there are several stages in the development of his mind on this question. </para>

                <para>These two gentlemen sit side by side. One of them tells us that he would enforce preference to unionists in summary fashion if he had the opportunity, and his colleague says that the provision allowing a Court to grant preference is the ugliest blot on the statute-book. </para>
                <para>In 1900, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wise</inline> introduced an Industrial Arbitration Bill into the New South Wales Parliament. The honorable member for Parramatta was not then a political fledgling.  His  views were matured when he entered Parliament, and he had been a member of the Assembly for ten years. He had been Leader of the Labour party, and had left the party; he had joined the Liberal party, and he had held the positions of Minister for Mines and Agriculture and Postmaster-General. Having had ample time to study the question, and speaking, not as a Labour, but as a Liberal member, he spoke on this Bill in 1900. There was never a better case put for unconditional preference to unionists. There were never stronger arguments than those he used in support of unrestricted preference at the hands of a Court. </para>
                <para>He dealt with victimization. He referred to the difference between capitalists here and those in the Old Country, to the disadvantage of the former. He replied to . the objections of associations of employers to preference to unionists. He dealt most effectively with the free-labour question. He discussed freedom of contract. No one can. read the speech without being sure that he felt the truth of every word he uttered. He is now associated with men whose views are the opposite of those which he holds; because he cannot have changed his innermost convictions. In that speech he justified interference with the liberty of the subject, and appealed to the House to leave matters unconditionally with the Court. I wish to quote portions of the speech, to put it on record. </para>
                <para>Let me now refer to the victimization of the workers. Speaking on 2nd August, 1900, the honorable member said - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para class="block">All that voluntary action can do for the settlement of these disastrous industrial troubles has been done ; but, in spite of all that has been done, men are to-day being victimized because they belong to trades organizations. The other day a mine manager discharged six men, the reason given being that the trade of the mine was falling off, and that, therefore, these men had to go. It was only a coincidence that they were the six men at the colliery who had agitated for an advance in wages, which was afterwards conceded. They attended the meeting at. which it was determined to ask for this advance, and, so to speak, took a. lead in the proceedings whereby it was secured : and it was merely a coincidence that they, and only they, were sent about their business at a time when there was an appearance of a falling off in trade. </para>

                    <para class="block">It seems to me that the difference in the capitalism in the two communities is largely one of temperament. In the Old Country, there is. still a lingering trace of the old spirit of noblesse, which has come down from Feudal times. I am glad to &#34;say that it has not yet left the capitalism of the Old Country. In these young countries, most capitalists have had to force their way up from the ranks, and the  process has developed a somewhat harder side lo their natures; they have become what may be called professional capitalists. </para>

                <quote>
                    <para>But now let us see for a moment what this objection really is, and whether it is so formidable as it might appear in some quarters. I take up a criticism of the Bill by the&#39; Builders&#39; and Contractors&#39; Association, and here the objection was put in a sentence : - &#34; We also question the justice of imposing disabilities upon nine-tenths of the industrial community at the instance of the trade unions&#39; &#39; tent &#39; in order that the majority of the employes may be coerced into joining trade unions or becoming industrial Ishmaelites.&#34; </para>
                </quote>
                <para>That is the self-same clap-trap that we had to-night from the honorable member for Grampians. The honorable member is effectively answered by this speech of his Prime Minister, which I would recommend him to read. The honorable gentleman showed that the employers desired freedom of contract which he controverted in unqualified terms. </para>
                <para>Dealing with the subject of free labour, he says - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>It is recognised in unionist circles that unionists should not work with free labourers. I. know a great many people who will not agree with that. The reason why that takes place to-day is this : a free labourer is regarded by the unionists as a menace to his wages, as a menace to his price. It is in order to secure his price that he has to sacrifice the free labourer. That is the reason why unionists very much object to work with free labourers, because the free labourer is only used, as a rule, by the employer in order to coerce the unionist to accept conditions which the unionist dislikes. That being so, under this Bill, the motive of the employer to employ free labour will be taken right away. The free labourer is never called into requisition at all, except in times of industrial trouble. Man for man, it is a recognised rule that the trade unionist is at least the equal of the free labourer in ability at his work. Therefore, it is not on account of superior workmanship that the free labourer is employed, but in order that he may be a menace to the unionist, who is employed for the time being, or in order to defeat him if he is out on strike. As this Bill is going to stop strikes, there will be no further motive on the part of the employer to take the free labourer under his protecting care. I should like to say, as the result of long experience in these matters, that if honorable gentlemen will think for a moment what is the object of the free labourer, and the effect of the free labourer upon the condition of the unionist, they will see a very good ground for dislike on the part of the unionist to the free labourer. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">I venture to say that the case for the unionist as against the free labourer was never put stronger than it was then put by the present Prime Minister. </para>
                <para>In referring to freedom of contract, he next combated the argument in its favour. The employers desire freedom to choose the non-unionist in preference to the unionist because the unionist increases wages, and is therefore a menace to the employers&#39; profits. This is what the honorable gentleman said on that occasion - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>We hear it in these words : that this Bill is an interference with liberty - an interference with the principle of freedom of contract. I often think that those gentlemen who make this objection must be very ignorant of our industrial history They must be very ignorant of the operation of this principle of the freedom of contract when they claim for it so many virtues and so many advantages. The industrial his.tory of this and every other country shows that, masquerading- under this principle of freedom of contract has been some of the most ghastly and horrible slavery that this or any other country has ever known. Go to the beginning of this century, and read there a picture of the operation of this principle of freedom of contract. T. have here a volume entitled <inline font-style="italic">Industry in England,</inline> by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> de B. Gibbins. An one who will take the trouble to read this book will, I think, for ever after be very careful as to how he uses that phrase &#34; freedom of contract.&#34; We are not here, I take it, to mouth shibboleths, either of liberty or protection, or anything else. We are here &#34;to investigate facts, and to see the bearing of them, and they are facts in the industrial life of this country. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">Then he goes on to picture how the employers have treated  litle  girls in the factories of England under this system of freedom of contract by working them seven, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, and eighteen hours a day. Here is an extract which he cited from the speech of a member of the House of Commons on this point - </para>

                    <para>Our ancestors could not have supposed it possible - posterity will not believe it true - that a generation of Englishmen could exist, or had existed, that would work lisping infancy of a few summers old, regardless alike of its smiles or tears, and unmoved by its unresisting weakness, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, sixteen hours a day, and through the weary night also, till, in the dewy morn of existence, the bud of youth was faded, and fell ere it was unfolded. . .  . . Then, in order to keep them awake, to stimulate their exertions, means are made use of to which I shall now advert, as a last instance of the degradation to which this system has reduced the manufacturing operatives of this country. Children are beaten with thongs, prepared for the purpose. Yes; the female of this country, no matter whether children or grown  up - and I hardly know which is the more disgusting outrage -are beaten, beaten in your free market of labour, as you term it, like slaves. The poor wretch is flogged before its companions - flogged,I say, like a dog, by the tyrant overlooker.

He continued - and I cannot but believe that those who mouth it so f ully must be very ignorant of what it meant in its full operation at the beginning of this century. I will tell you what I have seen. Take a little female captive six or seven years old; she shall rise from her bed at  4  o&#39;clock in the morning of a cold winter day, but before she rises she wakes, perhaps. half-a-dozen times, and says, &#34;Father, is it time? Father, is it time?&#34; And at last, when she gets up andputs her little bits of rags upon her weary limbs - weary yet by the last day&#39;s work - she leaves her parents in their bed, for their labour - if they have any - is not required so early. She trudges alone through rain, and snow, and mire, and darkness, to the mill, and there for thirteen, fourteen, sixteen, seventeen, or even eighteen hours, is sheobliged towork, with only thirty minutes&#39; interval for meals and play. Homeward again at night she would go. when she was able, butmany a time she hid herself in the wool in the mill, as she had not strength to go. And if she were one moment behind the appointed time, if the bell had ceased to ring when she arrived with trembling, shivering, weary limbs at the factory door, there stood a monster in human form, and as she passed he lashed her. This, &#34; he continued, holdingup an overlooker&#39;s strap.&#34; is no fiction.It was hard at work in this town last week. ThegirlI am speaking of died : but she dragged on that dreadful existence for several years. </para>
                <para class="block">This is the beautiful picture of freedom of contract that the honorable member for Parramatta put before the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales just before he entered this Parliament. Although he had been a Minister in a Liberal Government, he still held fast to his faith in the doctrine of preference to unionists - a faith from which he is now drifting. </para>
                <para>Much has been said about interference with the liberty of the subject. The honorable gentleman then went on to quote John Stuart Mill upon the question of interference with the liberty of the subject. He said - </para>

                    <para>We cannot do better than refer to an authority which is more frequently quoted by the opponents of this measure than perhaps any other - an authority whom they nearly always regard as being on their side. I refer to John Stuart Mill. I am going to quote a few sentences from his essay on liberty. Whatever other people may say of John Stuart Mill, I disagree with him in many of his statements; but I recognise in him one of the clearest and most profound thinkers on these questions that our race has ever produced. This is what John Stuart Mill says : &#34; The object of this essay is to assert one very simple principle, as entitled to govern absolutely the dealings of society with the individual in the way of compulsion and control, whether the means used be physical force, in the form of legal penalties, or the moral coercion of public opinion. </para>
                    <para>That principle is that the sole end for which mankind are warranted, individually or collectively, in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number is self-protection. That the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. &#34; That,&#34; said the honorable gentleman, &#34; correctly describes the principle operating under this Bill.&#34; </para>
                </quote>
                <para>The principle of preference to unionists, where a unionist must be preferred to a non-unionist, is, according to the honorable member, based on the ground of preventing harm to others. He indicated that the purpose for which it should be rightfully exercised was to prevent harm to others, and that the warrant for interfering with liberty of action is to secure self -protection. There, again, we have the whole case in a nutshell - that there must be granted a preference to unionists in order to prevent that victimization of unionists which the honorable gentleman knows, from his long experience, takes place in industry. When an employer proceeds to engage labour, and has the chance of choosing a unionist or a non-unionist, does he care whether the preference goes in one way or the other ? </para>

                    <para>We commit millions of pounds&#39; worth of property to the disposal of our Judges every day. All over the world the Courts of Law determine the conditions of families and of estates, and it seems to me that we should not hesitate about committing trade disputes to the arbitration of a Court in regard to which we have the highest guarantees to assure us that the Court will be what we say it will be. We commit these material interests to the hands of men to whom we are content to commit the issues of life and death. </para>

                    <para>Now you can say anything you like about what is possible under this Bill ; but when you refer a matter to the decision of a Judge, whatever you may think of the opinion he may hold, it is assumed that he is competent to givea decision. But every one of these cases cited presupposes that the Judge is going to be a fool, and not an ordinarily intelligent man. Is not the very reason of inquiry to enable the Judge to find out what is the measure of justice in the claim of either side? </para>

                    <para>It is generally recognised to-day, I think, by all intelligent men that nearly all that has come to labour by way of advancement has been per medium of these organizations. One can readily understand the feeling of the unionist when engaged in a dispute in defence of the privileges he already enjoys, and which he has hardly won by many years of arduous toil, when a man is brought into the arena to try and wrest those privileges from him. The free labourers, in these unionist centres at any rate, step in to reap where they have not sown, lt is that feeling which gives rise to hostility on the part of the unionist. </para>

                    <para>I venture to say that, upon the merits of the case alone, the Bill does right to give a preference to the trades unionist. 1 have already said that, in my judgment, trades unions have, done more for the workers than perhaps all the other influences which operate to advance our civilization put together. That is not my own opinion only, it is the opinion of those who have studied the question deeply, and who are in a sphere which enables them to detach themselves from the influences which operate with those . who have had anything to do with these troubles. It is their opinion that trade unions have done a great deal of good to the country at large. Almost the last speech that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gladstone</inline> delivered before he died furnished an opportunity for a statement of this kind - </para>
                    <para>I believe the trades unions of the world are the bulwarks of our modern democracy. That is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gladstone&#39;s</inline> deliberate opinion in almost the last speech which he delivered. </para>

                    <para>I confess to having at one time viewed them suspiciously. A long study of the history of labour has convinced me that they are not only the best friends of the workman, but the best agency for the employer and  the public, and that to the extension of these associations poli- tical economists and statesmen must look for the solution of some among the most pressing and the most difficult problems of our own time. I shall hope to show this after I have dealt with the facts of the present situation. </para>

                <para>That is how the Prime Minister stood in the beginning, and we see how he has since been slipping down the hill all the time. He then believed in forcing the principle of preference in a summary fashion, and had no time for the skulker who loafed on his fellows; he supported legal and unconditional preference in the Bill in the State House after he had become a matured Liberal, and then, in 1904, to meet the exigencies of party politics, we find him, for the first time, supporting a restricted preference. That was the first step on the broad and slippery path which leads to destruction. He no longer advocated preference because it was right in principle, or to protect trade unionists from victimization, but held that a majority of the workers in a given industry must be members of the union. He was now able to return along the road of freedom of contract; he had commenced to smash the unions, which for so many years he assisted to build up.  </para>

The honorable member, if he himself invites interjections, makes it all the more difficult for me to maintain order. </para>

They are his convictions, and the statements he now makes in connexion with his associates are not his convictions; he does not believe in them; it is absolutely impossible for a man in the maturity of his opinions to make such a speech without believing what he is saying. So we have the honorable gentleman slipping from point to point until he has boxed the compass. He wishes to catch his train, and I am pleased to defer to his wish. I shall return to the subject on another occasion. </para>

                        <para>.- It is very interesting to hear tie Prime Minister get up with this exceptional display of dignity, and request that a vote be taken at a certain time. The Prime Minister is generally credited with the responsibility for conducting the business of the House, aud he can take a vote any time he chooses. It is in his hands. </para>

I would remind the Prime Minister, and the press supporting him, that for every member from this side who has spoken there has been a member speaking on the Government side, and it has not been a waste-of-time debate. If we get any expressions of opinion from this side of the House they are replied to from the Ministerial side. If the Ministry wish to close the debate - which </para>

I hear an interjection, &#34; Let us catch our trains.&#34; I have no objection to my honorable friend catching his train. The worst thing that can happen now is that the House may be counted out, and I can assure the honorable member we do not intend to count out the House. We are not looking for any divisions to-night. It is insinuated that we are desirous of delaying the business of the House. As a matter of fact, the Prime Minister is particularly desirous that every new member on his side of the House should have the opportunity of expressing an opinion, and, in fact, the Government side so far have had a majority of members speaking. I think the honorable gentleman should recognise that, and should keep it in mind when indulging in heroics about his desire to get on with the business of the country. </para>
