                        <para>- I understand that it is proposed to import mechanics for the postal service. As applicants for the position of mechanic who reside in Australia are to be subjected to a test, I ask whether applicants coming from other countries will also be subjected to a test, and, if so, whether that test will be applied in their own country or after they have, reached Australia. If the test is applied after they reach Australia, I wish to know what will be done with those who fail to pass it. </para>

In accordance, however, with the desire expressed by the Postmaster-General, the Commissioner is arranging for the insertion of an advertisement in the metropolitan press inviting application from any local men who can efficiently perform the work which will be required of the telephone mechanics whom it is desired to employ to meet the requirements of the Department in Western Australia. </para>

In the case referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kendell,</inline> the men in question form part of the iSth Infantry Brigade. This Brigade extends from Mildura to Queenscliff, and it will readily be understood how difficult it is to arrange a time to suit the convenience of everybody. . Arrangements have been made for the Brigade to camp at Burrumbeet from the 29th November to the 6th December next, and inquiries made by the Brigadier who recently visited the head-quarters of the regiments in this Brigade, lead to the conclusion that no alteration of dates, at all events for this year, is desirable. </para>

So far as I gather the honorable member is reading from a report in a newspaper &#34;something in relation to another honorable member. I have already, on more than one occasion recently, pointed out the practice of the House of Commons in regard to the nature of questions which may be asked. Attention may be drawn by an honorable member to a statement in f&#62; report in a newspaper. The honorable member, however, must vouch for its accuracy. Is the honorable member prepared to do that? </para>

His conduct is in striking contrast to that of one honorable gentleman who spoke at Dandenong last night, and who made a statement regarding a member of another place and his association with the Chinn inquiry. If, as my honorable friends proclaimed, at Dandenong, no particular significance can be attached to this motion, it is extraordinary that they have had to call to their assistance leading counsel in this city, and that they have had to get two or three leading articles published in one of the morning newspapers here, as well as in Sydney and elsewhere, in order to demonstrate that there is nothing in it. </para>

                    <para class="block">That statement is signed by E. F. Mitchell and W. Harrison Moore. The honorable gentleman made a statement here the other night that his professional honour required that the closest possible secrecy should be observed in regard to every matter that came to his knowledge. In these circumstances, I should like to know how <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mitchell</inline> and Professor Harrison Moore knew when these retainers were given to the honor- able member. Is he prepared to say that he was not in consultation with them, with a view to the drawing up of this carefully prepared statement? It is signed by two leading counsel, and, if given to any one outside the bar, would probably have involved a fee of twenty-five guineas to each barrister. Is the honorable gentleman prepared to say that he was not in consultation with them, with a view to the publication of this statement in the morning papers, and that he has not had any talk with them about it ? I do not think that there are in the profession at the present time gentlemen so philanthropic as to be willing to incur, without reward, loss of much valuable time in undertaking the preparation of such a statement. I come now to the position of the company and the Attorney-General&#39;s association with it. The Marconi Company was non-existent in the Commonwealth, so far as Government concerns were involved, when the late Government took office. At that time two stations were being erected for the Commonwealth by the Telefunken Company, having been authorized by the previous Postmaster-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Quick. The first intention of the Marconi Company in respect of litigation was against, not the Commonwealth, but the Telefunken Company, who, according to the representatives of the Marconi Company, were infringing their rights. The Commonwealth Government had taken the advice of counsel, and had not only secured a general indemnity from the Telefunken Company in respect of any alleged infringment, but had involved certain individual interests, in addition to those of the company. The ex-Attorney-General, who is the acting Leader of our party and although the honorable member for North Sydney tried to be funny at our  expense, it is well known that the acting Leader of our party is the honorable member for West Sydney - protected the position of the Commonwealth interests in the event of the Marconi Company proceeding with their litigation. The present Attorney-General probably entered the field about this stage, if we accept Professor Harrison Moore and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mitchell</inline> as authorities on the subject. If we cannot do so, then the Attorney-General ought to repudiate them. The next action taken was not by the Marconi </para>
                    <para class="block" pgwide="yes">Company against the Commonwealth, but an amalgamation of the Marconi Company and the Telefunken Company in respect to their Australian interests.

                            <para>- It is a fact. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Denison</inline> said some pretty rough things concerning me, and his friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLeod,</inline> of the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin,</inline> has not been particularly nice. I have a few things to say about them also which it would be as well to make public; but I do not think that this is an opportune time to deal with them. I merely mention the fact that they are associated with one particular interest. Messrs. Blake and Riggall also furnish an opinion about the Attorney-General&#39;s position, and incidentally disagree absolutely with the attitude that the honorable member took up in the House. The two companies combined their interests against the Commonwealth, and the Fisher Government proceeded to try to protect the travelling public of Australia by erecting a series of wireless stations around the coast. As a matter of fact, we succeeded in encircling the coast with these wireless stations during our term of office. When we obtained the material we set to work, and built sixteen stations during the last sixteen months of our administration. Whilst we were proceeding with this work the present Attorney-General, by virtue of his retainer, was appearing for the Marconi Company against the Commonwealth, and, so far, the Commonwealth has been mulcted in considerable costs. The Attorney-General has told us that the highest degree of confidence must, of necessity, exist between client and counsel. Accepting that dictum as correct, then we are face to face with the fact that the honorable gentleman id thoroughly familiar with the whole of the secrets relating to the proceedings taken by the Marconi Company against the Commonwealth Government for discovery as to the particular system employed by us. The late Government resisted the claim for discovery, but the High Court, by a majority decision, decided against us. A very strong judgment - in my opinion, too strong - was given against the Commonwealth by the Chief Justice of Australia. </para>

                            <para>- Well, he was fairly pronounced in the Court, but I do not propose to deal with his position. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Barton concurred with him, but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Isaacs delivered a minority judgment in favour of the Commonwealth which was as argumentative and as pronounced as any to which I have ever listened. Whilst in ordinary circumstances fourteen days are allowed in which to apply for leave to appeal, in this case the next step taken by the majority of the Court was to give the Marconi Company an order for discovery within three days. The present Attorney-General did not discontinue his position with the company during any stage of this journey. I presume that he was advising the company in connexion with the case, which was ultimately carried to the Privy Council. Now, the Marconi Company has exercised its right to inspect the working of our system. It has taken drawings, and even photographs, of our system of wireless telegraphy, which was claimed to be distinct from both the Marconi and Telefunken systems. The Postmaster-General himself has Informed me that the examination of the station has taken place, so that the Marconi people know everything about the system, which was assigned to the Commonwealth, and which it was claimed should be kept secret for the special purpose of protecting Australia. The company obtained the whole of this information, and obtained it with the assistance of leading counsel - the present Attorney-General of Australia - who continues to hold a retainer from them. That retainer, however, he says, merely requires that he shall give notice before he accepts a brief against the company. Is that not the statement he makes? </para>

                            <para>- As a matter of fact, both the gentlemen involved in the British case lost money ; and that is not so in the present instance. The British Prime Minister lays it down that Ministers ought not to enter into any transaction whereby their private pecuniary interest may &#34;even conceivably&#34; come into conflict with their public duties; and &#34;even conceivably &#34; is a pretty pronounced phrase. The Attorney-General now tells us that he has handed over the question of the Marconi Company&#39;s claim to the Minister of External Affairs, to be dealt with by him. No doubt it is very convenient to be able to hand the matter over in this way; but the Attorney-General cannot carry out his duties as the chief law adviser of the Commonwealth if he hands over questions of law to his colleagues, no matter how clever the latter may be. The other day I asked the Attorney-General whether he intended to vote in the event of a compromise coming before the Cabinet for decision, and his reply was, &#34; Certainly.&#34; As I have shown, a retainer is repeated in the case of corporations and newspapers, and is for the life of an individual client; and, in view of the enthusiasm of one of the newspapers in this matter, I should like to know whether the Attorney-General has a general retainer from that newspaper. From the honorable gentleman&#39;s silence I can only conclude that he does not wish to answer. I am not prepared to say that he has such, a retainer. </para>

                            <para>- I thank the Attorney-General for that interjection, for it fits the case exactly. Can he be judge and jury in a matter in which, he must admit, he is conceivably involved ? Can he, under the circumstances, as the chief law adviser of the Commonwealth, decide, as he may probably decide, this question by his vote in Cabinet ? Can he wholly disregard the knowledge that he must have obtained of the company&#39;s affairs while he was working as counsel for them - can he keep his mind a blank when dealing with Commonwealth interests? This suggests another interesting position. Last night, when speaking at Dandenong, the Attorney-General evidently constituted h!*uself judge and jury, and spoke of what was to be the nature of the report that will result from an inquiry at present <inline font-style="italic">sub judice.</inline> As to this parliamentary inquiry, the Attorney-General has said that the  chairman  is biased, and that the report is a foregone conclusion ; and he recommends the Prime Minister to treat it as an Irish doctor once treated small-pox - with silent contempt. </para>

                        <para>It is a rule, in both Houses, that when the conduct of a member is under consideration, he is to withdraw during the debate. The practice is to permit him to learn the charge against him, and, after being heard in his place, for him to withdraw from the House. . The precise time at which he should withdraw is determined by the nature of the charge. When it is founded upon reports, petitions, or other documents, or words spoken and taken down, which sufficiently explain the charge, it is usual to have them read, and for the member to withdraw before any question is proposed. </para>

                        <para>. - I am rather disappointed with the speech to which we have just listened. I expected, from the flourish of trumpets with which this matter was inaugurated, that we should have from the honorable member a scathing philippic, raking my whole conduct fore and aft. I do not intend to occupy much time in reply to what has been said, nor is it necessary to do so. It will be remembered that the ammunition which the honorable member has used was supplied by me. In reply to a question by him as to the stage at which the Marconi litigation had arrived when the Government took office, and as to what had occurred since, I said that I knew nothing of what had occurred since, because, having been engaged in that litigation, I had handed over the whole case to the Minister of External Affairs, and I added that I had no further connexion with the Marconi Company except what was involved in the holding of a general retainer. At the time I thought that most honorable members would know what is meant by a general retainer held by a barrister, but, apparently, the position was not thoroughly understood, and later on the same day I was again questioned by the honorable member. He said - </para>

In reply to the last question put by me, the honorable gentleman stated that he held a general retainer from the Marconi Company. I wish to know whether, in view of the fact that the Marconi Company is engaged in litigation against the Commonwealth - litigation that may involve the Commonwealth in many thousands of pounds - he thinks that he should continue to hold even a general retainer from that company? </para>

                        <para>I think that the question proceeds from a misapprehension of what a general retainer, given to a member of the bar, amounts to. A general retainer merely gives to the person giving it the right to call upon the barrister by whom it is received, before he accepts <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> brief from any one else, who may be engaged in litigation, lo give- notice of the intention of the opponent to retain his services. That is all. When that notice is given, the barrister who has accepted the general retainer is obliged, of course, to consider all the circumstances that may, or may not, permit of his accepting a brief. In this case, as I have already said, I have completely severed myself professionally from everything connected with the litigation by the . Marconi Company. That company, like every other company or individual giving <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> general retainer, has the right to say that it shall have the services of a member of the bar if there is nothing to prevent his giving them. There are a number of other matters in which the Commonwealth has no concern, and with regard to them I should not be justified in depriving the company of its right to my services if there was nothing in the position which I held against my giving those services. </para>

                    <para class="block">The letter which was published in this morning&#39;s newspapers by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mitchell</inline> and Professor Harrison Moore, who obtained the necessary information with regard to the facts of the case from myself, elaborates a little, and states with even greater authority, because both gentlemen are members of the English as well as of the Victorian Bar, what the position is. Let me only add that a general retainer does not mean any connexion whatever of a professional character between a barrister and the person who has given it. A general retainer is merely a registration fee. Every barrister is, by the professional rules under which he works, bound to give his services to any member of the public desiring them, unless there are peculiar circumstances preventing him from doing so, such as the holding of the position that I now occupy. I must be forgiven for speaking in what might be considered a rather egotistical way, because it is a necessary part of my statement, but when a man occupies a position of some eminence at the Bar, there is competition for his services, and to prevent any man who may be rich enough from engaging the services of some particular barrister, or perhaps of all the leaders of the Bar, for any particular litigation, it has been the practice, for a hundred years and more, for members of the public to give to barristers general retainers, paying the small fee of five guineas. I do not think that my honorable friends opposite would have taken action in this matter had they not been under a misapprehension, because I cannot think that they have less sense of fair play than those on this side. Like every leading barrister, I hold a large number of general retainers of different dates. The Victorian rules relating to the holding of general retainers follow those of the English, Irish, and Scotch Bars, which have been in force for many generations. These rules are set out in a publication known as the <inline font-style="italic">Annual Practice,</inline> where honorable members may read them. The terms of the engagement to which the acceptance of a general retainer commits a barrister are there stated in black and white, so that there can be no mistake about the position.

                        <para>If the counsel who has accepted a general retainer from one party should be offered a special retainer or brief by another party, the general retainer entitles the party who has given it to reasonable notice before the offered special retainer or brief is accepted. </para>
                        <para>In case a special retainer or brief is offered to counsel by a party other than the party from whom he has accepted a general retainer, the counsel, after giving notice to the party from whom he has accepted the general retainer of the offer of the special retainer or brief, is at liberty to accept the special retainer or brief of the other party, unless a special retainer or brief be given within a reasonable time by the party from whom he has accepted the general retainer. </para>

                    <para class="block">As I have said, the rules of the Victorian - and, I might add, of the New South Wales - Bar are practically identical with those of the Bars of Great Britain, with this exception, that here it is a definite rule that retainers date in order of seniority, the fee in every case, no matter who may be the counsel, being &#163;5 5s. There is not that provision in the English rules, but there is an understanding to the same effect that is always acted on. General retainers are given by persons who think that they may be engaged in litigation, and desire to secure m advance the opportunity, should the necessity arise, of calling for the services of certain counsel. The general retainers that are given are entered in a register kept by a clerk employed by one, or by a number of, barristers, and stand in that register in the order of their dates. I do not know more than a few of the general retainers that I hold, but were I to say to the Marconi Company, &#34; You must take back your general retainer, and drop out of your place in the list of those desiring my services, going to the bottom of that list,&#34; I should be acting contrary to the professional practice that has prevailed in all the Bars in the British Dominions, and contrary to the simplest principles of fair dealing and good faith. No matter what the House might do, and no matter what might be the consequences, I would certainly not disobey the rules of conduct laid down by the Bar for the guidance of its members. </para>

                            <para>- I shall reply to that question in a moment; but let me first give a practical illustration of the working of a general retainer. There are a number of companies for which, I am informed, I hold general retainers, some prior, and some subsequent, in date to that of the Marconi Company. These companies may all, or any of them, at any moment be involved in litigation with the Marconi Company, or with one another. The Telefunken Company, for instance, gave me a general retainer some time ago. It was engaged in litigation, or contemplated litigation, with the Marconi Company, but I believe that the two companies have settled their differences: I do not know. </para>

                            <para>- From 1892 to 1895. That practice has been followed throughout, not merely in Great Britain up to that time, but in all the States and in the Commonwealth. But between 1892 and 1895 there were regulations made, after full discussion, with the view of depriving the Law Officers of any right to engage in private practice. I can understand the House desiring to bring forward that as a new matter of policy, as was done in England. Whether it is a wise thing to do will be a matter for the House to determine. It means that you must either dispense with the services of those who have risen highest in the profession, or make a new pecuniary arrangement to meet the circumstances, as was done in England. What they did in England was to provide that the Law Officers should be at liberty to take Crown briefs, and accept fees for Crown briefs, and that their salaries should be raised from &#163;3,500 or &#163;4,000 to &#163;7,000 a year. That information will be found, if honorable members want to find it, in a well-known work. The honorable member for Kalgoorlie has wandered over all the dictionaries and encyclopaedias, as far as I know, except the encyclopaedia which would have given him a little information on the subject. In the <inline font-style="italic">Encyclopaedia of the Laws of England</inline> he will find, under the head of &#34; Advocate,&#34; all those rules with regard to general retainers which he has been floating round and never really touched, set out in full. Then, under the head of &#34;Attorney-General,&#34; on page 408, he will find a statement of what was actually done in connexion with the position of Attorney-General of England - </para>

                        <para>Formerly, the law officers were entitled tt&#62; accept private practice without restriction, but important, although tentative, modifications of this privilege were introduced by regulations embodied in Treasury Minutes of 5th December, 1892, and 29th June, 1894. These regulations, however, were cancelled by a Treasury Minute of 5th July, 1895, which prescribes that for the future the Attorney-General and Solicitor-General - who are to receive salaries of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;7,000</inline> and &#163;6,000 per annum respectively - shall not undertake business of any kind on behalf of private clients, and any law officer shall, on appointment to office, return any papers or briefs on behalf of private clients. Provision, however, is made for payment of fees, according to the ordinary professional scales, to the law officers in respect of such contentious business as relates to proceedings, civil or criminal, which have actually been commenced, and in which the Government represents the plaintiff, defendant, or prosecutor. </para>

                    <para class="block">The actual remuneration then provided for enabling the Crown to obtain the undivided services of the Law Officers amounted to a sum which was sufficient to permit them to secure the services of such men as <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Russell, who was one of the first on whose behalf it was made - the first, I think; <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Finlay, and a number of others whose names might be mentioned since that date. If the House desires to introduce a new rule altogether, there may be reason for it, but then there are various considerations into which it would have to enter. In the first place, is it worth it ? </para>

In Great Britain they have adopted the latter course. &#39; In this case, as in every case in Australia, and in Canada, and other places where there is a Bar, the Law officers have been permitted to continue to conduct ordinary practice subject to the ordinary rules.

                            <para>- I have never been taught the language; that is the trouble. At page 964 of this book is reported a case which, for the first time, arose in England after this rule had been made. The Law Officers were obliged to &#187;ive up their private practice, and received 1 large compensation for it, amounting to, as has been pointed out, between &#163;15,000 and &#163;20,000 a year all told. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Finlay held a general retainer from A. He became Solicitor-General and Attorney-General, and ceased to be so on a change of Government. B then gave to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Finlay a special retainer, which is the same thing as offering him a brief. You have become a man&#39;s client when you have given him a special retainer. After <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Finlay left office, B offered him a special retainer to conduct a particular case; <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Finlay said, &#34; I cannot; I have a general retainer, which I had before I took office.&#34; The solicitor who offered him this said, &#34; I think that is wrong. I think that your taking office put an end to all general retainers under the new rule.&#34; They agreed to refer the point to the then Attorney-General, whose name I have not ascertained. He went into the matter, and decided that the solicitor&#39;s view was right - that accepting office under the new rule had the effect that the man retired from practice and all his retainers, <inline font-style="italic">ipsofacto,</inline> ceased to be applicable, and that when he went into practice again new retainers would have to be given. That, of course, is a necessary result of the rule that a man is obliged, on accepting office, to retire from practice. </para>

I am here at the instigation of a charge made by the honorable member for Kalgoorlie, with the express sanction of the Opposition, and I am here to answer it.

He, no doubt, misunderstands the character of the statement I made. I say that the Leader of the Opposition did deprecate the bringing forward of a vote of want of confidence on this matter. I propose to cite, from page 426 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> what took place here. It will be recollected that, on a motion for the adjournment of the </para>

                            <para>- Quite so; I have never had any other idea. My rejoinder to the Attorney-General&#39;s last statement is that nearly all such questions are raised during a debate of no-confidence, but I agree that this question cannot be properly decided in the heat of party conflict, which is another matter altogether. The question immediately before us is an abstract one dealing with the rights and privileges, and the honour and integrity, of members of this House and of the Government, and our object is to safeguard the interests of Parliament. The question cannot be decided on a proposed amendment on the Address-in-Reply, but it can be decided as a matter of procedure. </para>

                        <para>Honorable members on both sides may see fit by a large majority to say that certain rules shall be observed by this Parliament and Government now and in the future. I think the issue is bigger than party. </para>

                    <para>I agree with that - in fact, I suggested it; but what are the terms of the motion that is brought forward? The motion, after setting out what I would almost say the platitudinous statements by the British Prime Minister, which every one will agree with, proceeds to say - and that the action of the Attorney-General (the  Honorable W. H. Irvine) in determining to hold a retaining fee from the Marconi Company, now in litigation with the Commonwealth Government, has violated the rules of conduct here laid down, and is detrimental to the best interests of the Commonwealth. </para>
                    <para class="block">Is that the way in which to raise an abstract issue in a non-party spirit? Is there a Government of a British Dominion who would receive that motion other than as a direct motion of censure ? We were asked to accept it as a vote of censure. We were asked when we were going to give time to consider it as such. Yet I am told that I am misrepresenting the ex-Prime Minister by saying that he deprecated this motion being brought forward as a motion of censure. In listening to the honorable member this afternoon, I could not help recalling the fact that at one stage of his career he underwent a certain course of training for the legal profession. I could not help regretting that he did not go a little further, because the way in which he has rushed to dictionaries to get the meaning of &#34; contracts &#34; is amusing if it is not very instructive. The first great authority with which he came down to crush me was <inline font-style="italic">Stroud&#39;s Judicial Dictionary</inline> - a very useful work, but one which is a collection of the different meanings of words taken from judgments given in particular cases. If the honorable member had proceeded a little further in his legal training the very first thing he would have learned would have been that every one of those meanings must be considered in connexion with the circumstances from which it was drawn. He read, for example - &#34; To retain &#34; is, &#34; to keep in pay,&#34; &#34; to hire.&#34; </para>

                        <para class="block">On the 15th July, 1901, the Bar Council decided that, subject to rules 19, 20, and 21 of the retainer rules, a special retainer is binding if duly tendered, whether accepted or not, and that there is no rule of the profession which makes a general retainer binding on a counsel unless it is accepted by him. </para>
                        <para>These retainer rules were prepared by the Bar Committee, the predecessors of the Bar Council, and approved by the Attorney-General, and by the Council of the Incorporated Law Society in 1892. </para>

                    <para class="block">Apparently the honorable member feels himself entitled to take a general statement from a dictionary in which he is given a reference to the rules themselves and to omit reading those rules in order that he may draw a wrong inference from such general statement. That is conduct of which no honorable member of this House ought to be guilty. Now I will deal with the other portion of his charge against me - that I was engaged actively in connexion with the Marconi litigation against the Commonwealth. I have always said that I was. I told him that I was. Everybody knows that I was engaged as counsel for the Marconi Company for many months - as I was perfectly entitled to be. But the honorable member went on to say - he said it for the first time to-day - that after the High Court had decided that the Marconi Company was entitled to inspection of what was going on at the wireless stations established by the Commonwealth, the representatives of that company made an inspection, and, under my guidance, saw what was actually being done. </para>

                            <para>- At all events, that is what I understood the honorable member to say. Now, what are the facts ? When I took office there had been no inspection of anything. The order granting an inspection was then the subject of an appeal to the Privy Council. The decision of the Privy Council had not been given, and could not, therefore, be acted upon. Until the honorable member told me to-day I did not know that an&#39; inspection had actually been made. I handed over the entire business to the Minister of External Affairs upon my advent to office, and I have had nothing to do with it since. It has been said that I should be embarrassed in dealing with this matter if a question of compromise arose. I am prepared to make the honorable member a concession in regard to that point. I said before that I should not be in the least embarrassed by my acceptance of a general retainer. But I will make this statement - to some extent a modification of the view which I put before - that I should probably feel unable to deal with a compromise, and that I have not yet been present at any Cabinet meeting which has dealt with the Marconi litigation. If the House is not prepared to trust my honour in regard to this matter I am not fit to occupy the position that I do. Unless we adopt the English practice, which lays it down that an Attorney-General ought to cease private practice on assuming office, we cannot cut persons who fill that position off from the private practice which they have had up to that time. When a man becomes Attorney- General, who has been engaged in intimate relations with a company which has an action against the Government, some such course as I have suggested must be adopted, and, as a matter of fact, always has been adopted. A Minister who finds himself embarrassed by his previous business connexions must adopt some means whereby somebody else shall act in his place. That is the practice which, as far as I know, has always been adopted, and I have adopted it in this instance. It is followed by Judges suddenly taken from the Bar. Sometimes, where the necessities of the situation require it - where, owing to it being impossible to secure the number of Judges necessary to constitute a Bench - a Judge who has recently been raised to the Bench must break away from that rule and sit on a case in which he has been engaged as counsel. That, however, is a practice to be avoided as far as possible by a Judge, and also by the Attorney-General. </para>

                            <para>- Every Judge takes up that attitude. The duty of a Judge compels him to say, whenever a case comes up for consideration in which he has been engaged as counsel, &#34; I shall not sit in this case.&#34; Where, however, it is impossible to form a Bench in his absence he must sit. It is not a rule of law that prevents him from sitting in such cases; it is rather a rule of propriety that, as long as a Bench can be constituted without his sitting, he ought not to sit. I have adopted exactly the same rule in regard to this matter. There is no necessity for me to decide any question relating to it, since I have as a colleague a very eminent lawyer, who held office as Attorney-General in a previous Administration, and who is willing to relieve me of that duty. I have adopted a course that would be followed by every Attorney-General, either in England or elsewhere, by handing over the whole matter to him. I have no desire to occupy the attention of the House for any length of time, although J cannot say that I am entirely unconcerned by this motion. It would be hypocrisy for a man to say that he felt no concern in any attack that directly, or even remotely, touched his personal honour. I do not say that I can view any attack of this kind, no matter how groundless it may seem to me, without some concern, and that is why I have gone into the facts as fully as I have done. Wherever a professional man is placed in a position of trust and confidence, in which his duty and professional interests may possibly conflict, it is always difficult to know how you are to adjust them so as to prevent a conflict. In all such cases you must trust largely to the honour of the man who is placed in such a position. If you cannot do so, you have no safeguard. But what I desire to make plain above all other things is that these considerations do not arise at all in connexion with a general retainer. They do arise, however, when a man who has been engaged in active practice is put where he has to hold the balance in a case in which his former clients may be directly interested. It is in such a case that difficulty arises. I do not wish to take up further time. I cannot believe that those who support the Opposition outside are more likely than honorable members opposite themselves will be, when they know the real facts, to give an unjust judgment on such a clear and simple issue as  this undoubtedly is.I have no interest in the Marconi Company. I now know nothing of the Marconi Company. I have no connexion with it, either direct or indirect. The company merely stands in a list, of very considerable length, of persons who have given me general retainers, and who, in their due order, have the right to call upon me, should they require to do so in future litigation, to give them what they consider to be the benefit of my legal services. I have that connexion, but none other, with the company ; and no other that is adverse to the Commonwealth shall I have, either with that or any other company, so far as any Commonwealth interest is concerned, as long as I remain Attorney-General. </para>

In conclusion, I have only to say that I am not sorry that the matter has been brought forward at this time, and I hope that the motion will suffice to clear the air. My action in regard to this matter was carefully considered. The whole position was thought out, and I adopted that course which, in my opinion, was the only one consistent with my professional honour. No vote of the House, and no political consequences of any kind, will make me depart one iota from the line I have laid down. </para>

                        <para>. - The motion before the House concerns a matter of the greatest possible importance to the Parliament and the country. I quite agree with the view expressed by the Leader of the Opposition that it ought to be discussed without heat and free from the atmosphere of party. The honorable and learned member whose action is the subject of our consideration has treated the matter in a way that leaves some room for dissatisfaction. He said a great deal about the rules of the Bar, but very little about those rules of conduct which govern, and ought to govern, public men. &#34;Very likely he believes that the two things are coincident. It may be that they are, but certainly nothing th&#176;at he said, and no rule that he quoted, supported that position. In my opinion, it is not enough to quote rules of the Bar in a case of this sort, because such rules are meant to govern the conduct of lawyers towards their clients. They are not meant to safeguard the interests of the public in any way whatever. Litigants come before the Court represented by counsel, and as each side has counsel, the rules of the Bar are directed and are admirably adapted to safeguard the interests of the parties. The public, as such, is not generally concerned. Here, however, the public is vitally concerned, and here its counsel must be heard. The representatives of the people here assembled are the counsel, and through them the voice of the people finds expression within the walls of this Parliament. The public has only one adviser, the Cabinet, who form and direct the Executive Councils of this country. It is very necessary, therefore, that the conduct of those who voice the desires of the people and safeguard their interests should be above suspicion. </para>

                    <para class="block">No man is forced to come to this House. He comes by virtue of his own free will, and generally he comes gladly. He comes because he thinks it is an honour to represent his country, and when he comes he .must subordinate private interests to the public welfare. And this he knows, or should know, perfectly well. About that there is not the slightest difference of opinion, nor room for any. While that is perfectly true of members of Parliament in general, the rule - from which no one ventured to dissent when quoted by the honorable member for Kalgoorlie - the rule, which is observed in every British Parliament, that a member may not vote upon a matter in which he is personally interested, applies with special force to Ministers. The rule that a man shall not vote upon a matter in which he is personally interested, and everything that springs from it, constitute the very basis upon which public life becomes possible. The administration of the affairs of this country which we are carrying on here - the transaction of the business of the nation - is possible only so long as there is perfect integrity permeating its every fibre, and so long as there is no suspicion that private interests submerge public welfare. </para>
                    <para>That rule applies to Parliament in general, but in regard to Ministers it has to be applied far more rigidly. The public have, in regard to the action of private members, the safeguard of publicity which is given by discussions in this Chamber, and which insures, to a very large extent, at any rate, that every act and every word shall be open to criticism, if criticism be necessary. But Parliament in these days exists, in the main, for registering the decisions of the Cabinet. Under party government, although it retains its freedom of speech. Parliament has so far lost its freedom of action that it is unable to do little save to, in the vast majority of cases, blindly carry out what the Cabinet determines. </para>
                    <para>What is the Cabinet? This body unknown to the Constitution has grown up little by little, and has taken to itself such authority, that its very nature has now changed, although its name remains the same. The power of the Cabinet today is such that whilst the powers of the Parliament remain, as far as form and theory go, what they were in practice, what the Cabinet decides is done. Indeed, where, as in this Parliament has been the case almost since its inception, parties have been very nearly divided, it follows that dissent from the decision of the Cabinet is not possible, nor even desirable, from the stand-point of party, and none has ever occurred, so far as I know, on the floor of this House, in matters of first importance. </para>
                    <para>What is the Cabinet? If we regard this Parliament as representing the public, carrying on the business of Australia Unlimited, the Cabinet is the board of directors of the company. The members of the Cabinet have to decide how much the people shall pay in taxation and how the money shall be spent. They have to determine to whom it shall be paid; they have to decide any claims made against the Government; what claims shall be rejected, and what, if any, shall be compromised. The Attorney-General has sought to make it appear that the position he occupies is in perfect conformity with the rules of conduct laid down by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Asquith,</inline> the British Prime Minister, and perfectly compatible with the best interests of this Commonwealth. He takes exception to the wording of the motion, in that it is such that it must be regarded by the Government as a vote of censure. I want to say that there is no intention on the part of this party to level a vote of censure in this connexion. Nothing is further from our thoughts. We have put, in the form in which the motion appears on the notice-paper, the action of the honorable and learned member; we have put it in terms personally inoffensive, and as concisely and as clearly as possible. The gravamen of the charge against the honorable gentleman is conveyed in the last paragraph of the motion, which declares that his action violates the rule of conduct laid down by the British Prime Minister, and is opposed to the best interests of the Commonwealth. That is the position we take up; it is for us to establish it. Let us come to the facts, which, happily, are not in dispute. It is admitted that the Attorney-General received and still holds a general retainer from the Marconi Company, and that that company is at present in litigation with the Commonwealth. The honorable member for Kalgoorlie has detailed the steps that led up to the negotiations, but, perhaps, I may be permitted to emphasize the point a little. For years, the Marconi Company were in negotiation with the Government to erect their system of radio-telegraphy throughout Australia. Those negotiations ultimately failed. The tender of the Telefunken Company was accepted in regard to two stations. The Marconi Company again opened negotiations in regard to other stations, and for years those negotiations were carried on. This also failed, and the Government decided to go on with a system which its own expert had perfected and assigned to the Commonwealth. The Marconi Company alleges that this system is an infringement of its own. The claim of the Marconi Company against the Government is one of first importance, involving great sums of public money. It is of the utmost moment that the defence should be carried on with due regard to the welfare of the Commonwealth; and no one can deny that in relation thereto a direct conflict has arisen between the interests of the Marconi Company and those of the people of this country. The Attorney-General holds a general retainer from the Marconi Company. He has explained that this means little or nothing; that at present it does not create any obligation between him and the company, excepting the obligation on his part to accept a special retainer for them as against any other company if they so desire. The honorable member for Kalgoorlie, however, has very properly pointed out that people do not give money for nothing ; there must be some object in giving lawyers a general retainer. And this is so obvious that a layman must understand it. As for the amount of the retainer, that is quite immaterial. The object is to insure the contingent services of some man whose advice and counsel at a critical juncture is of material value to the prospective litigant. So much for the general retainer. But we have to look, not only at the present relations between the Marconi Company and the Attorney-General, but at the whole circumstances. Here we have the interests of the Commonwealth and the interests of the Marconi Company in vital conflict. It is not denied that the Attorney-General held a special retainer from the company in its litigation with the Commonwealth before he accepted office. He was, as the honorable member for Kalgoorlie pointed out, in a position to know exactly what the </para>
                    <para class="block">Marconi Company desired - to know precisely their objects and their plan of campaign. He appeared for the company in the Court, and probably, though we are not precisely so informed, advised them generally in regard to their position. Now he is the Attorney-General for the Crown, and the litigation is still going cn. And the gentleman who is to direct and determine generally what the Commonwealth shall do to best conserve its interests is the gentleman who was the special confidential adviser of the company a little while ago. Here, surely, is a position in which the interests of the Commonwealth may conceivably suffer. This general retainer the Attorney-General says is the merest, flimsiest filament connecting them. Why, then, does he not break it? The honorable gentleman seems to say that this motion is a reflection on his personal honour. He said a great deal about the position of professional men, and told us that reliance on their professional honour was practically the only guarantee the public or the client has. I shall say nothing to belittle the professional honour and integrity of the members of the Bar. They are a body of men whose reputation stands very high; but I have no reason to believe that their reputation stands any higher than that of any other body of men. Professional honour is no more than public honour - no more than the honour of members of Parliament, though that is impugned every day. The Attorney-General himself, at Dandenong, last night, impugned the honour of members of Parliament. It is a curious defence that the honorable gentleman sets up here in answer to the charge. He says, &#34; I have done nothing opposed to the rules of the Bar.&#34; But how do these apply to the present case? Let us suppose a trade unionist charged with some offence or conduct conceived to be improper in the circumstances. He says, &#34; Well, your Honour, I have done nothing against the rules of my society.&#34; Would that be a defence ? I do not think it would be accepted by the honorable gentleman opposite. Yet that, practically, is the only defence the Attorney-General brings forward to-day. He tells us that we must trust his honour. But we must trust every man&#39;s honour, and the honorable gentleman advances nothing new. We have to trust to men&#39;s honour in most things in this practical world of affairs. Trial by jury, which is the basis of our system of civil liberty, rests upon that principle. We must trust to the honour and unprejudiced view of every man; and, yet, I have never known a case where counsel did not challenge any man whom he thought would give, or was likely to give, a verdict against his client. What we are impugning is not the honour or the professional honour of the Attorney-General, but that natural bias, which creeps in insensibly, and which every man recognises, makes allowance for, and counteracts, wherever possible. </para>
                    <para>The Attorney-General says that we ought to believe that he comes to the deliberations of the Cabinet with a mind free from any sort of prejudice and bias, and unaffected entirely by his previous close and confidential association with the Marconi Company. I propose to quote something which I hope the Attorney-General will regard as relevant, and not altogether without interest, in order to show how he, himself, views human nature when placed in the same position as that in which he is now placed. In the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of Saturday, 21st June, is a report of an extraordinary occurrence in the High Court of Australia, in connexion with the hearing of the Tramway case. It arose through remarks made by the honorable member for Bendigo, who was appearing as counsel, who stated that it was intended to raise certain points involving, possibly, a review of a previous decision by the Court. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Duffy and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Powers were on the bench; and, under the Judiciary Act of 1912, it is necessary that a majority of the Court shall sit in order to determine constitutional cases. It followed that, unless four Judges could sit, it would be impossible to review a constitutional point already decided, and that, therefore, if in any way it was possible to drive one or two Judges from the bench, it would be impossible to have the case heard. The Attorney-General waa appearing for the other side. On the Thursday, some remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Feez,</inline> of the Brisbane Bar, brought about the retirement of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Duffy and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Powers from the bench, on the ground that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Feez</inline> would not, or did not, consent to their sitting in the case, in the new light of the Court intending to deal with a constitutional matter, and, in fact, review a former decision. The Court adjourned. When it met on the following day, the Acting Chief Justice, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Barton, reviewed the whole position. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Duffy and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Powers had both been connected with the previous case, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Duffy as counsel for the union, while <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Powers, as Crown Solicitor, had been brought indirectly into the case when the Crown intervened. The point raised in effect was that those two gentlemen, by reason of their former connexion with the case, ought not to sit in this instance. It was not pretended that they had a general retainer, or that there was the slightest connexion between them, now that they were Judges, and the litigants before the Court. They are appointed, as every honorable member knows, as High Court Justices for life. Nothing could upset their position; they had nothing to hope in the way of preferment, and nothing to fear in the way of dismissal or retrenchment; they stood there firm and impregnable. But the Attorney-General, and other counsel, objected to their sitting. It is true that the Attorney-General did not admit in so many words that he objected; but I propose to read what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Barton said, in order to make it perfectly clear that the Attorney-General was not prepared to have the case heard by a man who had been briefed by the other side, although that man was a Justice sitting on the bench. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Irvine</inline> had endeavoured to again explain his position. The explanation was not satisfactory. The Acting Chief Justice said: - </para>

                            said a little more than that. He said : - &#34; That is the position I take up now. We are willing to go on now without the Court constituting itself &#39; a full Bench. We do not desire to withdraw the invitation. If, on the other hand, this Court is to be reconstituted as a full Bench in order to see whether it should overrule the previous decision, and we were then asked if we consented to the Judges sitting, we might reconsider our decision in the absence  of the Chief Justice.&#34;

                    <para class="block">Practically then, the position thus created was that the Attorney-General, in the best interests of his clients, was not prepared to trust the judgment of two men who had been interested on the other side - no matter how remotely - and whose judgment might, therefore, be considered to be biased. He therefore objected to their presence on the Bench, and they said that they would withdraw. The case stands there as a clear, unmistakable enunciation of that principle that actuates all men in such circumstances, that they are not prepared to trust their case to any one who they think may, by past association, be biased against them. Let us consider the application of that case to present circumstances. Here is the Attorney-General, who has been counsel for the Marconi Company. He was their confidential adviser in their application for inspection, which the Commonwealth Government resisted, in the best interests of Australia. The company followed his advice. He is now counsel for the people.  His  advice is that which the Commonwealth now has to follow. It is true that he says that he has handed over the matter to his colleague, the Minister of External Affairs, but I say that the Attorney-General cannot divest himself of the functions of his office in that way. He is the chief law adviser of the Commonwealth. From my own personal experience I can say - I cannot recall instances to the contrary - that a Cabinet always takes the advice of its Attorney-General in regard to matters of law. What the Attorney-General says is acted upon. Besides, although the Attorney-General may have handed over this matter to the Minister of External Affairs, he is still a forceful character in this Cabinet. He takes part in its deliberations. He can exercise a vote, and he declares that he will not abandon that right. Yet these associations, these relations, have existed between him and that company whose interests are so vitally in conflict with those of the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- The very fact that the Attorney-General handed over the matter to the Minister of External Affairs, and refused to attend a Cabinet meeting when the matter was discussed, are proofs as strong as Holy Writ that the motion which we are now submitting is amply warranted. If the honorable and learned gentleman really believed that there was nothing in this general retainer, if he believed that it was really a mere nothing, like a distant relationship of no particular importance, why did he hand over his office in relation to this most important matter to another Minister, and why did he refrain from attending Cabinet meetings ? <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, it</inline> is because he knows perfectly well that the public have just cause to suspect unconscious bias - nothing more; there is no question of personal honour in this - that there is room for dissatisfaction. There is not, I believe, any question of the personal honour of any man who is called upon to act in a public position. I believe that ninety-nine jurymen out of one hundred go into the box with a determination to give a verdict according to the evidence ; but, nevertheless, every lawyer knows that it is a wise thing to challenge six jurymen out of ten who file through. I will put the matter in another way. Let us see exactly how it applies. I have said that the Cabinet are the directors of Australia Unlimited. They carry on the business of Australia Unlimited in secret. No one knows of their deliberations except by the consequences. It is not an uncommon thing for objection to be made to a Judge sitting to try a case if  His  Honor has shares in a company whose affairs are before the Court. We have seen, in this particular case, that objection was taken to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Duffy because he had been counsel, and to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Powers because he had been Crown Solicitor, in a previous case; and the Attorney-General himself regarded it as questionable that they should sit on the Bench. But, see how that applies in this instance : Let us reverse the position. Suppose that the Attorney-General had held a general retainer for the Crown, that he had been counsel for the Crown, and had then become a director of the Marconi Company. Does any man mean to say for one moment that his fellow directors would have tolerated his retaining the general retainer for the Crown when the Commonwealth and the Marconi Company were in litigation? Will any man tell me that the Marconi Company would allow one of its directors to hold a general retainer for the Commonwealth when the company was in litigation with the Commonwealth ? Of course not. Every company demands from its directors unwavering allegiance. It would not avail a director of the Marconi Company to quote the rules of the Bar, or the rules of any society whatsoever.  His  fellow directors would say, and very naturally, &#34;A man cannot serve two masters; the interests of the Marconi Company and the interests of the Commonwealth Government are at variance; a man cannot hold a general retainer from the Commonwealth Government and serve our interests at the same time.&#34; I do not think that there is any answer to that position. </para>

                    <para>And now a word on another point. A defence of the honorable member&#39;s conduct has been put forward by Professor Harrison Moore and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mitchell,</inline> by Messrs. Blake and Riggall, and by the Attorney-General himself, in regard to the rules of the Bar. All these I accept as statements of the facts so far as the rules, practice, and etiquette of the Bar is concerned. But they are not material to the point under discussion. There is no reflection on the Attorney-General&#39;s professional honour, any more than there was any reflection on the personal honour of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Duffy and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Powers. Yet, as I have said, those two gentlemen were, owing to their having had, in the most remote possible way, a relation with this particular case, objected to, because it was considered that they were calculated to be biased. In the opinion of the Attorney-General, they were not good enough to try the case in the interests of his clients. Why? Because they had acted for and advised the other side. Human nature is built that way. The generality of men cannot purge themselves of bias so completely as to satisfy those who desire justice that it is safe to leave their case in the hands of a man who has been a partisan on the other side. </para>
                    <para>This motion is not levelled from the stand-point of party, nor with a desire to embarrass the Government. It is put forward in the best interests of the nation, and, indeed, at the request of the honorable and learned gentleman himself, in order that we may lay down, in this year of our Lord, 1913, what is a proper rule of conduct in this respect. And this is the only point to be decided. We are not to look to precedents; but we are to consider whether a man who has had intimate relations with a company now making a claim against the Government, and holds now a general retainer from that company, who is charged with the welfare of the Commonwealth, a custodian of the public purse, who determines how much a man shall be taxed, and how the money shall be spent, is a fit person to be in charge of Commonwealth interests. It is admitted that the honorable and learned gentleman was in close relation to the Marconi Company not very long ago, and that he has not severed his relation with it. We wish to have it determined, therefore, whether he is in a position to see Commonwealth interests in that clear and unbiased light which is necessary. It appears to me that there is no question but that such a position gives rise to very grave doubts. There is no question of personal honour or professional honour in this question. They are not relevant to this case, and they do not affect the position taken up here. It is no use referring us to the rules of the Bar. We must remember how the conception of public duty has evolved. It is not so very long ago since a man could be Attorney-General and at the same time accept a brief against the Crown. Such a practice was at one time fully sanctioned by the rules of the Bar. But public opinion has swept by the rules of the Bar, and the Bar lags panting after public opinion. From time to time it brings up its antiquated procedure to the level of civilization, which always goes on ahead. Therefore, I say most emphatically that it is not for us to be concerned with the rules of the Bar. We are concerned with rules of conduct governing public men in the execution of their public duties. We do not say for one instant that the rules of the Bar are not in perfect accordance with honour and morality so far as they are designed to protect the interests of clients. They are. But that is not here to the point. Here is a case where there is a conflict of interests. </para>
                    <para class="block">That conflict is real. It concerns matters of such importance that if the Marconi Company wins, the result mav involve a matter of &#163;50,000, &#163;60,000 or &#163;100,000 to this Commonwealth. No one can say that here is not a real and tangible conflict of interests. No one can say for a moment that the honorable gentleman would be accepted as a Judge or as an arbiter, supposing that - as was suggested - the claim of the Marconi Company against the Commonwealth were submitted to arbitration. </para>

                            <para>- Suppose he was not Attorney-General. Suppose he was outside. The point is this: I want honorable members to look at it from the point of view that there is no reflection in this course. We consider that we are justified in moving this motion and in asking the House to carry it. Whatever may be the fate of the motion, I should be the last to say, or to permit any other person to say, so far as I could prevent it, that any reflection has been cast on the integrity of the Attorney-General, or on his personal or professional honour. The motion has nothing to do with those things; it has to do with the position created by the circumstances in which the honorable gentleman has been placed. These circumstances, in my opinion, make it incompatible with the best interests of the Commonwealth that he should continue to hold the general retainer of the Marconi Company, and he ought to return it. </para>

                        <para>. - It is not necessary to say very much on this subject, because the ground has been covered by the concise, clear, and, to every dispassionate listener, convincing statement of the Attorney-General; but I wish to say a word or two in reply to the remarks of the honorable member for West Sydney. He referred to the Tramways case, which was mentioned in Court on the 21st June, as being absolutely conclusive on this question; but I cannot see that the points then raised have any relevance to those raised by the motion. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Duffy had held a brief in the Tramways case before his appointment to the High Court Bench, and it would have been contrary to all principles of ethics, and to the professional practice which is consistent with them, that he should try a case in which he had been engaged as counsel. Had he been merely briefed, he could have&#39; returned the brief, and sat on the case without the slightest reflection being cast on his impartiality. Speaking from a long memory, I recall an instance in which that was done. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Williams had been tendered a brief in the Ferret case - I think it was in 1880; I happened to be in Court at the time - and was subsequently appointed to the Bench, but it was agreed that he should try the case, although a criminal one, because he had not read the brief, and had no knowledge of the facts that could in any way affect his judicial discretion. In the case to which the honorable member for West Sydney alluded, some of the facts must have become known to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Duffy, as counsel, and to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Powers, when acting as Crown Solicitor, at a preliminary stage, and it is inconceivable that, without the consent of the parties interested, either Justice would have sat to adjudicate in the matter. Later, a constitutional question arose, which was common to the Tramways case and to other cases, and I think counsel consented to both the Justices sitting under certain circumstances, and up to a certain point. Those appearing for the parties had such absolute confidence that the traditions of the Bar would be followed by the Justices named, and&#39; knew so well that opinions, if any, expressed had been expressed in a representative capacity, that they felt that they could trust them to give judgment absolutely free from predilection. Subsequently, however, a question arose as to the constitutionality of the Court in regard to certain points. </para>

                            <para>- Under ordinary circumstances, consent would not have been given, the reason being that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jus</inline> tice Powers and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Duffy had not only either sent or received briefs, but had acted in the case. As to the position of the Attorney-General in regard to the Marconi Company, he severed his connexion with their litigation with the Commonwealth immediately on accepting office, and has stated that, if a matter should arise in Cabinet requiring the exercise of his discretion as a Minister, he could not - not because of his general retainer, but because of his knowledge of the facts - in duty to* the Marconi Company, give a decision. He could not, under the professional rules that operate, having become, as an advocate, absolutely familiar with the case of the Marconi Company, give a judgment, as a Cabinet Minister, affecting the company, because to do so would affect, through knowledge acquired while the relationship existed, a former client. The honorable member for West Sydney, without impugning the accuracy of the statement as to what the rules of the Bar prescribe, contended that those rules merely regulate the procedure of counsel in their dealings with one another, or with their clients. Does he say that they are not consistent with the rules of conduct which should obtain in this House ? The object of citing them was to show that they were absolutely consistent. The first part of the motion is a homily, and the second an incomplete transcript of something said by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Asquith.</inline> I ask what &#34; contractual relation &#34; exists between the Attorney-General and the Marconi Company. A general retainer does not bind counsel to accept a special retainer or brief in all circumstances. </para>

                        <para>If the counsel who has accepted a general retainer from one party should be offered a special retainer or brief by another party, the general retainer entitles the party who has given it to reasonable notice before the offered special retainer or brief is accepted. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">That means that a counsel holding a general retainer from one party, and receiving a special retainer or brief from another party, must give notice of the fact to the party retaining him, so that that party may have reasonable opportunity of giving him a brief or special retainer, which he must accept so long as he does nob embarrass himself by doing so. In Halsbury &#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Laws of England,</inline> Vol. 2, page 407, paragraph 680, it is stated that a special retainer, or brief, need not be accepted where embarrassment would result, and it is then the duty of counsel to refuse to accept it. For instance, the fact that the honorable member for Flinders had become Attorney-General would have entitled him to refuse a special retainer or brief from the Marconi Company. The distinction which is overlooked is the one between the general retainer and the special retainer or brief, the acceptance of which might be in violation of his duty to a client. The position of the Attorney-General, then, is that he is not obliged to take a brief from the Marconi Company, so long as by doing that it can to any extent affect his public duty as a member of the Cabinet. As a matter of fact, he would not, according to the rules of the Bar. The honorable member for West Sydney lias talked about the rules of the Bar. We have pretty good evidence that these rules are consistent with the highest ethics of political life. There is, perhaps, no profession whose hands in this matter have been cleaner than have been those of the Bar. That is the experience in almost every country. So far, then, as to the difference between the general and the special retainer. But I would go further, and point out the position which is always assumed by counsel. They do not surrender their general retainers when they become Ministers of the Crown. Take the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Isaacs. It was mentioned a few days ago that he had accepted a retainer from South Australia in reference to the Murray question. I have here a copy of his opinion, which shows that as soon as acting on a special retainer became inconsistent with his duty to the Government, he declined to advise, but that so long as it was not inconsistent with his duty to the Government, as Attorney-General, he continued to advise under his general retainer. </para>

                            <para>- The occasion for deciding that point did not arise in reference to the general retainer, but only arose when a case for opinion was submitted to him, which might possibly cover the Commonwealth&#39;s sphere, as well as the relations of two States to one another. The point in issue was the riparian rights of the States against each other, and as that involved the consideration, to some extent, of the navigation question, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Isaacs,</inline> in effect, said, &#34;I, as Attorney-General, decline to advise on the navigation aspect of the question, because in doing that I might be doing something which would be inconsistent with my position as Attorney-General.&#34; But he did not return his general retainer to the State. So far from doing that, he actually acted on the retainer up to a certain point. </para>

In other words, he advised on the riparian relations of the two States, keeping his general retainer; but he did not advise on the navigation rights, because that might possibly touch the Commonwealth relation to the matter, and, as such, embarrass him in his position as Attorney-General. My honorable and learned colleague has discontinued all connexion with the Marconi case, so far as it relates to the Government; he is out of it altogether. He has a general retainer, under which he is not obliged to take any brief which could possibly touch his position as Attorney-General. If the time ever does arrive when there is another case against the Commonwealth, and a brief or special retainer is tendered to him, then the moment will come when he must decide between his obligation to the public or to the Crown as Attorney-General. He would not, and could not, accept a special retainer; he cannot act for both sides. </para>
                    <para>The rules of the Bar show that he is not obliged to accept any brief which could possibly touch or embarrass him in his position as Attorney-General. What, then, have honorable members to complain of ? What code of ethics applicable to or practised in Parliament is violated 1 I will put the position without in any sense wishing to be personal. Are honorable members to say, for instance, if a member of the House happens to be secretary of a society, whether it is one for employers or for employes, whether it is in a voluntary or paid capacity, he cannot, on any matter of general legislation which turns up here, record a vote ? Are they to say that if an honorable member is promoted to Cabinet rank, whether as Attorney-General or as Minister of External Affairs, and happens to be in any pecuniary relation to an organization whose doings, or whose policy, or practice may have to be considered by the Cabinet, he must at once, before any question calling for exercise of discretion has arisen, choose between his Cabinet position and, one might say, his position as a member of the House, and his relation to the association ? Why are you to frame one law applicable to one class of society and another law applicable to other classes? </para>

                            <para>-According to that theory, a man must not be a member of a corporation because his vote here might be prejudiced, because there is such a relation between his position as a member of a municipal corporation and that of a member of the House, that he must discontinue his relation with the corporation if he wishes to act honestly as a member of the House. He must get rid of all associations with which he is connected that might bias his judgment here. The Constitution does not say so ; it draws a clear distinction between what is a substantive interest and what is a mere shadowy one. There is no objection to an honorable member casting his vote in the House in relation to some matter affecting a company of which he is a member. It is only where the membership is less than twenty-five that the interest becomes one of substance. If you followed the suggestion of honorable members all round the compass, it would mean that it would be almost impossible to get the best class of men to sit in Parliament. The very same thing applies to a Minister. There is no necessity, however, to wander into these comparative irrelevancies. The point is that there is no contractual relation that is violated here, or, indeed, established by any general retainer. The moment that self-interest clashes with one&#39;s duty to the Crown, or to the public, as a member of Parliament, at that moment the general retainer is conditioned by another rule, and that is that the Minister affected can refuse to act on the special retainer. </para>

                            <para>- When the special retainer is tendered, the Minister is not obliged to accept it if he will be embarrassed by doing so. In England, automatically, now, the moment an Attorney-General is appointed, all his &#39;private retainers go, because he must only do Crown work. When the position of Attorney-General was similar to ours, when he could still carry on private practice, they still trusted to the honour of the Bar, which has never been ignored. No honorable member will assert that. Has there ever been a case in which a member, as regards retainers, has been successfully challenged in the House ? I do not remember one-. </para>

I do not wish to dwell upon the case. The rules regulating the conduct of barristers, as laid down in 1892 in England, are absolutely, in every point, consistent with, the code of etiquette which ought to operate with honorable members. From time to time these matters are challenged in Parliament. There was a discussion in Parliament on the Marconi case. It was said that even <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Carson and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. F.</inline> E. Smith ought not to accept retainers in the Matin case and the Chesterton case on the ground that their judgment in Parliament might be affected ; but that has not been accepted as a principle operating even with legislators. </para>

                            <para>- However, I do not wish to labour this question. My point is that no person accepting a general retainer is bound to do anything which at all affects his position, either as a member of Parliament, or as a member of the Ministry. The moment the two interests clash, he may refuse a brief, or decline a retainer. That is the position here. Any knowledge of the facts which the Attorney-General may have acquired as counsel for the Marconi Company is at an end. Consequently, his judgment cannot possibly be biased. He is not obliged to accept any brief which that company may tender, and therefore I fail to see why this motion has been tabled. It has been said that the Attorney-General should not vote upon the motion. Have honorable members gone behind <inline font-style="italic">May,</inline> or behind the textbooks as to the right of an honorable member to vote? I could cite half-a-dozen cases to show that the Attorney-General is entitled to vote upon this question. </para>

                            <para>- Votes have been challenged in a great number of cases, and it has been held that where there was not a direct and proximate pecuniary interest the member was entitled to vote. Upon one occasion, when a motion was tabled to reduce the salary of a Minister, it was held that he was entitled to vote because the question at issue was a public one. I repeat that there is absolutely no justification for tabling this motion. </para>

                        <para>.- The Attorney-General has said that he is very interested to know how I intend to vote upon this question. I do not propose to allow him to be consumed with anxiety until the division is taken, and therefore I tell him now that I intend to vote for the motion. Debate as to legal etiquette or legal ethics, the position of which is embodied in the rules of the Bar, is to a great extent beside the issue. I look at the matter from this point of view, &#34; What does the man in the street think?&#34; </para>

                            <para>- The position is clearly laid down in a work by the honorable gentleman himself, which applies the principle that I submit is the principle which should govern this matter. He should be judged by that very principle. I do not prefer a charge of personal corruption or personal bias against the honorable gentleman. I have had the opportunity of being associated with him in the conduct of certain cases, and I have also been opposed to him in the conduct of others. ,So far as I know not one word can be said which would put a stain upon his personal honour. But this question, as I view it, is one of political propriety, and I say that it should not be governed by what the fraternity of lawyers, to which the Attorney-General and myself belong, may think, but by the effect which his action is likely to have upon the people of the community. </para>

                            <para>- The whole matter has been debated from the point of view of the rules which were so extensively quoted both by the honorable member for Kalgoorlie in moving the motion, and by the Attorney-General in his reply. The Attorney-General, it has been truly urged, is the legal watch-dog of the Commonwealth, and the man in the street naturally says, &#34; Here is the legal watchdog of the Commonwealth, and here is a case in which he has been extensively engaged.&#34; The honorable gentleman says that he has thrown that case overboard - that he has no further connexion with the Marconi Company. But there is another link between him and that company in what is known as a general retainer. </para>

                            <para>- I do not propose to subject myself to the cross-examination of the Attorney-General, he himself objected to &#39;that very thing a few days ago. It is his duty to jealously watch any attack upon the Commonwealth. He has been engaged in previous litigation between the Marconi Company and the Commonwealth, and still retains what is undoubtedly a link between him and that company. On his own showing it is a link. The honorable gentleman might have gone a little further when this matter was previously mentioned in the House. He then told us that all that a general retainer meant was that the person retained had to give notice to the person retaining him if he were approached with a view to his acceptance of a brief by the other side. In my opinion, that is not all that it means. Putting it in common parlance, it means that the persons who have given, a general retainer have the first call upon the services of the person retained. If there are no other countervailing circumstances, therefore the Marconi Company has a right to the first call upon the services of the gentleman it has retained. </para>

                            <para>- Accusations of absolute ignorance of the situation were freely  levelled by the Attorney-General at honorable members upon this side of the Chamber. Prom beginning to end the position has been plainly put, and plainly apprehended by them. To understand what is a retainer is the simplest thing in the world. The dramatic castigation of the honorable member for Kalgoorlie by the Attorney-General was one which I was very sorry to see him attempt to administer. For the honorable gentleman to come down from his high legal eminence and endeavour to cast a slur upon and to belittle the steps which the honorable member for Kalgoorlie took towards en&#39;tering the legal profession - few though&#39; they may have been- was unworthy . of him. What constitutes a retainer is  fully dealt with in Halsbury&#39;.s <inline font-style="italic">Laws of England,</inline> which has been referred to by the Minister of External Affairs. There are two classes of retainers. A retainer is the engagement of a barrister to give his services to a client, and involves the payment of a fee, without which there can be no retainer. That is the first link - the payment of the fee, which constitutes practically the retainer. The rules bearing upon this question are set out on page 403 of that volume. There are &#34; special retainers &#34; - the direct engagement of counsel in the matter - and the &#34; general retainer,&#34; the nature of which has not been misunderstood, and under which the person retaining has a first call upon the services of the person retained. Now, the Attorney-General has retained a retainer from the Marconi Company. That company may say to him, &#34; We want your services in particular litigation. We have first call upon you in that litigation.&#34; </para>

                            <para>- No, I will not. I do not wish to prolong this debate, since the question is one that we may all apprehend, and upon which we may all readily come to a decision. The honorable member for West Sydney put the case very clearly and emphatically, expressing many of the views that I hold, and which it is unnecessary for me to repeat. The honorable member likened the position of the Cabinet to that of the directors of a company, and, by the way, I got into trouble recently for using such an illustration. The position is, as the honorable member says, that the Attorney-General is one of the directors of the great company of Australia Unlimited. The Cabinet have to steer the Commonwealth ship of State clear of financial and other rocks which beset it, and we have to ask ourselves what may be said of the position of the honorable gentleman whom we may call the legal director of the Commonwealth. He has taken a fee from a company which is now in litigation with the Commonwealth, and the interests of the Commonwealth he should be one of the first to conserve. </para>

                            <para>- No. We are debating the position of an honorable member who is the legal director of the Commonwealth - the position of a Minister who has taken a fee from a company which is now in litigation with the Commonwealth Government, and whose duty it is, and not the duty of the Minister of External Affairs, to map out the clear course of the Commonwealth in the troubled waters of the law. Those who know the honorable gentleman would not suspect him of personal corruption in the matter - we would not say that a miserable fee of &#163;5 5s. would deter him from doing his duty to the Commonwealth, but we have to consider what members of the community may think of his position. Our object is not to condemn the Attorney-General in person, but to lay down a general principle. The honorable gentleman has done something which comes within the general principle that the Opposition believes should apply. He, on the other hand, thinks that it ought not to apply, so that the matter resolves itself into, not a personal charge, but a difference of opinion in regard to the application of a general principle. I commenced by saying that the question is not one of legal etiquette. We have not to decide whether the Attorney-General&#39;s action comes within particular rules laid down by the profession for the guidance of the profession. We have rather to ask ourselves what the public may reasonably think of the situation that has arisen. The honorable gentleman&#39;s position is not exactly analogous to, but, as has been said, is certainly very like that of a Judge. In the case of the Tramway Company, in which I had the honour of appearing, while the Attorney-General was one of the eminent counsel on the other side, what occurred ? When the case was called on, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Duffy and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Powers refused to take any part in the hearing, not unless one side expressed their willingness that they should sit, but unless both sides should specially request them to sit. It was only because both sides specially requested them to sit that they did so. </para>

If he will allow me to do so, I shall show him that there is a great difference between the position of those Justices and that occupied by the Attorney-General. In the Tramway case, the Court had to deal with two private litigants, who could agree to give up any right they possessed. Their right was to. have their cause tried by unbiased Judges, and either or both could object or agree to the case being tried by a Bench of which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Duffy and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Powers were members. Both agreed to their sitting. Here, however, we have the whole Commonwealth involved, and it is a question of the propriety of the conduct of the Attorney-General </para>

                            <para>- The Prime Minister will not lead me from what I want to say. The sole connexion which the two Justices had had with the Tramways case may be briefly stated. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Powers was Crown Solicitor when the case originated, and his office instructed counsel to appear and apply for leave to intervene. He never saw the papers; he never had anything to do with them.  His  name simply appeared upon them as Crown Solicitor of the Commonwealth. &#34; Yet,&#34; he said, &#34; here am I debarred from adjudicating on this case, with which I have had nothing to do. All that has happened is that my name appeared on the papers, yet I feel myself debarred from sitting unless you specially request me to sit.&#34; Surely that was a slight - a very slight/ - connexion with the case, slighter even than the connexion of the Attorney-General with the Marconi Company by reason of his acceptance of a general retainer. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Duffy had not appeared for either party, but on one occasion he had appeared in a special case for the Commonwealth, intervening between the two parties. Because of this he said that he could not take part in the hearing of the case unless he was specially requested by both sides to do so. Why did he take &#34;up that stand ? He did not regard himself as biased, nor did <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Powers consider he was biased. No one else, knowing the men, would have regarded them as biased; but the principle that guided them was that if they took part in the hearing of a case, with which they had had even the most remote connexion, people might regard them as biased, and the administration of justice, therefore, might fall into contempt. That is the principle on which the Attorney-General, in my judgment, should act. He ought to say, &#34; I should not keep even this slight connexion between myself and a company that is in litigation with the Commonwealth, not because I regard myself as biased, not because my friends would regard me as biased, but because the public might do so.&#34; This principle is made clear in a learned and useful work dealing with justices of the peace, of which the Attorney-General and my learned friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wanliss,</inline> are joint authors. In this work, the honorable gentleman deals with the question of bias, because of pecuniary interest, in the case of justices of the peace. </para>

                        <para>The general principle governing the question of the qualification of Justices to sit and adjudicate, and which is to be found stated in nearly al&#39; the cases referred to, is that Justices must not adjudicate in cases where there exists a reasonable suspicion of bias, and if that be shown the decision is bad : it is not necessary to prove the actual existence of bias. In a late case in our own Courts it was laid down that a Justice is disqualified from hearing any case in which &#34; The circumstances warrant a considerable number of the community reasonably in suspecting him to be biased.&#34; </para>

Clearly, the question is not whether the rules of the profession govern the matter, but whether the Attorney-General can stand before the community and say, &#34; Although I am retained by the Marconi Company, I can still maintain an unbiased attitude. I cannot be suspected even by many people of being biased.&#34; He knows, and we, too, know, that he is not, but it is the suspicion of the many <inline font-style="italic">- oioo - to</inline> which we must have regard, and it is by that principle that the honorable gentleman should steer his course. </para>

I belong to that honorable fraternity of which the Attorney-General is so distinguished a member; a fraternity described by Shelley as &#34; Skilled to snare the feet of Justice in the toils of law,&#34; and I hope that the honorable gentleman will see that it is not the standard of the legal profession only, but the standard of the people of the country, by which he should regulate his action. The honorable member for West Sydney likened this Government, as any other Government, to a directorate; and, as to the duties of a directorate, in one famous case, which will be well known to the Attorney-General himself - a case concerning the Northern Territory - Lord Justice Bowen said - </para>

                        <para>. - I regret, and in the light of the debate, I venture to think that a number of honorable members opposite have reason also to regret, the terms of this ill-advised motion. I could quite understand the lofty view which animated the leader of the Opposition when he said that it was desirable that, on this subject, there should be introduced an abstract motion at an opportune time. Such a motion was practically invited by the Attorney-General himself, and had one been proposed little exception could have been taken to it. The motion before us, however, is of a very different nature. In the first portion of it, there is laid down certain parliamentary ethics to which no one can take exception, and which, I hope, and indeed think, animate honorable members generally in the conduct of business in this House. The motion, however, goes on to deliberately propose a vote of censure on the Attorney-General; and it cannot be accepted from that stand-point. Honorable members opposite must admit that the latter part of the motion means censure or nothing; its collocation with the earlier portion clearly shows that to be the intention. Honorable members opposite may express their admiration of the Attorney-General, and affirm and re-affirm&#39; their definite assurance that they do not, in the remotest degree, doubt his probity or honour - </para>

All their protestations - indeed, they seem to protest too much - as to the honour aud integrity of the Attorney-General, and the anxiety of the honorable member for West Sydney that nothing in the motion shall be regarded as in any way a reflection, go for nought. When we look at the terms of the motion itself, we see that it is not of the character which was suggested by the leader of the Opposition, and which would have been assented to by the Attorney-General himself. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Kalgoorlie said that all the members of his party were going to vote for the motion. Do honorable members opposite deny that all the members of the Labour party who are present are going to vote for the motion ? If they are, it shows that this is obviously and intentionally a party move. From that standpoint it has to be resented; and, moreover, it is deplorable that such a motion should have been launched. As I say, all the protestations as to the admiration of the honour, probity, and integrity of the Attorney-General go for nought under the circumstances; and the best evidence of that is the speech of the honorable member for Bendigo. That honorable member understands this question most thoroughly - none better - from a legal stand-point; and he has been obliged by party loyalty to give his adherence to this motion. </para>

The honorable member for West Sydney and the honorable member for Bendigo protested against the Attorney- General handing over his authority in this matter to the Minister of External Affairs. Further, the honorable member for West Sydney said that Parliament is entitled to the whole of the services of the Attorney-General in this case; and that point has been emphasized and supported by honorable members on every occasion of its pronouncement. Later on, however, the honorable member for West Sydney most conclusively justified every action that has been taken by the Attorney-General. We have been told by the Attorney-General that, because of his former association with the Marconi Company, he had handed the whole matter over to the Minister of External </para>

                            <para>- The very best justification that could be urged in favour of what the Attorney-General has done has been put forward conclusively by honorable members opposite. Nothing could be clearer than that the Attorney-General has acted, not only in accordance with Bar etiquette, which is a subordinate matter, but according to the highest ethics of parliamentary life, and the highest moral standards. I suggest, therefore, that there is no case on the merits at all, but that the case urged by the Opposition depends solely on the fact that the Attorney-General holds what is called a general retainer. It is admitted that, by reason of his former association with the company, he could not have dealt with the case at all in Cabinet. If he could not have dealt with the case without the retainer, the mere fact that be had a general retainer could make no difference, as lie was already disqualified from dealing with the matter. But let us deal with the matter from the general retainer stand-point. Having made it quite clear that the Attorney-General could not deal with this matter a&#38; all in Cabinet, having regard to his former association with the company, &#39;I venture to say that the general retainer cannot make even an infinitesimal difference. Because if he could not deal with the case in Cabinet, having the retainer, he could not deal with it without the retainer. He has not dealt with it. More-ever, he has, so far, broken that general retainer by intimating to the company that, as far as the Commonwealth is concerned, he has completely severed his connexion with the case. Could the Attorney-General have done more? </para>

                            <para>- In other words, my honorable friends suggest that the Attorney-General is not to be permitted to earn his livelihood by his profession by engaging in private practice; if so-, that is a totally different question to the one under discussion. They object to the Attorney-General taking a brief for this particular company in litigation wholly apart from Commonwealth interests. All that the general retainer means is that the Marconi Company is to have notice from him in regard to any litigation affecting them in which a brief is offered to him - nothing more. In these circumstances, I urge that everything that could be done by the Attorney-General has been done. If he has broken the general retainer, as far as this company is concerned, he has severed his connexion with the company. He has refused to take any other briefs from them in connexion with Commonwealth affairs, or to advise them as to their interests; and, in order to make sure that all room for suspicion will be removed, he has stated that he has handed the matter relating to the company over to the Minister of External Affairs, and has added that he intends to take no action in the case, as far as the Cabinet is concerned. </para>

                            <para>- My honorable friend is ungenerous in making such a suggestion. I ask again, What more could be expected from an honorable man ? My honorable friends opposite are laying down a strange principle. We are a very small community, which is not largely composed of leisured men. This Parliament of ours consists of men who are actively engaged in business, professionally, commercially, and otherwise. Necessarily, matters in which we are directly or indirectly interested must occasionally come up from time to time. It must be left to the honour and rectitude of honorable members themselves, in cases of this kind, to avoid any suspicion whatever of voting in matters in which they are directly or indirectly interested. It is a tradition of parliamentary ethics, well known and well recognised, that that rule shall be followed. The Attorney-General, having shaped his course in accordance with that high tradition, ought not to be singled out for censure in the terms of this motion. If my honorable friends opposite will fully consider the matter, they will, I feel satisfied, realize that it is desirable that the motion should not be persisted in. I suggest to them, in view of all that has taken place, that it should be withdrawn, particularly as it is obviously recognised to be a direct motion of censure on a prominent member of the Government. </para>

                        <para>. - I am prepared to admit that when the honorable member for Kalgoorlie first brought this matter before the House I paid very little attention to it. But during the last two or three weeks, since the question has been discussed and in view of the fact that a direct motion was to be moved, I felt it to be my duty to make myself acquainted with the issues at stake. 1 feel sure that with two notorious exceptions every honorable member is anxious that when the personal honour and integrity of any member of this House is assailed, we should be very guarded in our expressions and weigh our votes. I hasten to add that, as far as I am concerned, I do not in the slightest degree impugn the personal honour and integrity of the Attorney-General. I go further, and say that, in my opinion, if this motion were carried, it would not affect the position of the Government. As far as I am concerned, this is not a motion of censure, and I will try to deal with it apart from any desire to attack the Government. In my opinion, the carrying of it would not affect the position of the Government. But the Attorney-General would have to resign his general retainer from the Marconi Company. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable gentleman, if he remained a member of the Government, would also have to resign his positions of director of an insurance company and director of a bank. I do not intend, to quote from law books, nor to fall back on dictionaries, because, were I to do so, I might get out of my depth. But it is fortunate that there have already been two discussions similar to this in Australian Legislatures. One of the cases was not absolutely analogous, though very similar to this, but the other was on absolutely the same lines. In the first case, Attorney- General Barton was arraigned by members of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly for having accepted a brief against the Railway Commissioners of the State; in the second, Attorney-General Isaacs was arraigned by members of this House for accepting a retainer from the South Australian Government against Victoria. </para>

                            <para>- The opinions which were expressed in the two debates should be helpful to us to-night, because eminent lawyers and prominent laymen took part in the- discussions. I shall not discuss the question now before us as the other two cases were discussed by some of the speakers. For instance, I shall not deal with it as the honorable member for Wentworth dealt with the Isaacs case, when he said that &#34; honorable members of the legal profession always regarded questions of fees as of the supremest importance.&#34; Neither shall I deal with it as the Isaacs case was dealt with by the honorable member for Werriwa, who, referring to the honorable member for Kalgoorlie - who was at the time studying law - said that &#34; he ought to have learned the first part of a barrister&#39;s duty, which was to look after his fees.&#34; Nor do I intend to discuss the case in the manner adopted by the present Prime Minister when dealing with the Isaacs case, when the honorable member for Wentworth, having expressed regret that Attorney-General Isaacs had not seen fit to be present to explain the exact position of affairs, said, &#34;Why should he? He is earning money,&#34; which prompted the honorable member for Lang to ask, &#34;Does not the Attorney-General receive a very fair salary?&#34; It would be impertinent and presumptuous were I to take any other stand in regard to the legal profession than this : that, whilst we as laymen may sometimes joke at their expense, barristers are members of a noble profession, and, with few exceptions, such as obtain in all callings, should be spoken of in the highest terms. . The debates to which I have referred contain a great deal of information, and show that, in matters of this kind, it is not wise to be guided too much by members of the legal profession. Although I speak in the highest terms of their honour, it would seem that at times lawyers are warped in their judgment by the traditions of the Bar, or the etiquette of their profession. The honorable member for Parramatta took practically the same -stand in the Barton case as he did in the Isaacs case, and said practically the same thing in the two debates ; I have not often accused him of saying the same thing twice. When dealing with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Attorney-General</inline> Barton, he said - </para>

                    <para>As <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> public man I do not allow my personal friendships to close my mouth, and it would be a bad thing for the people of this country when a law officer of the Crown, such as the Attorney-General, can be retained by those who are fighting against the public. It adds a great weight to the case of the plaintiff, or defendant, as the case may be, that such high and distinguished men should be their counsel, and when distinguished lawyers become high and distinguished public men their first duty is to the public of this country. If they cannot earn a living without taking briefs against the public of the country they should resign their public positions. That is my view in a few words as to this case. </para>

The honorable member who has just resumed his seat asked, &#34; Would you say that the Attorney-General should not take any private practice ?&#34; I do not say he. should not take any private practice, but I do say that it would be a very peculiar position if the Attorney-General took a case even in a. private capacity for the Marconi Company, his hands being tied here as a representative of the people. I admit that it would apply to him equally whether he was a private member or a Minister. </para>

                            <para>- I would like honorable members to read the whole of the debate that took place when the honorable, member for Parramatta arraigned Attorney-General Isaacs because he had *. brief from South Australia against Victoria. It was not a brief against the Commonwealth. The contention in that debate was that possibly the time might come when the question of some rights in the big rivers might be brought within the sphere of Commonwealth politics, and, consequently, the honorable member stated that, in his opinion, the Attorney-General ought not to accept a retainer,, even from a neighbouring State against; another State. </para>

                            <para>- I voted the other way. The gravamen of that charge was that possibly a question of riparian rights between two States might involve the Commonwealth. There is a greater probability of the Marconi Company coming; within the sphere of Commonwealth law and being dealt with from the Commonwealth stand-point, even if the honorable member should take a private case on its behalf, than there was a probability of South Australia or Victoria, on a question of riparian rights, being brought, within the Commonwealth jurisdiction. </para>

                        <para>I do not say that it is actually wrong for him to have done this, but it is getting near the border-line, and it is highly desirable, in my opinion, so that there may be no cause of suspicion that he should come to another decision. The consideration of this matter should be above party influence, but, with all due respect to the Minister, without saying a word against him personally, or impugning his motives, I think he has not come to the wisest decision. </para>

                    <para>During the course of that debate the present Prime Minister stated that if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Isaacs</inline> would give up his general retainer he would be satisfied. We take up the same position. If the Attorney-General will give up his general retainer with the Marconi Company we shall be satisfied. The present Prime Minister, on the occasion to which I have alluded, said his position was that, if the honorable and learned member had not stated that night that he intended to accept a further retainer from the South Australian Government he would have been satisfied. </para>

                            <para>- To my mind, it is an awkward position for a member of a Government to be a director of a large company. In this connexion, I am rather surprised that the Attorney-General did not act as the Postmaster-General acted. The Postmaster-General resigned his connexion with a bank immediately he became a Minister of the Crown. I think that his example is a very good one to follow. During the last Parliament, members of the Labour party were taunted with having failed to deal with the Tobacco Trust, because they were said to be in some way or other interested in the tobacco monopoly. </para>

Is he not likely to have his judgment warped and his hand stayed because he is a director- </para>

                            <para>- Upon what Bin did he make it? It seems to me impossible that a man can conscientiously be a director of a private insurance company and a member of a Government which is going to introduce insurance legislation at one and the same time. I do not know whether the scheme which the Government intend to submit is to be a voluntary or a compulsory scheme. But no matter what may be its character, it will necessarily conflict with private interests. </para>

                            <para>- I say that a Minister who is a director of a private company should retire from the latter position. We have a Commonwealth Bank, and it seems to me that a Minister cannot with propriety continue to hold the office of director of a private bank. I say very readily that I intend to vote for this motion, not as a censure with respect to the past, but as a direction for the future. The time has come when not only members of the Government, but private members of Parliament in Australia, should realize that their first call is to the people of this country. </para>

                        <para>.- I have listened to this discussion with a good deal of interest. Member after member of the Opposition has told the Attorney-General what a splendid man he is, and that they would not think of casting any aspersion upon his personal character. They say that he is an excellent lawyer, an honorable man, an admirable Attorney-General, and so forth. But, while they speak in this way, they submit a motion which, if carried, would practically drive the Attorney-General out of the Ministry. As showing that that is in the minds of honorable members opposite, I have only to point out that the last honorable member to address the House referred to the honorable gentleman&#39;s association with public companies. Clearly, then, this motion has been submitted, not for the benefit of the Parliament or the country, but rather to break down the Attorney-General, and, if possible, to drive him, as a strong opponent, out of the Ministry. It has been somewhat interesting to notice the different aspects from which this matter has been discussed ; but I think we may fairly accept the view put forward by the honorable member for Bendigo that it is from the aspect of the man in the street that the Opposition are regarding it. In looking at it from that aspect, however, we .have been completely side-tracked. We have lost sight altogether of the main issue. We have left on one side the real question that the House should consider. The question is: What is the position of the Attorney-General ? </para>

                            <para>- That is exactly what honorable members should be informed of, and what the man in the street should learn through the medium of this House. The man in the street should not be misled by arguments and statements made during this debate which do not affect the case. We have to consider what is the strict position of the Attorney-General  in view of the general retainer that he holds. We have had the honorable member for West Sydney taking up a position in direct conflict with that of the mover of the motion. The honorable member for Kalgoorlie sneered, if I may use the expression, at the Attorney-General, and insinuated that the case for his side had been put before the public through the medium of well-known members of the Victorian Bar, and by means of a letter from a leading firm of solicitors, who happen to be solicitors for the Marconi Company. He at once points to the fact that these learned counsel and this firm of solicitors do not agree, and he practically puts it that the solicitors give away both counsel and the Attorney-General. After he has done that we find what little reliance can be placed on his view of the matter, since the honorable member for West Sydney says that he agrees with the position as stated by the two learned gentlemen who wrote letters in this morning&#39;s newspapers; that he quite agrees with Messrs. Blake and Riggall, and also with the Attorney-General&#39;s attitude and explanation. We can take it, therefore, that the honorable member for Kalgoorlie is not in that respect in agreement with the honorable member for West Sydney. </para>

In fact, he said he was an honorable man - no doubt, a most honorable man. He immediately followed up that statement, however, with the remark that people do not give money for nothing; that their object is to secure services.

                            <para>- I shall deal with that point in a moment. The insinuation was that the Attorney-General&#39;s services are being secured by the Marconi Company because of this general retainer. I should be sorry to think that that was a wilful misrepresentation of the facts. The Attorney-General has made absolutely clear what is his position under a general retainer. He has shown that he is under no contractual obligation whatever to the Marconi Company. He is entirely free of that company, except that he has to give it notice if he is asked to accept a brief against the company. And yet we have the honorable member for West Sydney insinuating that, in giving him this general retainer, the Marconi Company had in view the certainty of securing his services. And, further, the honorable member for Melbourne has interjected that the retainer was given to secure the Attorney-General&#39;s services against the Commonwealth. That is not the purpose. The Attorney-General has stated that he would not accept any brief against the Commonwealth at the instance of the Marconi Company, and the Marconi Company has no right whatever, by reason of the giving of this general retainer, to demand or to retain his services against the Commonwealth, or against any one else, if the Attorney-General thinks fit to refuse them. I do not know whether or not it was intentional, but the honorable member for . Kalgoorlie, in dealing with this matter, conveyed to me, and, no doubt, to others in the Chamber, an entirely false view of the Attorney-General&#39;s position. He said that the Marconi Company, in its litigation with the Commonwealth, had the benefit of the services of the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth. That is not a correct statement of the facts. The Marconi Company, at some time in the past, had the services of a member of the Bar; but that gentleman, having become Attorney-General of the Commonwealth, dissociated himself entirely from the company, and, therefore, they have not had his services as Attorney-General. If the honorable member for Kalgoorlie&#39;s contention is correct, then any barrister who happened to be briefed by any person or company, and who afterwards became a member of Parliament or Attorney-General, might have the same charge levelled against him. Would it be right, merely because a gentleman had been so acting before he became a member of Parliament, to level such a charge at him when he entered this House? The position of the Attorney-General has been reviewed, and it is said that he is now representing the Crown. He is not representing the Crown in this matter. He has explained to the House that he has dissociated himself from it- The honorable member for West Sydney contends that by dissociating himself from the company he has given evidence of his guilt. I wonder what he would have said if the honorable gentleman had not done so ? The Attorney- General, who has been counsel for this company - and this would apply even if he had been acting as counsel for the company before he was a member of the Parliament - dissociated himself from it as soon as he assumed his present position. And this is said by the Opposition to be proof of his guilt. On the face if it, such a contention is manifestly absurd. It is not tenable for one moment. It seems to me that a great portion of the discussion in this House, so far as the Opposition is concerned, has been directed, not to the enlightenment of honorable members, but to the man in the street. </para>

In this matter, it seems to me that if any one ought to have a grievance, it is the Marconi Company. We have in the Attorney-General a gentleman who was their counsel, and who evidently possesses a knowledge of all their business secrets so far as they are material to this case. Having that knowledge, the Attorney-General has dissociated himself from the company, and really becomes the representative of their opponents, in some respects, in connexion with this particular business. Therefore, I say that the company might reasonably have more ground for complaint than the Commonwealth or this Parliament could possibly have in respect of the charge levelled here. </para>

It has also been said that there is a conflict of interests by reason of the Attorney-General continuing to hold a general retainer. Where is the conflict of interests? The Attorney-General has absolutely dissociated himself from any litigation in which the Commonwealth and this company are concerned. If there were no general retainer, and the Marconi Company were engaged in litigation with some private persons, and desired the services of the Attorney-General, would it be reasonable that he should refuse a briuf because some other business of theirs was connected with the Commonwealth? </para>

I do not think that such a position should be expected on the part of the Attorney - General or any other member of the House who may be engaged, not perhaps in the legal profession, but in some other business. The honorable member for Bendigo has said that the Attorney-General 13 the watch dog of the Commonwealth in legal matters. The Attorney-General, however, is not a watch dog in this particular matter, or otherwise there would have been a howl of indignation here. He has properly handed over his duties in this connexion to another member of the Cabinet, and made it quite clear to the House that he has, even in Cabinet matters, entirely dissociated himself from the company. </para>

Now that this matter has assumed such proportions, it is only fair that honorable members should express their views. This motion, as framed, is distinctly an attack, not only on the honorable and learned member personally, but on him in his capacity of Attorney-General. It is also an attack on the Government, and I feel sure that it could not have been accepted in any other way than it has, namely, as a motion of no-confidence. </para>

                        <para>.- I take up a position of, I hope, &#34; the man in the street,&#34; who, as a rule, does not love the lawyer too much, having had much bitter experience of him. I look forward to a happy time when we shall nationalize the lawyers, because then their duty would be to make peace and not war between the citizens. I have no desire to wrong the Attorney-General, although politically I hit him as hard as I can. I understand that the Attorney-General has said that, if the question of compromise with the Marconi Company were considered by the Cabinet, he would not deprive himself of his right to sit, but that subsequently he added that the probability was that he would not sit. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know what the honorable gentleman got from the Marconi Company, but we do know that he took the side of a trust against his country. I am going to prove that this is only in keeping with his record during many years, and that, at the present time, he is a member of an illegal association formed to defy and destroy an Act of Parliament. The Attorney-General, in his very superior, I may say Equity-Court barrister, style, condescended to take notice of a poor unfortunate member, who at the last election was returned unopposed, and, when he had an opponent, obtained a larger majority than the Attorney-General ever had. I refer to the honorable member for Kalgoorlie, whom the Attorney-General referred to as the &#34;Justinian from the West.&#34; In my opinion, if ever there was a weak, would be Coriolanus, it is the present Attorney-General. Coriolanus, we know, was going to destroy Rome, but, on the appeal of his mother,, the one little golden gem in his heart was touched, and he marched away. Do I not know when the Attorney-General marched away ? It was when he had the Upper House of Victoria in the palm of his hand, and, backed by the whole power of the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> had the biggest majority that ever sat behind a Premier. Then it was that he showed his back-bone to be nothing more than soap. As I say, I accuse the honorable member of being a member of an illegal association which was destroyed by the power of the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> and public opinion, but which, in the dark, was formed again. If the honorable member for Indi were to attempt to practise his profession in the High Court, he would find that the Attorney-General would refuse to appear with him ; he would find that there was preference to unionists, and that he had no right to earn his living alongside the Attorney-General. And why is this? It is because of the rules of a secret society. </para>

                            <para>- I will show that the Attorney-General is receiving a fee from what I consider to be a trust. The Telefunken Company has been compelled to join, or has advisedly joined, the Marconi Company, and to-day they constitute a trust that leaves a slime of evilness wherever it appears. Luckily for the great Chancellor of the Exchequer of England, this trust was not able to crush him. I am a little bit tired of this cry of &#34; Honour, honour, honour &#34; - we know that Mark Antony had a great deal to say under this head. Time was when lawyers were paid in the way that Judges are paid now, and the business of the Courts was to see that justice was administered, and the rights of the people preserved. A little later, clients, who were blessed with money, got into the way of giving retainers. Of course, it may be regarded as quite a fair thing for either the rich man or the poor man that he should be able to give a retainer; but does any one think that the average &#34; man in the street,&#34; who earns from &#163;2 to &#163;4 a week, can spare &#163;5 to retain a member of the Bar? I venture to say that the numerous retainers of which the Attorney-General has boasted to-night on the floor of the House, come from great companies and wealthy men; I doubt whether he has a poor man amongst all his clients. In the days gone by, those who had the means, and desired the zealous and undivided services of a lawyer, gave him a fee, which, as it was said, was &#34;to insure progress&#34;; and if honorable members look at the initial letters of these words, they will find that they spell &#34;tip.&#34; This was regarded as tampering with the Court, and was punished. When the Legal Professions Practice Act was before the Victorian Parliament, the honorable member for Kooyong had a clause inserted limiting the power of barristers to charge the enormous fees they were then charging. Although politically I entirely disagree with the honorable member, I must compliment him, because he is what is known as an &#34; amalgam,&#34; who would not be permitted by the Attorney-General to appear with him in Court. </para>

                            <para>- It was given in a much more indirect manner. In those days, the legal advocates had a little pocket at the back of their robes which they could not touch with their hands, and into this pocket the wealthy clients used to put the extra fee or tip. As a matter of fact, if we go into a Court of the present day, we shall see the remnant of this pocket in the robes of our barristers. I have been informed that the Attorney-General received over four figures in sovereigns; and for what? For defending the trust or combination .of the Telefunken and Marconi Companies against his own country. Is it any wonder that the great, .jurist, of . America said that, for the betrayal of a. country, or a great cause, we had not far to seek, because it could be found in any barrister we met. The Attorney-General would sell his country if he would fight for a trust against his country. What did the great <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shiels,</inline> once Premier of this State, say when I brought before the Legislative Assembly the fact that the barristers were seeking to destroy the Act which Parliament had passed ? He said that once a measure was embodied in the laws of the country, it was the duty of every barrister to obey it. </para>

                            <para>- The barristers have defeated the object of the Act by an illegal combination. If the Attorney-General were asked from a public platform whether he was a member of a trade union, I have no doubt that he would be manly enough to admit that he was. He has acknowledged it to me, and I have no doubt that he would admit it publicly. But if he were asked whether he was in favour of preference to unionists, he would deny it. He has declared his intention of removing from the statute-book the preference provision which exists there. But I am going to prove, from an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper, that he belongs to an association which has always stood for preference for the members of its own union. I am glad to recognise that the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> on the 29th August last, published an article severely handling a Judge in connexion with this question. In so doing it maintained the policy by which it has been guided for many years; for, on the 5th December, 1891, the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> published a strong article on the very same lines.

                        <para>While the Bill for the amalgamation of the two branches of the legal profession was passing through Parliament it encountered the most determined opposition from a certain section of the Bar, who were naturally hostile to any projects which threatened to break up the monopoly that they had come to look upon as their prescriptive right. The opposition proved thoroughly futile, and the measure became law, but the malcontents made no secret of their determination to employ every means at their disposal for rendering its provisions of no effect, and so depriving the public of the advantages they expected to derive from it. </para>

                    <para>The result of their machinations is a pamphlet issued by a body calling itself the Bar Association, and prescribing, a number of rules by which the attitude of its members is to be strictly regulated towards every practitioner who declines to subscribe to them. Their object is to maintain the same relation between barristers and solicitors as existed prior to the passing of the Amalgamation Act, and this is sought to be effective by ordaining that 11 every member of the association, shall act and practise only as barristers who usually acted and practised in Victoria previously to December the 1st, 1891, and not otherwise.&#34; Everybody outside the charmed circle is to be strictly boycotted. </para>

                    <para>Of course no member of this highly respectable body of conspirators against the laws of their country is to enter into partnership, directly or indirectly, with any other member of the legal profession in Victoria. Further than this. No member is to accept a retainer or brief from any solicitor who is suspected of having a partner&#39; on the barristerial side of the Court. And certain members of the association are to be told off as a sort of vigilant committee to keep an eye upon the other branch of the profession in order that no one who has the hardihood to take advantage of the new law should escape for want of detection. </para>
                    <para class="block">The name of any one who does not fall in with the aims of the association is put on a black list. Yet the Attorney-General denounces trade unions. Never did any trade union in this country carry on as this Barristers&#39; Association has done. Is there any honorable member opposite who would dare, in any hall in this city, to defend the action of the chief law officer of the Commonwealth in taking money to fight his own country ? Do honorable members know what the great Judge Higinbotham, when he waa Attorney-General in Victoria, did in such a case? I have it on excellent authority that Judge Higinbotham abstained entirely from private practice when he became Attorney-General, from the 27th June, 1863, to the 6th May, 1868.  His  reasons were that he owed his sole services to the country which paid him a special salary to be Attorney-General, and that to continue and combine private practice with public duty would be improper. Let. me continue to quote from the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> articleto which I have already alluded - </para>
                    <para>There are other rules providing for the domestic behaviour of the Bar Association, but sufficient has been quoted to demonstrate the desperate and thoroughly despicable character of the tactics to which members of an honorable profession can descend for the avowed object of putting, money into their pockets at the expense of the general public. For one of the foremost objects of the Amalgamation Act was. to cheapen the cost of litigation by enabling litigants to employ one lawyer where they at present have to employ two, and, at the same time, to widen the field of selection for them.. Among the members of this precious junto will: probably be found the loudest declaimers against the precipient principles and practices of trade unionism; but 110 trade union has ever attempted) to go so far in a direction of prohibiting freedom of contract. The two parties aimed at are the solicitors and the public. The rules of the association are designed to intimidate the former and to dictate to the latter, and the impudence of the whole affair is capped by a provision nominating the Attorney-General and Minister of Justice for the time being,  Chairman  of the Committee of .Management, as though it was the most natural thing in the world for the political head of a Department to take part in a conspiracy for breaking the law which he has sworn to administer. And, after all, what does the law contain, that it should provoke such a desperate opposition to it? There is nothing either very new or very shocking in the idea of amalgamation. It is the practice in more than one Australian colony. The United States have had it in operation for a long time; and the leading lawyers of England, including many Judges, have not only acknowledged the merits of the system, but declare that it cannot be long before it is adopted in that home of Conservatism. The attitude of the association is therefore almost ridiculous as it is sublime. It not only challenges the public of Victoria, but it sets up its back against the almost unanimous opinion of the entire English-speaking race. Excluded from the pastures, of the world outside, the Bar Association looks to make a sort of ring fence Eden of Temple Court in which it can kick up its heels and bray its loudest defiance in the sure and certain hope that the other beasts of the fold will be too frightened to interfere. Whether its expectation will be realized as easily as it thinks remains to be seen. As we said before, the laws of the country are assailed in the proceedings of the association, which are distinctly opposed to public policy in as much as they a&#39;re in bar of trade as well as disloyal and immoral in their tendency. As for the solicitors, they must inevitably lose caste in the eyes of the public whose cause is also theirs, if they allow themselves to be coerced into signing away  their independence by the threat of being sent to Coventry by the fifteen or sixteen superior persons who claim to embody the conscience of the profession, while they are really looking after their own fat fees. </para>
                    <para class="block">If it were not for the fees paid by this Telefunken-Marconi Combine, does any one think that this highly honorable legal gentleman would fight for it? If the Attorney-General does not agree with the law of Victoria affecting barristers, why did he not, when he was Premier of Victoria, and had command of a tremendous majority, be manly enough to remove the law from the statute-book ? He, as a barrister, now seeks to destroy it. Would it not have been more honorable to have tried to amend it? There was a black list for any one who dared to break the rules of this little association. This was the pledge - </para>

Having quoted from a Democratic and Liberal newspaper, I wish to quote from a newspaper that fights its opponents much more fairly than some others do. I had broached this matter in Parliament, and such a wave of anger went through the country that, had an amending Bill containing a clause providing a penalty for breaking the law been introduced, the Attorney-General would not now pride himself so much on the honour of barristers, and would not belong to an association which, in his innermost heart, he knows to have been formed to defy and destroy a law which his country has passed.

                        <para>We are unwilling to believe that the members of the Bar forming the association, whose rules are published in another column, fully realize the nature of the compact into which they have entered. The honour of their profession is, we take it, the first consideration with the Bar as a body, and the obligation to respect the law is inseparably bound up with the maintenance of that honour unimpaired. Is a general agreement to contravene the law in any possible aspect consistent with these premises? The answer is surely self-evident. And, if so, then the aims of the new organization are wrong in principle and degrading in effect. </para>

                    <para class="block">As the representative of a large constituency, I desire to pay the meed of my thanks to both the daily newspapers of Melbourne for what they did at that time. I further thank the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> for its article of the 29th August last, in which it held up to the scorn of the people of Victoria, at all events, the action of a Judge who forgot himself. He, being sworn to obey the law to its uttermost letter, actually made statements regarding it that were not accurate. It would be well for the Attorney-General to remember that his acts in the past are not such as to give us great faith in his future. The largest body employed by one Department of this State was by him&#39; robbed of its citizenship. But we know that when the opportunity came even that House of fossils known as the Legislative Council wiped out unanimously one of the two Bills that distinguished his State career. Never was there a Coercion Act passed in England, even in the most terrible times, equal to the Victorian Act. One can forgive the English Parliament for being severe. The Gladstone Coercion Act was brought in on the night of the day that they buried the poor dead clay of Cavendish and Bourke. I, the son of an English mother, with an Irish name, looking back through the years, cannot blame the English Government for being too severe under such circumstances. But in this State a Bill was brought in more drastic and more severe in its penalties than the severe Coercion Act that was introduced into the English House of Commons under the terrible circumstances to which I have referred. What did the leader of  His  Majesty&#39;sOpposition in the State Parliament, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Prendergast,</inline> who has lately returned from the Old Country, say when, by a. trick of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bent,</inline> they were passing a vote on the resignation of the honorable member for Flinders? </para>
                    <para>It was the loss of that population at that particular period that landed Victoria in the loss of a Federal member. We, at that time, lost one member in the House of Representatives, while the membership of New South Wales was increased. I would point out that the late honorable member for Lowan was seldom in the House after his departure from the Premiership. He did not attend the House more regularly than about once a week. His name appeared very seldom in connexion with the divisions, or anything else, and since his wife received that &#163;2,000 as the price of her husband&#39;s apostasy from his original principles, he was hardly ever in the House at all. </para>

                            <para>- I bow to that ruling, sir. As it was a very large fee, perhaps it could not be taken as a retainer. I ask the honorable member for Henty, if he dares, to take the Melbourne Town Hall and ask the citizens who created this Parliament if they will, for one moment, vote for a man like the Attorney-General to fight for this combine of Telefunken and Marconi against his own country. I will take him on if he dares to accept my challenge - or any other member of the House - even in his own district. He knows that in his heart he dare not do it. I have put my protest on record, and will vote as I have said. The Attorney-General is not following the traditions of the English House of Commons or the practice of the French House of Deputies, where, in the last fifty years, every man who has been accused has withdrawn from the Chamber and let his fellow members decide the question. The Attorney-General knows that he dare not do that, because if he did this motion would be carried, most likely. </para>

                            <para>- I am willing to meet the honorable member at any time and argue the question before the public. I do not care what the opinion is. The law must be put in proper terms. This sort of thing would not happen in Denmark; it could not possibly happen in Switzerland, because there an officer in the Government has to give up everything. I want to be fair to a majority of one, which may last a month. I quite recognise that in the case of a man who, in taking the position of Attorney-General, gives up a large practice, with the possibility of being thrown out of the position in a month or two, there is a difficulty. If a man gave up a big practice and applied his energies and abilities, as he should, to the welfare of his country, I would be quite prepared to vote that a Minister, under these conditions, should have the right to a retiring allowance or a pension of, say, &#163;1,000 a year, if ever he should demand it.

                        <para>.- By some cruel fate, every time I speak I have to defend my unfortunate fellow unionists on the other side of the House from a violent attack on the part of the honorable member for Melbourne. The last time I spoke here I had to pour oil on the troubled waters, and now I have to pour cold water on the head of my honorable friend to try to keep him in his place. I want to join with the honorable member for Kooyong in his pathetic appeal on behalf of the Attorney-General, and the precarious means by which he and other honorable members eke out a living at the Bar. I would not have spoken at all but for the fact that the Attorney-General practically invited me to come to his assistance in this little matter. I feel that, as a humble follower of the same profession, I am in duty bound to say a word or two on this most interesting subject. The Attorney-General has vouchsafed to the House that I, in common with the honorable member for Bendigo and others, either know the rules governing these cases, or ought to know them. I, at any rate, he said, ought to know them. He granted to my honorable friend here the credit that he did know them. I venture to say that I know something about the rules, and if I was not thoroughly conversant with them before, I have been made so by the kindly advice and the clear statement of the Attorney-General - advice, I may say, which was granted at a much cheaper rate than I have been accustomed to pay on behalf of clients for opinions in the past; although it is only fair to add that clients who have paid always thought it worth while. So far from being embarrassed by the vote I intend to give, or so far from being ashamed of the opinion I hold in this matter, I am very glad to have this opportunity of recording a vote on the side of the higher ethics. We have heard so much from honorable members opposite about the corruption and the disloyalty, and the immature political views of honorable members on this side, that it is gratifying and refreshing to have an opportunity to record a vote on behalf of a principle which takes us into the higher and rarer atmosphere. It is not so long since honorable members opposite, who have shown themselves very sensitive about any criticism levelled at themselves, were pleased, if not to applaud, to peacefully acquiesce in, the remarks of the honorable member for Echuca when he spoke of ex-Ministerson this side as robbers and purloiners. Consequently, they ought not to be too sensitive when it comes to a consideration of their own political and professional conduct. The Attorney-General seems to be determined to take this motion as reflecting on himself personally, and his mind is quite made up that if it is carried, it will amount to a vote of want of confidence in the Government, and to a very grave reflection on himself. I venture to remind him of the legal principle, with which, no doubt, he is quite familiar, that one cannot discuss very well in Parliament, any more than in the Courts, mere abstract principles without some concrete case on which to found one&#39;s arguments in connexion with those principles. Consequently, in endeavouring to lay down a principle in the House, we have associated with the principle and the expression of it the name of the Attorney-General, in these words - </para>

                    <para>I cannot help thinking that there is a very great deal in what the Attorney-General has said in regard to the Bar Association, about which the honorable member for Melbourne had a lot to say. But there is a great deal, too, in what the Attorney-General said with regard to his loyalty to that association. I applaud his loyalty to the Bar Committee, and that is why I join issue with the honorable member for Melbourne, who has very appropriately crossed the floor and gone into opposition with me on this matter. </para>

                            <para>- It is the Attorney-General&#39;s union. It is one of the strongest unions in Australia. I am proud to say that the loyalty of the members to each other, and to their union, sets an example which might well be followed in the industrial world. Their loyalty is really admirable, and I commend them for it; I do not blame them for it. At the same time, I realize that there comes a time when even loyalty to one&#39;s union may be strained too far, and when it comes to a question of loyalty to one&#39;s union, or even the appearance of disloyalty to one&#39;s public duty, I think we have reached a stage at which even the union must give way. A very interesting example of the strength of the position of the Bar Association, not only in the minds of its members, but in the minds of their Honours the Judges of the Courts, was afforded the other day, when a Supreme Court Judge ventured, from his place on the Bench, to threaten a member of the Bar who was before him, not with any of the penalties which the law enabled him to impose, but with penalties which were to be inflicted by the Bar Committee, an irresponsible body, sitting, as my honorable friend rightly remarked, in secret. We have reached rather a curious position when a Supreme Court Judge may do that with impunity. Nevertheless, that is precisely what happened in the case which I have in my mind, and with which, I am certain, every honorable member is familiar. So that loyalty to one&#39;s union may be carried too far. I am always safe in agreeing with the honorable member for Bendigo, because his judgment in these matters as a citizen, as well as his law, is invariably sound. I share the view which he expressed in regard to the question which is now before us. That view was misrepresented&#34; by the honorable member for Kooyong, and, to a lesser extent, by the honorable member for Indi. The honorable member for Bendigo viewed the question from this stand-point - &#34; It is not how honorable members may regard the attitude of the Attorney-General, or how discerning members of the legal profession will regard it. The crucial test is the maintenance of general public confidence.&#34; That is what the honorable member for Bendigo referred to as the attitude of &#34; the man in the street.&#34; It is not sufficient for the Attorney-General to examine his conscience and say, &#39; &#39; I am doing something which my conscience tells me is quite right. I am acting honestly, and am determined to act honestly.&#34; He must be prepared to place himself beyond the region of reasonable suspicion. That is the principle upon which he should act. Several analogous cases have been quoted by the honorable member for West Sydney and the honorable member for Bendigo. The honorable member for West Sydney rightly pointed out how high is the standard set to members of the Bar by the Judges themselves. He cited the example of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Powers and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Duffy, who, on the lightest breath of suspicion that they might be influenced by their previous connexion with certain cases, retired from the Bench. The honorable member for Bendigo put another analogous case - that of a judicial officer who might reasonably be suspected of bias, and who, in these circumstances, ought not to adjudicate. Still another analogous case is that of a trustee upon whom very important obligations are cast in the exercise of his trusteeship.  His  duties as a trustee are more onerous and exacting than are his duties as an individual. He must not mix trustee property with his own property; he must not buy trustee property, even though he is prepared to pay a. greater price for it than the market price. In every case the standard of his caution must be greater in regard to the property of which he is a trustee than it is in regard to the ordinary management of his own affairs. Having accepted the invitation of the Attorney-General to justify my position from the stand-point of the higher ethics, I do not intend to press this matter much further. I merely wish to ask honorable members just where we are in the particular case which has been used as an illustration upon which to found arguments in connexion with this really abstract proposition. I hardly think it is necessary to add to what has been said in support of the view that nobody upon this side of the Chamber suggests any personal dishonesty or impropriety in connexion with the attitude taken up by the Attorney-General. He holds a general retainer from the Marconi Company. What that means has been sufficiently well explained. I have to thank the honorable gentleman himself for explaining it very fully. He says that all that it means is that he must give notice to the Marconi Company before accepting a brief against it. In other words, that company has the first claim upon his services. If that company received notice from the Attorney-General that somebody else desired to brief him it might thereupon deliver a brief to him. That is the point which I wish to make. We may actually reach the stage when the Attorney-General has been tendered a brief, which, of course, he might not be able to accept.  His  discretion would then come in, and he would determine whether he could accept it or not. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know that we are, because the honorable gentleman&#39;s general retainer is based upon the fact that the Marconi Company desires his services, and has ear-marked them. Consequently, there is a strong presumption that it will brief him, and that company is in litigation with the Commonwealth. Honorable members opposite have asked again and again, &#34;What is this general retainer?&#34; They have urged that it does not create any obligation, and does not establish contractual relations. Then why hang on to it, seeing that it has already created in the public mind a doubt as to the political propriety of the Attorney-General&#39;s action. Would it not be better for him to say, &#34; I will not accept a brief if it conflicts with the discharge of my public duties, and here and now I return my general retainer to the company?&#39;&#39;&#39; That is the simple and only means of obviating public uneasiness. </para>

I am merely suggesting that the Attorney-General might well take the view that if our arguments are, even apparently, well founded, it is not a question of whether the balance of argument is upon his side or upon ours. If our arguments have substance in them, that in itself ought to be sufficient to induce the Attorney-General- </para>

                            <para>- That is merely a difference of opinion. I do not think the Attorney-General, with all his light and learning, should arrogate to himself the whole sum of knowledge, even upon this matter. I do not intend to detain the House. I merely rose to assure the Attorney-General, who mentioned my name this afternoon, that this subject presents no difficulties to me. The matter is absolutely apart from personal considerations. It is really an abstract question. The honorable member for Kalgoorlie, in a very vigorous speech, entirely disclaimed any personal feeling in the matter, or any desire to disparage the Attorney-General in the discharge of his public duties. But the matter having been ventilated, and it being a matter upon which the public may conclude that the conduct of the Attorney-General is open to suspicion, I shall experience no difficulty in voting for the motion without in the slightest degree desiring to reflect upon the personal, professional, or private character of the honorable gentleman whose name happens to be associated with it in circumstances with which we are all familiar. </para>

                        <para>. - The honorable member for Barrier went so far as to say that no private member should identify himself with any case against the Commonwealth, and the honorable member for Batman has affirmed that he believes in the higher ethics of the profession. In my position as Postmaster-General I was served this morning with a plaint from the honorable member for Batman, on behalf of certain officials in the Post Office, who claim increases in salaries and a reduction in their hours of labour. If the honorable member pursues that case to a successful issue, it will involve the Commonwealth in a loss of thousands of pounds per annum. Is the honorable member justified in taking an action against the Commonwealth any more than was the Attorney-General, who, when a private member, held a retainer on behalf of the Marconi Company which he threw up the moment he took office and found that his position as counsel for the company was antagonistic to the Commonwealth? If an award be given in favour of these postal officials, and that award be not adopted, how will the honorable member for Batman vote on that question? Will he vote for his clients or in the interests of the Commonwealth ? </para>

                            <para>- Parliament provided that the Public Service should have a right to appeal to the Arbitration Court, and an award of the Court having been made, the Government is going to observe it. The point which I wish to make is that if the Attorney-General is wrong, then the position of the honorable member for Batman, who has been acting in a case against the Commonwealth, is far worse. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly. The honorable member for Batman&#39;s case is on &#34; all-fours &#34; with that of the Attorney-General. In fact, it is five to four against the honorable member for Batman. Honorable members opposite do not like to be attacked, but they like to attack, and would crawl all over, the Attorney-General. This undoubtedly has been made a party question. Had there been no scandal in the Mother Country in regard to members of Parliament holding shares in the Marconi Company, would we have heard of this trouble? The fact is that when you want to beat a dog any stick is good enough to use. This has been made a party question. If the motion had been submitted without introducing the Attorney-General&#39;s name every honorable member would have voted for it. As it is, it is virtually a motion of want of confidence in the Government - an attempt to belittle the Ministry. Whilst every member of the Opposition has spoken highly of the Attorney-General, not one of them having had a word to say against his personal honour or integrity, this is undoubtedly an attempt to besmirch him and the Government of which he is a member. The last to speak in support of the motion should be the honorable member for Bendigo and the honorable member for Batman. The honorable member for Bendigo will probably be briefed in the very case against the Commonwealth Government to which I have referred. </para>

                            <para>- And, as far as we are able to do so, we shall give them justice as well as sympathy. I am a  member of the legal profession, bub am nob now in practice. My memory, however, is fresh enough to enable me to state what is the effect of a retainer. A general retainer is given to counsel so that the person giving it may have first call upon his services. It is often given to counsel whom you do not want on your own side, merely to prevent the other side securing his services. In your client&#39;s interests you think it better to have a certain counsel on your side than to have him against you, and it pays you to give him  a  brief. </para>

                            <para>- This is as good as an election meeting. I do not mind a few interjections. I wish to explain the difference between a general retainer and a brief. A counsel accepts a brief to go into Court and act on behalf of a client, but the mere fact that he holds a general retainer does not bind him to accept a brief, nor does it bind the client to give him one. If he does not receive a brief from the person giving the general retainer he is entitled to accept one from any one else. The Attorney-General, as soon as he discovered that the litigation between this company and the Commonwealth was being continued, said that he could not act any further for them in that litigation. The conduct of the case for the Commonwealth was handed over to the Minister of External Affairs, who was Attorney-General in a previous Administration, and he, the Crown Solicitor, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Garran,</inline> and myself are now conducting it. We are going to fight as hard as we can for the Commonwealth. I would remind honorable members in this connexion that there can be no patent rights as against the Government. So far as governmental purposes are concerned neither the Marconi Company nor any other company can claim that it has any rights if we choose to insist upon those which the Crown possesses. The company&#39;s claim, if it has any at all, can be only in relation to private business carried on for other people by the Government. </para>

                            <para>- In view of the fact that he had previously acted for the Marconi Company he could not be asked. He was a private member when he was acting for the Marconi Company, but as soon as he took office as Attorney-General he said he could act for it no more in the proceedings against the Commonwealth. I am sure that any member of the Opposition similarly situated would have acted as he has done. If the honorable member for Bendigo were Attorney-General in the next Administration, he would be in exactly the same position as is the honorable member for Flinders. </para>

                            <para>- Every member of the Bar in practice is liable to be in the same position, and I am sure, would do exactly as the Attorney-General has done. The ex-Attorney-General some time ago was the secretary of a union, the members  of which were on strike in Sydney. As Attorney-General, he might have been called upon to prosecute members of that union, but he did not dissociate himself from it, and no one asked him to do so. All these are analogous cases. </para>

                            <para>- I am inclined to agree with the honorable member for Bourke and the honorable member for Darling on that point. When I agree with two such sensible men as those honorable members, I think I am in good company. If every man is to be attacked for his private connexions in business, it will be very difficult to get candidates for Parliament. Some remarks have been made regarding myself; but I am in a different position, inasmuch as I am retiring from business, and have been endeavouring for some time to sever my connexion with several company boards.. If honorable members had not made a party question of this, we should not have had this discussion; but it is regarded as a good opportunity to attack the Government and the Attorney-General, and it is sought to make scapegoats of both. </para>

                        <para>. - We have heard so much from legal members, that it is about time a layman put in a &#34; spoke.&#34; Eight&#34; legal gentlemen have addressed the House, five of them from the Ministerial side; and each of these latter has, lawyer-like, given us a different definition. I shall not rely upon my own opinion, but quote from the <inline font-style="italic">National Review,</inline> which deals with members of the British Parliament, and Ministers in particular, on account of their association with this much-talked-of company. The article speaks of two members on the Unionist side, and comments on their action in regard to this particular question. The extract I shall read shows that &#34;birds of a feather flock together,&#34; and how members of the legal profession, though differing in politics, rush to the rescue of their brethren in trouble. The two members referred to are <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Carson and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. F.</inline> E. Smith, two noted legal members on the Unionist side, who, when the vote was taken on (.lie motion moved by a private member censuring <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd-George</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Rufus</inline> Isaacs, walked out of the House of Commons instead of recording their vote.

                    <para class="block">That seems to be the harbor of refuge into which all legal gentlemen rush -  though what those traditions may be it is impossible to ascertain, as the suggestion that every advocate is at the beck and call of the first comer - that he is, in fact, like a taxi driver on the rank - may be in accordance with precept, but it is certainly not in accordance with practice, as the reader will readily discover by seeking the aid of a distinguished K.C.  in  a case involving antagonism to the Big Wigs of the Bar. </para>

Smith are justified in putting themselves out of action on the dominant political issue of the day to please a Government they avowedly abhor - if they are entitled to disfranchise their constituencies by abstaining from vital divisions, as they did the other day on the vote of censure - constituencies will not unnaturally wonder whether lawyers make the best candidates and the best members, while rank-and-filers will ask themselves whether lawyers are ideal political leaders, seeing that the canons regulating their professional conduct are liable to paralyze their political action. </para>
                    <para class="block">These words apply very much to the legal members, especially on the Ministerial side, who have spoken to-night. To me, as a layman, there seems a very easy way out of the difficulty. I do not say that the case is parallel, but that eminent lawyer, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Russell, who afterwards became Lord Chief Justice of England, set a splendid example when, being of opinion that his private interests were likely to conflict with his public duties, handed back to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Soames,</inline> solicitor, his general retainer for the <inline font-style="italic">Times.</inline></para>

                            <para>- We can realize whether a bullet reaches its mark when we find a cool and collected man like the Attorney-General ever and anon drawn out of his seat by comments on his action from this side. Why should <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mitchell,</inline> K.C., and that great authority on constitutional law, Professor Harrison Moore, be brought into the field, and a specially long letter published in each of the morning papers in an effort to exonerate the Attorney-General? If this were only a bit of a &#34; squib &#34; we should not find these eminent gentlemen taking part. Somehow or other there seems to be something specially smell some about this Marconi Company, a very strong combination, which is trying to obtain absolute control of all the wireless systems throughout the world. The Telefunken Company has been absorbed; and now that we have in this Commonwealth obtained the services of an eminent expert, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Balsillie,</inline> with a new system, the claws of the combine are stretched out to grip that also. The very first man who should be ready at a moment&#39;s notice to defend the Commonwealth against such encroachments should be the Attorney-General, our chief law adviser; and it is a thousand pities, apart altogether from his past connexion with the company, that his services are not available at this critical juncture. I have no complaint to make about the Postmaster-General and the Minister of External Affairs, who are both good lawyers; but the Attorney-General should reserve himself for the defence of Commonwealth rights. Although the motion may not be carried to-night, I look to the Ministry, if they do not move an amendment, to bring forward for our approval similar rules to those submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Asquith.</inline> Those rules are as follow: - </para>

                        <para>We ask our readers to consider the known facts of the Marconi case in view of these rules. But, perhaps, it will be said that these rules had not been formulated before the action of Ministers. They did not know them, and, therefore, could not be expected to obey them. The plea is bad ; one of the most astonishing facts about the whole business is that we know the Chancellor of the Exchequer to have been thoroughly equipped thirteen years ago with the knowledge of the true principles and the true traditions. </para>

When once these rules are broken by any person in high position it leads to the complete demoralization of the whole Civil Service. It is setting a dangerous precedent. </para>

                    <para class="block">We are all public servants, and Ministers are such in an especial degree. If they cannot set an example, how can they expect the rank and file of the Civil Service to have high ideals? It is a rule of the service that officers shall keep themselves free from all other business than that for which they are paid by the State. I understand that some public servants have been carpeted because they have been found to have engaged in private business. Yet we have the Attorney- General of the whole Commonwealth engaging in private business actually against the Government whose Minister he is, and in connexion with a case which, as has been pointed out, may involve the Commonwealth in a loss of a hundred thousand pounds. That is a very serious matter. I intend to vote for the motion, and earnestly hope that it will be carried. If it is not carried, I trust that the Prime Minister will take it upon himself to bring in rules similar to those formulated by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Asquith,</inline> in order that Ministers in future may be prevented from doing anything derogatory to the country and the positions which they occupy. </para>

I entirely subscribe to those rules - to every one of them. I think they are admirably stated, and apply to other parts of the Empire as well as to Great Britain. I merely wish to add <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Asquith&#39;s</inline> comment upon those rules: that they had no application whatever to the case under consideration. They have been quoted here frequently, but those who have quoted them have carefully, studiously, and- persistently omitted the comment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Asquith,</inline> which I now supply.

Those, in my opinion, are rules of positive obligation, and I venture to submit to the House that none of those rules of positive obligation has been violated, certainly none of them consciously violated by any Minister in this case. </para>

                        <para>.- I am surprised that the Prime Minister thought it worth while to rise, after the way in which he has treated the House from time to time in regard to matters of great public importance. He has read to us some statements of the Prime Minister of England, setting forth his views of the morality which should characterize Ministers of the Crown. Because the Prime Minister of England said that he did not believe that certain rules which he enunciated had been violated consciously: </para>

                            <para>- Because the Prime Minister of England does not know whether these rules have been consciously violated, the honorable member suggests that the statements which have been made from this side to-night do not injure the man against whom they have been made. Does the honorable member say that the Attorney-General has not consciously violated any code of political morality that should be observed by members of this House? The Attorney-General holds a retainer for a great combine, the legal possibilities of whose future cannot be foretold. Will the Prime Minister say that in refusing to give up this retainer his colleague is not violating the code enunciated by the Prime Minister of England ? That code would not cover the position of the Attorney-General. We do not ask the Attorney-General to emulate <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higinbotham, that worthy man who has long since passed away, but whose memory will be honoured in days to come. We do not expect him to forego his private practice and other lucrative employment in which he may be engaged, but we expect him to see the wisdom of handing back his retainer to the Marconi Company, and dissociating himself from that company, in order that there may not be a vestige of suspicion attaching to his occupation of his high office. If he does that, it will be a step in advance, and a precedent to others who may hold his position in the future. It has been interesting to me to listen in this House and in another to the continual warfare among the fraternity known as the Devil&#39;s Brigade. Ever since I entered Parliament, I have listened to arguments, pro and con, for the disentanglement of some legal difficulty by legal members, and at the end I have been as wise as I was at the beginning. It is difficult to find out where you are when such a discussion takes place. Pour or five lawyers on the other side of the House to-night felt it incumbent to defend the Attorney-General, who is evidently not able to defend himself. They have felt it necessary to protect him from something, I do not know what; to. help him out of the position in which he stands. </para>

                            <para>- He has a legion of supporters outside, inspired, as he admits, with information regarding his connexion with the &#39;Marconi Company furnished by himself. I am not a lawyer, although I have met legal men in their own arena, and have vanquished as big a man as the honorable member in the Full Court. Although a layman without legal education, I vanquished a man who afterwards became a Justice of the High Court. When the Attorney-General speaks to me across the table as if to some one who may not have had the advantages which he has had in the way of education and college teaching, he degrades himself in trying to humiliate another whose opportunities have not been equal to his. Be that as it may, he must not think that the members of the legal profession are the only persons who can look at matters in a common-sense way. After all, it is common sense that brings, about justice and equity. When the lawyers have cited every case that they can find, and worn threadbare every argument, the Judge gives his decision, not in accordance with law, but in accordance with common sense. Let me tell the Attorney-General that, while he may be possessed of all the common honesty with which he has been credited, he has not got all the common sense in the world. He has defied the House. He has said, &#34; I have relinquished my responsibilities as Attorney-General, handing them over to my colleague the Minister of External Affairs. What would he have done had there not been another legal man in the Cabinet able to handle the technicalities of this case, and possessed of the necessary knowledge of the law ? In the last Government the Attorney-General was the only lawyer, and had to take all the responsibility -of the position on his shoulders. Had this Government been similarly constituted, what would have been the position of the honorable member for Flinders then ? He would have had either to retire from the Marconi business, or what is more likely, to retire from the position of Attorney-General, if he desired to retain the reputation he holds to-day. Fortunately, or unfortunately, for him, he has a colleague who has been Attorney-General, and who has been kind enough to relieve him of the grave responsibilities that attach to his office, and to handle this case for him in the interests of the Commonwealth. But if there should be a desire to come to an arrangement without having to fee the lawyers too much, and the question should come before the Cabinet, the Attorney-General previously declared, when speaking here, that he saw no reason why he should not assist to decide the question of compromise. I am glad to see that he has come down from that high pedestal, and that to-day he is quite prepared to consider the wisdom, or otherwise, of attending the Cabinet meeting. He does not say definitely that he will not attend, although he said &#34;Hear, hear&#34; to the honorable member for Indi when he implied as much. If his &#34; Hear, hear &#34; meant that he would not take part in the meeting, then it will not be a Cabinet in the true sense of the word. We shall lose the value of his vote at that meeting in deciding a great question which may involve this country in a large sum of money. For that reason, on whichever horn of the dilemma he is impaled, he shows the absolute anomaly of a legal man attempting to fill the position of Attorney-General, and to serve two masters at the one time. He might well take to heart the example of one of the noble men in the legal profession, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higinbotham, who took the only logical position that a man can take, and that is that if he wants to be the Attorney-General of a great country; if he wishes to hold that high position with honour, the only proper course is to forswear any connexion with the legal profession, whether private or public, and thereby leave himself free to discharge the duty he owes to the Commonwealth, as only a legal officer should do. But he says that, in England, they have laid it down as a rule that the Attorney-General must not engage in private practice. He says that they have done something more there. They have raised the salary of Attorney-General from &#163;3,500 to &#163;7,000 a year. By that remark he implied, &#34; If you want me to remain as Attorney-General, and to forswear all my interest in private practice, then raise my remuneration to an amount which will be in conformity with my earnings to-day, and I will humbly accept the position.&#34; That is what he meant to convey, for he said, &#34; I could understand a proposition of that kind. I could understand the Parliament being asked to say that the Attorney-General shall not engage in private practice, or in public cases, provided that he is furnished with a sufficient income to enable him to live as though he was following his profession.&#34; What does that mean ? It means that with him it is not a question of principle. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higinbotham did not make any stipulation of that kind. He did not put a money value on the position. To the honour of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Higinbotham</inline> there was no price in gold put on the office. It is only that standard that will free a man who follows the legal profession from suspicion in the public life of this country. If the Attorney-General assesses the position at a pure money value, where is his patriotism? It is not with him a question of principle at all, but a question of principal. If the House is prepared to indorse that principle he could vote for a motion of that kind. I do not wish to take up the time of the House, as I know that honor.orable members are anxious to get away. But I do not understand why this debate should be closed to-night. </para>

                            <para>- If I understand rightly, the Government, through the Prime Minister, is trying to bludgeon this business through, to terrorize this side into submission, to shorten the debate on a great and vital issue - as big an issue as has ever been considered in this House - and then he talks about liberty, freedom of speech, and justice. The man who dares to put the curb on by making an arrangement when we are discussing one of the most gigantic propositions ever submitted to the House - a proposition involving the honour, the integrity, and the morale of this Parliament - is simply trying to strangle the high precepts and principles that should underlie a Parliament of this description. The Prime Minister, with&#39; all his boasts of what he believes to be right and just, is not acting fairly to this side of the House to-night. Do I understand that he wants to close the discussion to-night, and is not going to provide cabs to take honorable members home? </para>

                            <para>- Whatever honorable members may feel or think, to my mind the Government is crushing me to-night. I have a lot to say on this question and a lot that ought to be recorded, so that the Attorney-General might, in the days to come, have something which would be hard for him to answer. My honorable friends on the other side are smothering that knowledge which the people are hungering for, and the Prime Minister is the culprit. A man who would dare to curtail debate on a big issue of this kind has no appreciation of his responsibility to the people of his country. I hope that this debate will continue; that when I resume my seat other honorable members will take part in it. In my judgment, this ought to be the last occasion upon which an arrangement to close a discussion upon a question of this character should be made. Our party look to us to keep up the standard of morality of this Parliament, and we ought not to consent to an arrangement being made, at the behest of the Prime Minister, merely to enable the Government to escape their obligation to pay for cabs to convey honorable members to their homes. </para>

                            <para>- The trouble is that I cannot get a nod recorded in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> The Attorney-General stated that I had not read a certain passage from Wharton&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Law Lexicon</inline> as to the Victorian conditions relating to a retainer. They are the same as the British conditions, as will be seen by reference to the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> proof  of my remarks, uncorrected by me, which the Attorney-General is at liberty to read for himself. The other point which he did not touch was as to how he would use his present position in voting upon this question. For his benefit I will read again a couple of passages which I quoted this afternoon - </para>

                        <para>As in all cases, when the personal position of a member is brought before the House it is a strict rule that the member concerned is to be heard in his place before the question affecting him is proposed to the House, and that then he must withdraw and allow the subsequent proceedings to take place in his absence .... There are other cases in which members might be expected to abstain from voting, not on grounds of pecuniary interest, but from motives of self-respect or respect to the House. There is no rule applicable to such circumstances, but a substantive motion to disallow a vote on such special grounds might be proposed, if a member did not see for himself the impropriety of voting. </para>

That quotation is taken from <inline font-style="italic">The Procedure of the House of Commons,</inline> by Redlich. May is equally emphatic. He says - </para>

                        <para>It is a rule, in both Houses, that when the conduct of a member is under consideration, he is to withdraw during the debate. The practice is to permit him to learn the charge Against him, and, after being heard in his place, for him to withdraw from the House. The precise time at which he should withdraw is determined by the nature of the charge. </para>

                            <para>-  I did not. What I said was that I had nothing personal against the Attorney-General. I have quoted the two highest authorities in reference to this matter, and the honorable gentleman can read them for himself. I do not make any special request that he shall not vote. I accept the statement of these two leading authorities, and I will leave the matter to his own taste. </para>
