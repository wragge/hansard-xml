                        <para>- Last year, several inventors sent into the Department of the Postmaster-General models of pillar- boxes arranged for the prevention of pilfering of letters, one patentee providing for electrical connexions between the pillar-boxes and the nearest exchanges. Seeing that there have recently been robberies of pillar-boxes in Adelaide, will the Postmaster-General ask the mechanicians, and gentlemen in high positions in the Department, if they have done anything to prevent interference with pillar-boxes? </para>

                            <para>- One Australian design was purchased by the Government for &#163;400, and some forty designs were received from persons giving Australian addresses, amongst whom were engineers, surveyors, and architects. The competition was duly advertised in Australia, and it was open to any Australian to compete. It is regrettable that a gentleman who is making such a sacrifice for Australia as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin</inline> is making, should be considered a fit target for the remark to which the honorable member calls attention. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin</inline> enjoys a very wide reputation, not only in America, but also elsewhere, as one of the best town planners anywhere. </para>

Knowing the big heart of the Prime Minister, I have only to ask him to bring this case before the Minister of Defence, in order to see whether some relief can be given, not only to this lad, but to others similarly circumstanced ? </para>

                        <para>-The trouble seems to be that we cannot get perfect administration, even perfectly sympathetic administration. Such cases as the honorable member mentions are provided for in Lord Kitchener&#39;s report, which specially points out that there is no need of compelling boys like these to undergo training. If I remember rightly, Lord Kitchener specifically lays it down that any boy who is the sole support of his mother should be exempt; and there is a whole series of exemptions which might very well be taken out of the roll if only the officers administering the scheme would go to the trouble to do so. Only a little more than half of the men who are eligible for training are required to complete the armies of various countries; and we know that cost determines such establishments all the world over. In Germany, if I remember rightly, only about half of those eligible are taken, because the country cannot afford to train the whole, and does not need the whole. Under the circumstances, it appears that all that is required is sympathetic and sane administration. I shall be very glad to call the attention of the authorities to the case. </para>

Also, is he aware that the cadets at Chewton are required to walk 6 or 7 miles in order to drill at Castleniaine, and will he consider what can be done to obviate this inconvenience which is causing much discontent with the defence scheme ? </para>

Under New Works the amount of &#163;550,930 was arrived at by deducting from the amount of&#163;649,930 shown on page 247 the amount of&#163;99,000 the Defence proportion of&#163;205,000 shown as savings on page 258.

                    <para class="block">On more than one occasion, honorable members in this Parliament have tabled motions similar to this, and it is not the first time I have put the matter forward, not in a public way, as a member of Parliament, but in a semi-public way, verbally and by literary means. It is more than twenty years ago since I first brought it under the consideration of the people of South Australia, at which time so far as Australia was concerned, I believe that mine was but a voice crying in the wilderness. No one had advanced the matter in any serious way, and in South Australia my proposal was considered an abstract one, and merely one for academic debate, but the time has now gone by for us to look upon this important question in that light. It is stated in this morning&#39;s newspapers that the combined Chambers of Manufactures throughout Australia have unanimously passed a resolution in favour of the decimal system of coinage and the metric system of weights and measures, showing that people from whom we might, perhaps, have expected some opposition, are anxious to have brought about this change in our industrial life. A little while ago, when glancing through the Acts of Parliament of the Dominion of New Zealand, I was agreeably surprised to find that, as far back at 1908, that Legislature passed an Act making it possible by proclamation at any time, to initiate the metric system of weights and measures. Section 25 of that Act, which is No. 206 of 1908, provides - </para>

                        <para>It shall be lawful for the Governor at any time by proclamation to declare that from and after a date named in the proclamation, the metric system, as described in the third schedule hereto, shall be the only system of weights and measures recognised for use in New Zealand, and  thereafter  it shall not be lawful to use any weights and measures other than those described in the said third schedule. </para>

                    <para class="block">Five years ago, therefore, the people of New Zealand recognised the vast importance of this subject. It will be observed that I have not submitted a motion couched in hard and fast terms directing that the Government &#39; &#39; shall &#39; &#39; bring in -legislation dealing with this matter. </para>

                            <para>- Elastic, but not ambiguous. I have done so because, in the first place, 1 do not wish to embarrass the Government in regard to this matter, whilst, secondly, I recognise that even the passing of an iron-bound motion would not compel the Government to bring in, at any particular period, legislation dealing with the subject. It is just as well, perhaps, that the matter should be left to the good sense of the Government, and the terms of my motion show that I am prepared to trust them to give effect to it in the event of its being carried. Another point of which we should not lose sight is that, having regard to the state of parties in this Parliament, my proposal would give the Government an opportunity to bring forward a purely non-party measure, the passing of which, I am convinced, would prove of great benefit to the people of this vast continent, and to generations as yet unborn. I desire to say, with all humility, that I possess, not only a full knowledge pf the theoretical side of the decimal system of coinage and weights and measures, but a practical acquaintance with the working of the system. In my youthful days - in the first three years of my school life - we still had in existence on the Continent of Europe the old system, but in 1868 notice was given that within three-and-a-half years a change to the decimal system would take place. There was a transitory period during which I was attending school, and, as my father was interested in business, I had an opportunity at the same time to see the practical working of the system which was initiated in the course of my scholastic studies. Leaving that part of the world I had an opportunity once more to test the almost antiquated system still in vogue in Australia with the result that I came to the conclusion that the system which I now urge should be adopted was vastly superior to that at present in operation almost throughout the British Empire. There are some objections of a more or less trivial character to the change which I propose. There are also a few weighty ones, and perhaps some very weighty reasons, which may be urged against it. With these I shall deal later on. As honorable members are aware, the decimal system is by no means new. It was started during the turbulent times of the first French Revolution - a revolution that brought about many changes, one of which did harm to thousands, while others bestowed benefits on untold millions. During that time of great commotion, the French Legislature of the day deputed certain French <inline font-style="italic">savants</inline> to evolve a different system of coinage and weights and measures, and they wisely chose one that was different from any other in existence at that period. They were probably influenced by the consideration which weighs with our friends, the Esperantos, who have produced an entirely new or artificial language in order not to stir up international jealousies. It speaks volumes for the system itself, and it is an everlasting monument to the ability of the great Frenchmen who evolved it that it has not been altered - even in any minute particular, so far as I know - from the day that it left their brains, now 120 years ago. It has been adopted by 500,000,000 of the human race. Practically every civilized country has adopted, or is about to adopt, it, and I feel certain that the day is not far distant when it will be in operation throughout the length and breadth of the great British Empire. Before dealing with the decimal system, let us glance for a moment at what I may describe as the present-day quarto-duo-decimal conglomeration. It is not quite as bad in relation to coinage as it is in respect to weights and measures. Under it, we have the sovereign of twenty shillings, and the half-sovereign, but we have the shilling divided into twelve pence, and it is there, in my opinion, that it is at fault. There may not be so much objection to our present system of coinage, and, therefore, it seems to me to be easier to bring about a change in regard to it than it is to make a  change in respect of weights and measures. I am aware that in the United Kingdom the opposite &#34;opinion appears to be entertained. Men and women there, who have given serious thought to this subject of decimalization, apparently hold the view that the metric system, as applied to weights and measures, should be the first to be taken in hand, leaving for a later .period the change with respect to coinage. They seem to think that the transition from the present inadequate system of weights and measures to the metric system would be the more easily accomplished. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so. It has, for instance, been adopted in connexion with all electrical work, and generally, I believe, in all branches of science. Even granting that, however, I fail to see that it should be easier to make the change from the present system of weights and measures to the metric system than it would be to introduce decimal coinage. Chambers of Commerce and Chambers of Manufactures in Australia advocate, as a first instalment, the introduction of decimal coinage, leaving to a future date the introduction of a metric system of weights and measures. The English system of weights and measures is one that has simply grown up with the course of time ; it is not the result of the combined wisdom of great thinkers, as the decimal system is. In the olden days, they took the yard measure from the length of the King&#39;s arm, and the inch measure from the length of the King&#39;s thumb; and the whole system might very well be called the rule-of-thumb system. We have the mile measuring 1,760 yards, the yard measuring 36 inches, and the foot measuring 12 inches; there being no easily-recognised ratio of one to another. Our systems of measurement are absolutely inadequate in these days, and stand in the way of commercial development. Our system of weights is even worse than our system of measures. When a ton is spoken of, we do not know whether a ton of 2,000 lbs. or one of 2,240 lbs. is meant. When we speak of a hundredweight, we refer, not to a cental, but to 112 lbs. Then we have the stone weighing 14 lbs. A bushel of wheat weighs so much, a bushel of oats something else, and other bushels have other weights. The learning of the various weights and measures taxes the brains of the growing community unduly. We have three measures of weight - apothecary&#39;s weight, troy weight, and avoirdupois weight. Liquid measurement, is just as involved. Every person of common sense in Australia, let alone every educated person, must realize that, by the retention of our present system, we are standing in our own light. In my opinion, the British Empire is making a mistake in clinging to this system,, which has been thrown over by civilized nations. Honorable members, no doubt, understand the decimal system. There is no need to sing its praises, because it recommends itself. Like a good article, it does not need advertising. But the question arises, How are we to alter our present system of coinage to the decimal system ? It would not be necessary to change many of our coins. I would propose the adoption .of the florin as the unit. That would allow of the retention of  the  sovereign, the half-sovereign, the shilling, and the sixpence. Austria-Hungary has a two-shilling piece for the unit of its coinage, coupled with the decimal system, and has found it very satisfactory. The florin, or two shilling piece, could be divided into 100 cents., its value being 96 farthings. A 2 cent, piece - about |d. in value - would be the smallest coin that we should need in Australia. In adopting this system, we should do well to get rid of the unwieldy bronze coins that we now use. To carry any large number of pennies or halfpennies now requires very strong pockets. For bronze coins we might well substitute nickel coins, as they have done in America and other countries, these being lighter and less bulky, and having a neater appearance. If I desired, I could read to the House great slabs of literary matter to support what I have said; but I would sooner state the case as it presents itself to my mind, and allow those who desire to consult literature on the subject to do so for themselves. I am sure that no honorable member wishes me to read out to the House what he can read for himself. The adoption of the metric system would, perhaps, have consequences reaching further than those of the adoption of the decimal system. The metric system is a uniform one. The metre, or stick, as it is called in some countries, has a length equal to the forty millionth part of the circumference of the  globe, measured through the poles, and is the unit of the system. In the ascending scale, we have the decametre, or ten metres; the hectometre, or 100 metres; and the kilometre, or 1,000 metres. In countries where the metric system is used, kilometres are employed for reckoning distances, much as we use miles. On the descending scale, we have the decimetre, which is one-tenth of a metre; the centimetre, which is one-hundredth of a metre; and the millimetre, which is one thousandth of a metre. This is a very simple system of lineal measurement. For liquid measurement, the litre is the unit. A litre contains about one and three quarter pints, or about 2 lbs. of water of a certain density; and it ascends and descends in multiples of ten, similarly to the metre. For the measurement of surfaces, the are is the unit, it being equal to 100 square metres. One hundred ares make one hectare, which contains about 2&#163; acres of our measurement, and is the term generally used in speaking of large areas. Before proceeding to deal with the objections to the changes that I propose, let me point out some of the advantages that would accrue from it. They are manifold, but I shall speak of only a few. In the first place, the adoption of the decimal and metric systems would make arithmetic a much easier thing for our children, and would save fully .twelve months&#39; tuition in the primary schools. If an article cost 56 cents., it is easy, to reckon by the decimal system what 100 articles of the same kind would cost. You merely add two noughts, and place a dot before them, and you get the result - 56 florins; but, with the English system, a rather difficult computation would have to be made. I know that my children have much more difficulty with their arithmetic lessons than I. used to have with arithmetic in Germany under the decimal system. If the decimal system of coinage and the metric system were adopted by the British Empire, and by the people of the United States of America, who now have the former only, it would mean uniformity in these matters throughout the civilized world. That would certainly be of great advantage ; and, further, I believe it would tend to bring nearer that day of universal peace for which we all long. The nomenclature of the system is the same in all countries where it is adopted, and a common way of reckoning throughout the world is bound to have the effect of bringing the peoples of the world more closely together. I could enlarge on the manifold advantages which this system would confer on the commercial life of Australia, but I intend to devote the time at my disposal to some of the objections we hear, or have heard, from time to time. As soon as anything new is proposed a large number of people are always found to oppose it, owing to that conservative strain which runs throughout&#39; human nature. I know that some of my friends, who are radical, or even absolutely socialistic, or anarchical, in their political ideas, and would repudiate any idea of conservatism, are in their private life the most conservative of all. When it was proposed to replace the old horse trams in Adelaide with electric traction many people were heard to declare that they would not care if the old system remained for ever, and this was simply because of some little arrangements as to alighting, and so forth, to which they had become accustomed in the course of years; but now, of course, no one would dream of suggesting that we should go back to the old state of things. On another occasion an acquaintance of my own bitterly opposed the introduction of the deep drainage into Adelaide, considering that it would do more harm than good, but as time went on, and the system was established, this gentleman became the  chairman  of an important Board of Health  in the metropolitan area, and sang quite a different tune. This strain of conservatism, as I say, we find running throughout the human kind; and it is only natural when a system, which, after all, is not so very different from that it seeks to replace, is suggested that a vast number of people should make objections, particularly before and during its developmental stages. I was a boy of ten or twelve, on the Continent, when this system was introduced there, and I remember that a great number of people found fault with it, but they very soon got over any annoyance they may have felt. The great mass of the workers very readily adopted it, as has been proved in other countries over and over again. If they are given proper wages and good living conditions they do not care whether they have to reckon in pennies or in cents. The other day a gentleman in South Australia, in talking over this matter, said that the workingmen&#39;s wives would not like to go into a shop and ask for a kilogramme of butter, but I may say that, even at the present time, in Germany, the people still ask for their butter, and other commodities, in pounds, the only difference being that for a pound they get half a kilo, or a difference of a few ounces. Then it is said that the introduction of this system would mean that the business people would have to alter their methods, but this was not found to be the case in other countries, where the people very readily fell in with the new method. An objection is sometimes raised that this system would necessitate the alteration of old, or the installation of new, machinery. True, this had to be done in other parts of the world, but, apparently, it did not amount to very much. Besides, the system would not be introduced straight away, but a period of possibly three to five years would elapse, allowing plenty of time for the people to absorb the new idea. It is said the system would necessitate the storekeeper providing new scales, but so far as the ordinary balance scales are concerned, they could be just as readily used as at present. Doubtless some of the weighing machines would have to be discarded in course of time. There is, however, another fairly weighty argument. If we initiated the system here, and it were not adopted in the United Kingdom at the same time, it is said it would mean a dislocation of business - that there might be a tendency of the trade of Australia and the other self-governing colonies drifting to those countries where the decimal system is in operation. I freely admit there may be something in that apprehension, because I know that countries, where there is a decimal system, are more inclined to deal with countries similarly circumstanced. However, if a law were passed in Australia initiating the metric and decimal system, we should again show a beacon light to other parts of the Empire, as we have done on many other occasions. It would, to a degree, at any rate, force the hands of the authorities at Home, especially if they feared to lose some of their trade. </para>

                            <para>- We could, at any rate, initiate a decimal system of coinage as a first step towards bringing about the entire reform. I regard this as a very important matter for all the people of Australia, and I hope that the day will come when the whole of the British Empire will adopt a system which would be of the greatest advantage from a commercial point of view. If nothing comes of this motion beyond once more drawing the attention of the people of Australia to the subject, it will be something to the good. I am certain that the great commercial interests of Australia are awakening to the fact that, by postponing this reform, they are standing in their own light. </para>

                        <para>.- The honorable member for Boothby is to be commended for submitting this motion.  His  earnest appeal strikes me as a comment of some considerable force on the difficulty there is in bringing public opinion to appreciate a reform which, to any one who gives it the slightest attention, is absolutely necessary and almost inevitable. This is a matter which has before engaged the attention of the Federal Parliament. In 1902, a Select Committee was appointed to go into the whole question of decimal coinage, and it brought down what I am justified in calling a very interesting and instructive report. As a member of that Committee, I am very glad to say that the work was done with much enthusiasm, and we had the benefit of the special knowledge and study brought to bear on the subject by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. G.</inline> B. Edwards, whose tragic death we all deplore. The Committee&#39;s recommendation was unanimous; and while I do not desire to traverse the ground covered by the honorable member for Boothby, I may remind honorable members that the difficulties he mentions were brought before us and dealt with in a way that I think shows that they can be overcome. We can take as a basis for the reform the present sovereign, and we can make a decimal coinage on that basis with very little alteration. The Select Committee recommended that we should have the sovereign and silver coins of the present value of 2s., ls., and 6d., and that the bronze coinage should represent decimal fractions of the sovereign, and be known as 4 cents, 2 cents, and 1 cent respectively. Thus the alteration would only apply to the present bronze coinage, and, in view of the undoubted advantage of the simplification of brain work in all calculations in <inline font-style="italic">money</inline> matters, and of the other advantages to be derived, the wonder is that we have not been able to persuade others in the Empire that the change should be adopted. But that is exactly where the difficulty arises in following up the report of the Select Committee. In June, 1904, a resolution was carried in this House in the following terms - </para>

                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">That resolution was carried unanimously, but, in spite of that, we are still working on the old unscientific basis. The difficulty undoubtedly has been to persuade the Imperial authorities to adopt the change in Great Britain. We are in a somewhat different position from that of Canada, which has adopted a decimal system almost identical with that of the United States. On account of her proximity to the United States, and because of the amount of trade between the two countries, it was only natural that the monetary system of those two countries should be identical. In Australia, We do the bulk of our business with the Mother Land, and it was repeatedly Urged before the Select Committee, by business men and others, that great trouble would arise in regard to business relationships between Australia and the Mother Land if &#39;Australia adopted a coinage of her own. I think the difficulties have been somewhat exaggerated. The calculation necessary to adjust matters would be very simple; and just as Australia has  shown  the lead to the Mother Land in regard to legislation in many other ways, she might easily take this step and give the Old Country the lead in the matter of decimal coinage. There is in Great Britain a large amount of inert public opinion, and an indifference to this reform, which it will take man, years for the enthusiasts in favour oi monetary &#39;reform to overcome; but 1 know these enthusiasts are working hard, and if we in Australia, following the recommendations of the Select Committee, and the terms of the resolution carried in this House, introduce the proposed legislation, it will not only give Australia a reform that will be of considerable advantage, but it will also strengthen the hands of those endeavouring to secure the change in Great Britain, and undoubtedly lead to the adoption of the same principle throughout the Empire. </para>

                        <para>.- The honorable member for Boothby is to be commended for bringing forward this motion, so that the matter may be considered by the House once more.

Of course, this is a question requiring special study, which, I suppose, the honorable member for Boothby has given to it; but, in one aspect of it- the decimal coinage aspect - it would appear that the reform suggested could be brought about with very little inconvenience. Certainly, if arrangements cannot be made with the Imperial Government to adopt the system, it would be quite safe for Australia to adopt it. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs,</inline> the Commonwealth Statistician, and an authority on this question, indicates that the confusion that would follow our adoption of the proposed system would be very slight.

Though there are many difficulties connected with the adoption of the metric system, the sooner the change is brought about the less will be the expense of bringing the Empire into line with other nations. The metric system is particularly one that should be settled at an Imperial Conference, but the decimal coinage system is one our Government could take in hand for the approval of Parliament, and at once open up negotiations with the Imperial Parliament to see whether it would not be advisable for Australia to do the same as Canada has done. </para>

                            <para>- There is nothing to prevent it. Canada has her own system. We know that decimal coinage could be adopted in Australia with probably a minimum of friction, but as an integral part of the Empire we should endeavour to bring about uniformity in our coinage and weights and measures through an Imperial Conference. At any rate, it would be well to first exhaust those means before introducing the system in Australia. I can see no great difficulty in adopting the decimal system of coinage. As <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs</inline> points out, the only substantial alteration that will be required will be in the parts of the shilling. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. There was formerly a good deal of difference respecting the coinage of our own silver, but now we find it a great advantage. We shall soon be in a position, I hope, to do away with the cumbersome bronze coins we are using, and to adopt the nickel coin. I understand the Government are now considering this point. Coining our own silver has had the effect of creating another industry in Australia. </para>

                            <para>- It was anticipated that we would make a profit of &#163;60,000 a year when we started coining our own silver, but we find now that the profit will probably be three or four times that amount. This is not a party question, and it is one that may well be considered by the Government. It should simplify business in Australia. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, and we are seriously contemplating the abolition of the copper coinage, and the adoption of the suggestion of the honorable member for Balaclava, that we should have a nickel coin. Both the metric system and the decimal system have been commented on by leading statesmen in Great Britain. A Select Committee of the House of Commons reported in 1895 in favour of both systems, and a year or two later a motion, tabled in the House of Commons, to adopt the decimal system was only defeated by a narrow majority, showing, not only that the feeling in favour of adopting the decimal system is unanimous in Australia, but that it is growing, and continuing to grow, in Great Britain. I hope that, as the result of the passing of this motion, the Government will make the question a live one. I hope that they will see fit to adopt it as part of their policy, and to provide for a system of decimal coinage, even if it is not prepared at this stage to introduce a metrical system of weights and measures. I trust that the Government will open up negotiations with the British Government, even before the next Conference, with a view to the simultaneous adoption of one, if not both, systems here and in the Old Country, and that, even if the Imperial authorities cannot see their  way to make such a change, the Government will be prepared to bring about in Australia the adoption of, at least, the system of decimal coinage. </para>

                    <para class="block">I offer no apology for bringing this proposal before the House. As a matter of fact, I submit it with a feeling of genuine pleasure, because it seems to me that in increasing these payments we shall simply do an act of justice to the aged and invalid poor of this country. I look back with much satisfaction to my association with the introduction of this beneficent system. I was a member of the first Select Committee appointed in New South Wales, many years ago, to inquire into it, and it was as the result of our report that legislation was introduced in New South Wales providing for the treatment of our aged and invalid poor in a way very different from that to which they had previously been subjected. I also remember with satisfaction having moved in this House for the appointment of a Royal Commission to inquire into the question of a Federal system of old-age pensions. The honorable member for Darwin was, I think, the first to mention the matter, but I secured the appointment of a Commission to investigate it. At that time honorable members viewed with alarm the proposal for a Federal system, because of the expenditure which it would involve, and I dare say some will view with a good deal of misgiving the present proposition to increase the payments. </para>

                            <para>- I think that a good many honorable members viewed my proposal with alarm, but I would urge upon those who may be inclined to take fright at this proposal to increase the pension payments, that it is our duty to look after the aged poor and the invalids of the Commonwealth in the best possible way. Why should we not provide, in a reasonable way, what is necessary for their subsistence? The Royal Commission of which I was  chairman  visited every State in the Union, and we held something like sixty-two or sixty-three meetings, at every one of which I had the pleasure of presiding. As the result of our inquiries, we recommended that a pension of 10s. per week should be granted to the aged and invalid poor of the Commonwealth, and I had the satisfaction of being a member of the Government which gave effect to that recommendation. In .the circumstances, therefore, having been closely associated with the introduction of the system, I have some right to bring it under review, and in doing so I ask honorable members to recall to mind the reasons that actuated us in fixing the payments at 10s. per week. It will be remembered that the Commonwealth was not so prosperous in those days as it is now, that we had to return three-fourths of our . Customs and Excise revenue to the States, and that we had to ask ourselves what was the most we could afford to pay, and what was the lowest amount that would provide a living for these people. After consideration we determined upon a payment of 10s-. per week. I find that the average pension amounts to between 9s. and 10s. per week, certain deductions being made in the case of those who have other sources of income. The figures supplied by the Treasurer show that the maximum pension is about 9s. 7d. per week, so that honorable members will see that a very large number of our pensioners must be subjected to deductions. At the time we believed that 10s. per week would be sufficient to enable the recipients to provide themselves with the necessaries of life, but I do not think any one will deny that seven years ago 10s. would purchase as much as 12s. 6d. will purchase to-day. We ought to be prepared to pay such a sum as will give these people as good a living to-day as they could secure by the expenditure of 10s. per week when we first passed this legislation. </para>

                            <para>-I am not tied to any particular amount. The Old-age Pensions Act was assented to on 10th June, 1908, and was proclaimed on 15th April, 1909, but the first payments were not made until 1st July, 1909. I am satisfied that at the time that the Act was assented to 10s. would buy as much as 12s. 6d. would buy to-day, and, that being so, we should be justified in raising the payments from 10s. to 12s. 6d. per week. I am not, however, tied to that increase. </para>

                            <para>- Not at all. If the Treasurer thinks the increase I have mentioned is not sufficient I shall be prepared to accept an advance. I realize that we shall have to find the money to provide for this alteration, but, at the same time, I cannot forget that plenty of money is being found for undertakings which do not commend themselves to me as much as this does. The qualifying age for women was reduced to sixty years by proclamation dated 18th November, 1910, but the first payments were made as from 15th December, 1910. That part of the Act which relates to invalid pensions was brought into operation on the same date, and payments were also made as from 15th December, 1910. The number of old-age pensioners in the Commonwealth on 30th June, 1913, was as follows- New South Wales, 30,869; Victoria, 25,434; Queensland, 11,221; South Australia, 7,752; Western Australia, 3.484; Tasmania, 4,183; total, 82,943. The estimated cost of increasing the maximum pension from 10s. to 12s. 6d. per week during the current year is &#163;640,000 per annum. I agree with the Treasurer that we must carefully consider the whole question before we call upon the people of Australia to bear this additional impost, but can we continue to claim that we are paying old-age pensions equal to those paid when the system was first introduced, if it can be shown that, owing to the increased cost of living, the payments to-day are not sufficient to keep body and soul together? </para>

                            <para>- No doubt that is so. I think that we might well have some alterations made in the administration of the Act itself. I have taken serious exception to the opinion which seems to prevail in the minds of some people that these pensions are in the nature of a charity. The honorable member for Darwin, and others, who sat with me on the Royal Commission, . will remember that our very first recommendation was that they should be granted, not as a charity, but as a matter of right. The old pioneers, who blazed the track and made the country suitable for us to live in, are as much entitled to a pension as is a Judge, and deserve just as well of the people of this country. It would be a case of Heaven help many of us, if we had not had these enterprising pioneers to clear the way for us. I therefore press this proposal upon the favorable attention of the Treasurer. The poor are always with us, and we should see that they are not neglected, even if it becomes necessary to impose extra taxation in order to provide for them. There are plenty of sources of revenue as yet untouched. Some members of the Commission suggested, for instance, that there should be a tax on sport; that every person who enters a race-course, a theatre, or a stadium, should be called upon to pay a small tax for this purpose </para>

                            <para>- Yes, we have the power, but I have always set myself against special taxation for this purpose. One matter of administration which is capable of improvement relates to the delay which takes place in granting applications for pensions. Sometimes a delay of two or three months occurs and that is altogether unreasonable. We know that the Treasurer has a warm and generous heart, and I ask him to give special attention to this matter, and to see that there is no delay. It is all very well to tell me, as the officials do, that a pension, when granted, is paid as from the date of application, with the result that the applicant gets his back payments in a lump sum, but meantime be may have been starving for weeks. I ask the Treasurer to exercise his power, and to see that this delay does not take place. </para>

                            <para>- Then, if I were in the Treasurer&#39;s position, I would quickly send out a &#34;chaser.&#34; I hope that the idea that the pension is paid as a matter of charity will be exploded, and that we shall divest this question of any party complexion. We all realize the responsibility of our position. The sum of &#163;640,000 would mean a large increase to our annual expenditure, but we must look after the army of distressed sick and aged. There are many sources of revenue which might be relied on to provide funds for the increase which I suggest, and it could also be provided for by stopping extravagance. There are many items in the Appropriation (Works and Buildings) Bill on which savings could be effected for the benefit of our invalid and aged. It must be remembered that the money given to these people is spent in the country. I make no excuse for having brought forward the motion, which, I am sure, will commend itself to the good sense of honorable members generally. I appeal to the Treasurer not to allow his official feelings to get the better of his sound sense, and ask him not to condemn the proposal merely because he feels that he cannot afford it. Australia is the richest country on God&#39;s earth, where every commodity can be produced. Let our aged poor share in our prosperity; let them feel that, in the time of plenty, we are prepared to give them consideration. There are financial difficulties in the way of what I propose, but they can be overcome. If the Treasurer will tell the House that he will give the generous consideration for which I ask, his financial genius will enable him to find the means for doing so. I should like a vote on the motion this afternoon, because I feel certain that, if four-fifths of the members of the House support my proposal, the Treasurer&#39;s political sagacity will cause him to take notice of the fact. Believing that I am proposing what is right, I leave the motion in the hands of the House. I do not insist on a pension of 12s. 6d., but, after careful consideration, that has seemed to me to be a fair amount. However, I shall be ready to listen to argument, and to agree to any reasonable arrangement whereby our sick and aged poor may share in the prosperity of the country. </para>

                        <para>.-I feel sure that the Prime Minister will agree to the motion, because it is part of the policy of the country to make sufficient provision for the aged, and they cannot live on the allowance that they now get. There has been a general increase in the price of commodities all over Australia, and in many instances the pensions that are paid are wholly absorbed in the payment of rents. The honorable member for Eden-Monaro has told us that, in his experience, the pensions are not sufficient to keep those to whom they are paid in a position of comfort, and honorable members will agree that that is so, and that it is absolutely necessary that the pensions shall be increased. </para>

                            <para>- I did not hear the honorable member for Eden-Monaro speak of the rise in rents, but it is one of the main reasons for increasing these pensions. I have several pensioners in my division, and know that they cannot live on their present pensions. The Government are very generous to those whom they employ, as can be shown by an analysis of the Estimates, and they should show generosity to the old-age pensioners as well. The law requires amending in other respects besides the rate of pensions. I think that too much value is placed on the property owned by pensioners, which results in the allowances given to them being quite insufficient. </para>

                            <para>- The law has not been sufficiently liberalized. In my electorate there are two old people who own a couple of houses, in one of which they live, but the rent from the other is not sufficient to keep them, though the value of their property prevents them from drawing pensions. Something should be done for persons in that position, and I think that an amendment of the Act is necessary to that end. When old persons have property like this, which they are not inclined to sell, they should be given a sufficient allowance to enable them to live in comfort. The small increase that the honorable member for Eden-Monaro suggests will be hardly sufficient to cover the advance in the prices of commodities of late years. No doubt the hon.orable member will have sufficient influence with the Treasurer to secure the serious consideration of his proposal. I feel sure that when an amending Bill is introduced, the increase which he advocates will be provided for. Australia owes its present position to the early efforts of its old people. They developed the country, and have done the hard work of pioneering. Many of them struggled hard to save money for their declining days, but were overtaken by misfortune, and found themselves unable to accumulate sufficient to keep them in comfort in their old age. They draw pensions, not because they are desirous of living on the charity of the country, but because they are entitled to anything the country can give them in return for the good work that they did in the early -days. The Government should seriously bear that in mind. I hope that, having dealt so liberally with the Public Service, the Government will deal liberally with the old-age and invalid pensioners. The honorable member for Eden-Monaro did not, I think, refer to the position of the blind. They, in my opinion, need more consideration than they receive, and I hope that when the law is amended they will be better provided for. Every blind person in Australia should be entitled to a pension, whether in an institution, and doing work, or not. A blind person may be able to earn a little money, but he cannot earn sufficient to give him the comfort and happiness that we desire for him. There can be no greater affliction than blindness. The number of blind persons in Australia is not very large, but that is a greater reason for giving their case generous consideration. I hope that the amending Bill will provide for them an allowance which will enable them to live in greater comfort than they can at present enjoy. There are two blind institutions in my division, which I have visited on many occasions. The blind are highly intelligent, and able to discuss almost any question that is brought forward. They spend their nights in being read to, and seem to be  able to grasp ideas more quickly than persons whose visual faculties are  unimpaired. I am very desirous of having them better provided for, and I am sure that the honorable member for Eden-Monaro will assist me in getting what I want. Our aged people are very dear to me, and I feel sure that not only members on this side, but also honorable members opposite, will support the proposal to deal with them and with our blind friends more liberally. I hope that the honorable member for Eden-Monaro will not allow his motion to be lost sight of, but will press it to a division, and will use his influence with the Government to secure the introduction of a measure, even this session, which will grant the relief that he has asked for. </para>

                        <para>.- I am very glad that the honorable member for Eden-Monaro has brought forward this motion, and I advise the Treasurer to make a statement to the House of the Government&#39;s intention in regard to it. This is a question which should be above party politics. No doubt we are all imbued with the highest humane ideals. There are in our midst persons who, in their declining days, find themselves in poor circumstances through no fault of their own. When the pension system was inaugurated in New South Wales thirteen or fourteen years ago, 10s. had as much purchasing power as 15s. has now, the prices of commodities and rents having increased so much. This Parliament has acted very generously towards the highly-paid public servants in increasing their salaries, and it has increased the wages paid to all Commonwealth workmen. The increase of wages brings about an increase in the prices of commodities, and our unfortunate invalid aud old-age pensioners have to battle against high rents and high prices, making it very difficult for them to support existence at all. This is a subject on which we should have short speeches, and come to a division very quickly. Honorable members on both sides are, I believe, agreeable that every consideration should be given to our old and invalid people. Money spent in this direction is money well spent, and it would be better to devote more to this object than to the very expensive naval and military system which we have initiated. The Government show no desire to cut down the defence expenditure, and they should certainly take into consideration those people who have made it possible for us to have a Navy at all. We have a splendid asset in our country, the wealth and revenue of which are increasing by leaps and bounds. The late Government left a surplus of &#163;2,600,000, and I do not see a better way of spending that than in increasing the payments to our aged and invalid citizens. If the Government devoted &#163;600,000 to increasing invalid and old-age pensions, they would still have &#163;2,000,000 left of the Fisher surplus, and I am sure that their action would be indorsed by the people of the country. When the late Government proposed the maternity allowance, they were asked where the money was to come from; but they faced the position, and the public do not complain of the expenditure of &#163;600,000 per annum which that allowance involves. I believe the allowance is approved by the country, and the present Government would doubtless obtain much political kudos, and strengthen their position, if they adopted the suggestion contained in the motion. I know that, personally, I should not attempt to make any political capital out of such a humanitarian act. The honorable member for Wimmera has a reputation as a generous citizen, and I have no doubt he will support the motion. </para>

                            <para>- The  Speaker  would rule me out of order if I were to attempt to deal with that matter. Our population is increasing every year, and also, of course, our revenue and commerce. The three years of the Fisher Government showed an increasing revenue, and we may anticipate the same under the present Government. If a referendum were taken, I firmly believe this proposal would be adopted by a majority of two to one. People are clamouring for more money on account of the high cost of living, and we know that on this ground the salaries of members of Parliament, and of the public servants, have been increased. This affords an argument, and a strong argument, for favorable consideration of the motion, for which, I am sure, we feel indebted to the honorable member for Eden-Monaro. It is not a party question, and I hope we shall have an early division, so as to show that this House at any rate contains members who have some humanitarian feeling in their breasts. </para>

                <para class="block">The time has arrived, I think, when the people of Australia demand an up-to-date Electoral Act. My object in submitting this motion is not so much to go into the past as to endeavour to formulate a scheme suitable to the electors of Australia ; past history will be appealed to by me only in order to find a way of avoiding mistakes in the future. It will be admitted by both parties that the party machine is grinding fairly hard at the present time, and that it is impossible to consider any large and important questions on their merits, with the result that they have to be set aside. Candidates are in many instances selected by a small junta, or selection committee, and they having received the stamp of approval of the party, the great bulk of the electors must either vote the party ticket or be defeated at. the polls. Some system could surely be adopted whereby the electors can give expression to their opinions without fear of their party being defeated. As to preferential voting, I have an open mind. I have never yet been able to bring myself to think that preferential voting is faultless, or even that it is the best system. It may, of course, be the best, but, at any rate, some system should, and no doubt could, be devised whereby a true reflex of the minds of the people of Australia could be shown in this House. There are many considerations that are, perhaps, as important, if not more important, than those of party. There is, for instance, the question of the Tariff, which has the effect of splitting up parties. Both sides of the House are trying to console themselves with the idea that the fiscal issue has been sunk. </para>

                                <para>-I do not say that I would. . I am not prepared at the present time to support preferential voting, but I am prepared to give every consideration to the evidence of experts of experience, to see whether they can substantiate their claims in support of that method or in support of the referendum and recall. As to . the fiscal issue, we parliamentarians may sink it, but I question whether the people of Australia are prepared to do so. Indeed, I do not see any reason why they should be asked to sink the issue, if some machinery can be devised to enable them, not only to vote on party lines, but also to vote on that issue and other large questions which come up from time to time. Many a man is put up as a candidate who is not popular, but his party feel that they cannot jeopardize the seat by splitting the vote, much as they would like to have some one else to represent them. I have had some experience of preferential voting, and it has not made me enamoured of it, while I have also seen the exhaustive ballot tried under similar conditions, and fail. Then there is the question of allowing every elector who can enrol to exercise the franchise. Provision is made to some extent in the Electoral Bill now before the House to effect this purpose by restoring the postal vote, and, I believe, that if that vote can be properly safe guarded, honorable members on both sides will be prepared to agree to its restoration. </para>

                                <para>- I have heard honorable members on the Opposition side say that they would agree to the restoration of the postal vote if properly safeguarded, and I regret that the honorable member should speak as he has done. It shows narrow-mindedness for any honorable member to say that he will not extend to the people of Australia the right to vote, and properly safeguard it. According to the Honorary Minister, there were at the last elections 77,000 people who were disfranchised through the abolition of the postal vote, owing to their being ill, or infirm, or too far removed from polling booths to vote personally. I have no desire to discuss the Electoral Bill, but I feel quite satisfied that even the honorable member for Oxley would not object to an inquiry into the matter to see if some safeguard cannot be established, so that the sick and infirm, and out-back settlers can have the postal vote restored to them. </para>

                                <para>- There is a good deal of argument in favour of what the honorable member suggests. The question of enrolment also needs some consideration. Means should be provided whereby all electors entitled to be enrolled should get their names on the roll with the least possible trouble and friction, and electors should be made to feel reasonably secure that when their names are enrolled they will not be erased for any trivial cause. There should be no stuffing of rolls. I cannot accept the statement made by the honorable member for Wide Bay, that there must necessarily be inflated rolls. There is room for improvement with regard to the removal of names. I think persons&#39; names should be kept on the rolls for more than a month after they leave a particular district, that is, until they are satisfied where their new residences are to be permanently fixed, and it seems to me a very unfair thing on our part to adopt the provision that any person who leaves a district for over a month- must have his name erased. </para>

                        <para class="block">I believe that we have, in our Electoral Department, men who are anxious to carry out their duties in a fair way, and I have no desire to cast any reflection on the officers of the Department. In fact, I think, generally speaking, the people of Australia, in their calm moments, are ready for a fair deal in regard to electoral matters. I admit that at election time people get excited and, perhaps, do things and say things which, upon calm reflection, they will not do or say.I do not think that any Electoral Registrar in the Commonwealth would make out a card for the purpose of losing it. Under the Act passed in 1911, an elector can have his name enrolled a number of times if he wishes. Though this may not be responsible for the inflated state of the rolls, it appears to be beyond all doubt that they are inflated. There is abundant evidence that they contain a number of names that should not appear on them. The adult population of Queensland, on 31st March last, could not possibly exceed 323,000, yet there were 363,057 names on the Commonwealth rolls on 23rd April. I have worked out these figures myself. They do not quite agree with some of those worked out by others with regard to the inflation of the rolls, but I venture to say they are not far from being correct. I have not gone into the deductions that should be made for lunatics, prisoners, and so on; but, calculating on the adult population of 52 per cent., we should have 323,000 electors for Queensland. On the same basis, the adult population of Victoria would be 729,890, but the enrolment was 830,286, an excess of 100,396. Again, the Commonwealth adult population should be 2,492,512, but the enrolment was 2,758,394, or an excess of 265,872. </para>

                                <para>- That is immaterial; but what I could have told, if I had seen a marked roll, was whether or not others had voted in their names. The Electoral Act of 1911 made it quite easy for persons to vote more than once. I desire now to call attention to a circular headed &#34; Confidential circular, for information of presiding officers,&#34; which was sent out by the Department on 4th January, 1911, just prior to the referenda. I have a decided objection to the reading of confidential circulars, but I think that that which I am about to quote has already been laid on the table of the House and embodied in our records.

                            <para>Advice has been obtained that an elector does not lose his right to vote because some one personating him has voted in his name, and therefore an elector who, not having already voted at the elections or referendum, claims to vote, and answers satisfactorily the questions put to him by the presiding officer, is entitled to vote, notwithstanding that some one else has voted in his name, and his name has been marked off on the list of voters. Presiding officers should act upon this advice should occasion arise, but it is not necessary or desirable that it be promulgated for public information. </para>

A similar circular was sent out just prior to the last general elections. Honorable members will recollect that, when the amending Bill was before us in 1911, the honorable member for Maribyrnong expressed great indignation because some one had issued a paper showing the electors how to vote. </para>

                        <para class="block">The Electoral Officer in Queensland sent these papers to the Chief Electoral Officer, who, in turn, forwarded them to the Crown Law Officer for advice. The Crown Law Officer gave a decision, which has not yet been made public, and sent on the papers to the Attorney- General for action or advice. The Attorney-General of that day - the honorable member for West Sydney - has not yet given his opinion to the Department, but he did give an opinion to his party in Queensland, which caused them to withdraw the first issue of these papers, and to substitute another which was almost the same. I think I had just as much right to receive the Attorney-General&#39;s advice as the Labour party in Queensland had. </para>

                                <para>- No action has yet been taken. I invite honorable members to examine these papers for themselves, and to say whether they are not dangerously near to, if not an absolute infringement of, the Act. The effect of their use, in one instance at least, was to disfranchise a lady who, it was thought, intended to vote for me. It is difficult to point to specific cases, but this is one. The lady in question went to vote at Silkstone, and was handed a set of these papers by workers for the Labour party. She was told that all she had to do in order to record her vote was to put them in the ballot-box, and that is all she did. Hearing of what had happened, I had my scrutineer on the watch for the papers, and here is a paper which represents the vote cast for me by this lady at the last general elections. </para>

I think I have made it sufficiently clear that the Act has been infringed; that the Labour party which amended the law two years ago with a view of preventing the use of electioneering papers likely to mislead, were the first to use them, and that they used them in a wholesale way reflecting discredit upon them. Other irregularities due to the hurried nature of the elections also occurred. To these I do not take any great exception, but I would point out that it is within the power of the House to remove the cause. The public are under the impression that honorable members receive &#163;600 per annum, whereas from the date of the dissolution of Parliament until our re-election we are not paid anything. The ex-Minister of Home Affairs had in view the very laudable object of seeing, as he told me, that the  &#39; Christians should not be too long without their money,&#34; and he therefore hurried on the general election. I am not. willing to sacrifice efficiency, even for my own benefit, but it would be a fair thing to amend the Parliamentary Allowance Act to allow the sitting member to draw his allowance until his successor is elected. If that amendment of the law were made, we could have an interval of three months, if necessary, between the dissolution of Parliament and the election, which would give the officers of the Electoral Department time to make their arrangements perfect. They had hardly sufficient time on the last occasion. </para>

                                <para>- I do not think so. The sitting member must perform the duties of his position until his successor has been elected, and during an election campaign has more work to do than falls to his share at any other time, because he comes into contact with so many persons, and is thus asked to attend to many things which would otherwise not be brought under his notice. At the last election, for some unexplained reason, the ballot-boxes used in Queensland were made in Victoria. They arrived in Brisbane by steamer on the 5th May, but, that being a holiday on which the wharf labourers were not working, were taken up the north coast, and did not get back until the 16th May. As it takes three weeks, and even more, to reach some parts of the Kennedy division, the House can imagine the bustle that there was to get the boxes distributed throughout the State in time for the election. It is surprising that there were so few irregularities and mistakes, but there were some. The absent voting provision was responsible for a good deal of trouble. In my opinion, absent voting is a good thing, and should be retained. Rut the electoral officers, and not the general public, as happened .in some cases, should have charge of the polling booths. Quite a number of persons were unable to vote because of the shortage of ballot-papers. At Mount Crosby an elector told me that he found it impossible to get into the polling booth in the morning, and therefore could not record his vote. As to what happened at Oxley, which is on the border of the Oxley and Moreton divisions, a great part being in one, and the balance in the other, I have had this letter from a friend. He says - </para>

                            <para>I got out of bed yesterday, and went to Oxley to vote, at about 2 p.m., only to find that the presiding officer there had only been supplied with five absentee declaration forms. The presiding officer applied to his superior at Sherwood, and that official is supposed to have forwarded an application to Brisbane for forms. David Hunter also visited Oxley in a motor, and took away an application for forms. Attempts were also made to get forms at other booths, but all were short. We were all satisfied the authorities would send the forms, but they did not arrive - at least they had not arrived when I left, at &#163; p.m. Finally, I had to drive to Cooper&#39;s Plains in the cold westerly wind at considerable personal risk. I managed to get about a dozen voters to the Plains, but you lost at least twenty more around here. Oxley residents are very indignant over the matter. . . . There is a lot of sickness about here, and old folks, who would have gone the few yards to Oxley, would not face the 3 miles or more to the Plains. </para>

A gentleman named Hunter went to the presiding officer at Kangaroo Point, or to some other place in the Oxley division, and got 100 ballot-papers without being required to sign any acknowledgment. They were simply handed to him, and he took them to the officer for whom they were intended. That was a loose way of doing business. A great many irregularities occurred, of some of which there is definite proof, while others can be supported only by hearsay evidence, with which I do not wish to deal. I think that I have made out a case for investigation, and do not wish to labour the matter further. It may not be usual to nominate the members of a Commission, but I would suggest the appointment of the honorable members for Denison, Melbourne, Wakefield, and Hume, together with the mover. </para>

                            <para>.- I support the motion, because, if ever there was a time when an inquiry was needed it is now. There have been wholesale charges of irregularity, though no  evidence  in support of them. An example of that has been given this afternoon. The honorable member for Moreton exhibited a dummy ballot-paper, which he says his scrutineer picked up on the floor of a polling booth. He alleged that the party to which I belong informed a lady  that all  she had to do was to go to the polling booth and drop this paper in the ballot-box. The honorable member told his scrutineer to be on the look-out for it, and by some mysterious means it came into his possession. What evidence is that to bring before the House? What proof is there that the scrutineer did not mark this imitation ballot-paper himself, and hand it to the honorable member, saying, &#34; This is what the dreadful Labour party have done.&#34; The story is so palpably thin that I am astonished that it was introduced as evidence of an irregularity. </para>

                        <para class="block">There has been only one electoral Select Committee since the Commonwealth was established, and it was on the recommendations of that Committee, of which I was a member, that the first Electoral Act was framed. It is absolutely essential that an inquiry should be undertaken forthwith. If the Government are sincere in their desire for legitimate reform, why should they burke an inquiry of this character ? If they have any evidence, they have not given the House the advantage of it in regard to the alleged irregularities at the recent election. There have been charges galore, but the inquiries instituted by the Liberal party themselves disclosed nothing, and the Chief Electoral Officer, in his report, practically disposes of the allegations that were made. In that report it is pointed out that the errors probably do not amount to more than three in 1,000, and that apparent duplicate voting was accounted for by the act of different persons of exactly similar names being on the rolls and wrongly ticked off - that the facts pointed more to clerical errors than wilful acts. In the interests of the electors, who have been maligned in every part of the Continent, there should be a most drastic and searching inquiry. If there are irregularities, let us put an end to them, but do not condemn the whole body of electors upon the mere gossip of irresponsible persons, especially in the face of the testimony of the Chief Electoral Officer that he knows of none. In my opinion, the Government ought to postpone the further consideration of the Electoral Bill until such evidence as could be elicited by an inquiry enables them to bring down an up-to-date measure. I suppose, however, that the honorable member for Moreton has no assurance from the Government to that effect. The first Select Committee, to which I have referred, consisted of seven members, and, as they were not paid for their services, the cost to the country was only that incurred by a visit to Sydney. The report was produced in reasonable time, and on that report the present Minister of Trade and Customs, as the then Minister of Home Affairs, framed the Electoral Act on which the second election was held. We have had the broad statement that 77,000 odd persons, who were ill and incapacitated, were disfranchised by the abolition of the postal vote. As to that number being ill and incapacitated, the statement is absolutely incorrect, and yet it has been made over and over again. If a reasonable proposal to restore the postal vote, with proper safeguards for the secrecy of the ballot, is made, I shall support it, but I cannot consent to that privilege being accorded on broad, indefinite statements, such as we have had in this House and in the newspapers time and again. Every inquiry made, so far, has cleared the character of the people, and not one scintilla of evidence can the Attorney-General produce that there were any irregularities or anything but that which might be expected at election time. It is unfair to the electors to charge them with all these political crimes, in the absence of any evidence. </para>

                                <para>- It was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> who said the dead were taken out of the grave to vote. I look on the ballot-box as too sacred a thing to be interfered with in the way alleged; but, on the other hand, the honour of the electors ought not to be impugned on irresponsible gossip. I feel confident that if a Royal Commission be appointed the character of the electors will be thoroughly vindicated,  because- I do not believe that one irregularity could be proved. There were charges of duplication made in my own district, but they were proved groundless. One lady was supposed to have voted at Hergott Springs, and to have also voted, at another place over 100 miles away, although there was no railway or other quick means of communication. The explanation was that another person of exactly the same name, who did not vote at all, was ticked off as having voted. In another case a highly respectable  farmer  voted as an absent voter in Adelaide, and was also supposed to have voted at Tumby Bay, although the ocean lay between,  with  no steam service at the time; in fact, it was impossible for him to have done so. The explanation in this case was that his nephew, of the same name, John Calderwood, had voted at Tumby Bay in person. In every case I found that the supposed duplication was an error on the part of the clerk. I have filled the position of scrutineer many times, and I defy any man to go through the whole of the day&#39;s work without making some mistake. As we know, the Chief Electoral Officer admits that three errors in every 1,000 votes are not unreasonable under the pressure, especially when, as on the last occasion, something like 80 per cent, of the people polled. I shall support the motion. </para>

                            <para>. - I support the motion because so much has been said that we ought to clear the atmosphere. I disagree with the conclusion of the honorable member for Grey, who contends that, because the inquiries that have been made are not very conclusive or clear, therefore there were no informalities or irregularities. Everybody knows that the rolls were in a rotten state. </para>

                                <para>- I have had a little experience of rolls, and I can say that those of New South Wales were very bad. Of course, I am not taking any exception to what happened, because we were all elected. I should like this inquiry to cover the appointment of those who are placed in charge of the various districts. The present system is to appoint the postmaster as the Returning Officer, though he may be only a temporary or relieving man, with no experience of the duties. Why should we not&#39; have permanent men, so that the experience of one election will prove profitable at the next? </para>

All I can say is that the experience of the honorable member, and others, are a revelation to me; we are infants compared to them. I should not like to put up for a constituency in South Australia or Queensland after what I have heard. One Queensland honorable member has charged another with &#34; working the oracle,&#34; and yet the former has managed to secure something out of the ballot-box. Those honorable members know so much that if they will start a kindergarten, I shall be glad to attend. </para>

                                <para>- I hope that if this Commission is appointed it will be above party suspicion, and composed .of men in this House in whom we have confidence. Charges have been flung around, and we are all agreed that some inquiry is necessary. There were some very curious things- at the last election; and I could tell some stories if I felt inclined. There were some duplications in my district, but, as they were the names of ladies and gentlemen who supported me, I went no further; besides, I knew they were above suspicion . I rose to support the motion for the appointment of this committee or commission. I hope it will be a body that will give satisfaction. I hope it will be one that we can have confidence in, and one without party bias. We are not so much concerned with the last election. What we wish the committee to demonstrate is what should be done in regard to the next election, which is probably not far off. Perhaps it would be well if this committee could recommend that Parliament be elected for five years, because in the present circumstances no sooner are we through one election than we are faced with another. </para>

                            <para>.- I support the motion to appoint a commission to inquire into elections, because it is absolutely necessary to have some inquiry, and if the Government have any consideration for the people of Australia and any regard to the slanderous statements made by many of their supporters, it. is only fair that they should grant the request of the honorable member. No honorable member was- subjected to as much criticism as was directed towards me. The honorable member for Moreton knows that all the statements appearing in the press were absolutely untrue. That is borne out by the recent scrutiny of the rolls in my electorate. On account of the Oxley seat having been held by a Liberal from the inception of Federation, and because I secured a majority of 3,000, the press had to say something, and one of the statements made was that after the rolls were scrutinized it would be found that about 1| votes was recorded for every elector on the roll. As a matter of fact, there were 38,238 names on the roll for the Oxley division, and the number of votes recorded at the election was 31,372 - a percentage of 82. The honorable member for Moreton has referred to a statement made in the Queens-, land Parliament by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Appel,</inline> but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Appel&#39;s  statement was made in ignorance of what was likely to happen. It was made on the Tuesday following the election, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Appel</inline> could not be in the position then to make a proper statement concerning the election. However, that is only characteristic of many statements <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Appel</inline> makes, and I do not think much notice need be taken of it. I am sorry the honorable member for Moreton attached any importance to&#39; it. He must know that it was afterwards found to be absolutely untrue. </para>

                                <para>- It was unfair to me, because the charge was practically against my election. It made out that there was something dishonest in the votes recorded for me. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Weedon</inline> supplied the figures, as the honorable member for Moreton says, then I maintain that he was not in a position to supply them. They were Federal figures in connexion with a Federal office, and he was not in a position to supply them to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Appel.</inline> However, that is merely by the way. I wish to refer to the postal vote that the honorable member for Moreton seeks to have restored. I think every member ot the Opposition is agreeable to the appointment of a committee as suggested by the honorable member, and, seeing the many statements made in reference to the late election, the Government should not hesitate to assist the honorable member in bringing about what he desires, but when consideration is given to the proposal  to restore the postal vote, I hope it will be bumped out. I agree with the honorable member for Moreton that the absent vote was of great service at the last election, and that it is of as much value as the postal vote. In fact, I consider it is of more value, and that it will give more satisfaction. </para>

I am agreeable to the introduction of a system that will allow the sick people to vote by post, but only on the certificates of doctors or nurses. I have seen the postal vote used in so many ways that I cannot agree to its restoration.

                                <para>- The honorable member for Moreton also referred to enrolments. The rolls, at the last election, were not as perfect as I would have liked to see them, because there were not sufficient officers to have many of the names that were wrongly on the rolls removed. There was not time for the officers to purify the rolls before they were sent along to the printer. But I do not think that mattered very much, so far as the last election was concerned, judging by the result of the scrutiny. That scrutiny proved that people of Australia are decidedly honest in electoral matters. I claim th&#39;at there was not a single duplication during the whole of the election. The records, furnished as the result of the scrutiny, are those of mistakes in every case. I think the highest number of alleged duplications in any division was 140. The -result of the inquiry was a great tribute to the honesty of the people of Australia. I would be prepared, after the closing of the rolls, to put on additional clerks for the purpose of clearing them up, and thus removing some of the criticism that came about after the late election. That is the only thing that need be done in connexion with the rolls. I do not think the Act needs amending to any great extent, except to give the sick and invalid people the opportunity of voting. Further than that, the Act does not require any considerable amendment. I have nothing further to say, except to tell the honorable member for Moreton that he has my whole-hearted support in bringing about this inquiry. </para>

I am glad he has brought on. this motion, because I think the comments on the recent election were a great reflection on me, as the Minister then in control of the Electoral Department. In fact, it was made to appear that I did nothing but scheme and plan to corrupt the whole of the voters of Australia. </para>

                                <para>- Nobody has said it. To blacken a woman&#39;s character you do not need to charge her directly with crime. You have only to throw out your insinuations, and the neighbours will do the rest. If ever a man tried to make a perfect roll I did when I was Minister; if ever a man tried to get the Department up-to-date, and put it on a business scale, I did; but I at once confess that when a man goes into that Department ha has to take things as he finds them. To get a Returning Officer, we must secure the services of a magistrate or a postmaster, who usually has all the work he can possibly do. Then the postmaster has to get another man, and that other man can devote only a little time at nights to electoral matters. He is too busy otherwise. These people have to make their living. I at once saw the weakness of this system. But another weakness is that the Minister cannot get the money he requires for the Department. It is all a question of finance. If the Minister goes to the Treasurer, he finds that the Treasurer wants a surplus. Every Treasurer believes that he must make his reputation by having a surplus, so certain sections, certain districts, and certain activities are starved in order to gain that end. I am glad this motion has been brought on, apart from this nonsense about corruption, because I believe that we have to deal with a number of partisan&#39;s. When I was stumping the country many people who said they could not read or write told me that they went to certain polling booths to vote in favour of the referenda questions, yet at those -polling places not a vote Was given in favour of the referenda. Those people told me that they could not read or write, but I am not going to say that the men in charge, because they were partisans, took care not to let these men and women vote for the referenda. These are the sort of stories - the &#34; flyers &#34; - one hears. Some one gives a &#39; flyer &#34; a start, and it keeps on flying and gathering force, like a snowball rolling down the &#34; Rockies &#34; ; which, by the time it reaches the bottom, is so big that you would want the whole nation to shovel it away. That is precisely the position in regard to many of these electioneering stories. I claim that the Royal Commission, if appointed, would bring up a report which must have a beneficial influence upon our electoral system. It would go into the whole question, apart from the consideration of stories and slanders, and would recommend a system that must prove of benefit to the people. I take the view that we should have a permanent Returning Officer in each division, and that we should do away with the printed rolls. My three years&#39; experience as a Minister teaches me that the &#163;12,000 to &#163;15,000 spent on printing the rolls is an absolute waste of money, because they are really antiquated before they leave the printing machine. I should be prepared to give evidence before the Commission in favour of the appointment of a permanent Returning Officer at a salary of &#163;200 or &#163;250 a year, in each division. These permanent officers would cost less than -we pay at present to print what are really useless rolls. We should substitute for the printed rolls index cards such as are used in some of the States of America. </para>

                                <para>- &#34;Under such a system, every person seeking enrolment would sign two cards instead of one, as at present. One of these cards would be retained in the Central Office, while the other would be sent to the Returning Officer of the division in respect of which the person claimed the right to vote. The relation of the Divisional Returning Officer to the Chief Electoral Officer would be very like that of principal and agent. When I represented certain corporations, I had agents in different districts. I required them to live there, and to become acquainted with the people, so that they could introduce me to them, and it was my business to secure the fellow whom they could not secure. Why should we not be able to run the Electoral Department on the same lines ? In this way alone shall we be able to secure a satisfactory system. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oldham</inline> is a splendid officer, and is absolutely impartial. There is no politics in him. If he has any leaning at all, it is to the other side, but as to that I have nothing to say. I am satisfied that his one desire is to do the right thing, but he also is hampered by want of money. Under my scheme, he would visit each division, and interview the permanent Returning Officer, whose headquarters would be the post-office in the principal town of the electorate. Steps would be taken to see that the name of every person over twenty-one  years of age was recorded. The Department at present is costing us &#163;30,000 or &#163;40,000 a year. I believe that we are paying from &#163;25,000 to &#163;28,000 a year to our Registrars. Are we doing this merely for fun ? If we are, then we ought to abolish the system, and let it disappear once and for all. With permanent Returning Officers in each division, we should have a system of exchanges. When a man changed his place of residence, and sought to have his name placed on the records, the Returning Officer for the division from which he had shifted would take his card out of the index box, and send it on to the Returning Officer for the division to which he had removed. </para>

                                <para>- Then he would be prosecuted. Is it not strange that, although we have society, wealth, luxury, and prejudice helping to keep people off the rolls, we have a law declaring that those who are not enrolled shall be liable to prosecution and punishment? Just as a man, before he puts his money into an investment, examines the proposition from every side, so should we examine our electoral system. Under my scheme, the Returning Officer in each division&#39; would make a tour of inspection from time to time, would interview his officers, and would also avail himself of the assistance of the police in seeing that all the people entitled to vote were enrolled. I would provide for compulsory voting as well as for compulsory enrolment, and I also think that the Commonwealth Government should provide vehicles to convey to the poll those who are living in country districts, and who are some distance from the nearest polling place. The Commonwealth should also pay for scrutineers. I would make a regular business of the whole thing. Election day is the greatest in the year. Is it not the day on which the people create the machine that has to carry on the whole system of government ? </para>

                                <para>- It is the foundation of the nation&#39;s prosperity, integrity, and progress. The name of every man and woman entitled to vote in respect of a division would be indexed aider the card system, and the cards would be kept in boxes and sent out by the Returning Officer to the various polling places to which they related. I would have separate boxes for those who came forward and said that, although they were over twenty-one years of age, their names were not on the list. If a man made an affidavit to that effect, I would require him to place his signature on an index-card, which would be put in a separate box, and later on, if necessary, the position in regard to such persons could be investigated. The permanent Returning Officers should be strictly nonpartisan. We must not forget that an honest ballot is the life&#39;s blood of a pure community. If ever people on either side tried to corrupt the ballot, or to secure their return by votes that ought not to be cast, the hopes of this nation would be quickly destroyed, and it would not be long before we had a name like that which Tammany Hall has made for itself in New York. I can remember that, in the case of one election there were 12,000 people on the roll, and 28,000 voted. We cannot beat that in this country. I told my constituents that if it could be shown that 300 votes had been improperly cast for me I would resign. I am glad that this motion has been brought forward by the honorable member for More ton. I hope that the Government will accept it, and that the further consideration of the Electoral Bill will be postponed until we have the report of this Commission. After all, the Electoral Bill is only a spite Bill. It has a lot of spitfire in it, but no real essence. Honorable members on both sides should come together, with the object of passing such an Electoral Bill as will be for all time a benefit and a blessing to Australia. I recognise that we can never get a perfect electoral system, because perfection cannot come out of imperfection. In this matter we have to deal with human beings, and whether they are born in Australia, America, or anywhere else, they have all passed through the same mould. I heard the honorable member for Robertson speaking the other day on the question of nationality. He said that he was born in Australia, and I was glad to hear it. Then he said he was a self-made man, and I was very glad to hear that, too, because it relieved the Almighty of a tremendous responsibility. It is a matter of no importance where a man is born. . Human nature is the same all the world over. Let the Committee make suggestions. I do not say that my scheme is perfect. If a man wishes to vote, saying that his name is John Williams, and he has apparently been personated, the Returning Officer should ask him for his signature, and at once compare it with that on the claim card, allowing him to vote if the two appear alike. I hope that the Government will put aside the Electoral Bill until we can get a report from the Committee, and that then both sides will come together, so that we can provide for clean elections, and not have charges made by defeated parties after each campaign. I know that when a man is defeated he feels bad. At one time, in South Australia, I was defeated by fourteen votes, although we polled 98 per cent, of the names on the roll, emptying the cradles and the graves. I felt bad on that occasion, but I made no charges. I told them that within two years I would be either in this House or in the House of Commons, and I came here. </para>

                            <para>. - It seems to be the general desire of honorable members opposite that electoral matters shall be inquired into, and there is an equally ardent desire on this side, both parties appearing to be of one mind on this, occasion. The honorable member for Darwin spoke of the Electoral Bill as &#34; a spite Bill,&#34; but may I remind him that it provides for the very machinery he suggests, though it does not go quite so far. It provides for the appointment of quite a number of electoral inspectors to go through the country, as he suggests, seeing that the electoral machinery is kept efficient. That is one of the main proposals of the Bill. </para>

                                <para>- All these matters are governed by considerations of finance. The electoral machinery could be made so expensive as to almost bankrupt the country. One has to be very careful as to the statements one makes, if only for financial reasons. But the electoral machinery must be put into a better state. The fundamental trouble now is that at each election we have to rely on a lot of scratch appointments. The men appointed are not experts, and in many cases do not know much about the electoral law. If there were a number of inspectors, devoting their whole time to instructing these persons in their duties, and disseminating information about electoral matters in every nook and corner, at the same time investigating the rolls and the whole machinery operating iu each electoral office, we should accomplish pretty well all that the honorable member for Darwin has suggested. We should have better business methods and more responsible control. No doubt, the postmasters do their very best, and give service far beyond what they are paid for. One cannot say a word to men like these, knowing the small sums which they receive and the tremendous responsibilities which they assume! It is the same with those who collect the rolls. But, speaking by and large, as a rule, in this world, you get what you pay for, what you buy in the market; that is, so far as the ordinary run of services is concerned. It applies to the service obtained from the man at the bottom, who works for a daily wage, right up the scale, to the man at the top, who receives a large salary. </para>

                                <para>- I quite agree with the honorable member. We must make up our minds to spend a good deal more upon our electoral machinery before we can hope for smooth and efficient working. I doubt if it will ever be perfect, seeing that it has to be worked on election day by many hundreds of persons who for three years at a stretch have no connexion with it. </para>

I am far from satisfied with things as they are. The Minister, worried with all the various cares and duties incidental to the control of a big Department, cannot properly undertake this investigation, and, therefore, if the motion be carried - I shall offer no objection to it - the Government will try to make the Commission, or whatever body is appointed, fairly representative of the whole House, and as far removed as possible from a party composition. Some inquiry must be made to put an end to the trouble that occurs after each election, and to give the public a guarantee that the best business ability that can be pressed into this service is obtained by the Government. We shall make every effort to obtain as fair an inquiry as possible. </para>

                            <para>.- The promise of the Prime Minister to appoint a Royal Commission removes the necessity for continuing the debate. I wish to express my approval of the honorable gentleman&#39;s suggestion that the Commission must be thoroughly representative. The somewhat innocent suggestion of the honorable member for Moreton that certain members whom he named, taking three from one side and two from the other, should make the inquiry, is a strange one, in view of the fact that there are thirty-seven members on each side of the House. </para>

                                <para>- No; but it would be possible to take three members from each side. My idea is that the Prime Minister will understand that the Commission is not to be strictly confined in its scope by the wording of the motion; its investigation will have to be wider than is proposed by the honorable member for Moreton if it is to do what, honorable members on both sides desire. The inquiry must be one. at which none can cavil. All matters relating to the election and referenda of 1913 must be investigated. The Commissioners must inquire into, not merely the purification of the roll, but also the means of obtaining a perfect roll, and must ascertain, not only how names should be taken off the roll, but also what is the best system for putting them on the roll. I thank the Prime Minister for promising that the Commission shall be fairly representative of both sides. I see no reason why we should follow the old practice of having an unequal number of members. Seeing that political parties in this House and in the country are equally divided, it would give more satisfaction and result in a more acceptable report to have an even number of members, half representing each political party. </para>

The works of the country, since the beginning of J uly, have been paid for out of Treasurer&#39;s Advance - that is, works in hand; and new works have not yet been begun, or, at any rate, to a very small extent. The Treasurer&#39;s Advance is exhausted, and a temporary Supply Bill will have to be on the table on Tuesday next, and I do not wish to ask for more Treasurer&#39;s Advance funds for public works. It is very inconvenient that we should not have an appropriation for works and buildings. For some reason or other, a great deal of time has been taken over this Bill. </para>

It seems to me that the parliamentary machine requires alteration when two honorable members cans detain the whole House for hours in that way.

                        <para>.- The third reading of this Bill cannot be permitted until some comment has been offered on what transpired in the previous stages, so that different statements made by honorable members may be cleared up as far as possible. I assure the Treasurer that the Opposition have absolutely no desire to delay the passage of the Bill, and there does not appear on record any indication of such a desire. The mere fact that honorable members have exercised their undoubted right to criticise the items of expenditure, and to deal generally with the provisions of the Bill, is no indication of any wish to even temporarily harass the Government. Surely the Treasurer does not suggest that we should quietly grant his permission to embark on an expenditure of some &#163;3,260,000 without seeking for information - though certainly we were not able to obtain any - or without criticism, if the direction in which it is proposed to expend the money does not meet with unanimous approval ? As it happens, there is not that unanimous approval, and, consequently, some criticism has been offered. I regret to say that we sought in vain for information. Even one or two members opposite were unable to obtain that information they desired, and the honorable member for Eden-Monaro was moved, in his disappointment and wrath, to refer to a portion of the Estimates of the Government he supports as amounting to a &#34;public scandal.&#34; These are exceptionally strong words from a supporter, and, in the circumstances, we are justified in the action we have taken. On the second reading, it was the duty of the Leader of the Opposition to call attention to the proposed increases in the staff at Garden Island and in the staff at Cockatoo Island. The right honorable member pointed out that, on the 30th June last, the establishment at Cockatoo Island was twenty-one, and the annual expenditure &#163;6,416, while the Estimates before us provide for an establishment of forty-five, and an expenditure of &#163;14,006. At </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">Garden Island, on the 30th June, the establishment was forty, with an annual expenditure of &#163;12,911, while the establishment now proposed is seventy-one, with an annual expenditure of &#163;15,311. The Leader of the Opposition asked for information regarding the proposed increase, but no satisfactory explanation was vouchsafed. The Prime Minister, when he spoke, said, in effect, that the Government were committed to these increases because the previous Minister of Defence had .either actually made or approved them. That was a very clear and emphatic statement, and I honestly believe that the Prime Minister was under the impression he was speaking correctly.  His  information, I gathered, had been obtained from the present Minister of Defence, and I took it that a mistake was being made through no fault of his own. However, the assistance of the Honorary Minister was called in, and he actually quoted from certain official papers with a view of, not merely emphasizing, but actually proving, the statements that the increases had been approved by the ex Minister. One of three positions is inevitable : Either the Honorary Minister did not understand those papers, or he did not fully quote them, or - which I should regret to believe - he did not quote them correctly. From a statement by the previous Minister of Defence, it is as clear as possible that he did not approve of those increases, and that the present Government were in no way committed to them. Today, I am pleased to say, when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> was confronted with the situation in another place, and when he was called upon to fully quote the same papers, it transpired that, as stated by the Leader of the Opposition, the late Government were in no way responsible - that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> had not given approval, and that those increases, so far as the managerial staff, overseers, and foremen are concerned, are solely the work of the present Minister. I am not here to say whether these increases are necessary or not, or whether they should be made. </para>

                            <para>- No. In connexion with Cockatoo Island there were seven experts on the Estimates of the New South Wales Government, and it was essential to take them over in the terms of the agreement, but, so far as Garden Island was concerned, the thing was taken over as a going concern, with the liabilities attaching thereto, but with no approval whatever for an increase in the staff. The staff has subsequently been increased. For the moment I am not prepared to debate whether it is essential that there should be an increase, or whether it is a good or a bad move, but I am here to take exception to the assertion of the Ministry that they are committed to these increases. I am anxious to emphasize the point, because I know that every honorable member on the Ministerial side, when discussing these matters during the next twelve months, will, without hesitation, shield himself, or attempt to do so, behind the word &#34; commitment &#34; when the subject of finance crops up. Honorable members on the Ministerial side have to explain why they propose to spend, during this year, over &#163;4,000,000 more than was spent last year. They may be able to explain it, but no doubt it is a serious matter to them, more particularly when one considers that they won their position in the House by declaiming against the alleged extravagance of the Fisher Administration. In the first place, they declaimed against that alleged extravagance; they called it by all manner of names - a &#34; carnival,&#34; a &#34; debauch,&#34; &#34; torrential expenditure,&#34; and so forth - and created in the public mind the impression that there was something wrong by referring in general terms to the millions spent by the Fisher Administration, and when they come into office with full and complete control, when they can do absolutely what they wish in connexion with this expenditure except in so far as they are statutorily committed, we find their Estimates amounting to over &#163;4,000,000 more than was spent last year. </para>

                            <para>- They will be called on in certain directions to make an explanation to the public. Their one and only explanation up to the present time is that they are committed to the expenditure, and that they cannot help themselves. We have this striking instance in which they actually go the length of pretending to quote from official documents to prove that they are committed in a certain direction. But so far as these additions to the staff at Cockatoo Island and Garden Island are concerned, I say that they are not committed to them, and that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> the late Minister of Defence, did not make approvals of this description. When, in addition to making an ordinary allegation, a Minister will actually pretend to quote from official documents in proof of the allegation, though the full and complete quotation from these documents would show conclusively that he is wrong, and that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is correct in his rebutting allegations, it seems to me to be taking a stand that is highly regrettable and deplorable. </para>

                            <para>- One of three positions is inseparable from this : either that the Minister did not quote correctly, or that he refrained from fully quoting, or that he did not understand the papers from which he was quoting. The documents read in the Senate to-day show, first of all, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> specifically declined to make these additional appointments except in regard to two or three clerks; and, secondly, that wherever the dock or managerial staff were referred to, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> declined to make any appointment, saying that it would be unfair to the new manager to do so. He refused point blank to tie the hands of the new manager; but, towards the end of his term of office, as the work was increasing, he did approve of the appointment of two or three additional clerks. So far as I can see from the Estimates, there are only eight clerks on the island altogether; there must have been some at the time the island was taken over. The position seems to me to be so acute that I feel justified in putting on record here a brief statement given to me by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> He says, in reference to Garden Island - </para>

Draft Estimates are merely the first proposal which the officers from various sub-Departments submit to the central Department. They do not commit the Minister at the moment, and they do not commit anybody other than the officers, who are not responsible to the Parliament, as a Minister is. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> says - </para>

No commitment was made; no appointments were made; and if, subsequently, appointments were made, and provision, is made on the present Estimates for them, it must be either that the present Minister of Defence has knowingly made them or he has allowed them to be made unknowingly.

                        <para>Under the Imperial Establishment there were marines in the Royal Navy. There are no marines in the Royal Australian Navy. It is understood that marines were used for guard and watch duties on Garden Island, and it became necessary, therefore, to appoint police to take their places. These appointments were, therefore, approved. But the proposal to retain ten officers and too petty officers and men (see page  100,  Estimates), was not approved by the late Minister. </para>

                            <para>- You must not commit me to what some one else is alleged to have said. I have not said it. Can any honorable member say why ten officers and a hundred petty officers and men are to be retained on Garden Island? It must not be forgotten that these are seagoing men, who ought to be on their ships, and not retained on Garden Island. To do what? No member of the Ministry knows why they are to be retained there; but, apparently, for some reason unknown to Parliament, and even to responsible Ministers, 110 officers, petty officers, and men are to be retained on this Island. Speaking with some slight experience of both sea and army, I do not know why sea-going men should be retained there. I cannot understand it. It has been suggested that they are to be in a sense the servants - the term is known in the Navy - of certain officers. I hope such is not the case. But we are justified in asking why this additional <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> is retained on the island. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> goes on to say that, so far as he knows, no reason can be given for the retention of these men - </para>

                        <para>Cockatoo Island Dockyard, it was arranged, was to be taken over from the New South Wales Government. There was a staff employed there, who were borne on the list of permanent officials of the State Government. During the transition period it was arranged that this staff should continue to manage the affairs of the dockyard, being lent to the Commonwealth by the State Government for the purpose. With respect to two of these officers - the Secretary and the Accountant - it was subsequently arranged that they should go back into the State Service, and their positions were filled by Commonwealth appointments. The late Government, had decided to obtain a general manager for the dockyard, and to seek his advice in  regard  to the staff necessary for the efficient working of the yard. To that end, they had advertised throughout the world; had received applications. They had fixed no salary. They had appointed a committee in Great Britain to go through the applications received. That committee had made recommendations on the eve of the Government, going out of office, and in consequence no appointment was made by the out-going Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> refused to make appointments on the staff other than those indicated, and some minor appointments to the clerical staff, rendered necessary by increase of work. He refused to do so on the ground that such action would tie the hands of the incoming manager. </para>

I would point out to the honorable member for Eden-Monaro that we took over practically two islands, with their separate staffs. It was intended to work the two together, and that a general manager of undoubted ability and experience should be appointed. Applications for the position were called for, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> as Minister of Defence, refused to make any appointment until the general manager was there to advise him. </para>

                            <para>- It would be quite possible to call for applications to fill a newly-created position without mentioning the salary. Would the right honorable gentleman fix the salary for an office without knowing anything in regard to it ? After all, he is sufficient of an autocrat, no doubt, to fix salaries for the whole world. We had our limitations, and we were not prepared to decide what was a fair salary to attach to a position of such magnitude as this. I desire, however, to come back to the interjection made by the honorable member for Eden-Monaro. The Naval Department, for instance, knowing that there was to be an increase in its work and that certain alterations were to be carried out, made its recommendations on draft Estimates to the then Minister of </para>

                            <para>- My honorable friends, because they happen to have been members of Cabinets of different character, are seeking to confuse the issue by suggesting that the mere appearance of the initials of the Minister on draft Estimates submitted by sub-Departments commits that Minister, or any one else, to the expenditure for which they provide. They suggest, also, that a sub-Department&#39;s draft Estimates are sent on to the Treasurer before they have been finally approved by the Department or the Minister controlling it. How utterly absurd is the suggestion. The honorable member for Eden-Monaro is fairer in this matter, since, speaking with Ministerial experience, he points out that it is not correct to suggest that draft Estimates from sub-Departments are sent on to the Treasury. Such Estimates do not, and cannot, commit the Minister. </para>

                            <para>- But they were not based on an agreement. The agreement was to take over the staffs as they existed under the State, and we took them over. Since then, however,, the staffs on both islands have been materially increased, and it is in regard to that increase that this difference of opinion exists. For instance, we took over the Cockatoo Island dockyard staff of twenty-one persons, with an additional seven who were then under agreement with the State of New South Wales. But these Estimates make provision for a staff of no less than forty-five, and it is this increase to which exception has been taken. </para>

                        <para>Proposals submitted by the Naval Board were certainly approved for draft Estimates, following the usual practice of the Minister, which was, upon receiving Estimates of sub Departments, to approve of them for draft Estimates, and when all sub-Departments&#39; Estimates were in, to then go through them as a whole, and prepare his final Estimates for submission to the Treasurer. The latter stage was never reached, and in consequence no final approval of estimates for these establishments was given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> The approval given was merely a temporary approval for them to be submitted at a later date on final Estimates. </para>

                            <para>- The point is that when this increase in the Estimates was challenged, the honorable gentleman, acting on the statement of his Minister of Defence, alleged that the increases were commitments, and that his Government had no option in the matter. He may be able to explain why these increases should be made. They may be perfectly proper; but we must take exception to this continual excuse on the part of the present Government - to their constant attempt to get behind the late Administration when challenged with regard to any expenditure, and to their declaration that they were committed to it. Here we have a specific case in which they were not committed. </para>

                            <para>- The main point, so far as I am concerned, is this: that the proposed expenditure for the current year exceeds last year&#39;s expenditure by over &#163;4,000,000, and that this large increase is excused by honorable gentlemen opposite, and particularly by Ministers, on the ground that they are committed to it by the action of their predecessors. That statement will be scattered broadcast. The party newspapers are publishing it, and honorable members will repeat it from every platform, at every social, and at every little gathering of men, women, , and children. They will allege, when asked, &#34; Why did you gentlemen, who were elected to put the finances on a sound and proper basis, spend &#163;4,000,000 more than your predecessors, about whose extravagance you complained so bitterly?&#34; - when that is asked, as it will be very often, they will make this puerile excuse, that they could not help themselves, because the previous Ministry had committed them to it. </para>

                            <para>- The only expenditure to which they take exception is that on the maternity allowance, to which they are committed, and from which they cannot at present escape. So far as the expenditure on the Post Office, old-age pensions, the Navy and Army, and all other Departments of the Public Service is concerned, they claim that it is in furtherance of their policy. If so, why do they not stand up like men, and acknowledge that the expenditure is their expenditure? They should not creep behind their predecessors for shelter. I do not wish to repeat the statement too often, but during the recent elections many serious, alarming, and unwarrantable references were made to finance. Honorable members opposite then spoke in millions. They frightened the electors; they made the public timid. Large numbers of persons actually believed that some frightful wrong was being perpetrated; that the country was being rushed into a very maelstrom of extravagant expenditure. We asked for the items to which they took exception, and then they became as dumb as it was possible for men to be. Now they have complete control of the finances, and can do as they like, except where statutory commitments are concerned, they are increasing the expenditure by over &#163;4,000,000. They have a perfect right to do so, and I do not complain of that; but they should stand by their proposals. They should acknowledge that the expenditure is in furtherance of their policy, and that they approve of it. They should not seek shelter behind their predecessors. This is another paragraph of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce&#39;s</inline> memorandum - </para>

                        <para>Further, the Government, if it makes appointments under these Estimates, is practically tying the hands of the future manager, who may find himself with unnecessary officers in some cases, and without the necessary ones in others. </para>

                    <para>That shows that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> took a definite and, I think, a proper stand. He was instituting what for all practical purposes was a new Department. He was providing for the building of ships, and particularly of naval ships. He called for applications from men competent to take the responsible position of manager of a huge ship-building yard, and to control the expenditure of many hundreds of thousands of pounds a year. He said., in effect, that, not being expert in these matters, he preferred to receive the advice of whatever expert might be appointed as to the staff that would be required, so that the Garden Island and Cockatoo Island establishments could be worked in conjunction, and as economically as possible. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> therefore, refrained from making these additional appointments. They may be necessary; I do not say that they are not. </para>
                    <para class="block">But it may be advisable to refrain from making them until the manager has had an opportunity to view the position for himself , and to communicate to the Government what staffs he will require for this important work. There is one other matter to which I desire to draw attention; it is the peculiar situation in which we find ourselves in regard to the Cockburn Sound Naval Base. I should not have troubled the House this evening with any reference to the matter if it had not been for the regrettable illness of the honorable member for Fremantle, a young man who, whatever may be our political differences, we welcome to this Chamber as giving indications of useful service to the country in this National Parliament. I hope that his illness will be of the shortest possible duration, and that we shall soon be able to welcome him back to the place that he honours. The Ministry have informed us that they have invited an engineer of great ability to advise them in respect to the Naval Bases. Until his advice is obtained, they say, the work must be stopped. We find that the work at Cockburn Sound has been stopped. The Naval Base there is within an electorate that rejected a supporter of the present Ministry, and elected an Oppositionist. The work at Westernport, the site of another naval base within an electorate represented by a Government supporter, has not been stopped. Work was commenced at these two places on the recommendation of the Australian Navy Board. Apparently the present Ministry do not think that the Board is competent to give advice about this work. They say, &#34;We must have the advice of an expert from England.&#34; I think that, under these  circumstances,  I am justified iu asking why they have not stopped all the naval works. If the Australian Navy Board is competent to advise in respect to the work of the Westernport Naval Base, it should be competent to advise in respect to the work at the Cockburn Sound Naval Base. But I have been given to understand that the work at the Westernport Naval Base has not been stopped, although that at the Cockburn Sound Naval Base has been stopped. </para>

                            <para>- It is time for an inquiry, if the Board could recommend the Fisher Administration to go on and expend money, and the Cook Administration to stop spending money. The interjection of the Prime Minister would lead one to believe that the Board is too pliable. Ministers are justified, if they so desire, in bringing out this expert, but, unfortunately for them, there already have been reports in respect to Cockburn Sound, not from <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Maurice</inline> Fitzmaurice, but from a senior to him in the same firm. Looking up the records, I find that, in 1887, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Coode, the head of the firm to which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Maurice</inline> Fitzmaurice belongs, personally inspected Cockburn Sound. The Western Australian Government, of which the present </para>

                    <para class="block">Treasurer was Premier, desired to make a harbor at Fremantle for ocean-going steamers. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Coode furnished a report in response to the wish of the Western Australian Government. &#39; He stated that he had put borings down  in the Success and Parmelia banks - which obstruct the entrance to Jervoise Bay, and are the cause of the Cook Government delaying the works - towards the end of 1886, and had found that those banks were composed almost entirely of sand, and that it was not improbable that a channel might be selected across either one of the banks, to afford depth for ocean-going steamers, without encountering rocks. The only doubt was the composition of the sand-banks, which proved satisfactory later. He reported, also, that if the proposal were adopted, he would need some further bores to finally determine the matter. Such bores were put down by the Fisher Government, and proved entirely satisfactory. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Coode added that there was little change in the actual configuration of the banks in a period of thirty-three years which <inline font-style="italic">he</inline> had under review. He said that a channel through Parmelia bank would be sufficiently sheltered from the sea. for navigation by large steamers in all weathers. The Western Australian Government, however, preferred, for reasons best known to the present Treasurer, a site known as Owen&#39;s Anchorage, and wished the channel dredged through the Success bank. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Coode, whilst agreeing to do this, at the same time unmistakably favoured Jervoise Bay. He urged  that a channel should be cut through Parmelia bank in any circumstances, as being less exposed in rough weather. He considered that perfect shelter would be attained in Jervoise  Bay,  about 6 miles south of Fremantle, whence a railway might be easily run to connect with the line at Fremantle. Even ths Agent-General, in sending the report on to the Treasurer, said - </para>

Captain Archdeacon, of Holyhead, an eminent navigator, of the Royal Navy, who had been engaged in survey work at Cockburn Sound, reported on 22nd August, 1891 - </para>

                        Coode, on 2nd October, 1891, had reported that he had carefully examined samples of sand from Success and Parmelia banks, and had no hesitation in saying that such sand was capable of being readily dealt with by a pump dredge. This cleared up any doubt whatever as to the practicability of cutting a channel. The Treasurer, notwithstanding the experts&#39; views, prevented the harbor from being placed at Jervoise Bay, and he now prevents a Naval Base from being placed at the best favoured spot, advancing as an argument that Mangles

Admiral Henderson, furnished with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Coode&#39;s  reports, prior to inspecting the site, also recommended Jervoise Bay. The Commonwealth Government then decided to further test the matter. In conjunction with the Western Australian Government, it, in 1912, put down bores in the banks named to a depth of 40 feet, and demonstrated that there was nothing which could not be easily removed by a dredge. Tests were also carried out, which proved that there had been no movement in the sand-banks for forty years. </para>

We have the peculiar situation that, years ago, despite the advice of experts, the Western Australian Government, of which the Treasurer was Premier, refused to go on with the works so far as Jervoise Bay is concerned. It is reasonable to suppose that if the experts had advised in the direction he personally desired he would have gone on with the work.

                            <para>- Honorable members may go on with their interjections, but they cannot sweep away the important facts that I have related. Once before, expert advice, as I say, was not acted on because it did not suit the Ministry of which the Treasurer was the leader, and now, again, work is stopped for some reason not yet explained. I hope that the work will be proceeded with at the earliest possible moment. If the expert advice was not taken on a former occasion there is a fair possibility of the expert advice of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Maurice</inline> Fitzmaurice not being acted upon, notwithstanding that there is, to some extent, a commitment on the part of the Ministry. These were the two points to which I desired to call attention, because their importance appeared to justify me in doing so. </para>

                        <para>. - We have listened to one of those diatribes in -which the honorable member for Adelaide frequently indulges. They are very clever, almost perfect, from a rhetorical point of view ; the logic may be faultless, but the facts are all wrong. The trouble with the honorable member is that he makes everything, right, always at the expense of the facts, and we have to go after him and give the facts which he has omitted, misstated, or misrepresented, either by innuendo or in some other of his clever dialectical ways. For the last half-hour he has been attempting to politically injure the Treasurer, but, luckily, the Treasurer stands too high in his own land to be affected by either the blame or the praise of the honorable member. All his efforts to make political capital out of the supreme question of National Defence are made with the ulterior motive of damaging the Treasurer politically. </para>

I am not on the question of whether the ex-Minister is responsible for the signing of the draft Estimates - that is, as it may be - but it acquires a significance beyond the ordinary if the signing is an act subsequent to a solemn agreement made with the Imperial authorities on the one hand and the State authorities on the other. What did <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> agree to with the State and Imperial authorities? That is the crucial point of the whole question. It is not so much a matter whether he signed the draft Estimates, and was intending to revise them. If an honorable roan, he could not revise them after having bound himself to those two authorities to take the officers over. </para>

                            <para>-If the allegations of the honorable member for Adelaide are right, there is a reflection on <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> I am not impugning the honour of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce;</inline> it is the honorable member for Adelaide who is doing so by suggesting that, after agreeing to take those officers over, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> was not committed to do so merely because he signed those Estimates. There lies the imputation on <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce&#39;s</inline> honour, if imputation there be. I say, again, that it is not a question of whether&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> signed the draft Estimates, but a question of whether he entered into those solemn agreements. And <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> himself does not deny either of them, but, on the contrary, has affirmed them in another place. The present Government have appointed a single officer to these Departments since they have been taken over. What we have done is to find the money to pay the officers for which the previous Government were responsible. It seems to me that things are coming to a pretty pass when we have the suggestion that, although previous Governments have agreed to take all the officers over as part of a huge transaction, it is still open to their successors to repudiate the agreement by omitting to provide the money on the Estimates. Here we have, in the person of the honorable member for Adelaide, a paragon of national honour ! The new ethic he is laying down is that when we have made an agreement with the Imperial Government and the State Government, we may lay it aside at will simply because it is not in black and white. Arguing by analogy, we should be quite correct, according to that ethic, in . repudiating entirely the bargain that was made with the Western Australian Government for the powellised sleepers. The contract is not signed yet, but we are honouring it. As honorable men, we feel that the agreement made between these two Governments should be honoured as binding upon the honour and conscience of the Federal Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member is now shifting his ground with his usual trickiness. I have read of how they catch eels, and how they need holding. The honorable member is. not to be allowed to slip out of it in that way. According to his own statements, we are only responsible for the Estimates. Let me take the very last statement of the honorable member, that we are only responsible for the increases. I point out, in reply, that we have made no increases, except to the extent of one or two salaried officers. </para>

                    <para>Another point in this indictment from the honorable member for Adelaide is that there are 100 petty officers , and men at Garden Island. The honorable member &#39; &#39; does not know why they are there.&#34; &#34;What are they doing there?&#34; he asks. &#34; What are seamen doing on shore at all?&#34; The answer is simple. They are waiting to be drafted into ships. They are waiting to go to sea. At present they are temporarily waiting to be drafted on to the ships. The honorable member for Adelaide makes a distinction between the appointment of, and the agreement to appoint, a manager. Again, the answer is that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> made this recommendation - of course, on the advice of the Naval Board. No one suggests that he did it on his own account. He did it because the Naval Board suggested it was the proper thing. They said, &#34; We are taking over a new set of conditions entirely, involving heavy obligations both in construction and repairs and docking, and everything else. We want a first class man, and will not get a man for that job under &#163;2,000 a year.&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> said, &#34;Very well, let it be &#163;2,000 a year.&#34; Yet his champion says to us, &#34; You are not committed; you can strike it off and repudiate it, if you like.&#34; </para>

                    <para>Now in regard to these commitments. The honorable member has been talking and dreaming &#34;financial commitments&#34; for the last month. He is anxious to point out that we are not committed to anything; that we must stand up to our full responsibility for initiating all the increased expenditure, and for all that has made these Estimates as heavy as they are this year. Let us examine that claim. The honorable member again began by misstating the facts. He says that we are proposing to spend&#163;4,000,000 this year more than was spent last year. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> says&#163;7,000,000, other honorable members say &#163;5,000,000. One must be careful about his language. It is quite true that our Estimates are about &#163;4,000,000 more than the actual spendings of last year, but it is very probable that when we have tried our hardest to spend all this money this year, just as they did last year, we shall have more than&#163;1,000,000 unspent. </para>

                            <para>- Of course, I have given away the case because I am stating facts. The honorable member does not keep facts on the premises; they are always strange to him. I am merely pointing out that last year the late Government did not spend - after doing their very best - within a million of the amount they put on the Estimates. The exact amount to which they committed the country last year was &#163;24,883,000, or, roughly, &#163;25,000,000. They had &#163;22,683,000 on ordinary Estimates, and then they had loan commitments, including the dock, to the extent of &#163;2,200,000, making altogether nearly &#163;25,000,000 which they committed the country to last year. If we could take our Estimates of this year and their Estimates last year, there is a difference, not of &#163;4,000,000, but of only a little over &#163;2,000,000. What do these facts mean ? They mean that whereas there has been an increase of 33 per cent per annum during their three years of office, our estimated increase -never mind the actual spending or what they are going to be - is between 7 and 8 per cent., as compared with their average of 33 per cent. </para>

                    <para>In the year1909-10, when the Fisher Government took office, the expenditure in respect of ordinary appropriations, excluding loans and amounts paid to States, was&#163;7,867,000, or &#163;1 16s. per head of the population. This year&#39;s Estimates provide for an expenditure of &#163;17,800,000, or &#163;3 12s. 9d. per head. In their case there was an average annual increase of11s. 3d. per head per annum, whilst our estimated increase this year is 2s. 6d. per head. I want to point out that, so far from this Government being guilty of gross, unrestrained, and irresponsible extravagance, it has, by sheer dint of hard work, scotched the extravagance. </para>

                            <para>- Provision would have been made for an expenditure of &#163;27,000,000 and a few millions more. Coming to these statutory commitments, which I repeat are inescapable, we find that in the first place there is in respect of parliamentary allowances an increase of &#163;4,252, last year having been a broken year. Then we have &#163;5,405 more for the High Court Judges, Public Service Commissioner, and inspectors, and the Industrial Registrar. We have also to pay &#163;5,790 in respect of the Inter-State Commissioners, an additional &#163;330,952 for invalid and old-age pensions, an increase of &#163;237,220 in respect of the maternity allowance, and an increase of &#163;65,551 in regard to other bounties. Let me show what these &#34;other bounties&#34; are. In the case of the bounties on natural products, there is an increase of &#163;4,408, and in respect of the iron bounty an increase of &#163;34,902. Then we have a new item in respect of the bounty on shale oil. It amounts to &#163;16,241, and it may or may not be required during the year, although, personally, I should not mind if it were. The bounties on wood pulp and rock phosphate - these have all been approved by Parliament, but we are making financial provision for them for the first time this year - represent &#163;10,000, or a total of &#163;65,551 in respect of these other bounties.&#34; Will honorable members say that these are not commitments ? </para>

                            <para>- Then there are some commitments after all? In respect of the surplus revenue to be paid to the States, we have this year an increase of &#163;05,070. These items altogether amount to &#163;948,000. When from this amount is deducted a sum of &#163;438,000, due to the abolition of the sugar bounties and several other things, it will be seen that, on these items alone, there is a net increase of &#163;510,000 - all statutory commitments, which a Government, no matter to which party it belongs, must face. There is another item which we have to pay this year, and most of which is new. I refer to the fact that a sum of &#163;89,716 has to be paid by way of interest on inscribed stock. Is that a commitment? Some Government, before this Ministry came into power, has been borrowing. </para>

                            <para>-I am only pointing out the inconsistency of the Opposition, who have been prating about loans ever since these Estimates have been laid on the table. Our total loan Estimates this year are&#163;3,000,000, whilst theirs in respect of last year were &#163;2,250,000. This certainly shows a slight increase; but one would think, when listening to the Opposition, that we were inaugurating a new policy, and that borrowing should never see daylight here. </para>

                    <para>Again, on this matter of commitments I turn to the huge Estimates of the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department, which seem to be towering up year by year, and making a greater and greater disparity between income and expenditure. The Postal Department is rapidly becoming the most serious problem that the Parliament has to face. Let there be no mistake about the matter. It is becoming our most serious problem, and will have to be gripped, and gripped very strongly, in the near future. Statutory increments in the Department represent &#163;58,399 in respect of this year. Then there are increments to the fourth and higher class officers amounting to &#163;12,820; &#163;25,100 to provide for the Arbitration Court&#39;s award to postal electricians; &#163;.124,278 for new staff; and &#163;193,097 additional provision required for existing staff. I think that the Treasurer gave some of these figures in his Budget speech, and I apologize for going over some of them again. The increased cost of conveyance of mails amounts to &#163;46,930; increased allowance to non-official postmasters, &#163;16,690; increase for operating and maintaining wireless stations, &#163;17,680; increase in repairs and maintenance of telegraph and telephone lines, &#163;29,865; or a total of &#163;524,859, less a decrease . in respect of some other items which reduces the amount to &#163;405,521 - the amount represented here as being ordinary expenditure. Quite half these items represent increases which are commitments that have come to us, and are inescapable. </para>

                            <para>- They are commitments which cannot be evaded without repudiation, and, therefore, are not parliamentary commitments in the ordinary sense. I find, also, that the amount provided for in the Estimates for 1913-14 for new post-office buildings is&#163;270,413, of which &#163;108,234 represents revotes - another commitment which the late Government did not spend. This is where they got their surplus. They left the surplus, but they also left the debts. There is &#163;108,000 for re-votes, and &#163;162,000 for new business. This year we provide, in addition, from loans, &#163;170,000 for the purchase of sites for post-offices and similar expenditure ; but of that sum &#163;70,000 represents commitments and re-votes. The word &#39; &#39; commitment &#39; &#39; has been used very frequently as a term of reproach during the discussion of the finances, and I am now replying to the gibes and jeers of the honorable member for Adelaide on the subject. I say that all these huge commitments, which are inescapable, amount in their totality to, I should think, at least &#163;1,000,000 on the ordinary Estimates, in addition to the increased amounts that we are spending on new services, which, again, are commitments and obligations of a statutory character. Honorable members will begin to see what we have had to tackle in the three short months that we have had for the investigation of these matters. </para>

                    <para>When the Estimates were introduced, we had had control of the Departments for only two months, in which time we had many things to do besides investigating the finances of the country. These Estimates ought not to be regarded as, in the ordinary sense, our Estimates. We have to take the responsibility for them, and we do so; but we are taking responsibility for the Estimates of the other side, which we have shorn down by millions. That is the position of affairs. </para>

                    <para>I come now to the Customs expenditure. There is an increase there of about &#163;74,000 in the ordinary expenditure. Of this amount &#163;59,000 is in connexion with lighthouses; but . we expect to receive light dues which will balance that amount. There are many items in the Estimates which, I think, ought not to be there, unless they are grouped in a special business account. Take this item. It represents only an advance, to be repaid during the currency of the year. But it goes into the credit and debit sides of the account, just as though it were expenditure in the ordinary sense. It is simply a loan to the Trust Funds, with which to operate the Department until the money can be repaid into the revenue later on. It swells the Estimates and makes the totals larger. Quite a number of items of this kind figure in the Estimates. The same thing applies in regard to the factory expenditure. We get grants at the beginning of the year, and pay them into the Trust Funds. They are our capital and trading accounts for the year. But as the money comes in, credits are put in the exchequer, instead of being put against these amounts in a specialized account. In this way the Estimates are swollen. </para>

There is an increase in regard to navigation, and an additional &#163;9,000 for quarantine. That, again, is to be refunded by the States later on. For the Bureau of Agriculture the amount set down is&#163;5,000. I wonder if this next item will be regarded as a commitment - &#39; &#39; Industries Preservation Bill,&#163;20,000.&#34; That is to pay for the celebrated Vend case. We had nothing to do with that.

                    <para>Then there are some in the Home Affairs Department. There the ordinary items show an increase of&#163;25,000 only, and the increase is made up in this way : There is an addition to the permanent staff, which has had to be largely increased to undertake the work that has previously been done by temporary officers. In previous years, too, the States have been paid for work done by the Commonwealth. We are altering that system, but it means a large increase in expenditure. Another increase - but this may have to be taken off the Estimates later, if the Electoral Bill does not pass - is to provide for the ten electoral inspectors whom I mentioned this afternoon. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member knows that there is not; he would not be laughing if there were. In the Land and Survey Branch, only three months&#39; expenditure was provided for last year, but this year we have to foot the bill for twelve months. That is another commitment. For the Federal Capital, there is an increase of &#163;100,000. This is one of the heavy years in connexion with the Federal Capital. A sequence of years shows steady evolution, right up to the point when the buildings will be completed, and this is a heavy year,- preparations having to be made for the buildings next year. That accounts for the increase. </para>

                    </continue>
                    <para>In regard to other new works, there is a slight decrease this year. This Government has had to do a little  retrenching  in connexion with new works, the expenditure on which shows a decrease of about &#163;37,000. Then there is the expenditure frOm loan money. The expenditure on the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway shows an increase of &#163;793,000. Here, again, it is the fate of this Government to have to shoulder heavy expenditure this year. Honorable members opposite had all the light years, and all the surpluses; we have all the heavy years, and all the commitments and obligations. Then there is &#163;80,000 for land for the Federal Capital. That is another increase, and a commitment from which we could- not escape. </para>
                    <para>In the ordinary items of defence expenditure there is an account of &#163;437,000; we have to provide this year for 22,500 junior cadets extra being taken into the service, and 17,500 senior cadets being passed into the Citizen Forces. That means not only more pay for the cadets, but also heavy additional expenditure for <inline font-style="italic">personnel,</inline> training, clothing, ammunition, stores, and such things. The Military College is taking thirty-eight more cadets, completing its full establishment of 150. That costs a huge sum, for the training of each cadet is very expensive. There is an increase for rifle clubs, and for the first time we are shouldering responsibility for aviation. Aviation has been mentioned in the last two Estimates, but this is the first time that a concrete, definite sum lias been provided for it. There is &#163;84,000 for the completion of factories. The other day, the honorable member for Adelaide suggested in regard to the woollen mills at Geelong, the walls of which are three-parts up, that we had no responsibility in regard to the work, unless we liked to accept it; that we might pull the walls down, and scrap the machinery and plant that has been ordered. I suppose that if there were an appeal to the country, and we went out of office, and the other side came in, they would at once start to build again on the original foundations. That is the latest finance as expounded by the honorable member for Adelaide. </para>
                    <para>In the Defence Estimates I find there are large- increases of permanent soldiers and officials; and this item is creeping up every year. We call this a Citizen Force, and it is one, but it necessitates a large staff for administration and training. Remounts are a much larger item than last year, but still they are a commitment, and so with military works of various kinds, which we may not escape, no matter how much we desire to do so. They have to be undertaken, because the whole administration has been, and must be, laid out with foresight and care if it is ever to become an administration worthy of the name. Then technical instructors for the artillery have to be provided for, and also a large increase in the Medical Corps. </para>
                    <para>I wish to say here that I am not satisfied that the best is being done in this Department. I am not now saying one word about the character and efficiency of the training; but with a force which was estimated by both Lord Kitchener and Colonel Legge, after full and careful investigation, to cost &#163;1,880,000 at the normal, it strikes one as strange that it should be costing over &#163;3,000,000 when the scheme is not at the full. I should like this investigated as closely and keenly as possible; but the Minister cannot undertake such work while the House is in session, and while he has two huge Departments to administer in addition. The Government will have to consider very seriously what line the investigation is going to take in regard to these Departments. It is of no use making the investigation unless we are going to make it in the most expert way, and by means of real expert ability. </para>

                            <para>- My opinion now is much the same. A great deal of money has been wasted in the Northern Territory, and, in my opinion, the late Government, in their administration, put the &#34; cart before the horse.&#34; All sorts of small settlements were endeavoured to be promoted in a climate in which the Administrator himself says men cannot do more than 80 per cent. of the work they can do in other warm parts of Australia, and where 25 per cent. more has to be paid for the work, in addition to special allowances. The railways are not yet through the country; this, therefore, is not the time to facilitate settlement, because the settlement cannot be kept there. People are sent up, but they come back. For some years now, we have had jubilation when anybody has gone to the Territory, as though the problem were settled. We shall not find the problem settled until men go there with their wives and families. The Administrator tells us that the women folk are not there ; and this is one of the troubles that is leading to the fretfulness of the men. We shall always have our special problems up there; but there are some requirements common to all sorts of settlement, and one of them is railways. The sooner railways are pushed up into the Territory the better. This internal development, away from the railways and in such climates, ought not to be persisted in. A recommendation came down for the purchase of a station near Darwin for closer settlement; but there are better climates than that for such a purpose. To dig, delve, plough, sow, and reap, men. do not desire a wet, moist climate, if they can find a somewhat drier, healthier, and more elevated one elsewhere. One hardly knows what to do until the Commission reports; but there is one thing we can do in the meantime, and that is not to waste more money than we can help on small experiments which, in the aggregate, make up nearly all the expenditure of the Department. </para>

Any one going up there, under the same conditions, would be liable to make mistakes. I am not, however, suggesting that the Administrator is making mistakes, but merely claiming the right to express my own opinion. That gentleman may be found to be right, and I sincerely hope he may. This ought not to be a party matter. We have a most serious obligation in the development of this Territory, as an addition to the defences of the rest of Australia, amongst other things. These are some of the items which are commitments by our predecessors, and we have honored them, that is, some of them, because we have had to pare down a good many. I believe these Estimates would have been very much larger if the late Government had had the privilege of submitting them, for I know the paring we have had to do to make them fit at all. </para>

                        <para>.- The Prime Minister commenced by complimenting the honorable member for Adelaide on being capable of presenting a case which seemed to be on a solid basis, but which, however, lacked facts. It will be admitted that the Prime Minister this evening, in characteristic fashion, when endeavouring to put his position before the House and the public, has altogether overlooked the points in the attack of the honorable member for Adelaide. This discussion arose out of the Estimates that were before us last evening. The Leader of the Opposition then made certain statements which the other side attempted to controvert; and, subsequently, I, myself, put certain facts before the Committee, and asked to be enlightened. The Honorary Minister said that if I would resume my seat he would give proof that the ex-Minister of Defence was responsible for the increased expenditure. &#39; When I heard that gentleman quoting documents, I came to &#39; the conclusion that it would be unwise, on my part, to contradict him, because I thought that the expenditure complained of had been approved by the ex-Minister. This evening, however, the honorable member for Adelaide has presented a statement from the ex-Minister himself, in which he says that he did not approve in the draft Estimates of certain payments to be made in connexion with the defences. He points out further that these draft Estimates had to be taken into consideration by him at a later period when he was dealing with the general Estimates. I can quite understand why that should be. The Minister of Defence may get the Estimates from the Commandant of Victoria, possibly two months before he - gets the Estimates from the Commandant of New South Wales, and he puts aside those draft Estimates until he can deal with the expenditure of the Department as a whole, and decides what works shall be carried out, and what the expenditure shall be. However, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> did not come back to office to formulate the general Estimates. The present Government are responsible for those Estimates, and cannot shield themselves behind the fact that the ex-Minister of Defence had certain draft Estimates. If the present Government did not approve of the draft Estimates, why did they not cut out the expenditure they considered unnecessary? No Government, worthy of the name, would endeavour to justify themselves day after day with a cry of &#34;commitments.&#34; I admire a man who will stand up to it. I admire a Government who will say, &#34; These are our Estimates. We have given them full consideration, and we cannot see that we can reduce them &#163;1 more than we have.&#34; I cannot admire those who say, &#34; These are our Estimates. We are sorry we have had to increase the expenditure, notwithstanding that we told the people that there had been extravagance, and that if we were returned to power we would reduce the expenditure and cut down that extravagance.&#34; If they had pointed out to the people that the works were absolutely necessary in the interests of Australia, they would have been doing the right thing, but in place of that they are making it appear that, because they find they have had to increase the cost of government during their tenure of office, they are committed to it -by their predecessors. The point argued last night was in relation to the additional expenditure incurred on Garden Island and Cockatoo Dock. The Prime Minister, in replying this evening, said that in consequence of an agreement entered into between the late Minister of Defence and, first, the State Government in relation to Cockatoo Island; and, secondly, the Imperial authorities in relation to Garden Island, the present Government were bound . Any Government is bound to comply with an agreement. We take no exception to that. The honorable, member for Adelaide took no exception to it. What we claimed last night, and what we claim this evening, has never been answered by the Prime Minister. Our claim is that&#39; Admiral Henderson, who is our guide in naval matters, said that once the Commonwealth Government accepted Cockatoo Island expenditure should be reduced on Garden Island. This point was not touched by the Prime Minister. If we admit that, having entered into the agreement, it is a fair thing to take over the officers - the Prime Minister says he has appointed only one additional officer, and I do not doubt his statement - nevertheless, the fact remains that, when </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">Garden Island was taken over from the Imperial authorities there were only forty-one officers employed there, whereas these Estimates provide for seventy-one. The point at issue is not the agreement between the State Government and the Commonwealth. It is whether there should be an increase in the number of officers on Garden Island, seeing that Admiral Henderson recommended that there should be a reduction of officers there after taking over Cockatoo Island. We realize that it is necessary to have an efficient defence system, but we also realize that we should not have unnecessary expenditure in connexion with it. If there were forty officers on Garden Island when the Commonwealth took over the island, and one officer has been appointed since, as the Prime Minister says, then why do the Estimates provide for seventy-one officers? Where are the other thirty to come from ? Are they to be appointed by the Minister of Defence immediately these Estimates are passed ? If not, why is the money on the Estimates? The Prime Minister did not touch on this point. </para>

                            <para>- No. They are placed for duty on Garden Island. I have been asking for this information because it is necessary to have a thorough understanding before voting money for the purpose. However desirable it may be to have a Navy, we cannot go on voting money if it is to be wasted. This complaint has never been answered. Rhetoric is of no use. We desire to get an explanation of what this means. The matter was mentioned last night, and has been mentioned during the week, and yet we cannot get the desired information. The Estimates show plainly that there is provision made for seventy-one officers on Garden Island, whereas the staff under the British Admiralty was only forty-one. Why are the additional thirty required? Instead of reducing the number, we are increasing it. That is the point to which the Prime Minister should have applied himself. Then, again, in regard to Cockatoo Island, supposing the agreement exists, we should keep faith with it, but here we find that there were twenty-one officers on the island - State officers, I suppose, whom we are to take over - with the addition of the seven experts appointed by the New South Wales Government, making twenty-eight altogether, and there should be no more provided for on the Estimates, unless there is some explanation made. The trouble is that there are forty-five. I do not say that those officers are not required at Cockatoo Island. Indeed, I believe that more will be required as the works are opened up. But how do the Government account for putting on the Estimates forty-five officers for Cockatoo </para>

                    <para class="block">Island as against the number there previously, whilst on the other Estimates they provide for seventy-one as against forty-one previously? No attempt has been made to explain the discrepancy. It was urged that the Labour party was responsible for this state of things. The Prime Minister reiterated that charge. The honorable gentleman ought to explain these points more clearly, so that the public may know what justification there is for voting the salaries of so many additional officers in both these places, in view of the fact that Admiral Henderson recommended that there should ultimately be a reduction on Garden Island. We have not yet had a satisfactory answer to that question. The. Prime Minister ran away from it by dealing with the Jervoise Bay question.I do not desire to say much on that matter, but on one point I should like to put the Prime Minister right. He tried to make good his position by stating that Admiral Henderson had reported in favour of what the Government are doing as to Cockburn Sound. To suit his own purpose the honorable gentleman quoted a part of a paragraph of Admiral Henderson&#39;s report, but not the whole of it. On page 56 of the report, paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a,</inline> occurs this statement - </para>

It appeared to me that a site in the vicinity of Jervoise Bay was best suited for naval dockyard requirements. A channel for deep-draught ships would have to be dredged through the Parmelia and Success Banks, and slight dredging would be required in other places. It would probably also be necessary that a short breakwater should be thrown out from Woodlands Point. </para>

                            <para>- Getting away from naval matters the Prime Minister touched on the question of finance. He pointed to the action of his Government in bringing down Estimates which, as he states, provide for between two and three million pounds more expenditure than was incurred by the previous Government. In reality, these Estimates provide for between&#163;4,000,000 and &#163;5,000,000 more than the last Government spent. The Government intend to borrow money. The Prime Minister, however, pointed out that during the time our party was in office the expenditure went up by 33 per cent., or11s. 5d. per head, whereas in the year after this it is going up from 7 to 8 per cent., or a cost of 2s. 6d. per head to the taxpayer. He also attempted to justify the action of the Government by claiming that they have to meet commitments left by the previous Administration. It is the same old story as the party opposite told the electors. Every honorable member who wishes to be fair knows that there was complete justification for the expenditure  incurred by the late Government. Moreover, the people knew that no additional taxation would be laid upon them to meet that expenditure. I venture to make the assertion that with the exception of the land tax the people had not to pay a farthing more in taxation during the <inline font-style="italic">regime</inline> of the late Government than they had previously paid. I challenge any honorable member opposite to deny that statement. We neither increased taxation nor interfered with the Tariff. The only tax that we imposed was that upon the unimproved value of land, and I am satisfied that the great mass of the people recognise that it is a fair thing for those who possess the wealth of this country to pay more for its defence than the general body of the workers have to do.. As to the Prime Minister&#39;s allegation that expenditure under the Labour Government increased by 33 per cent., it was well known when we were returned to office that the finances of the Commonwealth were in such a position that unless the Braddon section was altered it would be &#39;impossible for the Government to carry on. It could not be done. Immediately our party was returned to power additional expenditure had to be incurred in connexion with matters which no honorable member opposite would dare to repudiate to-day. First of all, we liberalized old-age pensions, which cost a considerable sum of money. The present Government propose to liberalize the system further. We introduced the invalidity pensions, and had to find the money for them. Those two items cost the late Government &#163;1,500,000 above what their predecessors had had to pay. The Prime Minister did not mention that this evening. </para>

We did not borrow a farthing for the purpose. . Did the Prime Minister and the Treasurer while they were in Opposition do anything whatever to prevent that expenditure? They professed to approve of it. Why then do they now carp about what the late Government expended, and what they approved of? The Prime Minister has been grumbling about our  expenditure  throughout his speech to-day. The Prime Minister forgets to mention that he was agreeable to it, and he dare not oppose it. He dare not say that he will repeal any of these measures. We had also to pay the grant to Tasmania, the Bill providing for which was passed by us. As a matter of fact, the present Government are proposing this year to increase that grant. It was additional expenditure for which we had to provide. I would also remind honorable members that the question of the transferred properties was hung up until the late Government took office. </para>

                            <para>- No interest was paid upon them until the late Govern - lnent came into power. The right honorable member does not like to hear these facts. We took over transferred properties of the value of &#163;9,000,000, and on these we had to pay interest at the rate of per cent. We had also to provide for heavy additional expenditure in connexion with the Postal Department. We made a special grant of &#163;600,000 in addition to the ordinary expenditure of the Department for which we had to provide. During the election campaign honorable members opposite had something to say in opposition to the maternity allowance, but they have been a long while in taking action to repeal it. The Maternity Allowance Act cost the country &#163;600,000, and we met that new expenditure out of revenue. The taxation was not increased for the purpose, and if a plebiscite of the people were taken to-morrow, I am confident that the action of the Fisher Government in placing that beneficent piece of legislation on the statute-book would be indorsed. These items of new expenditure which the Fisher Government had to meet make up a very large sum, and the fact that we met them without increasing taxation must redound to our credit. </para>

                            <para>- The right honorable member cannot understand why the big land-owner should be taxed. He thinks that he ought to be clear. If that be so, why do not the Government bring in a measure to repeal the Land Tax Act ? The Prime Minister this evening said that his Government were increasing the expenditure this year by only 2s. 6d. per head of the population, as against an average annual increase of l1s. 5d. per head made by the Fisher Government. Is the comparison at all favorable to the present Ministry when we take into consideration the fact that its predecessors had to provide for the initiation of great works and schemes which came into operation only during the life of the last Parliament. What becomes of the statement made by the Prime Minister and his party in the country that they would reduce instead of increase expenditure ? The honorable gentleman said that they could have expended millions more, but that they had inserted the pruning knife wherever they could, and had cut down the Estimates. Notwithstanding this, he declared, they were going to tax the people 2s. 6d. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> more than they were taxed by the late Government. Once schemes involving heavy expenditure have been initiated, it should not be necessary for any Government to rapidly build up the expenditure upon them, and I venture to say that had we been returned to power this year, our Estimates would have shown a reduction. The Estimates submitted by the late Government last year were much less than those which the present Government have brought down. </para>

                            <para>- I am glad to have that assurance. Fair-minded people will come to the conclusion that the Prime Minister had no foundation for the case which he sought to make out to-night. When the expenditure is stated per head of the population, the belief is engendered that there has been an increase in taxation, but, as a matter of fact, the late Government, with the exception of the land tax, did not increase taxation by one farthing. We were able to satisfy, out of revenue, all the requirements of the Commonwealth, and to leave to our successors a surplus of over &#163;2,500,000. The present Government expect that their expenditure will eat up, not only the current revenue, but the big surplus which we left them. The point which I wish to emphasize is that the Prime Minister this evening carefully evaded the real question at issue. He did not tell the House why the number of officers on Garden Island and Cockatoo Island had been increased. The honorable gentleman said that the Minister of Defence had made only one appointment; but the question he should have answered is why these Estimates provide for the staff on Cockatoo Island being increased from twenty-eight to forty-five, and for an increase from forty to seventy-one in the case of the staff on Garden Island. He should also have told us what they are going to do with the 100 men who are to be placed on Garden Island. They are supposed to be naval men, yet they are not to take part in the working of any ship. Is there any necessity for such an expenditure? These points have not been answered by the Prime Minister. I want an answer to them. I did not interject last night, when the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs read certain documents, because I believed that everything was all right; but, having heard the honorable member for Adelaide this evening, and the Prime Minister in reply, I am satisfied that there is something to be answered, and that an answer should be given. The Prime Minister carefully evaded the very points with which we dealt last night. The position I take up is that, if this expenditure is necessary, we should agree to it, but that, if it is unnecessary, we should strike it out. I am not fighting these Estimates because </para>

I do not wish to see established here a military caste, which will practically run the show, and do what it pleases. This Parliament should control all these matters. It was from that point of view that I spoke last night. I thought that the Prime Minister had made out a good case, but having heard more about the matter since, I find that that is not so. The ex-Minister states that they were only approved draft Estimates, and that the method he followed in regard to them had been his method for the three years that he was in office. Other Ministers may have different methods. </para>

                            <para>- In regard to that the Prime Minister carefully avoided the real question. I have admitted that any agreement made with New- South Wales and with the Admiralty in regard to Cockatoo Island and Garden Island should be honoured, but last night I asked why the officers at Cockatoo Island were being increased from twenty-one to forty-five. The Prime Minister did not deal with that point. Then at Garden Island there were forty officers when the agreement was entered into, and seventy-one have been provided for in the Estimates, although Admiral Henderson says that the cost of the Garden Island establishment should be reduced on the taking over of the Cockatoo Island establishment. The Prime Minister has not dealt with these matters. If the additional officers have not been appointed, why should we vote the sums asked for; if the money is needed, the appointments must have been made, or must be in contemplation. The Prime Minister did not clear that up. </para>

                            <para>- No; but the matters raised last night should have been cleared up. We are considering whether certain additional expenditure at Cockatoo Island and Garden Island is justifiable. We must keep the Estimates as low as possible, and provide against unnecessary expenditure, but the Prime Minister has given us no information as to the appointment of additional officers. He has not told us anything in regard to the 100 petty officers that are to be at Garden Island. </para>

                            <para>- As a representative of the people, it is my duty to look closely into proposals. for expenditure, and if I think any item&#39; unnecessary, ,to speak and vote against it. When the&#39; Honorary Minister brought down the papers last night, I thought that he had made a satisfactory reply, but in the light of further information, I think that he and the Prime Minister have signally failed to answer the case against them. It is a question of displaying zeal for the protection of the Exchequer and of the taxpayers. </para>

                        <para>. - It is not my intention to traverse the supplementary Budget speech delivered by the Prime Minister, in which the honorable gentleman evaded the main- questions at issue. I hope we shall not have an all-night sitting, but the honorable gentleman did his best to provoke it, and it is an indication of our restraint that we can resist the temptation he placed before us. Is it not ridiculous that any honorable member on the other side should attempt to fasten upon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> the responsibility for advanced reports sent in prior to the making up of the Estimates for the year? Every one knows that we had an election this year, and that the late Minister of Defence went to Western Australia in March, and did not return to Melbourne until June, yet the Prime Minister attempted to fasten upon him the responsibility for the preliminary suggestions made by officers of the Defence Department throughout the Commonwealth in respect to the preparation of the Estimates for the financial year. </para>

                            <para>- I regret having made the statement; but, if I were to emulate the Prime  Minister,  I would make a dramatic display on account of his persistent interjections. When a few interjections are made when he is speaking, he resumes his seat with an offended air. I repeat for the special edification of the Prime Minister that no sane man would think of believing that blame should attach to a Minister for signing preliminary suggestions for expenditure received from his officers in various parts of Australia, especially when a general election was about to be held. A man does not need  to have been a member of a Ministry to know that, from the officers of every Department, there is every year a shoal of requests received involving considerable expenditure. The signature of a Minister in charge of a Department to such documents indicates that the requests are to be taken into consideration. He may later find it necessary to reduce the expenditure proposed, and, further, to submit the Estimates to the Treasurer, or to the full Cabinet, where a further pruning process takes place. Very often the final say is left to the Treasurer. The Prime Minister has claimed that his Government have had to cut down considerably the expenditure proposed in these preliminary Estimates submitted by the officers of the different Departments, but if the previous Government had remained in power they would also have used the pruning knife upon them. </para>

                    <para>If there is one thing emphatic in Admiral Henderson&#39;s report it is that once Cockatoo Island was taken over for docking, repairing, and other purposes, the staff at Garden Island should be reduced, yet we find that the staff has been increased, not only at Garden Island, but at Cockatoo Island also. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> in the document which was before us to-day, has told us that the Naval Board were anxious to have certain appointments made, but he, as a commonsense administrator - one of the best we have ever had in the Department - declared that, beyond a few men on the clerical staff, and some others, no one would be appointed until a general manager was there to take charge. In Cockatoo Island we are taking over a&#39; great industry, and I have no objection to the expenditure of &#163;850,000 for the land, the dock, and so forth. If we are to have a Navy, it is essential that we should be able to send the flagship for repairs should occasion require. And here I may observe that should the flagship suffer an accident near .the western coast of Australia, she would, under present circumstances, have to come right round to Sydney in order to be put right. This only shows how essential it is that there should be a Naval Base on the western coast, and Admiral Henderson, the greatest expert we have had here, has recommended Cockburn Sound. We must believe the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> because he is an honorable man, whose word would be taken not only by the Australian people, but by the British authorities. The great bulk of the men at Cockatoo Island were not in the permanent service of the New South Wales Government, and are not. in the permanent employ of the Commonwealth Government, the only permanent men being those few whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> decided to take over. I do not wish to say anything harsh about the Defence Department, but those who administer it do not seem to really know where they are with respect to Cockatoo Island and the men employed there, the present Minister of Defence, I am sure, being decidedly mixed. In order to show that the men employed knew they were not permanently engaged, I may say that two elderly men in the clerical staff requested that they should be transferred to another Department of the State, in order that they might complete the service necessary to obtain their pensions. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> had decided to take over all the officers, how is it that we hear of such cases as that ? It is a grand thing to know that the Commonwealth has been able to take over such fine works, and I hope they will be managed iu the best interests of the people of the Commonwealth. </para>
                    <para>The Prime Minister has been talking about the large expenditure, and I should like to point out one or two ways in which a saving can be effected. Ever since I have been in this Parliament, I have had complaints to make about our printing being done at great expense in the State Printing Offices. Our printing bill has attained such dimensions as to amply justify the establishment of a Federal Printing Office. And all of it is  not done  by the State. For instance, the <inline font-style="italic">Year-Hook,</inline> and all the publications issued from the Statist&#39;s office, are printed by McCarron, Bird, and Company, of Melbourne; and this fact, combined with all the other circumstances, must lead to the conclusion that the Commonwealth ought to do its own printing. If this were undertaken now, we should, on removal to Canberra, take with us a well-organized office. Something like &#163;5,000 is proposed to be expended in connexion with stamp-printing, the purchase of machinery, and so forth, in the State Printing Office here ; and I am sure, considering what we pay the State Government in printing, that some saving might be effected if we did the work ourselves. </para>
                    <para>Then, again, the duplication of the Cordite Factory, as recommended by a Committee which reported just prior to the late Government leaving office, would save one-third of the expenditure. </para>
                    <para>I have to complain bitterly about the number of experts, and the big fees we are paying them to come to Australia to tell us something we already know. I understand that something like &#163;2,000 is to be paid to a wireless expert, although there is already here one of the best in the world, who has established a system that will be invaluable to Australia. Further, while I do not mind the casual visit of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin,</inline> I think the Government are asking too much when they suggest that we should pay that gentleman &#163;1,050 per annum for three years to superintend the works at the Capital, he to have liberty to devote half his time to private practice. The next expert is <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Maurice</inline> Fitzmaurice, who is to be brought here at a cost of &#163;4,700, although I believe we have in our Naval Department officers quite qualified to continue the work at Cockburn Sound. If. our own men can carry out the awkward undertaking at Westernport to the satisfaction of the present Government, I do not see why we should pay such a large fee in connexion with Cockburn Sound to an expert who is a member of a firm the head of which some years before reported on the same site. We have here one of the best harbor engineers to be found in the world. In the last hundred years we have had to make many harbors; and I am sure that we could get the best advice on this subject locally, because we have Admiral Henderson&#39;s absolute approval of Cockburn Sound as a Naval Base, and one which is absolutely essential to our Fleet. Why do we need to pay &#163;4,700 to bring out an expert on harbor construction? I can hardly conceive of a junior member of a firm going against what another member of the firm, and a far superior man, has said. I cannot conceive of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Maurice</inline> Fitzmaurice overriding the opinion of such an eminent engineer as <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Coode. </para>
                    <para>I was referring just now to the Cordite Factory. The man who is manufacturing cordite here, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Leighton,</inline> was brought out from the British service, after having put in a fine service in India, and started a similar class of work. We brought him out here as an expert. He is manufacturing cordite not only equal to, but superior to, that which was brought from the other side of the world. Yet I understand the Minister has set aside the man who was brought here to superintend the erection of the Cordite Factory, carried out all the difficult initial work, and is turning out cordite for small arms. I heard some complaint about the quality of -the cordite obtained from the Colonial Ammunition Company, which was proved to have little or no ground, but there has been no complaint of defective cordite since we started our factory. Now that we have put in a plant which turns out cordite for our small arms,- we ought to establish works for cordite manufacture for our big guns, and thereby save a third of what we have been spending. I understand that the Government, who are so much in love with spending money J and bringing out experts to tell us what we already know, have sent home an officer or officers to bring out information in respect to the manufacture of big gun cordite. </para>
                    <para>As regards the main point which has been raised to-night, the Prime Minister glided off the point admirably, and got on to what I call a supplementary Budget speech. The honorable member for Hunter, the honorable member for Adelaide, and other honorable members, have been pleading for information. While I do not feel much inclined to cavil at expenditure in connexion with the Post Office, or any other Department, I do submit that, in connexion with defence, where the expenditure will not be of a reproductive character, we have to be very careful to see how the money is to be expended. The information has not been made available to us. I do not sit down making a threat, but I do think that it would almost serve the Government right if they were kept up all night on account of the meagre information which they have supplied, not only in respect to this measure, but in respect to others. I enter a protest against the information not being forthcoming. I believe that, so far as the officers and the Minister of Defence are concerned, there is a considerable state of mix in connexion with Cockatoo Island and Garden Island. I do not believe that they have been able to unravel it. We have never had a satisfactory explanation, and it seems that we never will. _ The blame must be thrown upon the Minister and his officers. It certainly cannot be thrown on those who, like myself, have been so patiently endeavouring to extract information. </para>

By arrangement with the State of South Australia, the purchase of that 3-ft. 6-in. gauge rolling-stock was obviated, and ^126,000 was thus saved to the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para class="block">That is one of those half truths which can be correctly described as worse than a lie. The Honorary Minister made that statement at the function for one purpose, and that of taking to himself the credit of saving &#163;126,000 to the Commonwealth. If he had been honest he would have stated what led up to the Fisher Government giving notice to the South Australian Government that they would return them an agreement which had been made between the State and the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Batchelor.</inline> It may not be known to honorable members generally that ever since the work was started at Port Augusta the authorities in the Home Affairs Department have repeatedly applied to the State Government to get the right of a roadway of 4 ft. 8^ in. on to that wharf. They ask for the right for the sole purpose of obviating the increased expense which would necessarily follow from having to load into 3-ft. 6-in. trucks to be shunted a certain distance and the contents put into other 4-ft. 8^-in. trucks and carried on to our road of construction. Not only did the State Government absolutely refuse to give that  right, but they charged rates which were excessive. For instance, for the use of an ordinary 5 to 8 ton truck they charged the Commonwealth12s. a day, whereas the same Railway Commissioner leased to the contractors, Smith and Timms, who were constructing railways in another portion of the State, the same trucks at 2s. 6d. per day. The rate charged between the Victorian Government and the South Australian Government for a 10 to 15 ton truck is only 3s. a day, but the Commonwealth has been paying to South Australia no less than 12s. a day for a 5 to 8 ton truck. Our Supervising-Engineer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane,</inline> has repeatedly wanted to get some arrangement made with the State Government which would obviate that heavy charge. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane,</inline> in a report on the 27th June of last year, says - </para>

                        <para>All of the material for the construction of the South Australian section of the line, amounting to over 200,000 tons, of which only a comparatively small proportion has been received, must be discharged from incoming vessels at the wharf. The South Australian Railway Commissioner expressed himself as being unfavorable to giving permission for Commonwealth railway stock to have direct access to the wharf. The Commonwealth owns the wharf and the tracks thereon. It pays interest on the cost of construction, and is also debited with extraordinary repairs and renewals. At the same time, the Commonwealth is called upon to pay wharfage rates under the ordinary public tariff in respect of every ton of material which passes over the wharf. These rates will average, I should say, at least1s. 3d. per ton, and probably nearer1s. 6d., so that on a 200,000 tons of business we would in the ordinary course be called upon to pay at least over , &#163;12,000 in wharfage dues. </para>

                    <para class="block">It was to avoid this that overtures were made to the South Australian Government to allow the Commonwealth authorities to have a 4-ft. 8&#189;-in. roadway on to the wharf and a road direct from the ship&#39;s slings to our own 4-ft. 8&#189;-in. trucks. That request was refused. Again, in November of last year, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane</inline> reported as follows: - </para>

                        <para>As the Minister is aware, the Commonwealth pays all the interest on the capital cost of this railway,, including: the station buildings, yards, and. wharf at: Fort Augusta, and, in addition, the cost of extraordinary repairs is debited to the Federal Government. For the outlay referred to; amounting to &#163;84,000 per year for interest, and a varying annual sum for extraordinary repairs, the Commonwealth obtains no service whatever. On the contrary, the Home Affairs Department is paying, wharfage to the South Australian Railway Commissioner at full tariff rates for all material landed ex ships at the wharf, and, in addition, it is called upon to pay a heavy rate for the haulage of this material from the wharf to the Commonwealth depot, about three-quarters of a mile distant, the work being performed by the South Australian Railway Commissioner, who, in pursuance of the powers conferred upon him by the lease, absolutely refuses to allow the Commonwealth trucks to run on the wharf. Our unsatisfactory position is accentuated by the fact that heavy repairs to the wharf are now necessary. I have prepared details of what is required, together with an estimate of cost, and the Minister has approved of an expenditure of &#163;9,200 in strengthening and renewing the wharf. ... It is unreasonable that the Commonwealth should be spending large sums for interest and general upkeep of a property, and then have to pay further large sums for the privilege of using that property. </para>

                    <para class="block">It was in consequence of these overtures by the authorities in the Home Affairs Department, over which the honorable member for Wentworth now presides, that the Fisher Government, having failed to get the South Australian Government to meet them in a reasonable way, were compelled to give notice of their intention to terminate the agreement on the 1st January next year. Had the South Australian Government met the late Administration in the same spirit that it has met the present Government, there would have been no necessity to give notice of their intention to terminate the agreement. After all that the Commonwealth had done for South Australia, one would have expected that the Government of that State would have been satisfied, and would not have endeavoured to fleece the Commonwealth. It was only when every effort to obtain a reasonable arrangement with that Government had failed that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas</inline> gave notice of the intention of the Commonwealth to terminate the agreement entered into with that State by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Batchelor</inline> I am sure that that gentleman never dreamed that the Government of his own State would have treated the Commonwealth in the way that it has treated it. At the present time the South Australian Government is charging the Commonwealth a demurrage rate of 12s. per day per truck, whereas the amount paid by a private contractor is only 2s. 6d. per truck. Then, again, the South Australian authorities are charging us 3s. per 1,000 gallons for water: </para>

                            <para>- I want the Commonwealth to be&#34; treated in the same way that it treats other people. I was a resident ot Port Augusta for a number of years, and when I contracted to consume 100,000 gallons of water I got it at 6d. per 1,000 gallons. That is the rate which obtains at present. Every small stock-owner in the vicinity pays only 6d. per 1,000 gallons for water upon his undertaking to consume 100,000 gallons per year. Yet the Commonwealth is being charged 3s. per 1,000 gallons. When the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs told a meeting the other day that he had  effected  a saving of &#163;126,000 upon rolling stock for this railway, he stated only half the truth, because, had the arrangement entered into by the late Government been given effect to, we should have still had the rolling-stock. Had the honorable gentleman told his hearers what led up to the late Government giving the South Australian Government notice of their intention to terminate the agreement, I would have had no fault to find with him. But he claimed credit for having saved &#163;126,0CC upon one little matter which had come under his notice. If it had not been for the termination of the agreement </para>

                            <para>- I have the Railways Commissioner&#39;s letter, in which he acknowledges that he charges 12s. per day,, whereas they charge Smith and Timms 2s. 6d. I do not wish to occupy the time of the House, but there are two sides to the story the Honorary Minister told at a tea party the other night, and I wish to put the other side in fairness to the late Ministry. The present Minister of External Affairs will admit that the alleged saving is all a myth. There ought to be a different arrangement made at PortAugusta in regard to water, or we should put in our own water supply. South, Australia should treat us better considering all the work that is being done at Fort Augusta and in the development of the Northern Territory. At least, we should be put on the same footing as private people. </para>
