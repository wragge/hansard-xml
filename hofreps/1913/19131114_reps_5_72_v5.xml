                        <para>- On Wednesday I asked  the Prime Minister whether the Government had decided to reimburse the Government of New South Wales all the expenditure incurred in the active quarantine in that State during the present small-pox outbreak, to which he replied that he did not know what had been done. I want to know whether the Government has made any arrangement, or come to any understanding, with the Government of New South Wales whereby it will pay all the cost of active quarantine during the present outbreak, which, according to our Quarantine Act, should be borne by the State Government ? </para>

                        <para>- I wish to ask the Prime Minister a question relating to procedure. I have consulted <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> about it, and he thinks that the question should be referred to the Prime Minister. This is the first time that it has been raised, and it is one of some importance. On the 15th October a statutory rule was issued in reference to a certain Department, and I subsequently gave notice within the prescribed time of a motion to disallow it. As the Prime Minister will know, if no such motion is tabled within fifteen days from the date of the laying of the rule on the table, the rule becomes statutory law if not disallowed within thirty days from the date of issue. This thirty-day period expires either to-day or to-morrow, and I wish to know how the rule is affected by my notice of motion? I have not had an opportunity to move the motion, because its position on the business-paper has not allowed me to do so. It is not my desire that the rule should be disallowed, though I think that it should be amended; but the Acts Interpretation Act 1904 gives me no option but to move to disallow it, no provision being made there for the amending of a rule. Section 10 of the Act says - </para>

                        <para>- The point raised is one of those nice constitutional questions which require some consideration, and I confess that it has never before come within my knowledge. If the Government had no control over these things, members, by challenging regulations and insisting on their motions of challenge being debated, could hold up the business of Parliament as effectually  as  in any other way. </para>

The same thing is beginning again to-day. It is obvious, on the other hand, that if every alteration of a regulation is to be deferred until Parliament can find time for its discussion and ratification, the Public Service of the country will be held up. I ask the honorable member to let the matter stand over, and we shall have it looked into carefully.  His  point, I take it; is whether a regulation, after having been laid on the table of the House for thirty days without being disallowed by motion-- </para>

There would be no way of holding up business with greater facility than by constantly challenging the statutory rules, which seem to pour out of the Government Printing Office every day. The honorable member&#39;s point is a new one, and I ask him to raise it again next week. </para>

On the contrary, I pointed out that the door was open in every union, and that, as a matter of fact, many of the unions, including the Australian Workers Union, had no entrance fee at all. Any of the Unions that have entrance fees will advance the money until a man can earn it. He does not require a penny to join, and I can assure the House that I .never used the words that the newspaper report attempts to put in my mouth. </para>

My view of all this criticism is that in the end we may lose some of the privileges and rights that we possess. The sooner we let the thing alone and revert to our old practices, whatever they were, and try to treat others fairly, the better it will be for the House and for all of us. </para>

This question has been already fully dealt with, and a full answer has been given. I do not want to go too far in the matter, or to implicate an officer of another Department. I think, therefore, that the explanation I made ought to be accepted. I can only repeat that I gave no instructions for the mutilation that took place, and no instructions of that kind were given at all, but through a misunderstanding on the part of an employe, honorable members received <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> proofs in the way they did. </para>

                        <para>- I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether he is aware that manufacturers of explosives in Australia are complaining of a variation in the standard of explosives introduced into the Commonwealth as detrimental to their interests? In addition; I wish to ask the honorable gentleman is he aware that recently the Board appointed for testing explosives to be placed: upon the permitted list for use in gaseous mines have again altered the list, and have removed some of the explosives that were previously included in it, with the result that very large supplies are held at a loss in the hands of some of the collieries and business people in New South Wales, because under the regulation in regard to permitted explosives the Mines; Department cannot allow their use? In view of this, will the honorable gentleman take into consideration the necessity of establishing, once and for all, a testing station of our own in Australia ? </para>

                        <para>- I am having the whole matter inquired into. It is purely a question of cost. As the honorable member is aware, we have not. many people in Australia who have new explosives to test. We have some, and I hope we shall have more as time goes on. My own impression is that it is time we had a testing station of our own. The establishment of a Federal Department is an expensive matter, and the question to be considered, and which is now being inquired into, is whether the establishment of the station can be justified, in view of the cost involved. If it can be done at  a moderate cost, the honorable member may rely upon it that we shall have it done. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to ask the Postmaster-General a question without notice. He will remember that I have raised the question of the Tasmanian mail service on several occasions. He is aware that now is the time for the people of Tasmania to apply to the Government in order that they may secure cheap freights&#39;, as under existing conditions they are virtually controlled by a monopoly. I received the following letter from the Ulverstone Council, dated 10th November :  - </para>

The great trouble in Tasmania is that there is so much local jealousy between the people of different ports. The people of each port wish that the service should be run direct to their port. </para>

The opportunity for employment at this work will be as open as the day to them, and to any persons who care to qualify for the position. Many more than are proposed to be introduced will be required. . We are introducing some men to carry out urgent work of the Department, but the door to this employment will still be open to any young Titan who may come along and demonstrate that he possesses the necessary qualifications. </para>

                        <para>. - When the Prime Minister was kind enough last night to grant me permission to continue my remarks this morning, I was speaking on the benefits derived from unionism, and I did not mean altogether to the members of the various unions, but to the community generally. I think it is now recognised all over the world that the community generally has derived much benefit from unionism. I am deeply indebted to the honorable member for Darling for having very kindly supplied me with the matter which he, owing to the limited time at his disposal last night, was unable to use in his speech. Having gone deeply into this question he finds that in Australia there are 341,000 unionists. </para>

                            <para>- I think that we all look upon the honorable member for Darling as the Grand Old Man of Unionism. He points out that governing those unionists for the purpose of bringing about industrial peace, and getting better conditions for all concerned, there are no less than 667 bodies in the shape of Conciliation Courts, Arbitration Courts, and so on. My honorable friend also points out that 120,000 unionists are now working under Federal arbitration awards. I do not think that any honorable member on the other side will contradict me when I say that the Federal Arbitration Court has done wonders in bringing about industrial peace throughout Australia. In the face of those facts and figures I cannot understand why honorable gentlemen opposite are so opposed to the principle of preference to unionists. The only object I can see in giving preference is for the purpose of getting the men to go into the unions, and once we get them to realize the great benefits derived from being joined in a body, we shall have no difficulty in keeping them in the unions, and inducing others to become unionists. It is admitted now all the world over that the day of the individual has gone past. A thought flashes through my mind about the guilds referred to by the Attorney-General. I do not know where he got his history from. But I have read deeply about the history of the guild, and also conversed, as the honorable member for Darling did in the Old Country, with gentlemen who. have . been connected with the guild movement for many years, and Enow its history thoroughly. My principal authority is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thorold</inline> Rogers, and though I have consulted the authorities I cannot find out where it has been stated that poor workmanship, or, in other words, the men themselves, were responsible for breaking down the guild system. History, so far as I read it, teaches me that the guilds broke down owing to the invention of machinery. Machinery was invented which enabled the hands that worked in connexion with the guilds to come together in factories, which have grown bigger and bigger year by year, until at the present time the factories are no longer owned by individuals, as they were in olden times, but by companies. According to the history of the guilds, the master, as he was called, worked side by side with the employe, and had a thorough knowledge of the work. That time has gone past altogether. Factories are floated into limited liability companies, and shareholders want dividends, as a foreman in some very big works in Great Britain put it to me. When I pointed out to him the terrible conditions under which some of the employes were working in that factory, he said, &#34; Look, sir, I must get dividends. My instructions are to get dividends, and, therefore, I cannot better the conditions of those employed.&#34; I contrasted his treatment with the treatment meted out by Lever Brothers or by Cadbury and Company, where the employers are personally in touch with those who are working and producing the wealth for them. That state of affairs has forced the workman to do precisely what the companies have done, and that is to bring about a union. The companies have brought about a union of capital; the workers have formed themselves into a great union to protect themselves. I venture to say that the time of craft unionism has gone past, again largely owing to the perfecting of machinery. Just fancy, sir, one of those great iron trucks which are used on the Victorian railways being turned out every two hours&#39; at <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gray&#39;s</inline> works that we visited the other day. In every eight hours four railway trucks are completed. Speaking from memory, I think that in one year nine miles of trucks were turned out of the factory by the employment of about 400 men. The making of the steel, the shearing of the steel, and so on, are largely done by machinery, and hardly any hands are employed in the production of the increased output. It has made the employer almost independent of the supply of labour. Owing to the increased use of machinery quite a number of hands are thrown out of employment, and have to seek other work; hence we have the market overcrowded as it is. If we desire to be just we must admit that it is essential to have unionism to bring the employer of labour in close contact with a representative of all his employes. In Leeds a gentleman put it to me very forcibly as we went over his great works, employing some thousands of hands. I asked him if he was opposed to industrial unionism. &#34; Not at all,&#34; he said ; &#34; I welcome unionists, because they appoint an intelligent man to represent them. He comes along to me, knowing what the men want, and then we can confer, and, if it is possible, we settle upon an agreement, and the men go on working under it. That is far easier for me, and far better for our works, than to deal with each man individually.&#34; He pointed out that the firm derived a great advantage from unionism in that respect. Industrial unionism, as well as unionism generally, has gone outside the question of simply getting better pay for the men, and so on. I am indebted to the honorable member for Darling for some figures. Taking 100 British unions for the period from 1897 to 1907, he says that the unions spent 13.4 per cent, of their funds in connexion with disputes, 22.1 per cent, on unemployed benefits, and 42.5 per cent, on friendly benefits other than unemployment. He goes &#169;n to point out that the unionist individually benefits largely when he is thrown out pf work, or when sickness comes along, by being a member of a union. Probably that is the reason why we have not even the Attorney-General himself making the slightest objection to any man being a member of a union. </para>

                            <para>- I want to qualify myself, because I wish to be fair and clear on the matter. I do not believe in hard-and-fast laws; but I would give preference to unionists, all things being equal, and that is as far as I am prepared to go. At the present time we have in our municipalities a form of unionism. We are compelled to comply with the law, whether we like it or not. I know a gentleman in Tasmania who put a barbed wire round his fence at considerable cost, and, because he had not complied with the municipal law, he had to remove, the barbed wire. He did not like removing it, but he had to do so. Why ? Because there was a law which had been made in the interests of the community. If the grant of preference to unionists will get men into the unions, and if their presence in the  unions will tend towards bringing about industrial peace - which is in the interests of everybody - then we should do everything by means of the law to bring about that result. Again, to show honorable members how unjustly the Bill will, in my humble opinion, act upon people outside, let me refer to an admission of the Minister of Defence which I quoted last night. The other day he stated that, in open competition, the Commonwealth Clothing Factory had tendered for some articles required by the Post and Telegraph Department. The Arbitration Court may give preference to the unionists in that industry, as it did in the case of the Brisbane tramway industry. Would it not be most unfair that the Commonwealth, entering into competition with private enterprise, should be placed at an advantage over private enterprise by being allowed to employ any person on that work for the Post Office at any wage it liked to pay, because, if there is no union- </para>

                            <para>- It would be obtaining an advantage over private enterprise if the Commonwealth paid a sweating wage; but I hope that the honorable member does not desire that the Commonwealth should pay a much lower wage in the same industry than the Federal Arbitration Court compels a man outside to pay. We compel the outsider to pay a minimum wage fixed by law. I interpreted the remarks of the honorable members on the other side to imply that they do not want any unionism in the Commonwealth Service, and want to be allowed to pay any wage that the Government think desirable. </para>

                            <para>- The only way in which to get a minimum wage is through a union. For instance, at the present time the Arbitration Court will not recognise any man who is outside a union. In the case of the electricians&#39; award - in which I am deeply interested, having worked at the occupation so long - what did we find the other day? The men who were in the union participated in the benefit, but those engaged in the same occupation outside the union did not, and so there was a general rush of men to get into the union at once. </para>

It is astonishing to note the small amount that the worker gets of the product of his own labour, chiefly owing to high rents and interest charges. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. Only the other day, I went into a shop, and inquired the price of a pair of boots. It was enormously high, but the shopkeeper informed me that he had to pay &#163;30 a week rental before he got a shilling for himself. Yet nothing is said about fixing a minimum rent. The rental charged is always as much as can be squeezed out of the unfortunate workers. I very much question whether the increased wages which are being paid will prove effective until we have established a Fair Rent Court in the States. The object of the Labour party is to better the conditions of humanity. Only the other day I had occasion to call on a family in Melbourne, and I may tell honorable members opposite that they would hot care to house their animals under similar conditions. Why ? Simply because the wages which are being paid to the bread-winner of the family are so small, and because of the difficulty which is experienced in securing a decent house in Melbourne in which to live. Let honorable members visit Richmond, and note the conditions under which people are living there. I have no doubt that Melbourne will yet have to pay as heavy a penalty as Sydney is now paying, owing to neglect of proper sanitary conditions. </para>

                            <para>- This is a very big subject, and covers a wide area. When the unionist gets better wages he at once raises his standard of living. He moves out of the dwelling in which he has resided, and occupies a better house. Consequently when we insure the payment of better wages the entire community benefits. Our aim is to secure industrial peace. The way in which trade unionists are being persecuted at the present time is absolutely cruel. In my own State quite recently they have had to fight a man of straw, and, incidentally, I may mention that not a leading barrister in Hobart would take up their case. The result was that they had to get <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. M.</inline> J. Clarke all the way from Launceston to plead their cause. The unionists were charged with a certain offence, and now find themselves up against a straw man, who has no financial standing. Even on his own evidence his wife owns the horse and cart which he uses. The organization may have to pay a large sum of money for defending its members against a charge which was absolutely without substance. I knew nothing of the dispute when it arose, and was not consulted. I was in Melbourne at the time, attending to my parliamentary duties. I went to Tasmania to ascertain the facts regarding it, and on my return here I sat as a member of a Conciliation Board. We met the shipowners, and heard the evidence which was tendered. We afterwards sat at the table together, and in a few hours we settled the difficulty. In the absence of that Conciliation Board, I do not hesitate to say that we might possibly have had a strike as disastrous as that which now obtains in New Zealand. </para>

                            <para>- I do not intend to reply to interjections, because I have a habit of repaying the interjector with interest. Ever since I have taken an active part in the Labour movement my aim and object has been to secure industrial peace. The only way in which that can be achieved is by granting all concerned justice, and we can get justice only through the medium of an independent tribunal, such as the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court, which is far removed from parochial influences. I am in favour of preference to unionists, and I shall oppose the passing of this Bill, although I do not think there is very much in it. Of course I am speaking as a layman. I hope that I shall have the advantage of hearing the honorable member for Bendigo speak upon the question, and if, when viewed from a legal stand-point, a different complexion can be placed upon it, I shall be glad to hear it. I do not see, however, that the Bill will cut across unionism in any way, and I certainly do not think that it will bring about a double dissolution. </para>

                        <para>.- I cordially agree with the statement of the honorable member who has just resumed his seat that when interjections are hurled at us we are apt to hit back in a way that we may afterwards regret. I have no desire to hit back this morning unless it is absolutely necessary to do so. I wish to deal with this matter from the view-point of the Opposition. They have put forward a dual claim in connexion with preference to unionists. In the first place, they hold that in adopting preference to unionists they adopted a new principle; and, secondly, they urge that unionists now have an established right to preference. I particularly desire to refer to some remarks of the honorable member for Darling, and I feel a real pleasure in being here this morning to answer the man who is unquestionably the father of unionism in Australia. When I was a little boy in knickerbockers I heard the honorable member make a speech on this very subject at a spot 150 miles removed from any railway station. From that day onward I have closely followed his utterances upon trade unionism, and I wish now to put the other side of the picture. I, too, have witnessed the growth of unionism, but from a different standpoint from that of the honorable member. But before dealing with this aspect of the matter, I wish to dispose of the claim which is made that preference to unionists is a new principle. As a matter of fact, it is as old as the hills. The ancient clay tablets of 4,000 years ago show that preference to unionists was operative then. Aye, even India, China, Persia, Rome, France, and England have all tried preference to unionists, and in every instance the principle has had to be turned down, because its operation had always brought misery to the masses and trouble to the toilers. It is impossible to advance one section of the community at the expense of the remainder, without bringing trouble to that particular section. The very case quoted by the honorable member for Darling - that of the guilds in England - led . to such trouble that the system had to be abolished by law. He knows that perfectly well. </para>

                            <para>- There are any number of authorities for it, from Buckle and Draper, the historians, down. Guizot shows that Rome was practically ruined by this very principle. I wish first, however, to show the expense attached to granting a preference to unionists. We have examples which prove that the adoption of the principle involves the community in additional cost. Recently we had two of these examples, one in connexion with the erection of Commonwealth offices in London. What do we find? We find that between the lowest tender in which preference to unionists was recognised and the lowest tender in which it was not recognised, there was a difference of &#163;16,000. In other words, the adoption of this principle in that instance would have involved the country in a loss of &#163;16,000. Here is another case which must go right home to honorable members of the Opposition who believe in Government employment. In New South Wales, a short time ago, when a deputation waited upon the responsible Minister and asked him to reduce the rents of cottages at Daceyville, the model suburb, which&#39; is being built by the State Government for the housing of the poor, the Minister replied that until they could induce the carpenter and bricklayer to reduce their wages, he could not reduce the rents. There they are paying for preference to unionists. Whatever the cause the result, undoubtedly, is that working men cannot afford to rent a house in the model suburb, and have to live elsewhere. Let me come now to the right of unionists, as urged by honorable members opposite, to demand preference. The Labour party are always denouncing the rights of property. From the days of Prudhon, the Frenchman, to the present time, we have been told that rights in respect of property should be destroyed by the masses, but we are told now that it is the right of the unionists to obtain preference, and that that right is one with which we ought not to interfere. The honorable member for Darling, in endeavouring to establish this claim, said that the unionist worked, not only for himself, but for the good of the community. I propose to show in what way the average unionist works for the benefit of the community. Whilst I was quite a boy in the back country - I had just left school - a mob of unionists came to the station of which I was then in charge and sought practically to take possession of it. In those days the unionists travelled in mobs, up and down the Barwon. The trouble in regard to the coercionist - the&#39; man whom the honorable member for Darling has been upholding - is that he will fight only with the pack, whereas the manly worker will fight on his own. The coercionist will fight only in the pack, like any other - *I shall not say at present what I had in mind. Such men are not genuine workers. The men in the unions are just as good as the men who are not in them, but they are no better. I have employed both unionists and non-unionists, and I speak, therefore, from experience. Unfortunately, the few men who will fight only with the pack often lead the pack into trouble. To return to the incident which I was proceeding to relate; let me say that I was only a boy of eighteen when a pack of these men came along to the station of which I was in charge and practically wanted to take control of the place. I was on horseback at the time, and I rode to a spot where only one man at a time could reach me, with the result that these men, like the honorable member for Darling, when &#34; Smiler &#34; was cleaning up the gaol, were not to be found. A couple of years later, I had been out on the run one morning, and on &#39;returning home was informed by the housekeeper that some of the same class of men had tried practically to take possession df the place. I went out at once and showed them a little practice with a 44 calibre- rifle, and, again, like the honorable member for Darling, when the trouble was on at the gaol, they &#34; were not there.&#34; These are the sort of men who cause trouble in the community, and who are being bolstered up under the system of preference to unionists. The genuine worker, the real man of grit, does not need to be granted any preference. As an honorable member has said, he will get it. We give such a man the preference every time. </para>

                    <para>Mr.FLEMING.- I shall cite one or two more cases which will appeal to the honorable member for Kennedy, who knows probably a good deal more about the inner history of some of these things than I do. Away in the back country, I have seen a great bush fire with a face over 60 miles long. The honorable member knows as well as I do from where that fire sprang. But, because such a thing happened, are we to condemn all working men ? This sweeping condemnation of any particular class because one or two are known to be bad is utter childishness. There are good and bad in every class. </para>

Because these conflagrations occurred, surely we are not going to say that all working men are incendiaries, and, possibly, murderers.. Not at all. We recognise that these were the acts of what may be called &#34; outcasts,&#34; and the men who shelter behind unionists, and often lead them into trouble. Let me show how some of these men seek to lead unionists into trouble -and the incident I am about to relate is absolutely true. In the same part of the country to which </para>

I asked what had happened, and was told that a delegate from the Shearers Union had. walked into the shed - I hope that the honorable member for Darling is listening, because he knows, this delegate well - and, not noticing my brother, who was standing back in the wool bins, had walked on to the board; and said to the men, &#34;Remember, you are shearing not for Fleming, but for yourselves.&#34; My brother  stepped forward and said, If you want to talk to these men decently, you can do so.&#34; I cannot repeat the exact language that was used, because I am afraid it would not be parliamentary. </para>

                            <para>- By both my brother and the shearers&#39; delegate. My brother said, &#34;If you are going to talk to these men decently, you can do so here, but if you are going to talk in this sort of strain, outside is the place for you, and any man who wants to follow you can do so.&#34; That ended the matter. A little while later my brother was stooping at a tank to get a drink, when the big delegate tapped him on the back, and said, &#34; You need not be rough on a man. I had to tell them &#34; - and again I shall not repeat the exact language used - &#34; something.&#34; This was the story that one of the men told me, and it was borne out word for word by my brother. This was one of the chief delegates of the Australian Workers Union, and he is the sort of man who, to a large extent, dominates the unions, and leads them into trouble. &#39; The genuine worker does not go looking for trouble. He does not set fire to the country. The decent, useful working man, who is a. real benefit to the community, does not travel round trying to destroy things; he seeks rather to build up. </para>

The honorable member for Darling has been in the shed where this happened, and the shearers&#39; delegate to whom I refer was one of the most honoured men in the Australian Workers Union. But it is not necessary to detail personal history to bear out my contention as to how the unionists try to dominate the community. Was not a member of the Farriers Union in New South Wales fined for not walking in a procession, although he had merely stayed at home to help to build a house for his wife and children ? We also know what has happened at Broken Hill, and more recently at Beaufort, where men were mean enough and cowardly enough to throw heavy things down a mine on-- </para>

                            <para>- But the honorable member for Darling said that these unions were in the same position as the Government, and could exact from their members and officials the same obedience that the Government could. I am one of those who, perhaps, are old-fashioned enough to believe that the Government of a country should be the supreme power and that it is extremely dangerous to the privileges of the people as a whole to allow one particular section to so organize that it can claim that it is as powerful as is the Government of the land. Some unions,however,havegone even further. The leader of the strike in New Zealand has threatened the Commonwealth Government that if certain cargo is allowed to be landed here out of ships coming from New Zealand, the unionists will upset all the industrial forces of Australia. Have we not heard the honorable member for West Sydney say that he has control of a union which at any moment could dislocate trade throughout Australia? If we have reached such a pass that we have in these unions a rival to the Government of the country, it is time that the Government took strong measures and stood up for the privileges of the people as a whole. The Opposition come here because they please their party wire-pullers- - because they sell the privileges of the people to a particular section which is dominated by the unions. </para>

                            <para>- We come here to restore to the people of Australia their privileges. We come here to represent no particular class or section, but to represent the people as a whole. No section of the community has a right to make a claim which cannot be interfered with by the Government of the day. Property is a good thing, and far be it from me to decry property, because, in my opinion, it is an expedient for the maintenance and extension of civilization, and, as such, deserves due consideration. But when one section of the community can defy the Government, and an honorable member can tell us that a union he represents is on a par with the Government, it is high time that this or some other Administration should restore to the people of Australia those ancient privileges which have made Great Britain what it is. </para>

                        <para>.- This Bill I can only characterize as a piece of political quackery prescribed by the medicine men of political heathendom to cure evils which do not exist. The wild words of the last speaker are, I submit, utterly beside the point. He spoke of evils to the community which unionism has brought about, but he did not venture to condemn unionism. </para>

                            <para>- That is where I am going to show the utter inconsistency of the honorable member. The Attorney-General, in moving the second reading, referred to the good that unions have done, and said there was no intention to destroy industrial unionism as such, but that the object was to put political unionism &#34;out of the fight,&#34; and restore industrial unionism pure and simple. What the honorable member for Robertson does is to condemn the acts of men who are purely industrial unionists, and his utterances do not touch the question before us in any way. That question is whether or not unionists are to obtain preference in Government employ. The honorable member referred to excesses of industrial unionists in New Zealand, Broken Hill, and other places ; but these, I point out, are excesses of men who do not wish the rule of law in any shape or form, but desire to retain the old weapon of the strike, and to be able to disturb industrial relations whenever they please, without check or regulation. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Robertson tries to fasten those excesses on the Labour party, who stand for the regulation by law of industrial matters, and are trying to prescribe means to make such excesses unnecessary. This aspect of the. question, however, I propose to deal with later on. I desire to -show now that this Bill is mere political nothingness; it can do nothing, and is simply put forward to do what no legislation should do, namely, provide a battle cry for a political party. It can have no other effect of any kind whatever. What is the position ? The present Government by administrative decree have reversed that which the Labour Government did, and which the Liberal, or Conservative, party condemned. All that the Labour party did in this respect has been utterly destroyed by the administrative act of the present Government. Preference to unionists in Government employ was brought in by administrative act, and it is taken away by administrative act. That being so, why this Bill? If, by some change in the fortunes of the country - by some measure of political salvation for this country - a new Government came in, they would not be bound by this Bill. </para>

There can be no legislative result or effect of any kind ; it is a piece of political humbug, as I have said before. </para>

                            <para>- That is what I complain of - that honorable members opposite are putting this machinery into activity, simply to provide themselves with a cry with which to go before the country. At the last election this administrative act of the late Government was made an issue on every platform, and was largely used by Liberal speakers in condemnation of Labour candidates.&#39; The present Government were returned, and they are now doing what they said they were going to do - destroy preference. Again, I ask, why this Bill? There is no power in the country, apart from the legislative power - which we know will not now be exercised in this direction - to give preference to Government employes; there is no. power except that which lies in the Administration itself. No Court in the country can give preference to Commonwealth employes. </para>

                    <para class="block">The position, as I conceive it, is that the public servants cannot go at the present time to the Court and obtain preference to unionists - that the only powers under which Government employes can approach the Court are the powers contained in the Arbitration (Public Service) Act of 1911. Those powers are set out in section 6 of the Act, and there is not amongst them any power to award preference to unionists, nor is there any such power in any part of the Act. </para>

                            <para>- At any rate, my contention is that the Act does not allow  any Court to give preference at the present juncture; and, therefore, the Attorney-General&#39;s statement that the one object of the present Bill is to prevent a Court giving an award against the Government goes by the board. Government employes cannot go before the Court for preference now; and, therefore, this Bi41 will not do anything in prevention of their going to the Court for preference. </para>

                            <para>- Of course. But the acts of the late Ministry in giving preference were done in public. The matter was given the utmost publicity. Ministers were not ashamed of what they did, and if they had the power they would do it again. Do honorable members of the Ministerial party contend that this miserable Bill, if passed into law, will prevent these things being done if Ministers in power wish to- do them ? It cannot. Take the- inconceivable position that, if this party is again- returned to power - I do not mean that that is inconceivable; but the subsequent position is inconceivable - preference to unionists could still be given, in secret, if there- was any desire to give it, notwithstanding this measure being on the statute-book. </para>

                            <para>- It could be done if Ministers desired. The point the honorable member put to me was that, after the passage of this Bill, any preference given to unionists could only be given in the open; but I point out to the honorable member that even that measure of protection - if it be protection - cannot be conceded, because if persons are willing to get behind the law they can do so, as the honorable member may conceive, though I cannot. I think it is clear that the Bill is a miserable - I shall not say &#34; subterfuge,&#34; because its purpose is plain, but it is a miserable legislative expedient in place of a <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> measure; it is utterly to be condemned; it is a false use of a legislative function and an attempted false use of a legislative body. It has no result as affecting the industrial relations of the people whom it is put forward as affecting; it can do nothing; it does nothing, and is, as I say, a mere election placard, the principle of which has already been placarded before the people. Honorable members on the Ministerial side will contend that the people have spoken on the matter, but what they are now putting forward is absolutely, as the honorable member for West Sydney said, stripped of every vestige of reason, leaving their pretext standing miserable, naked, and shivering under the scorn of the community, an object to be spat upon by every man who believes in sincerity and in <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> legislation. Taking the Bill itself apart from its objects, what does it bring about ? If the view of honorable members opposite is taken it intends to prevent preference being given by the Commonwealth to Government employes. I contend, first of all, that it cannot prevent it; and, secondly, that, if it could prevent it, it would be preventing  a good thing. The Government who believe in industrial legislation and seek to impose on other employers of labour conditions which they believe will bring about industrial peace, should not refrain from imposing those conditions upon themselves. What is the object of legislative measures to-day with regard to industrial regulation ? We cannot divorce this aspect from the Bill, treating it as a serious Bill with a serious purpose. What have the Legislatures considered the proper way to bring about industrial peace or industrial regulation? I prefer the word &#34;regulation,&#34; because I maintain that we cannot bring about absolute industrial peace. It is no use crying out &#34; Peace, peace,&#34; where there is no peace. But we can, by legislation aimed in that direction, bring about a regulation of industries which, though it will not cause strikes to cease altogether, will minimize them and their effects - which is our object. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable member for Werriwa will allow me to proceed, I. wish to condemn the Government for their want of courage in this matter. If they wish to bring this matter really to an issue and have the question of liberty decided as the honorable member for Werriwa would wish it to be decided, why do not the Government bring in a short Bill repealing the preference section in the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act? The thing would then be above board. The Bill before us is one of the test measures that have been brought forward to bring about a dissolution of the two Houses. </para>

                            <para>- Political unionism has its expression in bursts of light. The condemnation of acts of industrial unionism has nothing to do with the point. Suppose this Bill is passed, will it for a moment check the growth of industrial unionism ? Suppose every measure on the statute-book passed in order to regulate the nation and bring about the regulation of industrial conditions without recourse to strikes is wiped off the statute-book, is that going to repress actions of unions such as those the honorable member for Robertson has indicated ? It cannot. It simply means that if we take away from the workers the right to combine into unions, and the logical corollary that that right shall be expressed in the most effective manner-- </para>

                            <para>- Not the honorable member particularly, but the honorable member and his party, by their actions here, do suggest it. If this is taken away we shall not have less of the kind of thing of which the honorable member for Robertson has spoken, but we shall have a lot more of it. In New Zealand we have an outburst of syndicalist action by men who will not have an Arbitration Court, who have severed all connexion with it, who refuse to be regulated bylaw, and who say, &#39; &#39; You shall not take away from us the weapon of direct action - the weapon of industrial revolution.&#34; These are the men who do these things, but we as a party stand on the regulation of industry by political action. During the last campaign we were condemned for the very things that those who are opposed to our methods have perpetrated. It was unfair. Some honorable members on the Government side know the position. But on every platform during the last election we were condemned for strikes at Broken Hill, and syndicalist acts here and there; all were put down to the Labour party, whose very existence as a party stands on the question of the regulation of industrial disturbances or industrial actions bylaw. </para>

                            <para>- Some support us, and rightly so, because we are able to offer to them some measure of relief which the Capitalist party deny them. Our objective may be the same as theirs, namely, that the worker shall get a fairer share of the product of his labour; but their methods are utterly opposed to ours. We as a party stand on regulation by law; they will not adopt those methods, but stand on regulation by direct action, or industrial revolution. That is the whole difference between us, and though we sympathize with them in their objects, our methods are opposed to theirs. We believe in the political weapon, and not the weapon of direct action. What a farce it is to say that a union which gives its funds for political purposes, showing thereby that it believes in political action&#34; and does not believe in resorting to revolution, is to be penalized by being taken out of the range of preference to unionists? The position is utterly farcical and absurd. It is recognised that people should have recourse to law rather than the bludgeon. That is the principle which has brought about all civilization. Private warfare among individuals was once the means of regulating all relations between people; that private warfare has been stopped by law ; and so here industrial warfare, which once was the only means of forcing the demands of the workers on their employers, is being stopped. We wish to stop it by law. The Attorney-General does not think the time is yet ripe, but we think it is ripe, or, as the honorable member for West Sydney said, &#34;rotten ripe.&#34; Though it may not result in all strikes being stopped - it has done so under the Commonwealth tribunal so far - we hope that it will do so. The Attorney-General gave utterance to a most extraordinary view when he said honorable members desired to stop this preference to unionists because it was a step in the direction of syndicalism. The thing is utterly illogical. If the Attorney-General had not said it, I should have said that it was utterly absurd. The two things are on different planes, and have no connexion. In the trade congresses which are being held all over Europe, there is a clear line of demarcation between the leaders on the two sides. &#34; Are we going to have syndicalism;&#34; they say, &#34;or are we going to have political action?&#34; The London <inline font-style="italic">Standard,</inline> in a paragraph headed &#34; Cautious German Socialists,&#34; said recently </para>

                    <para>Berlin, Sept. 17. </para>
                    <para> The Socialist Congress at Jena to-day adopted, by 333 votes to 141, the party committee&#39;s official resolution declaring that the time has not yet come for recommending a general strike as a means of advancing party aims, and, in especial, obtaining electoral reform in Prussia. The resolution, known as the &#34; Rosa Luxemburg resolution,&#34; in favour of energetic, not to say revolutionary, measures, was rejected by the same majority. </para>
                    <para>It thus appears that the party leaders, at any rate for the present, intend to rely chiefly on their parliamentary policy, and they seem thus, to a certain extent, to have adopted the views of the Revisionists. The congress next discussed Budget voting, and the party&#39;s attitude towards taxation generally. </para>
                    <para class="block">The question that is being discussed is, are we going to give up our weapon of revolution, or are we going to have recourse to legislation? In England, and in Europe to some extent, the party in favour of political action has triumphed in the congresses. But the two methods are as wide as the poles asunder. We here stand, not for syndical methods, but for the methods of law. </para>

                            <para>- The point is that our platform contains this plank. We are firm on this point, and the history of the movement shows that that is so. The last great outburst of syndicalist action occurred at the time of the maritime and shearers&#39; strikes, which failed because the sense of the people was against them. Out of that ebullition of feeling grew the party of political action, which has advanced step by step, with the approval of the people, until we stand where we do today. The people said, &#34; These men are reasonable and fair. They do not want the weapon of the strike; their desire is to have industrial like all other matters regulated by law.&#34; That is our position to-day. The word &#34;syndicalism&#34; is derived from the French, and, like many words so derived, seems to have the power of frightening people. </para>

                            <para>- We are not divided in opinion on this matter. I approve of preference to unionists, regarding it as a step in the direction of regulation by law. For honorable members to suggest that we. support <inline font-style="italic">sabotage</inline> and direct action shows that they do not understand the matter. Speech after speech indicates that they do not. . They support direct action themselves, deprecating and condemning the action for which we stand, which is regulation by law. The honorable member for Werriwa has stated time and again that he believes in letting the people fight out these matters by themselves. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Kooyong is one of those who really do not understand the position. Honorable members on that side are hand-and-glove with the employers and their interests, and do not understand the position and objects of the workmen. I have made some attempt to understand these questions, and because of that I am here. The honorable member and many others have made no attempt to. understand them. <inline font-style="italic">&#34; ij  :&#39; &#39;</inline></para>

I am speaking of it as part of the machinery for doing that. The ignorance, if I may say so without pretence, of honorable members opposite as to the real  meaning of syndicalism, shows that the word, as well as the Bill, is being used, to quote the phrase of a great writer on the subject, to cry &#34;booh&#34; to political geese; that, he says, is always the method of reaction. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable members might not feel complimented were I to answer their question; The political &#34; booh &#34; with which we have to deal is this Bill, and the bogy of syndicalism. The Honorable Ramsay MacDonald, member of the British House of Commons, cannot be accused of sympathy with revolutionary industrialism or syndicalism. He says that syndicalism is trade unionism applied for revolutionary purposes. It is opposed to political &#34;action through parliamentary  representation, and advocates direct action by force, the passive method of social paralysis, or the active method of strikes. This programme of action, he says, is preached to revive the old trade unionism, and to draw the workmen away -from politics as a means of social amelioration. Our method is the opposite of that. This is an extract from a manifesto of the &#34;Industrial Workers of the World,*&#39; a universal organization which -preaches the doctrine of industrial legislation by force, and notbylaw. </para>

They say, &#34; We will not have these parliamentarians, because their methods are slow and obsolete.&#34; I do not blame them in many ways, because the parliamentary machine is slow in action, and one cannot wonder that men who are crying out for the  amelioration of undoubtedly harsh conditions become impatient, or that their accumulated energy bursts out in the direction of syndicalism, <inline font-style="italic">sabotage,</inline> or whatever you like to call it. According to a manifesto of the Industrial Workers of the World, every member is pledged to &#34;a revolutionary policy, that admits of no compromise, and knows nothing of contracts with employers, of arbitration, or of peace.&#34; That is the best expression I can give of the object of that syndicalism which the Attorney-General, who does not believe in the abolition of strikes by law, says that we are verging on, although all that we want is the encouragement of  unionism. </para>

                            <para>- I justify strikes where there is no other method of getting amelioration. For instance, it is the policy of the Government to exclude rural workers from the Arbitration Act. I would justify a strike on the part of those workers if they had good ground for it, such, for instance, as a demand for a rise in wages. If they are put outside the range of the Jaw, they must use the only weapon available to protect themselves. The position is summed up by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ramsay</inline> MacDonald in this way : - </para>

                            <para>-That may be so. We may not agree with everything that Ramsay MacDonald says; but there can be nothing truer than the statement which I have just quoted. He knows his subject thoroughly, and shows what the objective of syndicalism is, and what the object, of political action is. Members on the other side say there must be no political unionism, and that ho funds must be spent for party purposes. </para>

                            <para>- It was not the present Liberal party that did it. The Act was passed in 1904 for very definite purposes. The party, as then constituted, said they believed in political action for the rectification of injustices, and the Labour party agreed with them, and supported them, and the Act was passed because of their support. Its policy was a part of the platform of the Labour party, and its objects were to provide for the exclusion of syndicalist methods by prohibiting strikes, to provide an Arbitration Court to settle disputes by law, to encourage in every way possible the formation of unions, and to prevent individual men, who are irresponsible, from taking separate action. They must be controlled by an organization, so that the expression of the opinions of the organization may be assured before it goes to the Court. Therefore, they provided a means whereby the Court could be approached only by an organization, and in the Act the intention is made most manifest. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member approved of the general principle of preference to unionists to govern men in their relation with employers. In whatever connexion the remark was made, the Prime Minister recognised the principle. The question of whether section 40 is constitutional or not is still being debated, but why should the Government be excluded from a disability, if it be a disability, to which all other employers of labour are subject ? We have seen in our railway service, which is a purely trading service, men being employed at rates which no private employer would venture to give, because it would not be allowed. Why should a Government which undertakes trading enterprises, such. as the construction and running of railways, and the construction of post-offices, be put in a more favorable position than private employers? This cry about Government money being spent to encourage political partisans is a piece of political impertinence. Government money is paid by Governments for services rendered to them, and why should they not be under the same conditions, and have their industry regulated in the same way, as private employers? It is utterly absurd to say that preference is used as a sop to political sup porters. The Attorney-General went back to the golden age for illustrations, but every man of conservative spirit goes back to a time when he believes the golden age was upon the earth. He referred to guilds being formed in order to see that men worked in the interests of everybody.. The members did nothing of the kind ; they worked in their own interests and in -the interests of their guilds. The Government saw that that was a good thing for both workmen and employers, and deliberately encouraged it by enacting preference to unionists. </para>

                            <para>- When we adjourned for lunch, I was referring to the position of the guilds mentioned by the Attorney-General. I say that they existed for the benefit of the community, and the trades they represented. Every member of a craft was a member of the guild of that craft. The Legislature at the time recognised the position, just as the Legislature under the last Labour Government recognised it here. They recognise that it was for the benefit of the community, of the trade and the individual that the necessity for all engaged in a particular calling being members of the union connected with that calling should be insisted upon. The isolated free agent was recognised as a source of industrial trouble that could only be remedied by preventing his isolation, and bringing him into the union so that his actions might be regulated. Even in the time of Henry I., I find that it was provided that - </para>

                    <para class="block">That is the position they took up in those days, and which the last Labour, and the old real Liberal, Government took up in this Commonwealth in enacting preference to unionists for the benefit&#39; of the community. To secure industrial regulation they established preference for the law-abiding man who says, &#34; I put myself under the law by joining a union.&#34; When the late Government, by an administrative act, established preference to unionists in the service of the Commonwealth, they carried out their policy consistently. They believed that this was the only way to secure the regulation of industry, and bring about industrial peace. They said, &#34;We shall not refrain from putting into action what we believe all employers should put into action.&#34; They recognised that Governments should be benevolent employers guided by strict justice, and as an object lesson to the community of what all employers should do, they decided to establish preference to unionists in Government employment. They believed that that was the best method to bring about the cessation of the industrial evils complained of; and if, holding that belief, and having the opportunity, as they had, of employing large numbers of men, they had not put the principle into practice, they would not have been worthy of the positions they held. It is for that reason, and not because they wished to pander to political followers, or provide places for them, that they did this thing. </para>
                    <para>They did it from motives of consistency, laying that flattering unction to their souls which cannot be laid to the souls of honorable members on the opposite side. The position of affairs which the present Government propose to bring about would be ridiculous. They propose to adopt the contract system in the construction of public works. Public money will be given to contractors to pay the wages of men in their employment to whom the principle of preference to unionists will apply; but where the Government employ men directly upon public works by day labour, it will be a crime to give preference to unionists. Is not the position farcical, as well as unjust? In conclusion, I say that this measure, which has been introduced as a solemn legislative act, is a legislative farce, and unworthy of the Ministry. </para>

                        <para>.- The honorable member for Bendigo was not very happy in the last illustrations he gave. One of the reasons which he has given for opposition to the Bill is that he finds that700 or 800 years ago the Legislature was in favour of the movement introduced by the Labour party when in office. My trouble with the majority of the members of the Labour party is that they take so long to catch up to the legislation of the past. I admit that it is a distinct advance for them to catch up to the legislation of 700 or 800 years ago, but in this matter they have only caught up with legislation of 4,000 years ago. Under the Assyrian Empire men were obliged to belong to only one craft, and were punished very severely if they belonged to two. Honorable members opposite advocate the same kind of law. At that time there was not only preference to unionists, but every one, by law, was compelled to belong to a union, and the honorable member for Bendigo says we ought to go back to that condition of things. The legislation of 4,000 years ago is on a par with the general intelligence directed by the party opposite to the consideration of these matters. No one supposes that our honorable friends knew that this was really the legislation of those times. If they did, they would have condemned it because it was old. When they tell us that they are the party of progress who are introducing everything that was not before known in the civilized world, one is tempted to say, &#34;Well, let us see whether that is the case.&#34; On all sides, in the records of all countries, we find evidence that the systems which honorable members opposite are asking a free, White Australia to adopt are but the cast-off systems of some of the coloured races to whom they so much object. In Egypt, in India, and all through Assyria the legislation which honorable members opposite so earnestly desire to adopt was tried for centuries. Even after the migration that took place all over Europe from those places, perhaps, owing to the slow development of civilization, those engaged in different crafts and industries kept to themselves, and tried to shut out the rest of the community by laws framed entirely for their own advantage. Unfortunately, the records of civilization show that all classes have tried to secure legislation on their own behalf. In this respect the legislation of the various unions and crafts of the past does not differ from the legislation enacted for the benefit of the landed and moneyed classes. Each class strove, so far as it could, to secure a livelihood at the expense of other people. I am glad that the honorable member for Bendigo has sufficiently read history to recognise that these laws are&#39; very, very old indeed; but I wish he had studied it to more advantage, and had learned that true human progress only commenced when people ceased to regulate trades and industries in the way he has described. I venture to say that in the last 150&#39; years, or since the doctrine of competition started in the fashion in which we have it in these days, there has been more progress, as every one will admit, than there was in the course of all the thousands of years immediately preceding that period. </para>

If we go to India even to-day, we shall find that the effect of caste, which was the original unionism, is so great that nobody can escape from the lot or condition of life in which he was born. If we go to France, we shall find that, before the Revolution, the unions so tied down a large number of people that no mau but the son of a member of a union could become a member of it, and, in many cases, unless a man was the eldest son of a member of the union of a particular craft, he could not get into it. </para>

As my honorable friends opposite are so much in favour of old things, I may be allowed to recall a statement made 2,300 years ago by a gentleman named Thucydides. He said that the study of history is one which all ought to undertake, because it is only by a knowledge of the past that we can ever hope to foresee the future. </para>

                            <para>- That I take it is what has been done. I regret that the Bill does not abolish preference to unionists altogether, because what right has anybody to come forward in what should be the highest Court of Justice in the country and say that preference should be given to anybody ? If a man in any walk of life ought to be able to look forward with confidence, to anything it should be that in the Parliament of the country he would be absolutely sure that no preference of any kind would be shown to any individual. The mere fact that a Bill was brought forward in which it was sought to give preference to one class or another ought, in my mind, to have been sufficient to condemn it. Because the principle on which it was founded is, and must be, absolutely contrary to the true spirit of justice. I know that a great many honorable members get confused with the idea that, possibly, the granting of preference will lead to the betterment of the whole of the community. That can be the only excuse put forward in favour of the principle; but, as against that, I have only to refer them to the time when everybody belonged to a union, and remind them that there was no development then ; that there was still more misery and poverty - certainly very much greater poverty than exists to-day ; that the whole history of human progress consists, evidently, in the breaking up of old bonds and ancient customs , that where the force of law was exerted upon people there was no true onward movement. It is quite forgotten now that all this growth  of  liberty is a psychological growth, and persons speak as if it was in the power  of  Parliament to correct it at a moment&#39;s notice. The spirit of liberty means the putting on of new habits and a new capacity, it means the birth of a new insight.: Altogether, it is very largely a mental development, and in that way it is quite impossible for legislative bodies to deal with it. Because there is a good deal  of  evil, poverty, and misery in the world, honorable members on the other side at once say to the House, &#34; We can cure that by legislative action.&#34; It is not sufficient for them to point out an evil unless they can point out the means of curing it by legislation. Clearly, no method of coercion is the proper way to cure an evil of that sort. If my honorable friends could point out avenues of industry; if they could point out how the people were able to save a great deal of the waste that goes on ; if they could point out how, by the introduction o&#39;f new methods, the production of Australia would be quadrupled, it is manifest that they would at once immensely increase the proportion of the wealth that everybody in the community would have. Parliament sees that it cannot do that, and, therefore, does not make an attempt to do it; it does not see, however, that the mere forcing of people into unions is not a forward growth, but a backward one. It is a return to a system that has long since been given up in other countries; and, consequently, we cannot expect a true advance from that. In other words, we sometimes hear men say, &#34; Oh, but we on our side want to keep up the standard of living of the community.&#34; Surely honorable members on this side are just as anxious for the general benefit of the community as are honorable members opposite. I think it can be taken for granted that, on the whole, every member of the House is anxious to prove that the policy he advocates is for the best advantage of the community. I am sure that we are all agreed upon one thing, and that is that, in- the long run, a community is seriously injured and not benefited by dragging down the standard of living. The question is; How can we keep that standard up ? Some honorable members say that it . can be done by getting certain men into unions;  and that if we force all men into the unions we shall have a distinct advance in the general standard of living. Surely, if honorable members will reflect for a moment, they will see that it is not so. If they want to make an equal division of the property of the community, or the profits- </para>

When everybody gets into a community, who is to be entitled to the benefits accruing - one citizen only or the whole of the citizens? Manifestly, it ought to be the whole of the citizens. My honorable friends on the other side are trying to secure for a small section - less than a fifth of the number of electors - political advantages which ought not to belong to them. No advantage ought to be given to any citizen by Parliament. All true progress in the past has consisted in sweeping away privileges of every kind. Yet my honorable friends are busily engaged in trying to restore the privileges of a class&#93; and . they at once fall under this imputation. Supposing that to-morrow Parliament enacted that every one should call himself a unionist, would that satisfy my honorable friends? Of course, there is no reply. They know that it would not satisfy them if to-morrow everybody was to be termed a unionist. What they mean by a unionist is a man who is compelled to contribute part of his earnings to a union secretary, and then, and then only, is he to receive the union&#39;s stamp of approval. </para>

                            <para>- In New South Wales, last year, &#163;168,000 was collected by the unions, and practically the whole of that sum was expended in official expenses. It must be remembered that there was at least another &#163;100,000 which was collected in the shape of levies, and to which I take no exception, because that may have been distributed by way of relief. </para>

                    <para>Mi. CONROY. - The honorable member will see that I am not including that point in the argument I am putting forward, because . that, I think, is a voluntary contribution, whereas subscriptions are not, because they can be levied by law. When the Bill was being considered in New South Wales, and in this Parliament, too, it ought to have been provided that where union subscriptions were allowed to be collected by law, they should be safeguarded by law, and consequently we should then have a proper account of all these funds. The funds should not have been allowed to be expended, except where it was for the benefit of the men who were out of work, or in bad health. Those are the only two exceptions which ought to be made. Looking through the statistics for the Australian Workers Union for over two years, I find that out of every &#163;1 collected the union spent over 19s. in official expenses. </para>

It forces men into its folds whether they like it or not. It does not allow men to undertake work; and we have this extraordinary spectacle that while &#34;hard-faced,&#34; &#34; grasping &#34; business men, as my honorable friends term them, get fresh business for the great life assurance companies, and do not charge more than 3s. out of every &#163;1 collected, yet these men who tell us that they are overflowing with the milk of human nature, charge as high as 19s. in the &#163;1. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member knows that they were charged 15s. a year, and that a compulsory levy was made on them for a further &#163;1. The mere fact that this levy was said to be for the purposes of a newspaper only served to disguise the real amount which members had to pay, because - as the honorable member for Darling knows - unionists could not get their tickets unless they subscribed that additional &#163;1. Therefore, under no circumstances can it be said that during the last three years the members of the union have paid less than &#163;1 annually, and in two of those years they did not pay less than 35s. a year. These are the indisputable facts. </para>

                            <para>- That is one trouble which we experience with the honorable member for Adelaide. Much as we admire his speaking in this- House, we can never place implicit reliance upon his statements. I say that on more than one occasion I have paid a cheque to the delegate of the Australian Workers Union on account of a member of that organization, and on two occasions, if the member had not to contribute more than 15s. a year, with an additional &#163;1 towards the projected Labour newspaper, the delegate must have swindled the union. So far as the 400,000 unionists are concerned, their average contribution to union funds is about 30s. a year. Consequently, the amount which they contribute annually must be in the neighbourhood of &#163;600,000. Assuming that they have provided this amount for ten years, there ought to be &#163;6,000,000 available, which, with interest added, would make a very fine sum. </para>

                            <para>- When I was interrupted, I was pointing out that compulsory Arbitration Acts are absolutely opposed to trade unions themselves, because State action is action enforced on the whole people, and against which there must be no revolt. That imposes coercion upon them. Unions really represent the action of the individual, and, therefore, they are a protest against State action. The moment anybody disobeys an award of the Arbitration Court he becomes a rebellious subject, and is a mutineer against the State. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable member does not understand plain English, I cannot help him. I pointed out some years ago that Federal action in this matter would dangerously facilitate the formation of big combinations, both of masters and of men. I urged that it would lead to tyranny, because any sensible man must recognise that there can be tyranny by a union just as there can be tyranny by a trust. I pointed out that, as a result, a large number of the community would have to pay very heavily indeed for what has been done, and that, by fixing wages, we would destroy the great safety valve of employment in bad years. My warning, however, fell upon deaf ears. But I am pleased to note that, after all, there is a revolt on the part of a large number of men against compulsory Arbitration Acts. I admit that that revolt does not exhibit the spirit that I would like to see it exhibit. I would like to see the spirit of freedom revolting against the dictation of any Arbitration Court. After all, honorable members opposite, who have such a strong objection to lawyers that they absolutely prohibit them from appearing in the Arbitration Court, themselves selected a lawyer to preside over that tribunal, and asked the people to rely upon his decisions. I need scarcely point out that no legislative action was taken in respect of the eight hours principle. Yet, by means of men working together, they have obtained the general recognition of that principle. Had they waited for legislative action they would have been waiting to-day. The whole of the teachings of history show that those help themselves best who organize and work together. I am quite willing to help forward associations of men which are formed for legitimate purposes, so long as those purposes are consistent with justice. But the moment they seek to obtain for themselves an advantage which belongs not to them, but to other members of the community, that moment they become a danger, and ought to be put down. </para>

                            <para>- One would imagine that the honorable member had not read a word in the newspapers during the past seven or eight years, seeing that he is able to state with such a cheerful face that no strikes have occurred since the Arbitration Court was established. As a matter of fact, we know that there have been more strikes than ever before. The unions have ceased to be trade unions, and have become socialistic unions. The Socialists have captured them, and it is due to the Socialists that these outrageous demands are made without reference to the general interests of the community. </para>

                            <para>- I say, therefore, that every man should have his own, and no more. He should have his full share of all that he earns, and no man in a union should have the spending of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> until his brother has been brought up to his level. But we find an absolute abrogation of that doctrine. The idea of honorable members opposite is, &#34; I shall not contribute myself, but shall endeavour to force somebody else to contribute for me.&#34; They do not understand that if their principles were enforced, even for a week, more harm would be done to the country than would be inflicted on it by an invading army. If their principles are correct, all we have, to do to secure an earthly paradise is to transport the members of unions to the Northern Territory. Probably the leaders of those organizations would want a special telephone to enable them to communicate with their followers, because I cannot imagine that they would leave the comforts of the city. I repeat that all that we would require to do - assuming that the principles of honorable members opposite were put into operation - to make the Northern Territory a land flowing with milk and honey would be to keep out . employers. </para>

                            <para>- I have distinctly pointed out that the Bill does not go far enough. As yet we .have not a Judge declaring all the law of the country, although a great deal has been done in that direction. I believe that no Judge will be able to administer a law which appropriates the earnings of other people without, perhaps, losing his position. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member knows perfectly well that if I cannot get all that I want I must be content to accept a. part. Acting upon that principle, I shall vote for. the Bill. The measure is an expression of opinion on the part of our party that the time has arrived when preference should be denied to any class of citizens. The mere fact that preference is mentioned shows that the matter ought never to have engaged the attention of Parliament. Our object should be to do away with privilege, and if we extend a preference to any class we shall be giving them a privilege to which they have no claim whatever. The wish of that class is to prevent the right to work. That is really what preference to unionists would mean to a large number of the community. If, however, the people choose to contribute to the funds of a union, they are to be called &#34; good fellows,&#34; and every one will be able to work. If we passed a law providing that every one should join a union, there would be no such thing as preference. Honorable members of the Opposition, therefore, by supporting such a principle, show that they are considering, not the whole community, but only a section of it, and the moment they consider only a part of the community, that moment they must act injuriously to the people as a whole. I have been waiting for some recognition on the part of Parliament of a fact that has already been recognised by many unionists : that Acts of Parliament are not wanted on their behalf. One of the finest testimonies to the spirit of freedom of the Australian workman is that he is in many cases refusing to be bound by the awards of a Court. I want no awards of a Court against men on either one side or the other. </para>

                            <para>- Freedom of contract, certainly, in that matter, at all events. Bodies of men are making their own bargains, and doing the best they can for themselves, and they will do better, and infinitely better, for themselves than any Act of Parliament can do for them. The moment you bring an industry within these bonds, that moment you bring back the musty, fusty past. It is better, infinitely better, for human progress to have awards violated than enforced, and I should be sorry if the spirit of freedom so died out in Australia that men could be dragooned into working, either by a soldiery or any one else. I should think that the spirit of freedom had absolutely departed from them. In such circumstances, we should have neither more nor less than a body of white niggers. The Opposition talk of strikes being injurious, but there is something even more injurious than strikes, and that is an ignorant, debased population, unable and afraid to strike. There were no strikes amongst the slaves in the Southern States of America, because they were slaves, and there are no strikes among the niggers in South Africa, which, according to honorable members opposite, is the country of progress and civilization. </para>

But there is something worse than strikes, and that is a body of men unable and afraid to strike. I am glad to see that, in many cases, the men are adopting that view. The miners of Newcastle have withdrawn from the Arbitration Court. They can do better for themselves under a system of contract. </para>

                            <para>- If they are going back they are returning to a state of bondage from which they will never be able to escape. The poor cannot always fight against the law. Sooner or later it must keep them down. History teaches us that the advancement of the poor has been best brought about by the abolition of all those laws which bound them, and so long deprived them of the opportunity of obtaining their share in the progress of civilization. There are only two ways of governing the world; the one is by contract and the other is by status, or statute, which enforces the status. By status and contract only can there be any real regulation. In the one case the world is governed or regulated by religion, or custom, or something else; and in the other by stimulating the spirit of freedom, so that each by himself, or in combination with his neighbour, can get his share of that which be and his neighbour produces. If we depart from these rules of freedom we must do injury to the community. This Bill does not go far enough. I wish it had gone further, and I am glad there is amongst men that faculty of prevision which enables them to recognise that the man is not always a friend who shouts that he is for them. The Labour party are always saying that they are for the poor. They may know the opinions of the poor, but they are not acting in their interests. Well-meaning as some of them may be, their actions are contrary to the best interests of the great masses of the people. But for that there would be no one on this side who would not be at one with them in upholding the legislation which they favour. It is only because we know that legislation of the character introduced by the Caucus party has already been tried hundreds of times, and has signally failed, that we are opposed to it. We have to learn by experience. The very party to which I now belong introduced the first Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. Many of the members of my party held something like the views which the Labour party hold to-day in this matter. But they have been able to learn by experience. They have profited by the fruit of other men&#39;s understanding and wisdom. They have tried to read up the records of the past to see whether such legislation is for the benefit of the people or not, and they have been forced irresistibly to  the conclusion that it is really to the injury of the people for whom it is intended as a benefit, and that they can best be benefited by sweeping away the privileges of the past, by the abolition of all taxes and duties which press upon the people, and by encouraging, as far as possible, the spirit of freedom amongst them. This Bill unquestionably seeks to restore in some small measure the spirit of freedom amongst the people, whereas the Opposition support preference to unionists merely as a political measure. In the Government service, at least, we ought not to try to introduce the system of &#34;the spoils to the victors,&#34; which has been attended with so much harm in America. If we are going to encourage the people to look to Parliament for advancement, then the moment that they do so the people must be irretrievably doomed. Such a system must lead to a multiplicity of laws of the kind which we are now seeking to correct, and to &#39;the appointment of a multiplicity of officials, all tending to the regulation of everything and every one. In the general regulation that must take place profit will be absolutely destroyed. Because of Arbitration Court awards the wages of craftsmen in many industries are not nearly what they would otherwise be. No better proof of this is to be found than the fact that in the two largest industries pf Australia - industries employing the largest number of hands - I refer to the domestic workers and the agricultural workers- </para>

                            <para>- Then let us hear none of these jeers when their names are mentioned. Nearly 600,000 of the workers of Australia are domestic servants or agricultural workers, and, without any union and without any Arbitration Court award, their wages have been increased from 60 to 100 per cent., when we take into consideration the extra cost of keeping them. On the other hand, the increase in the wages of those who come under Arbitration Court awards is not 25 per cent. When we consider that the increased taxation imposed by the Labour party and those who voted with them is from 30 to 40 per cent., can we wonder that the condition of the worker is not what it would have been if there had been no interference on his behalf by his self-styled friends, who, usurping the name of Labour, have managed to deceive so many people as to their real actions. Their real actions do not coincide with their real intentions. I believe their intention in many cases was entirely good, but Parliament is not the place where I should excuse them because of their good intentions. I shall judge them only by their actions, and their actions, in my opinion, have resulted in injury to a large body of the people. As the result of their interference with the people by means of Courts, at which business managers have to attend instead of building up the profits of their trades, there has been a great loss of profit. It is an axiom with many economic writers that the profits of trade are due to management, and, as the result of legislation by the Labour party, management has been taken away from various businesses. The time of a business manager which should be devoted to his business has been taken up in attending Courts, and in this way profits have been lessened. Consequently, infinitely greater injury has resulted to bodies of workers under trade union awards than would have been experienced if there had been no such awards. If left to themselves, the men would have been able to argue out differences of opinion with their employers. We should have had a Conciliation Court, whereas Courts of Compulsory Conciliation and Arbitration have been provided. The result is that every man who revolts against an award of the Court is considered to be a mutineer. I decline so to regard him. In my opinion, a man has as much right to refuse to work as another man has to refuse to sell his bushel of wheat or the loaf of bread that he makes. I am bound to say that the harm that has been done is very great. We have the creation of great associations of employers, and of employes; and the public, in addition to not having industrial peace, are faced with the danger of the combination of both bodies with the object of raising prices against the general consumer. We cannot have a better illustration of this than the fact, that large bodies of coal-owners and of miners agreed to put up the price of coal, with a view to  a small fraction of the increase being given to the employes in the form of higher wages. In such a case, unionism is carried on at the expense of other classes of labour, and, therefore, is not a benefit, but an injury to the community as a whole. I trust that the Bill, though it does not go so far as I would wish, will be carried. </para>

                        <para>.- I rise to enter my protest against the passing of this measure. Throughout the debate I have endeavoured in vain to learn what is the reason and object of its introduction. The late Government issued a regulation whereby preference was given to members of unions, &#34; all other things being equal,&#34; and I understand that that regulation has been annulled by the same power&#39; that created it- the Government of the country. That being so, what can be the object of the Bill before us ? There is not much difference between parties in their utterances at election time, and no doubt there are candidates who allow their imagination to go so far that, when they are returned to Parliament, they find themselves in a somewhat awkward position in regard to the pledges they have given. Thus on the present occasion we have a Bill which I should say is not really intended to go through. In this Parliament we invariably follow the practice of the British Parliament; and I point out that in England an incoming Government does not seek to immediately reverse the policy of its predecessors, but gives that policy a chance of proving beneficial or otherwise. Up to the present there has been no proof that the preference to unionists, extended by the late Government, has resulted in any serious loss to the people of Australia. We all recognise that the Attorney-General holds very strong views, and I suppose that there is not a man in the public life of Australia with such Conservative instincts. He has shown his Conservatism by his opposition to the present day form of civilization, which is based on association. There is association in every form of commerce, trade, and professional life. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Alfred</inline> Deakin, when in this House, admitted that association was at the very base of civilization; and that fact we must recognise. Ever since I have been able to put two words together, I have taken an active interest in industrial organization, in spite of the fact that formerly trade unions were very obnoxious to many people. In our Public Service we have men of many callings, and all of them are connected with the associations peculiar to those callings. For instance, the medical men employed by the country must all be members of the British Medical Association, or otherwise their fellows will not co-operate or be seen in the same company with them. The same remark applies to those members of the legal profession who are engaged by the Government; and I question whether the Attorney-General would act with, or even mix in the social sphere with, legal men who did not belong to the association of the profession. Further, there are surveyors and others who all belong to associations; and in some instances the Government have to apply to those associations in order to obtain the services of the men. Whom is this Bill going to affect? The Attorney-General did not tell us, because he has not much knowledge of the Government employes; he has not had the necessity to acquire the information, and I do not suppose  he  worries himself much about it. The Commonwealth Government carry on a small arms factory, a cordite factory, docks, engineering establishments, and other works; and all the people employed in those works are members of organizations. The Attorney-General, however, by the Bill desires to introduce non-unionists, or persons whom I regard as not worthy to be in the company of those who belong to unions. Under such circumstances trouble must arise; and I do not see why there should be any opposition by the Government to the employment of unionists. Even if the Government did away with those Commonwealth enterprises, which, I know, are against their policy, they would have to get the requirements of the Commonwealth supplied from outside, and they would, undoubtedly, have to, in this way, indirectly employ persons who belong to industrial unions. Even in the case of the press, the reporters all belong to an organization, and they are very well capable of looking after one another&#39;s interests. My own opinion is that the worst paid people in Australia are those connected with the big journals of the various cities; there is no class of men who render such service to their employer for so little pay. I remember an instance when I was connected with the Trades and Labour Council of Sydney nearly thirty years  ago. A reporter used to attend our meetings; and on the occasion of a little bit of trouble about the importation of Chinese, when we went down to the wharf with a lump of wood by our side - there were no Arbitration Courts then - I saw that reporter there in the early morning. At 11 o&#39;clock that night I saw him again reporting in the room of the Trades and Labour Council. I asked him what were his hours, and he told me that he had to be at the Police Court at ten in the morning, and at the Trades and Labour Council meeting at night, while on Sunday he had to start work at 3 o&#39;clock in the afternoon. That man was employed on one of the best paying journals. </para>

                            <para>- To-day it is recognised that these conditions cannot continue, and there is no class of occupation in which there is not some form of association. The Attorney-General took pains to make out that unions were political in their object. I wish to allude to the experience we had before we could make the unions understand that the political arena was the only place where they could secure redress of their grievances or improvement in their conditions. Many of us burned the midnight oil and spent all our spare time in efforts to bring about early closing and the betterment of the conditions in factories and trades. Some of those conditions were abominable. However, we found it an utter failure under the old system. We could get no Early Closing Act, but to-day I suppose there is hardly a section of the community that benefits by the Early Closing Acts in force in the States that would revert to the old condition of things. I ask these big shopkeepers of Melbourne and Sydney - are they prepared to go back to the days prior to the passing of Early Closing Acts? </para>

                            <para>- They do not wish to do so, as the honorable member says. Several of us canvassed Sydney for weeks in an endeavour to get the shopkeepers there to agree to early closing, but our efforts failed, because there were two or three who would not agree. However, we have the blessings of early closing to day by legislation, and this should be sufficient illustration to prove to the Attorney-General, that the Labour organizations were driven by necessity to come into the legislative arena. At the time of the maritime strike in 1891, we were advised by every journal of importance in the Commonwealth to accept the Legislature as a means to the removal of the ills under which we were suffering. We took their advice, and that was the cause of the first arbitration measure being brought about. I remember the occasion on which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston</inline> brought a Bill to Sydney. My name was pretty well known, and he had a letter of introduction to me, so that I might get him a hearing before the Labour Council ; but we could do nothing until we had legislative action, and that; brought into existence the Bill introduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wise.</inline> That was a very good Bill - it was a very good attempt to achieve arbitration, at any rate - but, unfortunately, the unions did not possess the means to test the decisions of the Court. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade</inline> was engaged at enormous fees, and did little else but fight arbitration cases for five years. I ask leave to continue my remarks. </para>

                <para>Here, again, we have another illustration of incorrect statements being made without a scintilla of justification, and a proof  that the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> writers have not read <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> - neither do they trouble to look at it - when they are prepared to make these wretched assertions merely for party purposes.

It is to be regretted, but in view of what took place in the&#39; Chamber yesterday, these deliberate inaccuracies may continue, and all that those who take exception to it can do is to state their exception in the chamber, and have it recorded in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> that this newspaper is systematically making incorrect statements. </para>
