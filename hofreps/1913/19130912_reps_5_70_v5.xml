                        <para>- If the honorable member will place the question on the notice-paper, I shall, I hope, be able to give him  a  definite reply on Tuesday. Trucks are now coming forward, and  a  sufficient number have been shipped to Port Augusta to enable the plate-laying to be started shortly at that end. They  are  to come forward at the rate of three  a  week, and if the supply is kept up it should enable us to collect enough waggons within  a  fortnight or three weeks to start plate- laying at the Kalgoorlie end. </para>

                            <para>- Nearly all the men engaged on shore work at Cockburn Sound have been dismissed, but some provision must be made on shore for a dockyard. There is at present a dispute as to the site which should be selected. The Prime Minister has stated that he would obtain an expert report on the question. In the meantime, work on the site chosen by the ex-Minister of Defence has been stopped. Is work to be resumed on that site, or is it proposed to choose another site? </para>

                        <para>- A huge amount of money will have to be spent at Cockburn Sound in the development of the naval base there; I suppose that before we are finished millions will have been spent. This Government is of the opinion that the suggestion of the Naval Board - not the suggestion of the Treasurer as has been most unfairly stated by the ex-Minister of Defence - is a proper one : that expert opinion should be obtained before the huge outlay is begun. While on my feet, I wish to say that a more unjust and unfair statement than that contained in the telegram sent yesterday to Western Australia by the ex-Minister of Defence has not been made. It introduced party politics with a vengeance into the consideration of defence matters. Honorable gentlemen opposite are always asking that defence matters be kept high above party politics, but every day they try to make party capital out of them. </para>

                            <para>- Is it not a fact that, in reply to applications through members from their constituents for telephone connexions, the Department is reverting to the old system of stating that there are numerous applications ahead, and that those sent in by members will be taken in turn. This indicates a shortage in the staff, and I should like to know whether the Postmaster-General will enlarge the staff so as to expedite the connexions he now states he is willing to make ? </para>

                            <para>- I was given to understand yesterday that the telephone mechanics who are being brought, out from England are to be paid,&#39; iri the eastern States, the rates now observed in the case of similar work in Western Australia, where the cost of living &#39; is considerably higher. Am I to take it that the imported mechanics will be paid a higher rate of wages in the eastern States than are the local mechanics there? </para>

                                <para>- That would be better. The Department needs all the revenue they can get, because there are great calls on us for increased facilities for the public. I do not think the great mass of the people object to the extra 3d. being charged for maintaining each State within its own boundaries as regards prices. We cannot at present afford to make any reduction, as the revenue of the Department is really not enough to pay expenses. </para>

Various sums of money have been expended, and various schemes have been tried in an endeavour to improve the ventilation of the chamber. A few days ago I was called on by a representative of some firm with another process for the further purification of the air, but their scheme did not deal with the matter of ventilation. </para>

                                <para>- To open the windows as suggested by the honorable member for Henty would destroy the scheme of ventilation designed by the engineers. Thousands of pounds have been spent in an endeavour to ventilate the chamber. Altogether six schemes have been tried so far, and that at present in use has proved the best. There is machinery for withdrawing about 3,000 or 4,000 cubic feet of air per minute from the chamber and letting in a similar quantity. But trouble arises in the winter months. When the air is let in members complain about the draught, and go to the  Speaker  or  Clerk  to ask that the machine be shut off. The result is that the scheme has failed owing to the action of honorable members themselves in not allowing it to be properly worked. I have been told that if we have the doors and windows open the scheme which we have now at work to ventilate the chamber will be a failure. </para>

                        <para class="block">That is where the difficulty arises. No doubt the air in the chamber is very bad, but I think it is better now than it has been in the past, though perhaps something additional might be done. Every effort has been made to try and rectify the present conditions. </para>

                        <para>- If the right honorable gentleman resists a <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> effort to get some explanation of the amendment, I shall have to accuse him of obstruction of the grossest kind. When the Bill was previously under discussion, the honorable member for Adelaide suggested that a guarantee should be given that the amount expended in July to be covered by this provision should not be greater than the expenditure of the previous June twelve months. If the amendment refers to the June immediately preceding the July to be provided for, we should have no guarantee of the amount of expenditure which would be covered. Parliament has no sort of control over it, because during that June, presumably, it would be in recess. </para>

                        <para>- I am aware that the Appropriation Act covers the expenditure for the twelve months, but the Treasurer might in the last month of the financial year - though I admit it would not be usual - spend seven-twelfths or eight-twelfths of the total appropriation for the year. We want some assurance that the amount spent in the July to be provided for should not be greater than a normal monthly expenditure. The normal expenditure suggested by the honorable member for Adelaide is that of the month of June of the previous year. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly. We should know what that was, but Parliament will not know what the expenditure during the June immediately preceding the July to be provided for may be. If the Treasurer had some reason for securing the full advantage which might be derived under the amendment, he could do so by not spending much in May, and spending a great deal in June. He could thus get cover for an expenditure in July very much greater than is intended by this measure. The Treasurer might agree that the expenditure in July should be, for example, not more than one-twelfth of the total appropriation for the previous year, or not more than the previous June twelve months. The right honorable gentleman must see that the expenditure during that month would have been reviewed by Parliament. </para>

The Government express a desire to push on with public business, and this is the way in which a man is treated who exhibits an earnest desire to discover what is intended by the amendment before the Committee. The expenditure incurred during the June thirteen months prior to the July to be provided for will have been reviewed by . Parliament, whilst, as Parliament would be in recess, the expenditure of the June immediately preceding could not have been reviewed, and would consequently be entirely at the discretion of the Treasurer. He could during the month spend one-twenty-fourth, one-twelfth, one-third, or one-fourth of the total appropriation for the year. We do not want that. </para>

The Treasurer might spend &#163;500,000 in the June immediately previous to the July to be provided for, and if he did that this amendment would give  him  cover to spend ^&#163;500,000 in the July. </para>

                        <para>- Surely a Parliament cannot be expected to hand over to a Minister a power of that sort. What we want, and what the Prime Minister put forward as a reason for this Bill, is to obviate the necessity of doing almost illegal things in order to discharge public liabilities. We are perfectly ready to remedy that. One of two things must be done. Either the Bill should refer to the previous June twelve months, or it should provide that the amount spent in July shall not be more than one-twelfth of the expenditure covered by the Appropriation Act. Then we should get a guarantee that the expenditure in July would not be greater than usual. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not think that the desire of the honorable member for West Sydney would be carried out even if we specified the previous June twelve months. In the month of June, obviously, more money is expended than in any other month of the year, because a large number of accounts are paid in June which are not paid in any other month. The Treasurer sends out an intimation that all the accounts that have to be paid during the financial year must be paid before the end of June. He is naturally anxious that that should be done in order that on the 1st of .July he may be in a position to send all the statements .to the Auditor-General. Consequently, in June more money will be expended than in any other month. If, therefore, we specify that the amount paid in July shall not be greater than the expenditure in the previous June twelve months, we have no more control over the expenditure than to the extent of the expenditure of the month of the year when the largest amount of money is paid out of the Treasury. Suppose, for instance, that we provided in this Bill that this condition should apply to the previous June twelve months. A larger amount of money .could, under that provision, be spent by &#39; the Treasurer than it is the intention of Parliament to grant. Personally, however, I do not think there is much in that point, because I do not think that any Government would be anxious to spend in the month of July more money than is usually spent per month. </para>

The words &#34; aggregate amount of expenditure &#34; bind the Treasurer to adhere to the items of the Appropriation Act of the previous year as approved by Parliament, and further bind him not to spend more on such items in July than was expended in the preceding month of June. The provision seems to me to be perfectly clear. What is the object of the clause? It is not to allow the Treasurer to spend money recklessly, but merely to convenience the administration of affairs. </para>

                        <para>- I regret that the honorable gentleman should display such unnecessary warmth over the conscientious and logical suggestion which has emanated from this side of the House. I hope that his present demeanour will not be continued throughout the session. Honorable members upon this side of the chamber will have great difficulties in offering a suggestion of any description if he continues to display such heat, and to lose himself in his well worked-up indignation. The first provisions of this Bill are designed only to convenience the Treasury. It has never been suggested, even by the Ministry, that the Treasurer should be given a blank cheque for the month of July in any year. The measure is intended to prevent our public officials in particular from being subjected to inconvenience, and for that reason - if it be inconvenient to call Parliament together during the first week in July - it seeks to empower the Treasury to meet the ordinary current expenditure. There is no desire, I am sure, upon either side of the House that, under this Bill, the Government should be given a blank cheque for the month of July. I do not suggest that the Treasurer wishes to take undue advantage of the power which he will enjoy if the clause be passed in its present form. But we know that the opinions of Treasurers change. Different Governments may occupy the Treasury bench. I have a vivid recollection of the action of certain State Governments a month or two before this Parliament was inaugurated. Those Parliaments, to their everlasting disgrace, did something in a financial direction in the belief that they were imposing penalties on this Parliament, when, as a matter of fact, they were only inflicting injury on themselves. Similarly, we have instances of Governments in their dying moments having been guilty of political immorality of the deepest dye. The question therefore arises as to whether we are justified in giving to any Treasurer - not necessarily to the right honorable gentleman who now fills that office -a blank cheque for the month of July in any year, even though a general election may not have taken place, so that he may spend whatever he pleases. That is what the Bill amounts to. It is also intended to overcome a difficulty which presents itself in the July following a general election. That difficulty arises because our Electoral Act provides that new senators cannot take their seats until the 1st July following their election. In these circumstances, there is no justification for giving a blank cheque. </para>

                        <para>- If the Treasurer has regained his normal composure, if his little exhibition of irascibility has died away, he must know that the Bill is not required every July unless the Ministry, for purposes of their own, do not desire to call Parliament together during the first two weeks of that month. If they summon Parliament to meet during the first ten days of July they know perfectly well that they can get a Supply Bill passed through this House in a couple of hours at the very most, unless they have been guilty of some flagrant act which justifies special criticism. The necessity for the Bill arises from the fact that Parliament was not called together this year before the 9th July, although it might have been called together earlier. The Prime Minister himself practically voiced that opinion when he said that the Government had had to resort to some stratagem to pay the public salaries. </para>

                        <para>- We had from the Treasurer yesterday a statement that neither he nor the Department had resorted to the stratagem that the Prime Minister said they had resorted to. Every day we find Ministers differing diametrically in their statements. The Bill, as it stands, will permit the Treasurer of the day to spend in the month of July an amount equal to that which was spent during the previous June. Now it may happen that the ordinary circumstances of government have justified an excessive expenditure in June. This may arise from the desire of the Ministry to clear up the accounts before the close of the financial year. That, however, is not the practice of the State Governments. They frequently say, in regard to many accounts, &#34;Oh ! let them stand over till next year.&#34; It depends entirely upon the state of their balance-sheet. We may congratulate ourselves that that is not the practice with Commonwealth Governments. They are accustomed to sending out special requests with a view to expediting the payment of all accounts due before the close of the financial year. The ordinary circumstances of government justify an excessive expenditure in the month of June. But that is no reason why in July, and without knowledge of Parliament,&#39; without any supervision and criticism, the Treasurer should be given a blank cheque to do in that month what it was essential and proper to do in June. </para>

                        <para>- There is another feature which presents itself to me as being foreign to the real intention of the Bill. Again it must be emphasized that the real intention is to tide over a temporary difficulty in the early part of July, and to provide in particular that public salaries shall not be in any way interfered with; but under this provision we find that the Treasurer can indulge in expenditure of an aggregate character. The use of the word &#34; aggregate &#34; will permit of a manipulation of the expenditure. It will permit, for instance, of the raising of salaries, and that ought not to be permitted without a criticism on the Estimates. </para>

                        <para>- Not here. In ordinary circumstances increases of salaries are detailed in the Estimates, and honorable members know precisely what is going on, but the inclusion of the word &#34; aggregate &#34; in the amendment - and it is not proposed at present to cut it out - will mean that in July the Treasurer, if he so desired, could increase salaries in various directions, and once they had been increased, it would be a very difficult matter for honorable members to fairly criticise them or to have any check upon what he was doing. The amendment will permit of the transposition of sums from one heading to another heading. Sums might have been voted in the Appropriation Act of the previous year for a specific purpose and not expended for that purpose. The amendment will permit of the Treasurer, in July, when there would be no criticism, of taking a sum from under one heading and expending it under another heading quite without the knowledge of Parliament. I do not think - quite apart from party politics - that that is the intention or even the desire. The object of the Bill is to tide over a temporary difficulty which might possibly arise after an election. We ought not in the circumstances to give any Treasurer such a wide power. It might be the good fortune of some honorable member on this side to be occupying the Treasury bench in the course of a year, or two years, or five, years. This measure will be on the statute-book for all time, and whoever is Treasurer may be able to take advantage of this provision. </para>

                        <para>-I know that the expenditure varies. Some votes are not expended; other votes are exceeded in various directions. That is permitted regularly; it is an acknowledged thing. But we do not want to specifically give the Treasurer power to do things of that description in July, when we have no control over him. I will give an instance. It might be that a Government was defeated at a general election. The standard of honour in Governments differs. Indeed, the circumstances in their opinion might really justify them in retaining their positions, even though defeated at the polls. Notwithstanding that defeat, under this Bill they would have the power to manipulate - I do not use the word offensively - the expenditure during July. They would have the power to increase salaries quite out of proportion. </para>

                        <para>- The Treasurer ought not to make these assertions. Because I desire the Bill to be in what I conscientiously believe to be a reasonable form is no justification for him saying that I am against it. There is a difference between giving the Treasurer liberty to do a thing and giving him licence to do a thing. It is possible, I say, that a Government might be defeated at the polls. Ministers might retain their positions, as they would have the power to do, and under this Bill indulge in an increase of salaries, of which perhaps their successors might not approve. They might indulge in a form of expenditure which would not be acceptable to their successors, but which nevertheless they would be committed to by a defeated Government. Let us re tain the measure, as was the original intention. Let us put it in such a form as that any ordinary inconvenience because of the inability to spend one penny in July shall be met, so that the Treasurer, whoever he might be, could tide over the inconvenience. But do not let us, in this apparently simple measure, give a defeated Government the power to expend money. Do not let us give any Government the power to do what they like with the finances of the country for four to six weeks without the slightest control by Parliament, and to do things with which it might subsequently disagree, but which it would have to condone or permit. </para>

                    <para>. - There is a phase of this question which I think is lost sight of by the Committee. I want to make a strong appeal to honorable members on the other side, because the view I am about to put is not a party one. The position, V take it, is that under the amendment any Government would be entitled to tide over the financial requirements of the Commonwealth during July. There is no difference of opinion, I think, on the absolute necessity of an arrangement of this character being made in order to tide over the requirements of the Commonwealth during the month of July following a general election. That, I take it, is the reason why &#34;this Bill is introduced. I suggest the desirability of confining the provision to years in which a general election is held. I hope that the Treasurer will not think that in making this suggestion I reflect on him, or on the Government with which he is associated. I am sure that ho would act as honorably and straightforwardly as any Treasurer that we have had, or are likely to have, and no offence is intended. But what may happen if we allow the provision to apply to every year? Will it not, in effect, mean the deferring of the meeting of Parliament until August? I think it is not desirable to pass a law practically saying that Parliament shall not meet until August. There may be a great deal to be said in favour of the proposal in relation to ordinary circumstances, but we might have in power a Government which should be brought to book as early as possible. Such a Government might advise the Governor-General to prorogue Parliament in November, and if it could put off the calling together of Parliament again until August it would be free of control for eight months. Is that desirable? We should be careful not to fetter our successors. I may be told that a future Parliament could, if it chose, repeal the Act. That is so, but while we have the right to legislate to meet the requirements of the day, we ought not to fetter our successors. I see the need for a provision of this kind, so far as the July following a general election is concerned, but, as to other Julys, any difficulties could be provided for beforehand. For instance, two months&#39; Supply was granted in advance for the financial year 1911-12, because it was known that Ministers and members would not be able to return from England after the Coronation proceedings until late in the year, and it was thought desirable not to inconvenience the Treasury by the late assembling of Parliament which would be necessary. We hope that it may be many years before another Coronation takes place. Exigencies of State may require the presence of Ministers in London, or other circumstances may make it impossible to call Parliament together till late in the year. But these things will be known of in advance, and provision should be made in respect to them. Our present duty is to preserve the absolute freedom of honorable members in the criticism and control of finance, and we should not give up any of our powers. I understand that the Treasurer thinks that the provision would be useless if it were made to apply only to the July following a general election, but I should like to hear his reasons for that opinion. I do not say that the provision would be abused by this Government, and it would not have been abused by the last Government, but it might be abused by some future Government. Party feeling now runs high, and may run yet higher in the future, because parties are so evenly balanced, and the issues between them are of such vital importance. This makes it desirable that we should not give by Statute the power to defer the meeting of Parliament until August in each year. A six months&#39; recess is, in my opinion, ample, and, in many cases, too much. Parliament is the mouthpiece of the people, or, as <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid has said, the whispering gallery of the Commonwealth. Here every grievance can be voiced, and Ministers can be challenged on their every act. Possibly Governments do not like that, and the front Opposition bench may not always feel it convenient, but members generally should see that our powers of criticism are not curtailed. I do not think that it is necessary to make provision for the Julys following penal dissolutions and elections. </para>

                    <para>.- There are one or two aspects of the case to which I should like to draw particular attention. When we on this side offer any opinions about a clause, the Prime Minister charges us with obstruction ; but what is happening now is a proof that the criticism oh this side is of a beneficial character. We have reason to complain of the Prime Minister and other members of the Government going to Dandenong, Kyneton, and throughout the Commonwealth, addressing luncheon parties and assemblies for banquets, and thus wasting valuable time which ought to be given to the consideration of the proposals they submit to this Chamber. The Treasurer, when he introduced this measure the other day said, &#34; We are not troubled about the matter;  there is the Bill, and if you do not care to pass it you need not.&#34; That, if the honorable gentleman will allow me to say so, was a pretence. </para>

                        <para>- I am sure it will be remembered that the honorable gentleman said, &#34; Well, there is the Bill, and the Government are not particular about it,&#34; and he wished us to pass it that day without discussion. Because we did not pass it in one day the Prime Minister goes throughout the country talking about obstruction on the part of the Opposition. After the discussion that took place, however, the Government have brought down an amendment. I do not know who is responsible, but that amendment is very badly constructed, and, as the exAttorneyGeneral has said, is not at all clear. We are unable to say whether the words &#34; June preceding &#34; mean June in the year when this Act is to be operative, or the previous June mentioned in the first line of the proposed amendment. Although the Treasurer declared the amendment to be perfectly clear, he realized, after hearing speakers on this side, that it was badly drawn. Is that the way in which a Government should do business? Where are the lawyers on the Government side that they cannot come together and draft a simple clause ? I am wondering whether the expressed desire on the part of the Government to have business done has anything in the nature of seriousness about it, or whether the Treasurer has not brought down the Bill in this imperfect form in order to give rise to prolonged discussion. </para>

                    <para>.- What is desirable in a clause is clarity, and I suggest to the draftsman that he consults the Queensland Criminal Code, drawn up by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith, a Statute which is a model of concise expression. I do not like the idea of this  proposal to give the Treasurer a free run of the Consolidated Revenue for a whole month without consulting the members of this House. Does the Treasurer desire a long recess? If not, I see no reason for this proposal. There is no disadvantage in the existing method of procedure, except that the debate on that important question, the Address-in-Reply, might be interrupted for an hour or two while the Government get a Supply Bill through. The Treasurer tells us he requires the time to ponder over the figures and prepare his Budget Speech. We know that, year after year, when in Opposition, the present Treasurer baited the Treasurer of the day with requests to be informed when the Budget would be brought down; it was a standing grievance with the right honorable gentleman; but we do not hear much about it now - months are passing by and the right honorable gentleman thinks his Budget will be delivered in a week or two. Probably the object of this amendment is to enable the Government to prorogue the House in November, and continue the recess until the following August. It only shows how necessary it was for the framers of our Constitution to insert the provision making it compulsory to call Parliament together at least once a year. </para>

                        <para>- No; but I can see in it a desire to secure a long recess. I do not think the Treasurer&#39;s idea of gaining time to prepare his Budget Speech for delivery early in the session is sufficient reason for passing such an extraordinary amendment of the Audit Act. The right honorable gentleman has expressed his willingness to amend his amendment by providing that the expenditure in July shall not exceed one-twelfth of the ordinary annual expenditure. He went on to say that this was &#34; neither here nor there,&#34; but that is what he says about every proposition. As an old politician, he thinks that is the best way of allaying the fears of the Opposition.  His  remark reminds me of the statement of the Prime Minister, &#34; Oh, anything will do; all that you want is something near it or approaching the mark.&#34; Fancy Statutes being framed on that principle. Notwithstanding all our watchfulness, nearly every Act of Parliament is so framed that, as it is said, &#34; you can drive a coach and four through it.&#34; When exercising our utmost ingenuity and devoting all our powers of observation and thought to the framing of a clause in the most concise and clear way, are we to accept anything that the Treasurer cares to throw at us? The right honorable gentleman, forgetting his part for the moment, said that we could not have this provision applying only in a year in which a general election took place. Am I right in surmising that he wants more time in which to prepare his Budget speech ? Why does he desire that this provision shall apply to the month of July in each year ? </para>

                        <para>- That seems to be a good reason, but is there any objection to our meeting in June? We know that the Treasurer is a heaven-born financier, and is not likely to do anything wrong, but that does not relieve us of the responsibility of providing for the day when an awful fate shall fall upon the present Government and a new Administration take office. If honorable members think it wise to permit the Treasurer of the day to expend one-twelfth of the annual appropriation in the month of July of each year, I do not want to raise any unnecessary objection. </para>

                        <para>- And a good many turns. I rise to state that I support this provision, the need for which has quite recently been exemplified. After the last general election we did not meet until 9th July, and had it not been for the desire of honorable members on this side of the House to expedite business, the debate on the Supply Bill might have been continued until after the 15th or 16th July, when payments were due. Such a thing might happen at any time. I trust, however, that the Treasurer will see fit to strike out of this Bill all reference to a Tender Board. The creation of such a Board should be provided for in a separate Bill. I think the proposal that the appropriation in July shall not exceed one-twelfth of the appropriation for the preceding twelve months is a fair compromise, and I intend to support it. </para>

If the clause provided that in future this Parliament should meet early in July, there would be no objection to the amendment. Every Government of either party may be trusted to take advantage, as has been done in the past, of any opportunity to call Parliament together as late in the year as possible. When that course is followed, the difficulty which we now experience, and which this Bill is intended to meet, will continue to arise even though this measure should be passed. </para>

I understand that a number of commitments now involve weekly payments, and that being so, Parliament need not be called together until the 9th July, and under this Bill it would not need to be called together until the 9th August. If we could have an assurance that Parliament would be called together in the first week of July the Address-in-Reply could be got out of the way, and financial proposals brought down in August under this measure. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that, but does the Treasurer not see that the difficulty the Bill is intended to meet could only arise immediately after a general election? Ordinarily, it would not advance us a solitary step towards a solution of the difficulty. At the time of a general election half the number of senators go to the country at the same time as the members of the House of Representatives. Suppose the election takes place in May, it would be unreasonable to expect that the meeting of Parliament should take place at a date which would enable the attendance of the retiring senators. After a general election Parliament cannot meet before the 1st July, and that is what makes it necessary to provide for Supply for an extra month. The point I wish to make is that we have no guarantee that after this Bill is passed the Government of the day will call Parliament together earlier than has been the practice in the past. Except in the case of the first meeting of a Parliament after a general election the difficulty might be overcome even without this Bill. if. Parliament were to adjourn in September, and meet about the middle of May. That would allow the debate on the Address-in-Reply to be got out of the way in three weeks, the time usually occupied by the debate in this Parliament, and the Government could bring down Supplies and their financial proposals in accordance with the ordinary procedure. The Treasurer now proposes that the expenditure for July shall be one-twelfth of the total appropriated for the previous financial year. </para>

                        <para>- It was wise for the right honorable gentleman to do so. In the past it has been a common thing for the Treasury payments to be delayed in order that the Government of the day may appear to show a surplus at the end of the financial year. If a Treasurer has an ample revenue he will require all accounts to be paid up to the 30th June, because he will not know what may happen in the following year; but if he has not sufficient revenue to meet all expenditure he will delay all payments possible in order to make it appear to the country that the Government have closed the financial year with a surplus. If a Government were expecting to go to the country that is certainly what the Treasurer would do. </para>

                        <para>- We all know that it has been done. The point that I wish to have settled, and about which the Treasurer has given no clear explanation, is why this Bill has been brought down at all in its present shape ? The only excuse offered for it is that last session and this year it was found necessary to bring down a Supply Bill during the course of the debate on the Address-in-Reply. There is a general impression that it is not respectable to interrupt the Address-in-Reply debate with other business. But the Bill, even as amended, will afford the Government of the day an excuse for not calling Parliament together until a month or six weeks after the termination of the financial year. There has been an idea amongst a number of honorable members since the Federal Parliament was established that our sittings have been too long, especially when they lasted from the beginning of June or the 1st July to the end of the year. I know that a number of honorable members opposite are desirous that Parliament should not sit more than four or five months in the year. It appears to me that this Bill is aimed at enabling that to be done. </para>

                        <para>- If this Parliament continues till next year there will probably be a trip to England for some honorable members. But apart from that, there is a desire to shorten the sessions. Of course, a number of us who come from distant parts of the Commonwealth desire to get back amongst our constituents as often as we can. It may, perhaps, be convenient to some to shorten the sessions in that way. It is probably the intention of the Government to get this Bill passed with the object of enabling that to be done. But we must remember that if the sessions were shortened too much the people would want to know what this Parliament exists for. </para>

                        <para>- We are certainly sitting too long at present. To sit four days a week is too much, and tends to break up the health of honorable members who devote considerable attention to their political duties. The honorable member for Indi, for instance, will have to burn much midnight oil in studying the Bills that come before us. Indeed, that honorable member has been so much occupied up till the present moment that ha has not had time to express himself upon a single question that has been brought before the House. I think that the Treasurer has taken the right course in providing that power shall not be given to spend in the month of July more than one-twelfth of the appropriation of the previous financial year. That will give us a rough idea of the amount of money we are going to give permission for the Treasurer to spend. As the Bill was originally introduced, Parliament would not have had even a rough conception of the amount that was to be handed over to the Government to spend at discretion. One thing that I should like to know from the Treasurer is this: Has he had any fault to find with the Auditor-General regarding the method of auditing Commonwealthaccounts? Statements have from time to time been made that the accounts have not been properly audited. Can the Treasurer give us some assurance that they will be audited properly under this Bill ? I positively object to reflections being continually made on the Auditor-General and other officials regarding matters of this kind. If we do not obtain some such assurance from the right honorable gentleman he can rest assured that more will be said on this particular matter. </para>

                        <para>- I rise to a point of order. Last evening some doubt was expressed as to whether clause 3 does not contain a provision which is beyond the order of leave. Since you, sir, ruled that the clause was in order, a perfectly clear statement has been made by the Attorney-General that, under it, the Government can establish a Supply and Tender Board. In other words, they will be able to bring into existence an entirely new set of officers, who will have to be paid. They will have it in their power to create a new Department. When the Attorney-General was making this statement I observed that, at first, he did not feel called upon to express an opinion, but afterwards he appeared to realize that it was only just to the Committee that he should give us his view of the matter, which was that under this provision the Government can create a Supply and Tender Board. </para>

I said it had always been the intention of the Government to use this provision for the purpose of establishing a Supply and Tender Board. My hesitation was caused by a doubt as to whether the use of certain words was sufficient. </para>

I must say that he was quite candid. The Prime Minister backed up his statement by saying that he had already mentioned that it was the intention of the Government to appoint a Supply and Tender Board. </para>

I am sure that honorable members will see the very great necessity for confining a Bill of this character to the order of leave. When the House grants the Treasurer permission to bring in a Bill to amend the Audit Act the measure should be confined to audit matters. </para>

                        <para>- I propose to prove out of the mouths of Ministers themselves that the Bill goes beyond the order of leave, and that honorable members opposite know it. The Prime Minister must have had some ulterior motive in bringing forward this clause. How can it be urged that the creation of a Supply and Tender Board, the renting of an office in which its members may discharge their duties, and the payment of salaries and expenditure connected with this new Department has anything to do with an Audit Act? The Treasurer, instead of being in that happy frame of mind in which he ought to be after a satisfying luncheon, is angry that I have raised this point. This morning, when I asked him if he intended to proceed with this provision, he requested me to wait for information until we had got into Committee. The standing order upon this point is perfectly clear, and I hope that we shall transact our business in an intelligent manner. </para>

                        <para>-  I regret, sir, to have to disagree with your ruling. I feel it is about time we started to conduct the business of this Parliament on correct lines. It is the duty of honorable members on this side, not only to see that Ministers submit measures in a manner which will do them credit, and fulfil the objects they have in view, but also to see that the presiding officer conforms to the spirit of the Standing Orders so as to protect the House against having Bills of a duplicating character introduced under an indefinite order of leave. I agree with this Bill in the main. I agree that the provision which is now taken exception to should be enacted, but I contend that this is not a measure in which to empower the Government by regulation to introduce legislation of a very doubtful kind. I have repeatedly heard the Treasurer and the Prime Minister contend that legislation by regulation is repugnant to the best interests of this country. </para>

                        <para>-  The ruling practically is that a provision for that purpose is admissible in a Bill of this kind.  In  my judgment a provision to inaugurate a Supply and Tender Board is foreign to the object of the Bill, and should nob be allowed to pass. If the ruling is upheld by the Committee, I can easily conceive that Ministers will include in every measure a provision for something to be done by regulation which might prove highly injurious to the community. I wish to make a statement for the advantage of the honorable member for Henty, who was trying to instruct the  Chairman  as to his duties. </para>

                        <para>-  The objection to your ruling, sir, is self-evident. Every honorable member on this side has pointed out to the Treasurer the error of his ways in taking power in an Audit Bill to establish a Supply and Tender Board. Had he taken the advice which was tendered from this side, this delay would have been saved, but, through that usual stubbornness which characterizes him, and which he mistakes for tact or diplomacy, we have been driven into the extreme position of having to. move dissent from the ruling of the  Chairman.  I believe that the  Chairman  is absolutely wrong, and I hope that the Committee will vote for the motion. </para>

                        <para>- It seems to me that honorable members, having a poor case, have to resort to the old expedient of blaming the other side. They are asserting that this provision is contrary to the Audit Act. But the Audit Act is more than an Act to provide for auditing. In it a good many more provisions refer to the Treasurer and to the management of the public accounts than to the Auditor-General. The Auditor-General is mentioned only a few times, but almost every second provision says something about what the Treasurer shall or shall not do. </para>

                        <para>-  We know, of course, that the Auditor-General audits all expenditure, but sections 16, 17, 20, 21, 23, 24, 32, 33, 34, 35 and 36 all refer to the powers of the Treasurer. There is a misconception as to the scope of the Audit Act. In some countries provisions similar to those contained in our Audit Act have been put into Acts given different titles. The New Zealand Act which corresponds to our Audit Act is called the Public Revenues Act, and the English Act is called the Exchequer and Audit Act. Our Audit Act has far more to do with the way in which the Treasurer must manage the finances than with the Auditor-General&#39;s powers. The Auditor-General has the fullest powers in regard to the examination of accounts and the reporting to Parliament on all matters in connexion with expenditure. His powers are large, and his responsibilities great; but there are more provisions in the Act governing Treasury administration and the management of the finances than there are governing the Auditor-General . </para>

Every Department is now almost a law to itself in regard to this matter, or it can be. The Treasury may give directions and make requests, but it cannot legally bind the other Departments as to the methods of purchasing stores. The object of the clause is to enable us to frame regulations having the force of law, which will be binding on everybody in the Public Service.

                        <para>- It is quite true that certain heads in the various Departments including the Postal Department, are constituted a body to examine tenders before they are submitted to the departmental secretary, and, subsequently, to the Minister for approval. In the case of mechanical supplies the examination is made by  the Chief Mechanical Engineer, the Chief Electrical Engineer, or the Engineer in the State of Victoria ; but that is not the issue involved in the possibilities of the proposal before the Committee. The question is whether there shall be created under this clause an independent body, such&#39; as the Inter-State Commission is, with a staff of officers, whose duty it shall be to supervise the tenders for the whole of the Departments. </para>

Such a proposal, if submitted, ought to be presented in a separate measure. </para>

With all due respect to the Attorney-General, I think the Tender Board ought to be placed under the control of the Treasurer, who has to pay the bills. If there is any officer who ought to be free from any connexion with commercial transactions, it is the Auditor-General, upon whom Parliament and the people rely for the proper supervision of the accounts. </para>

The honorable member for Kalgoorlie has-, pointed out that the Treasurer may create an independent Department, with powers, a little less than those of the Inter-State--

I do nob go as far as to say that, but I can conceive the building up of a Department with great powers and a staff disproportionately large to the functions it will have to perform. We should sanction the creation of some body that will be independent, and &#39;have the authority to determine the suitability of supplies and tenders for stores and material required by the Commonwealth, and if the Treasurer will only tell us exactly his intention as to the power he wishes to get, much misunderstanding will disappear. </para>

                    <para>. - The present system of purchase and control of stores is not under regulations having the force of law. The object of obtaining the authority in clause 3 is to make regulations that will have the force of law, so that the Auditor-General&#39;s powers under section 41 of the Audit Act will have full play, which I hesitate in saying they have at present. Purchases are made all over Australia by different Departments under instructions, but these instructions are not as binding as regulations. The practice has been to utilize the Tender Boards in the different States, and I do not think there is need to rush in to appoint other Tender Boards so soon as we get this power, because we can utilize the Boards that exist in the different States and their regulations. We owe a debt of gratitude to the different States for allowing the Commonwealth to use their machinery and regulations. When a State Tender Board calls for tenders at the beginning of the year on a long list of hundreds of items the Commonwealth is included, and we have the option of taking our goods from the contractors at the prices they have submitted to the State Tender Board. </para>

It is his duty to report whether the finances of the public have been properly husbanded. I do not think there is much limit as to what the Auditor-General may do in criticising public accounts and reporting to Parliament. Sometimes Ministers are at variance with the Auditor- General, but that does not prevent him making his report to Parliament. These regulations, having the force of law, will be binding on the Departments. </para>

                        <para>- I hope we shall nob have Tender Boards for some time. We are now utilizing the Tender Boards of the States, and we can do it for many a day yet, but meanwhile the regulations will have the force of law, and under section 41 of the Audit Act they will come under the purview of the Auditor-General, which is not now the case. This provision is necessary, not in the interests of any Government, but in the interests of economy, and to secure a proper system and legal control over these matters. </para>

                    <para>.- At one time during the right honorable gentleman&#39;s explanation I thought we could see the matter clearly, but I am again in trouble, owing to his admission that there is no need for hurrying this measure, seeing that we will not require a Tender Board for some time to .come. In this Bill we have two clauses, one of which cannot be availed of until next July, while the Treasurer hopes the other will not be put into operation for a long while; yet only the other day we were violently accused by the Prime Minister of obstructing necessary legislation. We learn now that there is to be not one Tender Board, but many. I can understand that one Tender Board would be of no service. If something is required in Perth we can conceive the utter inability of a Minister in Melbourne expressing a reasonable and measured opinion concerning it. The right honorable gentleman possibly contemplates boards being appointed in the various States. To that I have no objection, but I ask honorable members to consider for a moment that the door will thus be opened to all sorts of possibilities. Here are boards whose functions are extremely vague, and the sphere of whose operations is obscure and apparently unlimited. What they are to do, and why they are to do it, we are not told, but we are led to understand very clearly that the Treasurer does not want them to do anything at all for quite a long time. In the circumstances I think we might fairly ask him to withdraw this part of the Bill until the need should arise for the creation of a body of this kind. So much for that point. The other point, as to which I am afraid the right honorable gentleman did not permit himself that measure of perspicacious utterance which it certainly requires - the question as to where the persons who are to constitute these Tender Boards are to come from - we should have more information. The Treasurer says that they are not to come from the Auditor-General&#39;s Department. Then from what Department are they to be selected, or are they to be persons now outside the Public Service ? As I said on a previous occasion, I have no objection to the right honorable gentleman constituting .a departmental board when and how he likes. All that we ask is that there shall be some responsible and independent authority to review the actions of these Tender Boards, just as the actions of all other officers are reviewed. That was the point made  by  the honorable member for East Sydney. The Treasurer knows that if he wishes to create such boards he does not require an Act of Parliament to enable Mm to .do so. I am utterly at a loss to understand why he is taking the power under this Bill to create a Supply and Tender Board, which he admits is not to be recruited from the .staff of the Auditor-General. The Auditor-General himself is not to .be the head of this Department, but is to have the power to review its actions. When we ask who are to constitute the board, whether they are to come from the Department of Home Affairs or from some other Department, we are not told. </para>

                        <para>- This copy which the right honorable member has handed to me shows that the Victorian Supply and Tender Board comprises, amongst others, the Secretary of Public Works, the Inspector-General of Public Works, and the Inspector-General for the Insane - an officer whose most appropriate appearance in this connexion seems to mark a new era in the debate. There has been hitherto an air of confusion, doubt, and difficulty about it, which is most regrettable, and the reason for which was not quite clear; but we now learn that the Victorian Government, wiser than ourselves, have provided that the Inspector-General for the Insane shall be one of the officers charged with the important duties in connexion with a Supply and Tender Board. </para>

                        <para>- The Secretary for Neglected Children ! This is, indeed, a refreshing sight. Politics in these days are essentially very dull, and the prospects before us are not calculated to rouse us to much jubilation. I should welcome with almost a transport of delight the possibilities for <inline font-style="italic">opera bouffe</inline> and unadulterated humour afforded by a board of this kind in which the Inspector-General for the  Insane&#39;s  vagaries are, so to speak, counterbalanced by the efforts of the Secretary for Neglected Children to see that nothing was done that ought to be done. There are on the Victorian Board a number of other gentlemen, &#39;Some of whose functions bear a very sinister appearance. One of these is the Inspector-General of Penal Establishments. This is introducing into the discussion a note against which I protest, and the Attorney-General, as the representative of the law, should be called upon to rise in his place, not as a matter of privilege, but by way of personal explanation. After all, returning to the point at issue, I should be perfectly satisfied if the right honorable gentleman would indicate more  clearly than he has done exactly how he intends to apply this system to the requirements of the Commonwealth. Unless he does so I must vote against this clause, and I am comforted in my determination to do so by the admission of the Treasurer that the matter is not at all urgent. I join with him in the hope that it never will be. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. No Commonwealth Government has yet established separate departmental Tender Boards, because there happen to be in the -States boards which perform for us the necessary functions, and perform them very well. If it were necessary, however, to appoint Federal Tender Boards in any of the Departments we should not hesitate to do so, and it would not be necessary to ask the authority of Parliament to do so. Honorable members may ask what is the connexion between Tender Boards and the particular power here sought to make regulations. The connexion is that when we have this power to make regulations we can impose an additional safeguard by conferring upon the Tender Boards which now exist, and are used by us, a certain authority. We :may say that the Auditor-General shall not pass accounts in respect of stores unless, first of all, the sanction of the Tender Board for their purchase has been obtained. </para>

                <para class="block">Treasurer submits in this Bill a clause under which it will be possible to establish a Supply and Tender Board. The Prime Minister, in discussing the preliminary stages of the measure, asserted that it was the intention of the Government to establish such a board. The Attorney-General yesterday, when unacquainted with what was in the mind of the Treasurer, also asserted that it was the intention to establish the board. A few moments ago, presumably after consultation with his colleagues, he stated that that is not intended. Before the Attorney-General spoke, the Treasurer informed the Committee that it was not the intention of the Government to establish such a board at present; that he did not want it; and that it was intended to continue the practice at present prevailing. Is it any wonder, in view of these differences of opinion, that honorable members on this side should display a little apprehension as to what really is the intention of the Ministry? Is this clause merely inserted to make good the bogy utterances from election platforms, or in order that the Government may take advantage .of it ? After listening to the Prime Minister, it would appear that the Government propose to take advantage of it; but, after listening to the Treasurer, it is clear that they do not intend to take advantage of it. The Attorney-General merely comes in to explain the legal position, according to the brief he holds at the moment. The whole thing is very characteristic of the &#34;yes-no&#34; attitude of the Government party in politics. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member may not be humble when on a Henty platform, but here he is as humble as &#34;Uriah Heep, and has to obey the Whip and come to heel when he hears the orders of the Ministry. We have a right to be apprehensive and to ask for information, in view of the contradictory statements made from the other side. I believe that if the discussion continued for another half-hour the Treasurer would make a further statement contradicting all that he has previously said. We on this side of the House are practically becoming dentists. We are extracting, occasionally and with pain to the person from whom it is extracted, little bits of information. The Treasurer has divulged something of what is in his mind. This afternoon he distinctly contradicted what he said yesterday, and for the third time in forty-eight hours has made a statement diametrically opposed to one made by the Prime Minister on precisely the same subject. I regret very much that the Treasurer has forced into an Audit Bill a subject that is entirely foreign to it. I wish to make it clear that in the first place we have no objection to an ordinary amendment of the Audit Act. We have no objection to the establishment of a Supply and Tender Board to safeguard the public interests. But we do raise an objection to a Tender Board being established under a mere regulation made under an Act entirely foreign to the subject. It was asserted that the title of the Audit Act had relation to the matter under discussion. The title of the principal Act is &#34; An Act to make provision for the collection and payment of public moneys.&#34; Will any honorable member contend for a moment that the purchase of stores has any relation whatever to the collection and payment of public moneys. </para>

                        <para>- I think that my honorable friend is on this subject sadly at sea. Instead of being on deck and understanding what has been going on, he has been down in the cabin. Otherwise he would know that the clause under discussion has no real relation to the subject of audit. A section in the principal Act provides for the auditing of public moneys. Has the Auditor-General anything to do with the purchase of goods? The Auditor and the purchaser should be entirely separate persons, so that the auditor may be free to investigate and criticise the work of the purchaser. The protection and recovery of public property is also provided for in the principal Act. The clause under discussion relates to the control of public property. I shall not debate the subject any longer. The Treasurer is taking advantage of the fact that the House is about to adjourn to force through a measure containing a clause entirely foreign to the rest of the Bill. He is forcing it through by virtue of his large majority. I remind honorable members opposite that it may happen before much time has elapsed that the two parties in this House will change places. If in the course of a month or two after a dissolution the Treasurer finds himself on this side of the House, what will he say if we take advantage of this clause? Of course, I know that the Prime Minister shrinks from the idea of a dissolution. I do not grudge him the promotion he has secured, but he knows perfectly well what the result of a dissolution will be. If as a consequence of an appeal to the country we change places in this House, and those who are now on this side take advantage of this particular clause to frame a regulation in respect of a Supply and Tender Board, and the purchase of stores, I am satisfied that the Treasurer, to the very utmost of his capacity, will denounce us as he has done in the past, and will say that we are practically making laws by regulation, and doing so when Parliament is not in session. </para>

                            <para>- I did not say that they had not. The Bill bristles with points which will naturally give rise to a good deal of difference of opinion, and I would like to hear and digest the explanation of the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs before we are called upon to proceed with its discussion. I can assure the Government that no time will be Jost by adopting that procedure. There are one or two provisions in the measure which we knew it would contain - for instance, there is the proposal to restore the postal vote. But there are quite a number of new points in it which come upon me as a complete surprise. The proposal to institute a check upon voting seems to me a most reactionary one. Before I discuss the Bill I desire to hear that provision explained. The Honorary Minister may have some data to support it, and, if so, I wish to have an opportunity to digest that data. I am not going to set myself against an amending Electoral Bill, and rush at it madly as does a bull at a gate. Candidly, I am opposed to the postal vote, but not under all circumstances and every circumstance. I am not opposed to electoral reform. It is only fair that the Bill should first be explained by the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs, and that we should then proceed with other business, resuming the consideration of the Bill on Wednesday. </para>

                        <para>.- When the honorable member for West Sydney sees the Bill I think he will be satisfied that it is very largely a Committee measure. In order to give honorable members opposite an opportunity of digesting it we are having distributed this afternoon copies setting out the amendments proposed in the original Act, together with the Act itself. Thus they will not have to study the amending Bill in conjunction with all the existing Electoral Acts. When they have studied it for two days I am sure they will assist us to get on with the public business. </para>

                        <para>.- The Honorary Minister has distributed today a reprint of the Electoral Act, showing the proposed amendments in block and erased type, which, of course, is a very commendable proceeding. Regarding the provisions for voting by post, I would like to know from the honorable gentleman, by interjection, or even in his second-reading speech, or from a Minister who has not spoken, whether those provisions vary from the repealed provisions. It is most important, I think, to have that information. I have not had time to compare the clauses in this Bill with the former provisions for postal voting. Eight or a dozen provisions appear to have been taken <inline font-style="italic">en bloc</inline> from some Act. I want to know whether they arc the same as our original provisions, or whether any alterations in the text have been made. Information on that subject will help honorable members on this side and facilitate discussion. </para>

                        <para>.- The Honorary Minister has told us that we have nearly four clays in which to digest a subject about which he knows very little. Does he mean to suggest that in the two days we shall be travelling by train we must study this measure? Does he mean to suggest that wo must give up our Sabbath to that work? Are the Government so depraved in their conception of their duty, not only to the people of this country, but to the Higher Power, as to force honorable members to study matters of this kind on the sacred day of the week? The suggestion of the Acting Leader of the Opposition, that the debate should be adjourned after the Minister has concluded his second-reading speech, is one which, I think, the Prime Minister would be very wise in adopting. There are considerations which, if extended to honorable members on this side, will be returned with interest, but if the Honorary Minister, who makes these sneers and jibes, and ridicules men who are old enough to be his father, and more enlightened than probably his father ever was, is to prevail, such conduct will be returned with interest, with a certainty. I advise this young stripling opposite to take a little advice, and not start to dictate and dominate the House, when he rises up in his supercilious and superior way to indicate what should bet done. </para>

                            <para>- I know that my honorable friend cannot, as he will find out as he goes along; he will discover that his colleague belongs to the worst specimens that this country has produced. This morning I received from the Prime Minister a reply to a question regarding the escapees from the quarantine station at Manly. I have to complain about the nature of the reply. It was to the effect that five men had escaped from the quarantine area ; that they were not in a highly contagious condition; in fact, that they were convalescent, and, therefore, there was no danger to the community. All authorities that I know of have laid it down that the most contagious stage of this disease is that of convalescence. For the gentleman who is at the head of a big Department of this kind, and who is responsible for the whole of the business in connexion with the scare in Sydney today, to send such a reply to this House, as though we were a lot of school children, is so much bluff, unworthy of an officer of a Department. Further, if his statement is correct, and these persons were wholly convalescent, they had no right te be in the quarantine area. They should have been discharged if they were what he calls wholly convalescent. On the other hand, the newspapers of Sydney, with scare headings, reported the escape of the men from the quarantine station, and stated that they were mixing with the people of Manly, and had the disease in a contagious form. That is absolutely contrary to the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Cumpston.</inline> The newspapers used the incident, as they have been doing from the beginning of the epidemic, to scare people into being vaccinated. It is a scandalous thing that every little point that can be taken with regard to the position of small-pox patients is used by the newspapers of this country to drive people into a worse condition than small-pox itself would bring about. In his reply to a question on a matter of great importance to the people of New South </para>

                    <para class="block">Wales, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Cumpston</inline> does not indicate that he has a comprehension of the responsibilities of his office, or, if that is not so, that he has the knowledge which should be possessed by a man who is administering a Department of that kind sufficiently to win the confidence of the people. I do not wish to further dwell on the matter, because I understand that the Prime Minister is prepared to give me an opportunity, as soon as he can, to discuss it. That being so, I do not want to sacrifice that liberality on his part. He realizes the importance of the matter. It is of primary importance to the people in this country that we should know whether the action of the Government is warranted by the experience of other countries, and by the knowledge of the highest authorities. In my judgment the Government are making a serious blunder, and spreading the disease day by day, as has been done in epidemic after epidemic, by vaccination. By scaring people day by day into being vaccinated the newspapers are doing nothing more or less than continuing the epidemic, which is practically the outcome of vaccination. We had evidence of that through the press when the Health Officer said that the disease was only attacking people in a very mild form, but that it was very probable that in a few days, or a week or two, it would appear in a malignant form. That statement has not been borne out by the course of events. The fact that weeks and weeks have gone by without any very serious cases having been reported, and without any deaths having occurred, only bears out my statement as to the experience of all other countries during an epidemic, and that is that it is suicidal to introduce wholesale vaccination, because it spreads the very disease it is intended to check. This is going on right along the line, and the Minister in charge of the Department evidently takes no notice of it. Where is he now? What cares he for the loss incurred by the people of to-day! What cares he for the ruin which is staring them in the face, in many cases by reason of the loss of business and the paralyzing of industry! What cares he about the lives which are being sacrificed day by day by vaccination and the effects of it! </para>

                            <para>- Yes, but he has not been in Sydney all the time. To a Minister who is in charge of a Department of State like this, when the lives of the people are at stake, which is the more important? The business interests of the community are also at stake. It is not his place to be away from the scene of action. He should be there, watching closely every move, to see if he can bring relief to these people who have been scared by the action of the Government, which had no warrant or justification, but must be regarded as a calamity such as I hope will never occur again in the administration of the affairs of this country. The newspapers are making capital out of the disease, and are doing more injury by what they publish in the city of Sydney than could be done in any other way. They have done everything to inculcate a haunting fear of small-pox, with a view to driving the people to vaccination. Everything that can be put forward to bring about wholesale vaccination has been published, but nothing to enlighten the people as to the folly of it is given publicity, although the newspapers profess to be the great public educators, and the guides of the people. For the information of these persons, who could sit, I presume, at the side of the grave laughing, in their ghoulish delight, at the tears shed by the relatives of those who have been called away by the effects of vaccination, I shall produce in this Chamber, not&#39; theory, but practical experience, and the judgment of men in every part of the world of far higher standing than <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Cumpston,</inline> proving that the action of the Government is suicidal, and destructive of the best interests of Australia, being calculated to spread the disease which it is asserted they are trying to stop. I suggest to the Prime Minister that when I again ask a question in this House, he will intimate to his officers that questions are asked seriously, with a view to getting information, and that members are not to be treated as children. We have no right to be told that a small-pox convalescent is not a contagious subject, because it is well known in connexion with all scrofulous diseases such as measles, scarlet fever, small-pox, and the like, that those who are in the convalescent stage are most likely to spread the disease. </para>

                        <para>.- I draw the attention of the Minister of Home Affairs to a matter that has already been brought before the House by me once or twice, and upon which I have asked questions, the giving for political purposes of &#163;500 by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Herbert</inline> Brookes to the honorable member for Perth. The honorable member for Perth has admitted that he received that money, and that it was received for political purposes; but he said that he did not know exactly the date when it was received. I should be glad if my banking account were in such a state that I could not remember exactly when I had received a sum like &#163;500. However, the honorable member for Bourke stated in this House that it was on the 26th April that the cheque was given. I raise no objection to the giving of the cheque, because I think that persons should be allowed to devote money for political purposes in aid of whatever party they may be associated with. But I bring the matter under the attention of the Minister of Home Affairs because the Electoral Act provides that an account must be given of any money sent for political purposes to any organization. I have asked whether the Home Affairs Department has received an account of how this money was spent, and have been informed that the Department has no information about it. The honorable member for Perth was good enough to say that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brookes</inline> informed him that I could go to his office, and see a statement of how the money was spent, but that is not my business. The matter would have been no concern of mine, but for the fact that section 172 of the Electoral Act says that a statement showing how much money is spent must be sent to the Chief Electoral Officer. As the money left Melbourne on the 26th April, it was money spent in connexion with the elections, and I ask the Prime Minister to ascertain whether steps have been taken to see if the Act has been complied with. When I asked a similar question some time ago, the honorable gentleman said that he was not a detective. I do not ask him to be a detective, but it is his business to see that administration entrusted to him is properly performed. During the electoral campaign, we heard a great deal about the need for pure administration, and about the need for purity of elections. I ask, therefore, whether an attempt will be made by the Chief Electoral Officer  to  give effect to the provisions of the electoral law in respect to the donation  to  which I have referred. </para>

                        <para>.- I  ask the Prime Minister to give consideration to our hours of sitting. He expects to get through a programme of legislation, a considerable portion of which means the utter destruction of legislation for which we on this side have been fighting for all our lives. When his measures are introduced, they will meet with the keenest opposition. During this week, we have been kept here every night until nearly midnight, but I submit that, in the interests of the honorable gentleman&#39;s physical condition, as well as for the sake of the health of other honorable members, our proceedings should close by half-past ten. It is not merely the hours that we sit here that have to be taken into account; the time occupied in attending to our voluminous correspondence must also be reckoned in. I have to answer letters from all parts of a constituency which is larger than Victoria. The Prime Minister can do a fair thing to the country and  to  himself only by setting apart a certain number of hours each day for the discussion of public business. He should not try to wear down his opponents physically. Such attempts only meet with retaliation and reprisals, and that we  do  not want. We want a fair fight, and should be permitted to get to our homes at a reasonable hour at night. If the honorable gentleman will consult the lists of the first Parliament, he will find that there are about eight of the original senators and about a dozen or fifteen of the original members of the House of Representatives left. We have both had a long time in politics, and, apparently, the people do not wish us  to  retire. Possibly we would not retire if we were asked to, and there is no reason why our exit should be hurried by asking us to sit here until midnight. </para>

                            on the splendid fight he had put up at the election, said he had a personal statement to make. On three occasion&#39;s during last week it was said in the House of  Representatives that he had been responsible for passing on a certain sum  of  money to a member in another State. He wished to say that this was absolutely true. He was proud of it, and hoped to be able to do it again. He hardly understood why such a disturbance had been raised in the House over the matter, when the secretary  of  the Political Labour League in Sydney admitted that a straight-out payment was made for political purposes. But how had
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anstey</inline>
                            received this information? Apparently the whole of  Australia was ridden with a nefarious system  of  spies. This was not playing the game.  At that social gathering a member of the Government,
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl,</inline>
                            was present; but I do not know whether or not, as the report of his speech is exceptionally brief, he complimented
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brookes</inline>
                            on the financial efforts he had made to assist his Liberal brethren. However that may be,

                            made a very definite statement; and, as the honorable member for Barrier has said, the Electoral Act requires all persons and associations to send in returns as to political expenditure at election times. That section of the Act the Government do not propose to amend, and we may take it that they approve of it. The request made by the honorable member for Barrier is a very modest one, and
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brookes</inline>
                            practically invites investigation.
