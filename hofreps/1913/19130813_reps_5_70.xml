            <para>- I am perfectly in order in outlining the case upon which I base my question. The Court decided that the company should make an inspection within three days. Permission to appeal to the Privy Council was applied for, but refused. I wish to know what is the present position of matters? Has the inspection been made, and, if so, what has been the result? Has any further action been taken against the Commonwealth by the Marconi Company ? </para>

            <para>- The question whether inspection has been made has not directly come before me, but I believe that an inspection was made. It would be better if the honorable member did not press for an answer as to the exact position at the present time. I could tell him what he wishes to know, but it would be better if he did not ask the question. The advisability of getting evidence from London has been under my consideration, but I ask the honorable gentleman to defer any question as to exactly what is being done at the present moment. </para>

            <para>- I desire to ask the Attorney-General a further question. In reply to the last question put by me, the honorable gentleman stated that he held a general retainer from the Marconi Company. I wish to know whether, in view of the fact that the Marconi Company is engaged in litigation against the Commonwealth - litigation that may involve the Commonwealth in many thousands of pounds - he thinks that he should con tinue to hold even a general retainer from that company ? </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- I think that the question proceeds from a misapprehension of what a general retainer, given to a member of the bar, amounts to. A general retainer merely gives to the person giving it the right to call upon the barrister by whom it is received, before he accepts a brief from any one else, who may be engaged in litigation, to give notice of the intention of the opponent to retain his services. That is all. When that notice is given, the barrister who has accepted the general retainer is obliged, of course, to consider all the circumstances that may, or may not, permit of his accepting a brief. In this case, as I have already said, I have completely severed myself professionally from everything connected with the litigation by the Marconi Company. That company, like every other company or individual giving a general retainer, has the right to say that it shall have the services of a member of the bar if there is nothing to prevent his giving them. There are a number of other matters in which the Commonwealth has no concern, and with regard to them I should not be justified in depriving the company of its right to my services if there was nothing in the position which I held against my giving those services. </para>

            <para>- It refers to a new survey. The question put by the honorable member was whether the reference was to a new survey party. There may or may not be a new party, but the reference is to a final survey before the construction of the line. The survey begun under the direction of the late Administration will, I hope, be completed by the end of the year. The field data has been collected for all parts except a stretch between Newcastle Waters and Alice Springs. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lawrence</inline> is at present in Melbourne, and intends to carry out all the office work. He told me this morning that he hoped that the survey would be completed by the end of the year. What we intend to ask for is that a survey before construction of the line itself be authorized by Parliament, so that we may push on with the building of the railway. </para>

In reply to the question asked by the honorable member for Maribyrnong with reference to the s s. <inline font-style="italic">Hawkes Bay,</inline> I desire now to say that that vessel arrived on the 11th August with a shipload of immigrants, amongst whom there were twenty cases of measles. These immigrants are isolated at the hospital at Coode Island, and the expense of this isolation is being borne by the shipping company. The isolation is effective. As to the question concerning the accommodation on board these immigrant vessels, which was asked by the honorable member for Melbourne, I wish to say that the matter has already been twice under the notice of the Board of Trade. In addition to this, a circular has been prepared for issue to the shipping companies setting out the requirements desirable on board these immigrant vessels, and that circular will shortly be issued. </para>

            <para>- Some, in fact I think all, of the matters to which the honorable member refers are under the Department of Home Affairs, and were referred to the Attorney-General&#39;s Department, under section 206 of the Act, to obtain a determination whether the Chief Electoral Officer should be directed to proceed. That is a matter to which, so far as the Attorney-General and the advice tendered by him is concerned, I should not be called upon to give an answer here. With regard to all prosecutions I may say that, so far as the Attorney-General&#39;s Department itself is concerned, the persons to receive the first intimation about them will be those who are primarily affected. I do not propose, while I hold office as AttorneyGeneral, to give specific information of the advice which I tender to my colleagues with regard to prosecutions or intended prosecutions unless they are actually launched. </para>

            <para>- The present Administration has entered into an investigation of the voting at the last general election, and having regard to the figures published, showing that some 5,000 votes are supposed to have been duplicated, or in some way rendered ineffective, I desire to ask the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs whether it is intended to continue the investigation ? </para>

            <para>- I may inform the honorable member that the particular investigation that has just taken place is not the only one that has been made. There have been some other investigations dealing with various phases of electoral management. For instance, I have endeavoured to trace the safeguards necessary in connexion with the ballot-papers, and there is no harm in telling the honorable member that that investigation has revealed the loss of 4,000 absent voters&#39; ballot-papers for the referendum. This shows that the checks existing at the present time are not altogether satisfactory. The investigations that I am making in regard to the electoral administration generally do not cease with the examination that has recently been concluded. That examination was to see how far the duplication of voting occurred, and it does not prove how far there was impersonation. In the case of a voter having impersonated another voter, and the original voter being subsequently refused the right to vote by the presiding officer, the inquiry breaks down as a check. We shall make all the inquiries that are practicable in the interests of the public. </para>

            <para>- The bank building is, I believe, directly on the avenue referred to. It is not the main axis of the Capital, but one of the two main avenues ; and it is rather unfortunate that buildings of a permanent character on the Acton side should have been erected in a way that will possibly interfere very materially with the avenue, or necessitate their removal as soon as we are ready to establish the city. </para>

              <para>- Shortly after I assumed office I called for reports from the Deputy Postmasters-General of the States as to whether the late fee stamp upon letters posted at country railway stations could be abolished. Each of those reports was adverse to the proposal, but a list is now being prepared of the small townships along thevarious railway lines throughout the Commonwealth at which letters can be posted without inconvenience to the railway officials, and no late postage fee will be charged upon such letters. </para>

              <para>- I do not think that any such rule has been observed. I understand that in some places effect was given to it. Where a post-office was situated three-quarters of a mile or more from a railway station certain concessions were made. But under the new proposal it will not matter where a post-office is located. In the cases I have indicated no late fee stamp will be required. </para>

          <para>.- lt is not news to honorable members cf either House that this, the Fifth Parliament of the Commonwealth, meets under very peculiar circumstances in so far as the relation of parties is concerned. There is evidence in both Chambers of a position which is not satisfactory with respect to the carrying on of public business, and there is evidence also of that fact in the speech made by  His Excellency  the Governor-General when opening the present session. The Speech was practically nominal, and offered to Parliament no guide to the policy of the present Government. The statement which was laid on the table of the House yesterday by the Prime Minister, and which purported to outline the policy of  His  Excellency&#39;s advisers, does not do very much to enlighten honorable members and the country as to what is likely to take place. In my opinion, it indicates, on the part of the Government, a mere policy of marking time. So far as we can see, they do not intend to launch any of those large and national schemes, such as were dealt with by the last Parliament, and which have tended to make Australia what it is today. Nine-tenths of the Government policy is purely negative. The Government, apparently, do not propose to make adjustments in the light of experience, but intend to hark back to ancient ideas, and to the most Tory principles. They mean to entrench privilege and to attack those who really need assistance. My first duty, however, is to oiler my congratulations to the honorable members who moved and seconded the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply. I think that they discharged that duty with credit to themselves and with honour to the House. Both have been returned by constituencies which were represented by others in the last Parliament. One constituency was represented by an honorable gentleman who has passed away, while the other was represented by a man who is still young, and who may be heard of again in Federal politics. Let me say that I appreciated some of the statements made by the honorable member for Indi. The honorable member, in the course of his remarks, made an appeal to the Opposition to see that the national policy of Protection was carried out. That appeal will not go unheard. In another statement, which, I presume, was made with Ministerial authority, the honorable member conveyed to the House and the country that it was intended to place tha maternity allowance on a contributory basis. I do not see anything in the official Ministerial statement that quite bears that out; but I presume it is an indication of the policy we are about to hear. In this lengthy document, which the Prime Minister threw on the table- </para>

            <para>- In the Ministerial statement, attention is first directed to the question of the rolls, and the Government express a desire that these shall be kept&#34; in proper order. Every member of this House - every member of the Labour party - agrees to that. We are glad to know, however, that the rolls are in fairly good order, notwithstanding the wildest and most reckless statements ever made by public and responsible men. The rolls contain the names of the people of Australia who are entitled to the franchise, and there is an excess of names, because, under the conditions of the check system, there must necessarily be more names than there are people with the right to vote. It is, and always has been, the policy of retro.gressionists, of Tories, and of privileged people to have as few names on the roll as possible. In a Democracy it is the business of the Parliament to see that the poorest and humblest citizen is enabled to exercise the franchise; and the outburst of anger and annoyance amongst honorable members opposite is because of the fact that such people have been accorded the privilege. The insidious, mean, and contemptible insinuation is that those people, if any, who did violate their election privileges, were not those with most of the world&#39;s goods, but those who are poor and needy - in other words, not those who support honorable members opposite, but those who support the Opposition.

            <para>- The statement was reported to have been made by the Prime Minister, and was given in the first person at a special interview; and it is an outrage on the credit and standing of the people of Australia. This country has been represented here and overseas as inhabited by men and women who are actuated by corrupt motives, and who act corruptly at the ballot-box. This slandering of the name of Australia is in keeping with the traditions of the party opposite ever since the Federal Parliament came into existence. When they were in Opposition, and the White Australia policy was before us, they denounced that policy in such language that Australia was misrepresented, and from that day to this the traditional policy of the Liberal party has been to traduce the good name of Australia here and in other parts of the world. </para>

            <para>- I had not intended to go deeply into this matter, but the people of Australia might just as well know how it stands. When the postal vote was allowed, how was it used ? One would imagine that in the great spaces of Australia, such as we find in Western Australia and Queensland, the postal vote would be mostly employed by the women, who there very often reside great distances from the polling-booth. As a matter of fact, however, the number of postal votes used in Victoria during the Federal election of 1910 was extraordinary. In order that there may be no misunderstanding, I shall give the figures for all the States. The postal votes used on that occasion were: - New South Wales, 6,219; Victoria, 14,049; Queensland, 4,020; South Australia, 1,751; Western Australia, 1,977; and Tasmania, 1,233. Thus we find in the most densely populated State of the Commonwealth there were 14,049 postal votes used. </para>

There are plenty of women who are in such a position that they are not afraid of their husband&#39;s position if they vote the wrong way; but, unfortunately, there are a large number of women who are not in that happy position, and it is chiefly for their protection that it is sought to remove this blemish from our Act without any delay. ...

            <para>- Nothing but an absolute and full apology by members of the Government will remove the stain which has been put upon Australia by the statements which they and their supporters have made in the press in regard to alleged electoral irregularities. These wild and reckless statements gave <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Foster,</inline> a leading Minister of the Canadian Parliament, an opportunity to make comparisons which did not reflect credit on the integrity of the people of Australia, as compared with the people of Canada. Anybody who knows America will recognise that it is the last country in the world with which Australia should be compared to our disadvantage in a matter of this sort. Yet, up to the present time, there is not a responsible Minister who has been honest enough to say that the allegations made in respect of impersonation and plural voting at the recent elections were not warranted. As a matter of fact, the number of irregularities which have been discovered are not more than those which are usually found even when a vote is taken in this chamber. Therefore, the voting of the people of Australia was creditable to them, and to this great Democracy. </para>

            <para>- And by Ministers. I am sorry that I have not the time to quote the statements of Ministers to the effect that the electoral irregularities represented thousands of votes. The Attorney-General made only one speech dealing with this matter, in which he conveyed the idea that ho believed in these allegations. Immediately he saw the rolls, he hedged, and said, &#34; I do not say that there are any irregularities which cannot be explained.&#34; But other Ministers were not so careful, and therefore the good name of Australia has been injured. The next point in the Ministerial manifesto is a rather important one. Paragraph 2 deals with two phases of social legislation which was enacted at the instance of the late Ministry. We are told that the present Government intend to abolish preference to unionists in the Public Service. Now, the only preference permitted in the Public Service by the late Government was preference to unionists, other things being equal. </para>

The second part of paragraph 2 in the Ministerial manifesto is nothing more nor less than a stab in the back of associated labour. It has always been the practice when privileged parties wished to inflict an injury upon the masses who were struggling for liberty and protection, that they secured a renegade to inflict it. At all times they have endeavoured to use the tools which were most convenient to their hands.

            <para>- I withdraw the phrase altogether, but what I have stated is an historical fact. Nevertheless, I withdraw the expression absolutely so far as it re fers to the Prime Minister. The honorable gentleman will admit that every step in the direction of progress won by the toiling masses has been won after the roadway has been strewn with the corpses of men who succumbed in the struggle for freedom. They had to band themselves together when unionism was unlawful, and that is not so very long ago. There are men living to-day who remember the time when it was unlawful to form a union at all, and when imprisonment was the lot of workers if they were known to be united for the purpose of raising their wages from 9s. per week upwards. They were outlawed. But all the powers of monopoly and vested interests could not keep them down. They rose, not because of the help which they received from the privileged classes, but because they banded themselves into associations, and by so doing were able to help each other, and thus to help the nation. We have reached and passed a period in our history when this Parliament deliberately - Liberals as well as Labour members - supported the principle of allowing an organized body of workmen who felt that they had a grievance access to an Arbitration Court, and of empowering the Judge of that tribunal to determine whether preference should be given to those who brought their plaintefore him. Is there anything unfair in that? If a body of industrial workers choose to go before the Arbitration Court and ask for a judicial decision upon the plaint which they have lodged, is the Judge of that Court to be refused the power to grant them a preference, even though he believes that they are entitled to it? Are these men and women to have no protection at all ? The honorable member for Hume has made an interjection which I did not catch. Is he aware that one of his <inline font-style="italic">confreres</inline> has published the statement, here and elsewhere, that an organization exists in this country to keep men who are free labourers for the purpose of breaking up our industrial unions? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Blackwood</inline> does not deny that fact. But men who are aggrieved will fight for freedom. Is it not a deplorable state of things that agents should be paid to break up industrial organizations, which have done more for the progress of the world than all the Parliaments that ever assembled ? No more severe condemnation of the Government policy could be found than this at- tempt to injure the organized bodies of labour throughout Australia. Paragraph 3 of the Government manifesto relates to the duties of the Inter-State Commission, and with the manner in which the Ministry propose to deal with the question of Protection. It is quite evident that no serious attempt is to be made by the Government to deal with the fiscal issue. It is evident that no effort is to be made by this Government to obtain increased powers for this Parliament, lt is equally evident to every man here, and to the country, that there are certain great industries, primary and other, that could not last for a single year without ample and effective protection on the seaboard of Australia. </para>

            <para>- The sugar industry is one of them. That industry is open to attack from all directions outside Australia, because everywhere outside &#39;this country sugar is produced with the aid of coloured labour, which is the cheapest labour in the world. The sugar industry cannot live in Australia without ample protection at the seaboard. The industry has been developed by white labour in the districts lying on our north-eastern coast, in a way that was not anticipated ten years ago, even by the most sanguine. It is an industry which must depend for its existence upon the good-will of the people of Australia. The  President  of the United States of America, finding it impossible to obtain the powers necessary for the protection of the people&#39;s interests, and the prevention of monopoly, proposes to wipe off the American Tariff duties, and to open the ports of America to free sugar. This Government has, apparently, no intention of asking for larger powers for the Parliament for the prevention of monopoly and the protection of consumers. Does the Government intend to prevent monopoly in Australia by opening the ports of the country to free sugar, thus destroying our great sugar industry? That must follow. In the United States of America the sugar industry is carried on largely with coloured labour, and, therefore, will not be affected so greatly by the loss of Protection as the sugar industry here would be. Were it not for the development brought about by the sugar industry on the north-eastern coast of Australia, we should have to spend hundreds of thou sands of pounds in preparing for the more effective defence of that part, as we are doing in the Northern Territory. </para>

If it is proposed to interfere with the maternity allowance for the purpose of pauperizing recipients, I very much regret it. The social legislation now on the statutebook might well stand as it is, and will bear the test of time. That Australia can well afford to find the money I have no doubt at all. The principle underlying the maternity allowance is that the wolf of poverty should be kept at a considerable distance from the door when the lives of, perhaps, two persons are at stake. I hope that our legislation will not be disturbed, and I speak for every member of my party when I say that it will not be disturbed with our consent. </para>

            <para>- Statements attributed to Ministerial supporters and others. It is my public duty to mention them, so that the people of Australia, and of the world at large, may know what our policy is in this matter. The Minister of Trade and Customs knows that many of the present Ministerial supporters denounced the White Australia policy from A to Z when they were in Opposition, saying that it could never be established effectively. The honorable member for Parkes, for one, would not deny that he did so. He was utterly opposed to the repatriation of the Polynesians and the adoption of the white labour policy in connexion with the sugar industry. He has also condemned the white labour policy generally, time and again. </para>

        <para>The Government propose to abolish the day-labour system in connexion with the construction of public works, and to revert to the contract system. That, I believe, will be a mistake. It will be found difficult to prove that, even in railway construction, the contract system is cheaper than the day-labour system. It may suit or please friends of the Ministry to have the contract system reestablished, but, on the strength of statements made in New South Wales and in Queensland, I say that the Ministry should hesitate before departing from the day-labour system. In an official report by the Queensland Minister of Railways, published last year or the year before - these are not figures prepared by a Labour Government - it was stated that the estimated cost of railways constructed by day labour was &#163;2,135,914, and the amount actually expended only &#163;1,864,562, showing a saving of over &#163;271,352, or a net saving of 12.7 per cent. It has also been stated in the press - though not verified officially - that in New South Wales day labour has proved more economical than contract labour. </para>

            <para>- At any rate, the case against day labour has not been proved, and I hope that no change will be made until it has been justified after a sufficient inquiry. I think that the proposed establishment of a Public&#39; Works Department is a good thing. The late Government did what they could in that matter. It must be remembered that there was no large&#34; expenditure on public works until we took office. Our expenditure was commenced under circumstances of great difficulty, there being no adequate staff; and in my opinion the work was carried on admirably. My recollection is that when the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Eddy</inline> came to New South Wales he asked for &#163;3,000,000 to put the railways into order, and the- Treasurer of the day promised him the money. But there was no staff with which to expend the money efficiently. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Eddy</inline> said that it would take him a year to get a staff to look after the expenditure of &#163;1,000,000. For several years the Commonwealth Public Works Branch was absolutely neglected. During our term of office demands for public works came from every direction. Our expenditure had sometimes to be made at a disadvantage, but, considering the difficulties under which we laboured, I think that our public works were done wonderfully well. There is now a better staff, and better facilities for the construction of public works, than when we assumed office, and I pm sure that honorable members generally are glad that that is so. </para>

        <para>I think we are all agreed that any extension of the old-age pensions will be beneficial, but I hope that the Government will not limit it to providing for the payment of pensions to charitable institutions. The principle underlying our pensions system is that opportunity shall be given to old persons to continue to live in their own homes. That was the desire and aim of those who inaugurated our pensions system. Persons who are unfitted to take care of themselves, and must be cared for iii an institution, are, of course, an exception. So far as they are concerned, no serious objection is to be made to the proposal before us. </para>
        <para>Regarding the proposed alteration of the Audit Act, I have indicated again and again that, in my opinion, the Government ought, for their own convenience, to be allowed to spend money in July on the basis of the appropriation for the previous year. That is a convenience, and is absolutely necessary, having regard to the period at which the term of office of senators expires. </para>

            <para>- I think it is an entire mistake to hold a larger gold reserve than 33 per cent. There should be a statutory reserve of not less than 25 per cent., with a working margin of 33 per cent. I have always held that view, and have no reason to depart from it. The margin I have mentioned is ample, and will become increasingly so. At the present time, probably, the fund is in credit to the extent of about &#163;320,000. That is to say, the earnings are being placed to the credit of a Trust Fund, and so add to the total amount of gold held or invested against the note issue. We have, therefore, every year an increasing reserve, if not in gold, at least in securities equal to gold, and it is most inadvisable at present to alter the Act in the direction mentioned. </para>

            <para>- The Prime Minister evidently refers to the communication which the Governor addressed to the <inline font-style="italic">Times;</inline> but in it he made no such statement. These were mere trifles, like feathers in a whirlwind, and did not seriously affect the question of the stringency of the money market. The greatest compliment ever paid to the Commonwealth was that given by the Opposition when they said that the financial administration of the Labour party had influenced the money markets of the world. The money markets of London, New York, Paris, and Berlin, according to them, were all shaken ! It is worthy of note, in this connexion, that since the present Administration took office the money market has become much tighter. When I opened my speech, I remarked that the peculiar position in regard to the state of parties in this Parliament made it very difficult to carry on the business of the country as it should be carried on. </para>

I believe that the &#34; beat time &#34; policy on the part of the Government is in keeping with the best traditions of all Conservative parties. We cannot blame the Government for doing nothing while they pretend to be doing a great deal ; but their attacks on the social and industrial legislation passed by this Democratic Parliament are wholly unwarranted. The mandate they have received from the country does not justify them. Indeed, they are not in accord with the policy which they put before the people, so far as I have been able to understand it. They contemplate a retrograde step, and if their proposals are given the force of law, they certainly will not prove beneficial to the people. It has been my lot tobe seriously misrepresented regarding the statement I made in 1910 concerning our attitude towards the fiscal question. I said then, clearly and definitely, that if the Commonwealth Parliament had the power to protect the workers as well as the employers, there was no reasonable protection that we would not give to enable the manufacturers of Australia to secure the trade of the Commonwealth. That was a clear and definite statement. We intended to appeal to the people by way of a referendum to give this Parliament larger powers, so that the workers might apply to the Conciliation and Arbitration Court to remedy any injustice under which they considered they were suffering. We did appeal to the electors, first of all in 1911; but our referenda proposals were rejected. At the last general election we made another appeal by way of a referendum, and our proposals were again turned down. In putting our policy before the people, we said that if the powers for which we asked were granted this Parliament, we should, as a party, introduce and pass legislation for the protection of Australian industries; but that, even if they were turned down, we should feel that since we had submitted our referenda proposals on two different occasions, and the people had seen fit to reject them, it would be our duty to endeavour to carry out a fiscal policy consistent with the protection of Australian industries, and the development of the secondary industries of Australia. That was, and is, the policy of our party. We should also lower taxation. I do not agree with the honorable member that it necessarily follows that local production is always dearer than are importations. </para>

            <para>- Any one who views the world&#39;s outlook and the position of Australia and New Zealand to-day must recognise that this country, isolated as it is, is not safe unless it has a large artisan population, and is in every respect practically self-contained. It is, therefore, doubly the duty of this National Parliament to deal with the question. I understand the Prime Minister took exception to a statement I made concerning his attitude towards old-age pensions. I have here a number of quotations from speeches made by him, all of which I shall not read; but those which I shall read should convince him that he has expressed himself very freely on the question. </para>

            <para>- I can assure the honorable member that his admission is worth something to the people of Australia. I have had hundreds of letters from various parts of the country declaring that the Prime Minister stated the contrary, and the press has iterated and reiterated that we were in debt instead of having a surplus, and, owing to his credit and reputation for veracity, the Prime Minister was believed by many people. The Prime Minister will now admit that the late Government did not spend every penny it received or could lay their hands on ? </para>

            <para>- We were the first Government to pay off a deficit left by another Government. The <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> in 1910, said that one of the chief points for the outgoing Fusion party was that the Labour Government would be faced with a deficit of &#163;1,000,000, and the newspaper was anxious to see how the new Government would deal with it. The one hope, consolation, and source of satisfaction on the defeat of that immoral combination of parties for office was the embarrassment which the Labour Government would meet in dealing with the deficit left by their predecessors. </para>

            <para>- It is a large Navy, and has been paid for and provided for out of surplus; and I am sorry to say we find no naval policy in the Ministerial statement. I appeal to the vast majority of the intelligent people of Australia when I say that there is only one policy for the oversea Dominions, especially Australia and New Zealand, and that is the policy of providing first class ships for the defence of these shores. That is a policy which is absolutely necessary for our own protection and for the help of the Mother Country. The policy of the Labour Government in this regard was known from the first, and was laid down definitely and distinctly. It was known to the Imperial authorities long prior to the Conference of 1909, when Australia was represented by  Colonel Foxton.  The policy of the Labour Government is, I believe, the policy of the people of Australia. </para>

            <para>- What have I done to honorable members opposite that they should interject so much? The Liberal Government were too&#34; big &#39; &#39; to start with a mosquito Fleet - too big to start in a small way - and, therefore, they adopted the usual course of the party, and never started at all. The objection of honorable members opposite is not because of the size of the ships, but because of our having started to make adequate provision for Australian defence. No one more than the Prime Minister objected furiously to our doing anything of the kind, and he came to an agreement with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> and the Liberals, with the result that immediately the House met the Labour Government were challenged, without any opportunity being afforded to discuss our policy. The Liberals desired to follow the lead of New Zealand and present a battleship to the Mother Country. </para>

            <para>- Happily, the Mother Country did not need any such gift, because it was in a position to build as many ships as it required at the time. All the Mother Country desired was to know the position of the Dominions in regard to their own general defences and the defences of the Empire. We made it perfectly clear what the policy of the Labour Government was, and we have seen no reason to vary it. If New Zealand presented a ship, the Mother Country had to man it; and that is a most material point. Canada finds it difficult to man the war-ships on her shores. Australia is the only Dominion in the Empire whose sons have offered themselves in larger numbers than are required to man the Fleet. The Old Country is in greater need of men to man the ships than it is of money to build the ships, and Australia will be a powerful auxiliary in time of need. The proposal of the Labour Government, as submitted by myself to the country, that  there should be another sister battleship on these shores, is not, in my opinion, an extreme, but, rather, a modest policy highly desirable to meet our immediate needs. If there is any great delay, or any delay whatever, in the continuance of the defence policy of the Labour Government, we may live to regret it. I am not one to proclaim the dangers of war, but prefer to proclaim the virtues of peace. However, viewing things as we see them in every part of the world today, and especially viewing our situation, together with that of New Zealand, in the South Pacific, isolated from all European populations, we are in duty bound to take such steps, both as regards the sacrifice of revenue and demand on the services of the sons of Australia, as are necessary to provide for our adequate sea defence, irrespective of all other considerations. These are all the matters with which I propose to deal at the present time. There will be ample opportunity for me to touch upon other questions later on. But, as no policy has been put before us of a character which can commend itself to a democratic community like that of Australia, which desires progress and will not countenance a policy of retrogression, I have a duty to perform before I resume my seat. This is a young Parliament and a young country - a country endowed with an abundance of latent wealth, and one which only needs a lead. Had Governments like the present occupied the Treasury benches in the past, we should have had nothing in the nature of development and nothing of a national character. For these reasons, and also in view of the fact that the policy outlined by the Ministry is not in accordance with the pledges made by them, I beg to move - </para>

          <para>- Nobody can take exception to a request of the character which has been preferred by the Prime Minister, although it has come a little early during the debate. I presume that there will be a debate upon the amendment, and if we were only granted an extension of the principle underlying my honorable friend&#39;s suggestion, we could secure agreement upon all points. There is one matter that I should like to mention, namely, that I think this Commonwealth is largely the host of a party which is about to visit this country from oversea, where a number of Australians were hospitably entertained some time  ago. In these circumstances, I think that an arrangement might be made whereby we could show our visitors that hospitality which we should like to extend to them, and with that end in view I would suggest that an equal number of honorable members from both parties in this House might be relieved from their attendance here. It seems to me that that would meet the case as far as it is practicable to meet it. </para>

            <para>- Seeing the precarious position which the Prime Minister occupies, I withdraw the remark. Probably the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs will tell me why, in a place like Kalgoorlie, where there is no other calling to which they can turn their hands, 200 or 250 men have been thrown out of their employment ? This question of providing rolling-stock in order to enable the rails to be laid on the earthwork which has already been prepared is a very serious one. The earthwork at the Kalgoorlie end of the trans-Australian railway has been completed for a distance of 60 miles; but the rails have been laid for less than 10 miles. It has been found impossible to convey the rails further on the trolleys which have hitherto been used, and which have had to be drawn by horses. The necessity of providing waggons to convey rails to the head of the road is a very pressing one, and is a matter of urgent importance to the men who have been employed upon the work. I do say that an explanation should be forthcoming as to why rolling-stock is overdue in connexion with the contract which was let  some  time ago to a Sydney firm. If that explanation be, not satisfactory, the firm in question should be compelled to fulfil their obligations or to pay the penalty. </para>

          <para>.- The honorable member for Kalgoorlie has given me a line. I have already asked the Government why it has taken certain action in regard to the Fitzroy Dock. The  Prime Minister has attacked the Administration of the Fisher Government, saying that, in taking over the Fitzroy Dock, it did something wrong. I have called for the papers, and I wish to know whether the Prime Minister has in his possession evidence which justifies his charge that the Fisher Government spent &#163;800,000 wrongfully in taking over property that was not worth that amount of money? Can he justify his statement? If not, why did he make it? The present Government have sent officials to make au examination of the boilers in the establishment. They have sent an officer to the Dock, and the result has been to throw the whole place into a state of disorder. The honorable member for Kalgoorlie has referred to a matter affecting 100 or 200 persons; but the matter about which I am speaking affects, perhaps, 1,200 persons. A great number of men have been thrown out of employment for a week or a fortnight by this Administration&#39;s lack of ability to control the officers under it. A property has been taken over, valued at between &#163;700,000 and &#163;800,000, and the Government, before it has had time to obtain information as to the real value of the property, or to know the officers under its control, has dismissed a number of the Dock employes. The Prime Minister has made most pronounced charges against the late Administration. I wish to know why a close investigation into the condition of affairs at Cockatoo Island was not made before thousands of men were thrown out of work? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Julius</inline> never examined a boiler at the Dock, but on his report the Government is closing the establishment. Men of technical training, instead of doing that, would have taken out the boilers two at a time, replacing those that were good, and discarding those that were bad. But this Government, on the mere report of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Julius,</inline> has closed down the whole place. There is something needing reform in administration like that. I ask, first, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Julius&#39;</inline> report be laid upon the table; and, secondly, that the Minister of Defence shall get the Dock into perfect working order. If this cannot be done, the Government is ineffective for its work, and the sooner it goes out the better. </para>

          <para>.- I wish to know from the Postmaster-General if it is true that men in the Construction Branch of his Department in Queensland are to have their wages reduced by a shilling a day. A statement has been made that the Minister has given instructions that that reduction shall take place, but no reason for it has been given. I understand that there has been&#39; no similar reduction in any of the other States. The men feel that they are being deprived of money to which they are justly entitled. It is not known whether the step has been taken for some political purpose, but that is the feeling in Queensland. The men, previous to the reduction, were receiving  only the wages paid in the other States, and it is difficult, therefore, to know why the reduction should be made. I hope that the Postmaster-General will give their case consideration, and I am sure that after making full inquiries he will direct that they shall receive what they were getting up to the beginning of last month. I trust that he will deal generously with them. </para>

          <para>.- Several men waited on me in Brisbane, saying that they had been told that they were to be discharged, but that those who applied, would be re-engaged next day at ls. a day less than they had been receiving. If it is the policy of the Cook Government to reduce wages, the sooner the country knows it the better. I at once saw the  Deputy  . Postmaster-General for the State, who said that he could give me no information publicly, and suggested that I should wire to Melbourne. I sent a telegram to the PostmasterGeneral, asking whether it was a Ministerial instruction that the wages of these men should be reduced by ls. a day, but a more Jesuitical reply than that which was returned I have never received since I have been in Parliament. The Postmaster-General did not answer my question, but fenced it like an old warrior. Knowing him as I do, I feel sure that the reply was dictated by an official, but having signed it, the Minister is responsible, and he it is whom I am attacking. I ask him now, if he were receiving only 9s. a day with which to keep a home over his head, maintain his wife, and bring up five children, paying 16s. a week for rent, he would like to have his wages reduced by ls. a day, or 6s. a week. I did not expect a levelling down of wages by the Prime Minister, whose vote in this Chamber has always been given for a levelling up, and I ask the Postmaster-General in all seriousness if he intends to do this paltry thing. He is robbing these labouring men of ls. a day, which they have been receiving for the last eighteen months. It is of no use to fence the question. Directly the new Government came in, the wages of these men were reduced by ls. a day. I appeal to the Government to restore to these men the ls. per day that has been taken from them, so that they may not go down to posterity as a Ministry who took ls. a day off the wages of the lower paid men, while the highly paid officials - the curled darlings of the service - were left by them untouched. No one knows better than &#60;does the Prime Minister what ls. a day means to a working man, and this taking of ls. a day from the wages of working men is the last act of which I thought he would ever be guilty. </para>

          <para>.- I have never known the Prime Minister to do anything in this House to increase the rates of wages of the men in, at all events, the lower grades of the service ; but I have certainly heard him talk about the matter. The only time when he did anything in the interests of the poorerpaid classes was when he was leader of the Labour party in New South Wales, but since he has joined the capitalistic section of the community - since he is the leader of the capitalistic section of this House - we cannot expect from him anything else than an order to reduce the wages of workers by1s. per day whereever that can be done. We shall have, however, another opportunity to consider the honorable member&#39;s attitude towards the working classes of Australia. I rose more particularly, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> to ask you to reconsider the question raised today as to the publication in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of questions that are asked, but not answered, in the House.

          <para>.- I Wish to add my protest to that which has been made against the practice of leaving out of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> a record of something that transpires in the House. Yesterday I asked a series of questions in regard to the electoral inquiry. A number of those questions were answered, but one, which the Minister did not answer, was omitted from the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report of the proceedings, so that the sequence of these questions was interfered with. The report, therefore, is not a true record of what transpired. I found when I received my proof this morning that this onequestion had been left out, although its omission interfered with the sense of the other questions. I submit, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> that when a series of questions is addressed to a Minister we do not get a true record of what transpires if one of that series is not recorded in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> merely because it is not answered. If an awkward question is asked, and a Minister declines to answer it, there is no record of it. It seems to me that that is an altogether anomalous position. I have consulted the ex-Speaker, and understand from him that he was not aware that the practice of eliminating from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> questions that are unanswered was being followed. </para>

        <para>As to the matter mentioned by the honorable member for Dalley, I wish to add my protest against the discharge of a very large number of workmen from the Fitzroy Dock, owing, it now transpires, to a mistake on the part of the Government. The present Administration has done what I have never known to be done by any other Government. As soon as they took office each member of the Ministry went about like the man with the muck-rake in <inline font-style="italic">Pilgrim&#39;s Progress,</inline> raking over every little matter in the various Departments in the hope that the attitude of his political opponents, might be placed before the country in an unfavorable light. In pursuance of this muck-rake policy it appears that agents of the Government went to the Fitzroy Dock to see if they could not find there something about which they could make a noise. The statement went forth that a number of boilers in use there were a danger to the persons employed at the dock. The statement appeared to be ridiculous on the face of it. </para>

            <para>- Of the honorable gentleman&#39;s Government. It was stated that these boilers were unfit for use, but we know that the boilers in all these large establishments are tested periodically. In the circumstances, it was simply a lot of nonsense to say that a competent manager in charge of the great works at Cockatoo Island would allow boilers to be used that were likely to burst and blow the whole place up. One of the members of the Government wired over to stop the works. They were precipitately stopped, and a number of the men were, if not permanently sacked, suspended from their work. Almost immediately it was discovered that a huge blunder had been made. Nothing wrong could be found, and an attempt has been made to start the works again. The men suspended from work were paid for two days they lost, and, as a result of the blunder made by the Government, a large number of men have been paid two days&#39; wages for which the Commonwealth has received no return. The honorable member who represents the district has stated that as a result of the action taken the work of an establishment in which 1,200 men were employed was interrupted, and he informs me that 400 of these men are now out of work. They are not being paid, whilst the members of the Government go round scandal-seeking in the different Departments to see if they can discover something upon which they may base a complaint against the late Government. This is only political engineering on their part. </para>

        <para>Only to-day we found the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs anxious to charge his predecessor with some  derelicton  of duty because an officer of the Department has commenced the erection of a building at the Federal Capital out of its proper alignment. One would suppose that it was the duty of the ex-Minister of Home Affairs to go to the Federal Capital to determine the exact spot on which the building was to be erected, and drive in the pegs himself. The Assistant Minister for Home Affairs knows perfectly well that the Minister has nothing to do with the alignment of public buildings. He has responsible and wellpaid officers, whose duty it is to transact such business. Yet, in order to blacken and misrepresent political opponents, it was suggested here this afternoon that the ex-Minister of Home Affairs, in his official capacity, was in some measure responsible for the improper alignment of the building referred to. If there are officers in our Departments who, by their carelessness, leave Ministers open to charges of that kind, it is clear that they are unfit for their position. We should know who they are, and the extent of the dereliction of their duty. </para>
        <para>In connexion  with  the reduction of wages at Brisbane, I wish to add my protest against the course which has been taken there. I understood from the present Prime Minister, when on this side, that he would take advantage of every opportunity afforded him to improve wages and conditions. It is true that all I know of the honorable gentleman in that regard is what he has said. I do not know of anything which her has done in that direction. I know that when he was Postmaster-General of New South Wales very low wages ruled in the Department. I know that the wages have been considerably increased since Federation, and particularly from the time the Labour Government took charge of the Post Office. I hope the protest made here this afternoon will lead to a correction of the policy of the </para>
        <para class="block">Government in reducing wages, and that we shall have some evidence chat the Prime Minister is prepared to carry out the views he expressed when in Opposition with regard to the improvement of wages and conditions of public servants. The honorable gentleman has the opportunity afforded him now, and I hope we shall see the reductions of wages stopped, and the honorable gentleman&#39;s expressed desire for the improvement of wages and conditions given effect to. </para>

Who began to make this railway before they were ready to make it? Who have been dragging rails and sleepers 10 miles on a cart with all sorts of uptodate machinery to do this business lying idle? Whose is the fault? Is it ours? It is the fault of those men who went before us; but ft seems we are to be blamed for all this Ministerial ineptitude. </para>

            <para>- I will try to get the honorable member the name. These reports have been made, not on our initiation, but on the initiation of the previous Government. They showed that the boilers were dangerous, and, for the safety of the men, the Naval Board, on the strength of these reports, advised the Minister to close them down until they were repaired. I will give the honorable member all the information he wants. He need not bandy words. He shall have all the papers, and all the facts. And when he gets them he will 1&#93;Ot like them. In the other case, they will prove that all this kind of thing has been going on, that the men have been working at the imminent danger of their lives, under the administration of our predecessors. I think it is going beyond the length of fair debate when honorable members make these reckless statements that we appointed agents to go to the Dock in order to stir up trouble. </para>

            <para>- It was said that we had appointed agents to make trouble in the Dock. That is the only statement I am combating, and I say that what has occurred in the Dock has occurred in consequence of a report by an officer appointed by our predecessors. That officer reported to the Minister, and the Naval Board, on the strength of the report, advised the Minister as to the course of procedure. That course has been followed in all cases. </para>

            <para>- I withdraw my statement. We are doing our best to repair these difficulties, and to purchase new boilers, and to get these works going to the fullest capacity, and we are doing it with only one end in view - to get forward the work already in course of construction, to get forward those ships which are years overdue, and to keep the men in  employment to the fullest possible extent. But when responsible officers say that it is dangerous for men to work, the honorable member must not expect us, for the purpose of keeping them in work, to jeopardize their lives. We will not take that responsibility. Anything that will remedy these defects shall be undertaken at the earliest possible moment. Every effort is being made to repair the troubles which have been shown to exist at the Dock, and I hope it may soon be that all these men will be at work again, and under the best possible conditions. </para>
