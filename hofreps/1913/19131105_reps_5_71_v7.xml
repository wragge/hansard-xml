                        <para>- It is not proposed to hand over, to a private company, all matters in connexion with refrigeration in the Northern Territory. There is already refrigerating accommodation there. I think that the honorable member, in asking the question, had in his mind the freezing works the establishment of which was contemplated by the last Government. As I said last week, I have been considering the possibility of having such works established by private enterprise. On the facts before me, I do not think that we would be justified in carrying out the works at the public expense, at all events at the present time. </para>

                        <para>- I have received no communications recently. The last intimation we had was from Victoria to the effect that if the other States were agreeable, that State would join. South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania were, I think, inclined to send exhibits, but they would not share in the financial responsibility. New South Wales was, I think, rather inclined to join, but I have not heard further to that effect. I believe that the visit of our American cousins has had the result that what was a possibility has become a probability, namely, that there will be concert between the States and the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- Then I rise to a question of privilege, and shall conclude with a motion. It would not have taken a moment more to ask the question, but, of course, if there is a desire to evade the question, that is another thing. The question concerns the passing of a certain Bill in this Chamber ; and I think it is just as well we should know exactly where we are in relation to it. Last week a Bill was introduced and passed. </para>

We have other clauses dealing with the duty of authorised witnesses, the issue of certificates and ballot-papers in connexion with the postal vote, the inspection of applications for the postal vote, the numbering of applications and certificates dealing with the postal vote, the initialing of postal ballot-papers, the duty of the Returning Officer to notify the issue of postal vote certificates and postal ballot-papers, and directions for postal voting, these occupying fully a page. Another page deals with the duty of an authorized witness, and with the duty of persons present when an elector votes by post, also with the preliminary scrutiny of postal ballot-papers. We have on still another page clauses dealing with the counting of postal ballot-papers, with the " review of decision," and with mistakes that may be made in connexion with the postal ballot-papers. You know very well, sir, that it is the practice of this House to prevent any anticipatory discussion on a Bill or motion. We need not refer to the practice of the House of Commons, because we have both practice and traditions of our own. We have had experience in matters of this kind extending over twelve years. The other day you ruled out a motion having reference to the Tasmania grant on the ground that there was a motion already on the notice-paper dealing with that matter. I would not like it to happen that we should forget our practice. Owing to the excitement which has permeated the political atmosphere for the past week - I do not think that you will be at all disturbed - but we may be, because we are only human, and it is possible that there may be a little mental disturbance or storm preventing us from arriving at a decision as cool as that at which we might arrive in other circumstances. But I hope, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> that you will see your way clear to carry out the practice of this House, which I venture to submit is that an honorable member should not be allowed to anticipate a discussion on business that is on the paper. The Bill which the honorable gentleman proposes to introduce covers the whole of the ground which I have just set out and which is embodied in the Order of the Day No. 6 - the Electoral Bill of 1913. The mere fact that any particular party has a majority does not justify this riding rough-shod over the practice of Parliament. The absence of a member of the Opposition is not a reason why we should abandon the political - I shall not say " game," because I do not like the word - but political procedure.

If the Electoral Bill were out of the way, the Prime Minister would be in order in introducing this measure, and to put it in order he should move that Order of the Day No. 6 be discharged from the business-paper. He could move its restoration after the Postal Voting Restoration Bill had been dealt with. I would point out to you the disadvantage that might follow the adoption of the course now proposed by the Government.

An honorable member might very well say, " I shall attend a week hence in my place in Parliament, because the Electoral Bill, which provides for voting by post, will not be further discussed until then." I submit that this Bill is not, and cannot be, in order until the Electoral Bill dealing with the question of the postal vote has been disposed of, and that the Prime Minister cannot properly proceed further with it. </para>

                            <para>- Order. I hope that the proceedings of the House will be conducted in an orderly way, and that an honorable member, no matter on what side he may sit, will be permitted to speak without unseemly interruption. I do not propose to allow interruptions to go to the length to which they have gone, and I refrained from taking extreme measures in the hope that the better sense of honorable members would soon prevail. I intimate to the House now, that honorable members must be heard in silence, or as nearly as possible in silence. Reasonable interruptions now and again will not be objected to, but anything in the nature of disorder or continuous or repeated interruptions will not be permitted. </para>

If there be one thing more than another to which this Government pledged itself at the last election, it was the restoration of postal voting, and it is in accordance with that pledge, reiterated from every platform in the country, that this effort is now being made. I do not intend to debate this matter to-day. If there be one question that is already threadbare, it is that of the postal vote. There was not one speech made in this House during the lengthy debate on the larger measure in which the question was not discussed and re-discussed. I do not think any member in the House can throw any new light upon the subject or break any new ground. </para>

                    <para>.- I think we might get a more appropriate title for the Bill if we had a little time to consider it. There are two main objections, of course, to the postal voting principle, and the first and most important is the possibility of doing away with the secrecy of the ballot. </para>

                        <para>-  In an ordinary sense, the Attorney-General is correct in saying that all we can do is, in the event of amendments being made in the clauses, to change the title in order to bring it into consonance with the amendments made. But we must not merely take what is on the face of the Bill as covering the scope of the Bill, because it goes much further. The Bill provides that certain postal votes are to be restored ; but it goes further, and gives power to the Government to make certain regulations, and contains a number of clauses which are covered under the principal Act. I maintain that the honorable member for Maribyrnong is quite in order, if he so desires, in discussing all those provisions in the principal Act which this particular clause seeks to re-enact. </para>

A measure of this kind requires the very closest attention, because on our Electoral Act depends whether we obtain a true reflex of the opinions of the people. If the community are allowed every possible facility to exercise the franchise without let or hindrance from others who may or may not possess influence over them, the more likely we shall be to have a Parliament in consonance with the feelings and aspirations of the people. </para>

The real title remains unaltered; and, therefore, nothing is gained by the honorable member, either in the way of widening the discussion or the power of amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - No objection can lie to the proposal of the honorable member for Maribyrnong. An objection to an alteration of the title might lie in the nature of so restricting debate as to prevent giving effect to the order of leave itself. The order of leave is to restore the provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1902-9 with respect to voting by post. Therefore, this is an amendment of the Electoral Act and is -an Electoral Act Amendment Bill. While the amendment does not seem relatively important, I see no reason why it should not be agreed to, and I see no practical disadvantage that will follow, so far as debate is concerned, but I submit that where discussion is limited there should be very good reasons why an amendment of this sort should not be allowed. The title is inserted for a special purpose, which is quite apart from the matter - it is merely a placard - and the honorable member for Maribyrnong very properly takes exception to that, a,nd seeks to have the title of the Bill changed to "an amendment of the electoral law." This really is a mere amendment Bill, like dozens of measures which have been introduced relative to the electoral law, and they have all been introduced under the generic term " to amend the electoral law." This is the first time in our history on which an attempt has been made to introduce a similar Bill other than under that designation. The reason for the change in the title is wholly unconnected with the thing itself, but has a party complexion that is so obvious that nothing is necessary to emphasize it. The amendment may be agreed to, and then we may discuss this measure for what it really is - an amendment of the electoral law. </para>

                    <para>.- I always have much pleasure in accepting the advice of the Attorney-General when I think it ought to be followed, but, in the present circumstances, I do not think the honorable gentleman is assisting the Committee. From his long experience at the Bar, and in a State House, he should be able to assist us, but, so far, he has not helped us much. Now he says  ' Pass this clause as it is, and when you come to the title you can alter it." But we can only do so by a certain process. The Standing Orders say that a decision in Committee cannot be reversed in the same Committee. </para>

                        <para>- I am surprised at the Attorney-General trying to side-track the Committee. He should be satisfied with getting the second reading through so expeditiously, without trying to get this clause through by a subterfuge. </para>

                        <para>- If we pass this clause the honorable member for Maribyrnong has no possible chance of getting his amendment agreed to unless the Bill is recommitted. The very remarks of the Attorney- General show how necessary it is to have full and free discussion, and I hope I may be permitted to make a few remarks about the title with which it is proposed to christen this Bill. I object to the title suggested by the honorable member for Maribyrnong. The honorable member must be aware that there is already a Bill on the notice-paper that will need the title of " Electoral Act of 1913." I would call this " a Bill to permit the manipulation of postal ballot-papers." </para>

                        <para>- I was coming to that. We should give the Bill a proper name, and I shall give some reasons why we should give it a name which is not a mere colourless thing such as that suggested by the honorable member for Maribyrnong, which does not convey the idea at all. What we should do with this measure is to indicate to the general public, as far as its name will permit us to do so, what is the political game of the Attorney-General. </para>

                        <para>- That is a very good expression. The Bill should on its face describe what it means to the Attorney-General and his party, and I submit we can show that best by giving it its proper name. I give notice of a further amendment, " That the Bill be called ' a Bill to enable the Attorney- General and his colleagues of the Liberal Association to manipulate postal ballot-papers.' " </para>

                        <para>- The Labour party have been abused, in both their public and private capacities, as being opposed to the sick having power to vote. The Government have professed a particular care for the sick and the invalid, and have wept crocodile tears from every platform over the poor sick, who cannot go to the polls. They now appear to be ashamed of their own professions. I strongly support the suggestion made by the honorable member for Capricornia, and, if I were in order, I would suggest that this Bill seeks to encourage impure elections, and that it will lead to the corruption of the voting system. </para>

                        <para>- Even when considering the short title to the Bill we cannot shut our eyes to the object at which it aims, and I wonder how far the Government are prepared to go in the matter of providing postal voting facilities for the sick and the invalid. I submit that there are good reasons - reasons advanced by the Government themselves, and reiterated a thousand times by the Prime Minister himself - for making this Bill what it professes to be - a Bill to provide for voting by post on the part of only the sick and the invalid. What right has any other section of the community to special facilities for voting away from the polling booth? </para>

                        <para>- I am anxious that this Bill shall be what it pretends to be. In this Parliament, we set a standard, perhaps, for the people of the world. We have provided that goods manufactured in this country shall be true to name. We have officers in our Customs Houses, and all over the. country, whose duty it is, to try to guarantee to the public that the goods they buy will be true to the trade description or label on them. </para>

This is not a Bill to provide postal voting facilities for only the sick and the invalid; but if the Prime Minister will give me his assurance now that it will be made to apply only to that section of the community, he will remove much of my objection to it. </para>

                        <para>- I am in favour of some other Bill, believing that the electoral law needs to be amended. I ask that we shall be honest, truthful, and fair about this matter. The honorable member for Bourke proposes to give to the Bill a designation that will meet the views of every honorable member. There is a certain proportion of the people of the Commonwealth - too large a proportion, in my opinion - who, by reason of sickness or invalidity, are unable to go to the polls and record their votes; and, for their sakes, we ought to make some extra and very special provision. This Bill, however, does not propose to do that, and it is because I believe that it should do so that I support the amendment. </para>

The honorable gentleman has thought fit to make a statement in regard to myself which is quite inaccurate and irrelevant, and which ought not to have been allowed. I take this opportunity of stating that what he said in regard to me is not warranted by the facts. Leaving the honorable gentleman alone, because to fight with him on equal terms is impossible, since, directly any one is able to say anything to which he takes exception, he will move that the question be now put, I wish to say, on behalf of myself and every one on this side, that he shall not put us in the position in which he desires, and which he has no right to do. He shall not hold us up to the country as being opposed to voting by post on the part of the sick and the invalid. We are not, and never have been. </para>

                        <para>- Very well, sir, I shall say no more about that matter. I have made our position clear. The amendment proposes to limit the scope of the Bill so that it will provide for postal voting for the sick and the invalid, and I believe that will meet every legitimate requirement in this connexion. If it be agreed to, consequential amendments must be made in the Bill. I shall be glad to learn upon what ground the amendment is opposed by the Government. This is a Bill which proposes to amend the existing law in this particular alone. It leaves the law in respect to absent voting as it is. Under the law of 1909, voting by post extended to persons other than those who were sick. Under sub-section <inline font-style="italic">a,</inline> section 109 - </para>

                        <para>- The Attorney-General took exception to the amendment of the short title when it extended the scope of the Bill, and takes exception to it now when it restricts the scope of the Bill. He wants the short title as a placard. What possible exception can he take to the proposal ? If he takes exception to it, he takes exception to a proposal that it shall extend only to the invalid and sick, when, as a matter of fact, under the existing law, and as the law will be if this measure is incorporated in the present law, an absent voter will be able to vote at any booth throughout the Commonwealth. What additional facilities does he want under sub-section <inline font-style="italic">al</inline> I hope that the honorable member will see that, restricted as we are by the scope of this measure, such an amendment is legitimate and proper. If he intends that the postal vote should extend to persons other than the sick and invalid, let him say so, so that we and the country will know exactly what the Government propose; but we were certainly under the impression that the gravamen of the charge against this party was that they had taken from the sick women, the mothers of this country, opportunities for voting. That is not true. We are perfectly willing that they should vote ; but we are not willing that the measure should be used as a cover for other things. </para>

                        <para>- The short title cannot be taken as any direction. The proper place, if any, for substantive amendments, is clause 2. It will be quite open, on that clause, for honorable members to move any amendment of any section contained in the voting by post provisions in the Electoral Acts of 1902 to 1909. If honorable members can formulate a scheme for enabling, not merely infirm and sick people, but old people, and people who are far removed from any polling booth to vote - and now is the time to do it - it shall have full consideration by the Government. I invite them to do it; but they cannot do it on this clause. </para>

                    <para>.- Your remarks, sir, almost make me ask, " What is in a name?" In this case there happens to be plenty in a name, because the short title was carefully thought out by the Government after their defeat last week. They have evidently submitted this scheme in the belief that they will thereby impress the public that they are giving effect to their platform pledges, and restoring to some persons the vote that they allege was taken away from them. The measure will be cited by the short title, and honorable members are, therefore, justified in taking exception to it. At the same time, we ask that the <inline font-style="italic">bona -fides</inline> of the Government side of the House may be more clearly shown to the public. </para>

                        <para>- That is a new suggestion. A very much better method would have been to allow members to express in general terms their opinions on the second reading. We should then have been able to arrive at a satisfactory, agreement as to what ought to be in the Bill, but the attitude of the Government has prevented that discussion, which is essential upon a matter of such importance. The blood be therefore on their own heads. They must take the consequences. The Bill is exceptionally complicated, although only one specific clause is brought in, in order, apparently, to prevent discussion and criticism and successful amendment as far as possible, even in the direction in which the Government allege that they are prepared to consider amendments. Any member who attempts to amend this clause will find himself in difficulties at once. Amendments will have to be framed with exceptional care to fit in with the various Acts. If there is any reality in the suggestion of the Attorney-General that we should suggest amendments- </para>

                        <para>- That was when the Ministry changed their mind. We have had it since that moment, and have been "  gagged  " in the consideration of it. If there is an atom of genuineness in  the honorable  gentleman's suggestion that he will consider amendments of this clause, the discussion ought to be adjourned forthwith, to enable honorable members to frame them. The; Attorney-General said he had never heard the short title of a Bill discussed, but the whole of these proceedings are different from what generally characterize Parliaments, and therefore some little latitude is essential. There are ten lawyers on the other side of the Committee, but if they went into the Ministerial room they could not in two hours return with an amendment of this clause. If the Ministry are genuine in their assertion that they will consider amendments to allow sick and invalid persons to vote, they will accept the amendment now suggested. The duty will then fall upon them of" framing the measure in accordance with the short title. It would take the Law Department a couple of days to do it, but they cannot expect honorable members on this side to do it while discussion is proceeding. If they are not genuine they will oppose the amendment, and we shall understand more clearly where weare. </para>

                    (Bourke) [5.5J.- The Attorney-General said he was quite prepared to consider amendments. I want to restrict voting by post to the sick and invalid. The Bill proposes not merely to give the vote to persons who are sick and invalid, but to practically every man and woman throughout Australia, if they so desire, to exercise the right of voting by post. It is quite possible to establish safeguards in regard to the voting of persons who are sick, but not in regard to those who may declare that on election day they will be 5 miles away from a polling place.

                        <para>- I have looked at the clause, and fail to see where I can move the amendment that I desire to move. I could move the excision of certain words. For instance, there is the provision for the person who believes that he will on polling day be more than 5 miles from a polling place. I could move to excise those words, but in doing so I should be taking away an existing right, and in supporting the amendment honorable members would be in the position of seeking to deprive certain electors of the right to vote, a position in which they ought not to be placed. </para>

                        <para>- I shall deal with that presently. If we look at the Standing Orders of the United States House of Representatives, as shown in the <inline font-style="italic">House Manual Digest,</inline> we find it laid down that the  Speaker  shall not be required to vote in ordinary legislative proceedings, except where his vote would be decisive, or when the House is engaged in voting by ballot; and that in all cases of a " tie " vote, the question shall be lost. Here, again, we see, even in the United States, where they have full power to frame their own Standing Orders, that it is not desired that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> shall have a vote ; and that, while he is permitted to have a vote, in all cases where there is a " tie " the question is lost. Again, to show how the question may be further dealt with, let us look for a moment at what took place at the time our Constitution was being framed. The Federal Convention held in Sydney in 1897 discussed proposed clause 39, now section 40, of the Constitution. The clause, as it was before that Convention, was - </para>

                    <para>It is not only possible, but it has actually occurred in the Victorian Assembly, that a proposed amendment of the Constitution that was considered by one Chamber, at all events, to require an absolute majority, did not have that absolute majority by one vote. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> had been allowed to vote in that case the vote would have been given. It seems a hard case that the State for which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> is returned should be deprived of his vote when the clause of the Constitution provides that an amendment of the Constitution cannot be carried unless it has an absolute majority of the Senate, and an absolute majority of the House of Representatives. </para>

I do not know that it really means that the State is disfranchised. . The  Speaker  represents an electorate in the National Assembly in the same way as the  Speaker  in this Legislative Assembly represents an electorate in the  representative and popular Chamber. If there is a question of the amendment of the Constitution here or in the Lower House of any one of the Parliaments of the Colonies, the  Speaker  is not entitled to any other vote than a casting vote. </para>

                        <para>- I think the High Court has more to do than merely interpret the Acts we pass. It has to interpret the Constitution under which we work, and the very moment we do anything unconstitutional, it is open, I believe, to any citizen to take action to bring the matter before the High Court. I do not altogether approve of that. My opinion is that the House should be the highest authority and tribunal in the land, and that no High Court should have the right to undo anything we have done here; but, unfortunately, that is not the position. I have been asked whether I have recorded my vote in Committee when  Speaker.  I did so on one occasion, and my vote was never challenged. The present  Speaker  also recorded his vote in Committee the other day, and it was not challenged. It was only afterwards that some began to consider whether it was right for him to do so; and I may have gone on doing it because I did not know that I was doing anything wrong at the time; but I have now come to the conclusion that it is not the correct thing for the  Speaker  to do so, because the Constitution clearly and definitely lays it down, in section 40, that the  Speaker  shall have no other than a casting vote. </para>

                    <para>. - Before you state your decision, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> as I am personally involved, I should like to address myself briefly to this question. I think that the honorable member for Kennedy has but exercised his right as a member of this House in challenging my action in respect to exercising my right to vote in Committee; but the grounds upon which he relies cannot be supported, so far as I am aware, by any authority, or by any evidence of parliamentary procedure that we have. By way of illustration, I would ask the honorable member whether he would deny the right of a member who occupied the position of  Speaker  of the House to take part in a discussion or to vote on his own Estimates in Committee? </para>

                        <para>- Unless the honorable member is prepared to do so, all his arguments must fall to the ground ; but I have never known such a right to be denied before. I think we may well set aside the United States of America authorities quoted, as well as others which have no binding authority on our procedure, and come at once to the point. There is no standing order of our own which precludes the  Speaker  from speaking and voting in Committee. If the  Speaker  of the House cannot, in Committee, exercise his vote as a private member representing a constituency, then it naturally follows that the  Chairman  of Committees cannot record his vote in the House as a private member on account of his position as  Chairman  of Committees, which is analogous to that of  Speaker  in the House, as the Presiding Officer over the proceedings. Yet the  Chairman  of Committees has frequently done so without his right being questioned. We have a special standing order giving only a casting vote to the  Speaker  in the House, and a casting vote only to the  Chairman  in Committee. If the argument applies in the one case, it must apply equally in the other. And if the contention of the honorable member for Kennedy were valid, the  Chairman  could not give a vote as a private member in the House itself. But I do not know of. an instance in which a vote given in the House by the honorable member for Perth, who is  Chairman  of Committees, has been challenged. Our Standing Orders provide that in the case of an equality of votes in the House the  Speaker  shall have a casting vote; and that in the case of an equality of votes in Committee the  Chairman  shall have a casting vote ; but that the  Chairman  shall not have a vote other than a casting vote in Committee, any more than the  Speaker  can have a vote other than a casting vote in the House. The point is that, when the vote in question was taken, we were in a Committee of the whole, and not in the House; and, therefore, I exercised my clear right to vote, not as  Speaker,  but as the member for Lang. As the member for Lang, I can no more be deprived of my right to vote in Committee than can any other honorable member. I vote in Committee, on ordinary business, not as  Speaker,  but in my capacity as the member for Lang. I am rather surprised that an honorable member with the honorable member for Kennedy's experience should have raised a point of this kind. Section 40 of the Constitution provides that - </para>

                <para class="block">That is the practice I have followed in the House. But the House has resolved itself into Committee, and I have voted in Committee as the member for Lang, and, as honorable members are well aware, the  Speaker,  in Committee, does not take the Chair, and consequently cannot by any possibility give a casting vote in Committee. Our Standing Orders recognise the distinction between the House and the Committee of the whole by providing for the Speaker's chair being vacated, and a  Chairman  to preside and report from time to time to the House. The House would not report to itself. The honorable member for Kennedy has quoted a number of authorities from <inline font-style="italic">May;</inline> but the particular authority that really does bear upon this question has not been quoted by him.  His  authorities have dealt with the Speaker's vote, not in Committee, but in the House. He will find the matter set out at page 368 of the 11th edition of <inline font-style="italic">May,</inline> where the position of the  Speaker  when speaking in Committee is dealt with. I am surprised that the honorable member has, with all his experience, overlooked it. <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> says - </para>

On 17th December, 1790, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> argued at length the question  of the abatement of an impeachment, by a dissolution of Parliament, and cited a long list of precedents. On the 4th December, 1797, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> Addington addressed the Committee on the assessed taxes, from the gallery. The same  Speaker  also addressed a Committee on the union with Ireland in 1799, and ' again, 6th May; 1800, spoke in the Committee upon the Inclosure Bill. In Committee, on the charges against the Duke of York, 16th February, 1809, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> Abbot moved the commitment of Captain Sandon, a witness, for prevarication. Again, on the 1st June, 1809, he made a speech in Committee on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Curwen's  Bill for preventing the sale of seats in Parliament; and on 4th February, 1811, in Committee, on the Lords' resolution for a Commission for giving the Royal assent to the Regency Bill. Finally, he addressed a Committee on the Roman Catholic Relief Bill, in 1813, and carried an amendment excluding Catholics from Parliament, which caused the abandonment of the Bill. . . . And lastly, on the 9th June, 1870, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> Denison spoke, and voted, in Committee, on the Customs and Inland Revenue Bill, in support of a clause exempting horses kept for husbandry from licence duty if used in drawing materials for the repair of roads. </para>

                <para class="block">If the  Speaker  has a right to move a motion and to speak in Committee, it necessarily follows that he does so, not as  Speaker,  but, as I have said, as a private member, and that that right obviously carries with it the right also to vote. If, as the honorable member for Kennedy contends, the " Committee " and the " House " are synonymous terms, and there is no distinction recognised, why cannot Bills be read and passed in Committee; and why does the Committee have to report to the House? There would be no sense or meaning in the House reporting to itself. Why, also, cannot disorder in Committee be censured by the Committee? Why has it to be reported to the House, if the House and the Committee are recognised as the same thing. That there was a very wide distinction was recognised by the honorable member for Kennedy himself when, on the 6th December last, he voted in a division in Committee on an amendment moved in the Constitution Alteration (Industrial Matters) Bill. </para>

That, alone, is sufficient to establish a permanent precedent. I think that I have' sufficiently demonstrated that I have been acting well within my rights, not as  Speaker,  but as the member for Lang, in taking part in these proceedings in Committee, and if any precedent were required, which I do not for a moment admit, the honorable member for Kennedy himself established that precedent, which consequently becomes the accepted practice of the House. </para>

                        <para>- Then the whole point turns, not on what our Standing Orders permit, but upon the meaning of section 40 of the Constitution. In construing the terms of an Act, certain rules of interpretation are accepted by all Courts, and the main one is that the ordinary plain construction of a section is to be taken unless there appears some good reason to the contrary. Section 40 is very clear. It provides that - </para>

                <para class="block">Those words are clear and unambiguous. The only uncertainty arising, if it arises at all, is in regard to the meaning of the word " House," and as to what were the rights of the  Speaker  at the time that this Statute was passed. I shall deal with the last point first. We have to assume, since it is one of the principles accepted under the rules of interpretation, that the Legislature knew the circumstances to which the Statute referred, and knew what Were the powers of a  Speaker  at that particular time. These powers are set forth at page 368 of the 11th edition of <inline font-style="italic">May.</inline></para>

                        <para>- This is an Act of the British Parliament, and the British Parliament had before it the practice of centuries, modified as time went on, as to the rights, privileges, and duties of the  Speaker  at that time. Upon that point the whole question turns. The  Speaker  of the House of Commons in the House itself, at the time that the Act was passed, had a casting vote in the House, but he did not have an original vote. In Committee it was the practice of the  Speaker  to vote; but, as <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> shows at page 368, the practice had gradually fallen into desuetude, and that right was becoming less and less exercised as time went on. I do not deny that the  Speaker  of the House of Commons had that right then, and has it now. That was the state of the law -or the practice of the Commons at the time the Constitution Bill was passed. If section 40 of the Constitution is not to be taken as absolutely meaningless, it must refer to the powers then exercised by the  Speaker.  It must limit them, because, otherwise, it would be a perfectly meaningless thing for a Legislature to pass. The practice of the House of Commons was so well known to the House of Commons that it was perfectly absurd to suppose that they would introduce a mere declaratory clause. The  Speaker  had the right to a casting vote in the House, and an original vote in Committee. He rarely exercised that vote, and does so more rarely as years go on. The Convention, when discussing this matter, also knew exactly the position. Although the Act was passed by the British Parliament, it was, in effect, drafted by the Convention, and, except technically, it is the work of the Convention. Section 40 was substituted for section 39, as shown on page 461 of the Convention debates, and reads' as follows : - </para>

                        <para>- I do not care where the section was taken from; I say it was applied to this Parliament, and was applied to it by the British Legislature. The Constitution of the Canadian House of Commons is entirely different from ours, and the application of that section there is not to be supposed to be identical with its application here. It is contended that the words " House of Representatives," in section 40, affect the vote of the  Speaker  only when the House is not in Committee; but let us look at the section and the Act generally to see what the "House of Representatives" means. </para>

                        <para>- If section 40 does not make any difference to the position of the  Speaker  as it exists in the House of Commons, why is it put there? The  Speaker  in the House of Commons clearly has the right to vote in Committee, but can only exercise his casting vote when the House is not in Committee. There was no need to put in section 40 if it is only intended to re-enact that. The right of the  Speaker  to exercise his casting vote was never, and would never have been, challenged. This was put in for a specific purpose, and whatever was the intention of the Legislature, it is a clear prohibition, and operates against the  Speaker,  whether the House happens to be in Committee or in the House. The matter ought to be fairly looked at apart from any party bias, and if it operates unjustly, surely we can agree to an amendment of the Constitution at an early moment. Will the Attorney-General say that it is not an arguable point ? </para>

                        <para>- Under the circumstances, I should like the honorable gentleman to look at this point fairly and squarely, and to give us his reasons why he does not agree, if he does not, with the views which have been expressed from this side. Since the matter affects the House and the country very materially, I ask that he will give an opportunity for the matter to be referred, if necessary, to a more impartial tribunal than this is. Legislation to which the House of Representatives may agree may become vitiated by this very thing to which we object. With all deference to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> the honorable member for Lang, so long as he is  Speaker  of the House, never ceases to be its  Speaker,  and his contention that he is in the same position as yourself is quite opposed to the plain words of the Constitution. There is in the Constitution a prohibition directed against him; there is none against yourself. The honorable member for Lang does not cease to be the  Speaker  of this House because he vacates the chair when the House goes into Committee; if he ceased to be  Speaker,  he could not resume the chair. </para>

                    <para>.- The Government have chosen to enact this legislation without laying the measure before Parliament in such a way as to enable honorable members to follow the proposal submitted; and the Bill has not been explained by the Prime Minister or any of his colleagues. This proposal, so far as I know, is without parallel in any British Parliament. It is not only an extraordinary piece of legislation, but, in my opinion, it will defeat the purpose of honest government. It is either intended to deceive, or it is not. If the Government are afraid to put their proposals before Parliament in a straightforward way, they should have the courage and honesty to say so. Enactments of this kind cannot be justified under any circumstances or conditions, and particularly when we are dealing with the foundational principles of representative and responsible government. The franchise of the people is all important; and the Labour party have been the pioneers of the extension of the franchise to all. Honorable members opposite laugh and jeer now; but they never without pressure freely voted for any legislation which had for its object the extension of the franchise. Honorable members opposite belong to a party which to this day keeps in existence in the Legislatures of the States, Houses elected on a privileged franchise, or the members of which are appointed as nominees, to govern a democratic country. Now, because they cannot take away the privilege of electing both Houses of the Commonwealth Parliament on a democratic franchise, they pose as Radical legislators, who are in favour of a greater extension of the franchise. It is said that the proposal now is to restore what the Labour party took away; but we took away nothing. </para>

                        <para>- No doubt the Attorney-General would say that a fair answer to my argument would be a motion that the question be now put. It is a matter of indifference to any one who is aiming to represent a portion of the people what action the Prime Minister or the Attorney-General may take. After all, we must remember we are the passing creatures of a day in the progress of a country. Let it be said, to the immortal credit of our race, that they are not seriously affected by either conceit or bumptiousness in their representatives. The progress of a country goes on whether the people are required to give up their privileges or not - whether their representatives seek to subserve their own interests or not, the great heart of the people stands true for ever, and they make steady progress. If the Government are so anxious regarding the postal vote, it would only be fair to give them an opportunity to deal with it effectively and positively. I have no other view to express than what I have expressed again and again. If the Government can bring down reports from their professional heads of departments- </para>

If, in this instance, the honorable member has been misreported and done an injustice, it is only fair that people should know, because, Heaven knows, he is under enough difficulties without that standing against him. If he says he did not say, and never intended to say, and never had it in his mind to say, anything of the kind, we should admit that he has been wrongly reported, and that he has been done an injustice. Will the honor-  able member take that view ? </para>

                        <para>- As I read the clause, they are both repealed and reinstated. It is almost an enigma, unless we delve into all the Electoral Acts since the Commonwealth commenced. I believe it would be wise, late in the day as it is, to amend the clause by omitting the reference to the repeal of sections 14, 23, 35, and 38 of the Electoral Act 1911, and then afterwards striking out the words " and the provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1902-1909 which were repealed by those sections are hereby revived and reenacted." This would permit of the main provisions dealing with postal voting coming down to the House in an ordinary Bill and being dealt with in the ordinary way. I warn the Government that by this proposal they are initiating a practice and a system of legislation that will work both ways with more than one party, because it may be applied to other questions. It is certainly an innovation that will not be defended by jurists or experienced responsible politicians. Further, in the state of business it is unjustifiable, and should not be proceeded with. </para>

                    <para>. - The Government cannot accept the amendment. The position was explained at a much earlier stage of the Committee. It is very simple. The Government have seen fit to introduce this Bill in its present form, not with a view of inviting the Committee to go into the whole process of manufacturing a new system  of voting by post. That was done previously, and, in the view of the Government, the system so arrived at acted well, notwithstanding everything the honorable member has said, and brought an easy, safe, and proper method of exercising the franchise to many thousands of persons who have since been deprived of it. We do not invite the Committee to enter into a scheme of making a new system of voting by post, as if it had never been tried. What we do is to bring forward again, and ask the Committee to sanction as a whole, that system of voting by post which has been found thoroughly safe and efficient; but, in so doing, we give honorable members full opportunity to suggest amendments if they have any real <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> desire to help us in perfecting this scheme. </para>

                        <para>- Time will not allow me to instruct the honorable member in parliamentary procedure from Alpha to Omega. I have already shown the Committee where it can be done. If any honorable member chooses to take the trouble to look into the sections which are re-enacted in this Bill, and he has any real objections to the working of any of those provisions, and desires to amend them, parliamentary procedure will allow him to do it under this Bill; but we cannot accept the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition, because we do not invite the Committee, at this stage of the session, to re-enter on the discussion of the whole of the machinery for postal voting as if we were making a new kind of machinery that had never been tried before. We are determined to get this matter through; and, if honorable members do not desire honestly and seriously to help us, and if they waste the time of the Committee in other ways, they have only themselves to blame. We have already wasted two or three hours this afternoon on a matter that should never have been brought up. As I said before, we shall give full attention to any matter brought forward <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> with a view to improving the measure ; but we do not intend to give consideration to any matter brought forward with any other object. </para>

                        <para>- Very well. Let us suppose that it does what it intends to do, and that it is confined to the repealing of certain sections which prohibit voting by post, and let us assume, further, that it is the desire of a member of the Opposition to amend one of the sections in the Act of 1909, which deals with voting by post. I invite the attention of honorable members to a plain statement of concrete facts. Section 18 of the Act of 1909 amends a provision of the principal Act dealing with voting by post, and relates to authorized witnesses. Let us say, for the sake of argument, that I desire that the term " authorized witnesses " shall include or exclude justices of the peace. Will the Attorney-General tell me by what means I am to bring such an amendment before the Committee? </para>

                        <para>- I cannot do it. I can only vote against the clause in a blind, unreasoning way. There is no other course open to me, except the eminently reasonable and proper one which the Leader of the Opposition has stated. I wish to emphasize what the Leader of the Opposition has done. By approving of the first part of the clause, he has assented to the principle of voting by post, and he has requested that the sections dealing with voting by post, namely, sections 109 of the principal Act, and the following sections, shall be placed on the table by the Government, so that we may deal seriatim with them. I wish to show that this is an eminently reasonable thing to do, whereas the proposal put before us by the Government is eminently unreasonable, since it asserts, in effect, that the principal Act was perfect, and that it not only provided for voting by post, but precluded the abuse of the system. In the very Bill by which the Government proposed originally to amend the principal Act, they proposed to amend these very sections. The Honorary Minister, when introducing the Electoral Bill, said that he recognised the weakness of these sections, and that was why it was proposed to take out the provision dealing with authorized witnesses. Section 118a of the Act of 1909 provided that the authorized witnesses - justices of the peace and others - should take from the electors the completed postal ballot-paper, and post it to the Returning Officer. In the Bill to amend the Electoral Act, which the present Government introduced, it was proposed to take away that right, because it violated the secrecy of the ballot, and to lodge it in the hands of the electors themselves. How can it be consonant with fair play, both to the Opposition and the people of the Commonwealth, that the Attorney-General should deliberately say that this is an endeavour to re-enact a proposal which he himself, through his lieutenant, has declared to be unworkable and unfair, and to assert, further, that we have ample opportunity to make any amendment we please?

Clearly the Attorney-General does not apprehend the reason, or, surely, he would have told us why, in a Bill to provide for the restoration of postal voting, there should be a reference to these other matters. I do not know whether they are good or bad; I cannot see what is their scope, and should be glad to be told why they have been introduced into this Bill.

                        <para>- I have read section 23, and also section 158 of the principal Act to which it relates. I say emphatically it is not confined to informal postal votes, but extends to all votes. Under a Postal Vote Restoration Act, we should deal only with postal votes. That I am prepared to do, and claim that we have a right to do, but we also have a right to expect that, when dealing with section 14, which is hereby repealed, section 14, which covers 109 and subsequent sections, shall be placed on the table, so that we may make suitable amendments. That is, after all, the shortest way and the best way, and if that is done, we are perfectly prepared to agree to it; but we desire that our amendments may be fairly considered and debated. They cannot be debated and considered now. The measure is so drafted as to make its clear meaning absolutely unknowable, even to the legal mind, and does not permit of that clear and reasonable discussion and debate and amendment that a measure of this sort, which goes to the very basis of democratic government, demands. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable member has just spent fifteen minutes in showing that it would be wicked to waste further time in this debate. If the clause is unknowable and unamendable, why does the honorable member invite the Attorney-General to help him to amend it, and put it right? My reply to the honorable member is that we gave him every provision referred to in this clause in a larger Bill many weeks ago, and the Opposition declined to take the opportunity to amend it to their hearts' content. </para>

                    <para>. - I was very pleased to hear the Attorney-General say that he would be prepared to consider any amendment in the Bill which might be brought forward. . Personally, I have always held that provision should be made for the voting of the sick and the infirm, and in the last Parliament I could not see my way clear to eliminate from the electoral law the provisions for postal voting, as the weight of evidence in favour of that course did not seem sufficiently heavy. In view of the many statements that have been made here since as to the abuse of the postal voting system, I have come to the conclusion that it is our duty to provide machinery to permit of the voting of the sick and the infirm without the possibility of abuses, and I have drafted an. amendment which, I think, will do that. This ought not to be made a party question. The Prime Minister laughs. </para>

I have been thoroughly conscientious throughout. I know of many aged persons who, during the whole of their lifetime, have taken a keen interest in politics, but are now - perhaps because of senile decay - unable to go to the polling booths, and I am in favour of provision being made which will allow them to record their votes without having to do so.

The returning officer, on a day previous to the election, and after the day for receiving applications has expired, shall instruct the presiding officer appointed at the nearest polling place to call at the address of the applicant, and who shall, if satisfied that the claimant is entitled to vote under the provisions of this section, supply a ballot-paper to the elector, who, in the presence of the officer, but so that the officer cannot see the vote, shall mark the ballot-paper in the prescribed manner, and shall fold and secure the ballot-paper so that the vote cannot be seen. The ballot-paper shall then be placed in a sealed ballot-box in the presence of the presiding officer, and shall be opened and counted at the scrutiny at the close of the ballot. </para>

                <para class="block">The adoption of that amendment would provide adequate machinery for the recording of the votes of the sick and the infirm, and should meet the strong objection to the postal vote in its old form. The Attorney-General has stated that the Government are prepared to increase the expenditure on elections if thereby they can be conducted more purely. The additional expense which the adoption of my proposal would involve would not be great, because in many places there would be no applications, and polling booths are in most divisions so near together, such great facilities for the recording of votes having been given by both parties when in power, that it would not be difficult for presiding officers to call on applicants. It may be objected that in sparsely populated districts it would be difficult to give effect to my provision, but in that case we might also provide that persons residing more than 5 miles from a polling booth could send their votes by post, instead of having an officer wait on them. I wish to facilitate the voting of the sick and infirm, and ask the Government not to brush aside my amendment without consideration. If Ministers cannot accept it, they may be able to make a proposal which would be acceptable to both sides, and it would be best for all concerned to have some understanding on this matter, because we all desire that the sick and infirm shall be able to record their votes. It does not matter how we accomplish our end so long as the elections are clean and above board. </para>

More people voted by post in Victoria than in all the rest of Australia, and it cannot be contended that there were more sick people in this State than there were throughout the remainder of the Commonwealth. For instance, in Kooyong, there were more people who voted by post than in the whole of Western Australia. </para>

If that contention holds good, we can understand the abuses in the past. </para>

                        <para>-  As I understand the situation, the resolution the Committee arrived at was that all the words up to  ' thirty-eight ' ' should stand part of the clause. That means, I submit, that we cannot take those words out of the clause ; but it does not mean that we cannot insert words between " fourteen " and  "twenty-three." The Committee have not decided that we cannot insert words between those words, nor that what  ' fourteen ' ' stands for cannot be amended. I draw attention to the fact that the Attorney-General suggested that, while he desired to keep "fourteen" in as an indication of his intention, he had no desire to prevent what " fourteen " means being amended. It means the retention of something like twelve sections of the principal Act. </para>

                        <para>- The position is perfectly obvious. The Committee have already decided that words up to and including "thirty-eight" shall stand part of the clause ; that is, that the clause shall remain unalterable in Committee up to that word. That has always been the practice in Committee; and it would be impossible to make any progress if any honorable member could go back on work already done. I, therefore, rule that we cannot go behind the word " thirty-eight " in the clause, and that all amendments to be in order must follow that word. </para>

I submit the honorable member for Bourke should have raised his question immediately the honorable member for Hunter announced his amendment. It is no time now to ask the honorable member for Hunter to waive his amendment after the honorable member has made a long speech. If that sort of thing goes on, we shall have long speeches all night, and there will be no finality reached. The rule is that an honorable member indicates that he has a prior amendment before the honorable member announcing another amendment speaks upon it, and not after a long speech has been delivered; and I submit that now it is too late for the honorable member for Bourke to propose his amendment. </para>

                        <para>- I am afraid honorable members are not following the proceedings very closely. The amendment proposed by the honorable member for Hunter has not been put from the Chair. The honorable member has made a speech and handed in an amendment, which I am now endeavouring to get before the Committee; but as I understand the honorable member for Bourke had a prior amendment, it is quite a proper thing that I should allow him to state it in order that I may ascertain whether it does precede the proposed amendment of the honorable member for Hunter. </para>

                    <para>. - The Government cannot accept the amendment. The machinery set up by it. for recording the postal votes of those who are sick and infirm makes it impracticable, and leaves it open to some abuse; but apart altogether from that, the limitation to those who are sick and infirm cannot be accepted by the Government. We do not interpret the postal vote in that way. Since Parliament has placed on the shoulders of the voter the compulsion to enroll, we maintain we are under an obligation, as far as possible, to make his privileges correspond with that obligation. The ideal to be aimed at in all our laws such as this is equal opportunities for voting, as far as we can encompass it. Where in the proposal of the honorable member is there an approximation of equality of privilege as well as of responsibility? </para>

I trust that we shall be able to conduct our proceedings in a more orderly way in view of the complaint of the Prime Minister, and of a complaint I heard also from the opposite side of the Chamber earlier in the evening. Otherwise, I have the Standing Orders to carry out, and I shall not be worthy of my position if I do not do so. I have refrained from taking any extreme step time and again, and I hope it will not be necessary for me to carry the Standing Orders to their furthest, in order that I may secure the attention to which any honorable member speaking is entitled. </para>

                        <para>- In a word or two I wish to show why we cannot accept the amendment. There is no need for heat. We claim that the amendment will seriously curtail the postal vote, as we have hitherto known it, and that makes it impossible for the Government to accept it. Where we have compulsion on voters to enroll we have to give them every privilege we can to exercise their votes. If a man is 8, or 9, or 10 miles away from a polling booth we place him under a serious disability, as compared with the man who is 8 or 9 yards away. That is the position in a nutshell. We have no right to lay an equal obligation on people with out in any way endeavouring to put at their disposal an equal privilege. </para>

                        <para>- I think not, out of consideration for my friends, and out of respect for them, to say nothing more. It is impossible to safeguard the postal vote in the way suggested by practically taking a Returning Officer round the country to collect the votes. It is impracticable to do so. The honorable member has, therefore, submitted a proposal that is absolutely impracticable, and his  position  would be far more logical, if those are the only conditions under which he will give the postal vote, if he would make up his mind to vote against it. The honorable member is prepared to concede the postal vote, as the honorable member for Bourke is, under impossible and impracticable conditions; and, of course, we cannot accept proposals which are absolutely unworkable, and cannot be carried out. </para>

                    <para>.- The Prime Minister would lead the Committee to believe that, because enrolment was made compulsory, voting was also in effect made compulsory.  He was quite right in asserting that, in a Democracy like this, the facilities for every one entitled to vote to record a vote should be as wide as it is possible to make them with safety ; but the principle of the exercise of the franchise rests entirely on the basis of the vote being cast under supervision. From the very earliest stages of voting it has been recognised that care must be exercised as to the manner in which votes are cast. Care was always taken in any system of voting apart from the supervision of responsible officers within a polling booth, or in the open, before the secrecy of the ballot was established, that no person voted oftener. than he was entitled to vote. I think this Parliament has developed the principle of extending the privilege and facility to vote more than any other Parliament, but abuses crept in. These were corrected by certain legislation, and certain administration, but, in my opinion, they were never totally eliminated, and they are not likely to be eliminated by any legislation. I say it is impracticable to eliminate abuses where we have an extensive system of postal voting. There should be some method of reaching electors who are more than a certain distance away from a polling place. The honorable member for Darling Downs will know that, in Queensland, fifteen years ago, a Liberal Government compelled seventy miners at Opalton to ride 120 miles to exercise their vote, and he will remember the celebrated  Bonnavonna  polling place to which people were carted from all parts of the colony. That was the way in which the franchise was exercised at that time, and the Labour party were loudest in their condemnation of that practice. The proposition is quite different now. Able-bodied electors, within a reasonable distance of a polling booth, should cast their votes at that polling booth under proper supervision. The sick and invalid - and a person may be invalid and not sick, or may be maimed and incapable of moving or being moved - should have every facility to exercise their franchise. But people in good health, and more particularly males in good health, ought to be compelled to go to the polling booths, because the greater the extent to which they do so, the greater will be the assurance that the franchise will be exercised as it ought to be. I should not like to commit myself to every suggestion which has been made by the honorable member for Hunter, but his amendment is certainly a great improvement on some of the proposals made by the Government, and I regret that they cannot see their way to countenance it, even if they will not accept it exactly in the form in which it is proposed. </para>

                    <para>.- We have had from the Prime Minister this afternoon a statement very different from those made by his party throughout the election campaign, and, in fact, up to the present day. It is now quite clear that the Government desire, not merely to restore voting by post in the case of the sick and the infirm, but to extend it to persons enjoying even the best of health. It is intended that they shall have facilities for voting by post of a character that must necessarily be open to question. Previously all the statements made by the Ministry and their supporters were to the effect that by repealing the postal voting provisions of the Electoral Act we had prevented the sick and the infirm and the mothers of Australia from exercising the franchise. Practically nothing was said of a voting-by-post system which would allow tens of thousands enjoying the very best of health to avail themselves of it if they so desired. An entirely new situation has been sprung upon us by the statement of the Prime Minister that the Government are determined to restore this system because they have in this Chamber, at the present moment, the necessary numbers to enforce their will. It is just as well that the vast difference between their pre-election cry and their utterances to-day should be emphasized. </para>

                        <para>- I accept the honorable member's disclaimer, and will say that honorable members opposite cannot afford to employ paid canvassers. But whether they can or cannot, the fact remains that paid canvassers are persistently working in their behalf. Who pays them, I do not know. They are paid to do certain work, and their work for many weeks prior to an election will be to secure votes. If the postal voting provisions are restored, as the Ministry propose, then these paid canvassers will be able to call on every man and woman within 2 yards, much less 2 miles, of a polling booth, and try to persuade them to sign a statement to the effect that they believe - not that they will - but that they "believe" that they will be more than 5 miles from a polling booth on election day. Those who do that will be able to take advantage of the postal voting provisions of the Act. If honorable members opposite think that is a proper provision to have in our electoral system, well knowing the abuse to which it can be put, let them enforce it. </para>

                        <para>- I am not. I am simply speaking of the possibilities, and of what the honorable gentleman from his long political experience must know will become actualities. Just prior to an election, when party feeling is high, and when persons can be induced for pay to canvass for votes, they will be able to do what I have said. While "the electors are, in the ordinary sense, innocent of any intention to do wrong, paid canvassers will be able to cajole thousands into taking advantage of these provisions, and if the vote of the individual does not suit the paid canvasser, then we know that it will not be recorded. That is the unfortunate feature of the situation. An innocent person recording his vote by post has to do so in such a way that a paid canvasser must inevitably see how he votes, and under the provisions proposed to be restored, he is to take the ballot-paper from the voter, and is himself supposed to place it in the letter-box. </para>

                        <para>- Five days ago the Government held a different view. They were then going on with the Electoral Bill, and, in introducing that measure, the Honorary Minister specifically denounced provisions that are being reenacted under this measure. He denounced them as being unfair and open to corruption, and said they ought not to be retained in the electoral law. The Ministry have suddenly changed their minds. What was but a few weeks ago denounced by the Honorary Minister as unfair and improper and open to corruption is now being forced upon the country. </para>

The question of whether my remarks are, or are not, of a political character is merely a matter of opinion, and the honorable member is entitled to warn me, or to threaten me, as the case may be, but while I am permitted to speak, I have the right to say that it is because he objects to my criticism of his action that he warns me that if I persist I shall have the " gag " applied, although I am a representative of the people in this House. It is impossible for me to occupy very much time, since there is a time limit of thirty-five minutes to our speeches in Committee, and it is therefore monstrous for the Attorney-General to suggest, as he does, that I am wasting time. </para>

                        <para>- My remarks may be distasteful to the honorable member, but I am at liberty to speak while he permits me to do so. According to a member of the Ministry, the provisions that are now being forced upon us do permit of corruption at election time. The amendment submitted by the honorable member for Hunter is a clear indication that he is prepared to remove all the objections that were recently raised as to the prevention of the sick and- the infirm from the exercise of the franchise by the repeal of the postal-voting provisions of the Act. Those were really the only objections raised up to a few minutes ago. The honorable member's amendment clearly indicates his desire to meet them, and there is no doubt that if it were accepted it would be carried by a very large majority. But the very moment that the Opposition meets the arguments on the situation created by the Government side of the House, that very moment Ministers say they will not accept an amendment giving voting facilities to the sick and the infirm. I am justified, even although it may be considered that I am making a political speech, in emphasizing my sincere regret that there should be forced through this Chamber a measure of which, no doubt, advantage can be taken at a critical time, and which will mean that the men who have the money at their disposal - whether they have it themselves or have friends to spend it for them - will be able to secure a voting strength which would otherwise be impossible. </para>

                        <para>- Apparently it is proposed to extend the postal vote to the healthy community regardless of distance from polling booths, provided they will sign a paper to the effect that they believe they will be so many miles distant on election day, but it is questionable whether a large number who sign the paper will thoroughly understand it in that light. There is a cry that these proposals are entirely for the benefit of country people, and the Prime </para>

                <para>Minister said that we ought, in the Electoral Act, to give to the country people privileges equal to those given to the people in the cities. I have absolutely no objection. Having resided in a country district for many years, I have full and complete sympathy with those resident therein; but if the Government are so anxious to give the country people facilities, let them increase the number of polling booths by a few thousand. But what a sham and hollow cry is that about equal privileges. They might just as well say that we should give them electric trams in Warrnambool or Horsham, or build a capital city in every State, or take a railway to the door of every individual in the country. The assertion was made merely to pander to the country people, without giving them reasonable facilities. But it is intended to give facilities to exercise the postal vote to persons to whom those facilities should not be given, and that those opportunities should be taken advantage of by paid canvassers at election periods. I regret that the Government will not accept an amendment that clearly indicates our desire to give postal voting facilities to the sick and infirm, whether in the city or the country, but insists on extending them in another direction. </para>

                        <para>- This is a matter of procedure, and even in circumstances like these, when honorable members are a bit heated in their minds, I think that they will see that it is both unwise and undesirable that a question should be put when it is impossible for honorable members to hear distinctly what is said. It is true that you, sir, have stated that you called order. That is not sufficient. I suggest that the question should be put when honorable members on both sides are reasonably attentive. </para>

The Standing Orders provide that when the closure is moved no debate can take place, and that the question must be forthwith put. The  Speaker  has no option in the matter. </para>
