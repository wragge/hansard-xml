            <para>- I ask the Postmaster-General, in reference to a circular which he has distributed to honorable members, and which conveys information regarding new postal arrangements, whether these new arrangements have yet come into operation ? The circular is dated the 17th September, but I am informed that yesterday, when a merchant went to the Melbourne Post Office, and wished to send a lettergram to Broken Hill, he was told that the regulation providing for the sending of lettergrams was not yet in force. </para>

            <para>- The answer to the honorable member's question is -  i,  2,  3, and 4. Rolls were prepared under a proclamation, a copy of which is attached. Clause 5 thereof reads - " If the Commonwealth Electoral Officer is satisfied that any person is entitled to be enrolled on any new roll as an elector he may (notwithstanding that no claim for enrolment has been received from such person) cause his name to he placed on the new roll for the subdivision in which such person lives. But this provision shall not relieve any person from his duty to fill in, sign, and send in a claim for enrolment." </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In each State the names of all persons, ascertained by the police to be qualified for enrolment, at the time of the preparation of the rolls, were, as usual, included therein. </para>
          <para>Claims for enrolment were obtained as far as practicable at the time of the electoral canvass, but for some persons whom the police returned as qualified for enrolment personally-signed claim cards were not at the time of the canvass obtainable owing to temporary absence, illness, &amp;c. </para>
          <para>The Commonwealth electoral officers considered that they had sufficient evidence and authority under the proclamation to include the names of such persons in the roll, and did so. This, and not the dummy cards, account for the names of such persons appearing on the printed rolls. </para>
          <para>In order to make the card index as complete as possible for detecting duplications, the Chief Electoral Officer, purely as an administrative act. directed that typewritten cards of names of persons legally on the roll who had not sent in cards should be inserted in the index, pending the receipt of personally-signed claim cards. The outstanding cards gradually came in, until at the time of the elections they were reduced to less than 1 per cent. of the whole. </para>

            <para>- The practice which i8 growing up of discussing proposals at this stage, though in accord with the Standing Orders, is, in most cases, I think, an inconvenient one, because i¥ leads to the discussion of measures before they are actually before the House. The usual plan of deferring debate until a measure has been introduced, and the second reading moved, is much better. It is only on extraordinary occasions, when a Minister may think it preferable to make a statement on the motion for the introduction of a Bill, that there should be any discussion at this stage. When there is debate at the second-reading stage, members have the Bill before them, and can speak with a knowledge of its provisions. </para>

            <para>- That is so; but, although honorable members may know all about this Bill, they cannot know all about other Bills when the motion for leave to introduce them is moved. The object which the Government have now in view is to do what is thought just to Tasmania, and to give effect to the unanimous recommendation of the Royal Commission which considered the financial position of the State in regard to Federation. The last Parliament voted a grant of £500,000 for the assistance of the State, and of this amount £95,000 was paid up to the 30th June last. Having reconsidered the whole matter, and knowing that the people of Tasmania are very anxious to obtain the full amount recommended by the Royal Commission, and, indeed, feel that they have not been treated as they deserve, Ministers now propose a further grant of £400,000. </para>

He has given us no information as to whether the authorities in Tasmania or anybody else have applied for this sum. </para>

            <para>- The Treasurer should have told the Committee that an intimation has been made by the people of Tasmania that this extra sum of £400,000 is required, but he gave us no information on the subject. All that we could get from him was that this is a bad method of conducting the business - that we have no right to debate the motion. What is the object in submitting the motion ? It is only for the purpose of debate, and for no other reason. If it was not intended that the proposal should be debated, why does the Treasurer go through this procedure? He must recollect that when similar motions were submitted during the last Parliament honorable members on his side never lost an opportunity to talk. </para>

            <para>- Yes, eighty-three Bills were passed in the last Parliament. Did we not give the honorable member a Bill last night - one Bill one day? I thought that that was very good. Some weeks ago the Government got the Audit Bill. What more do they want? In any case, I do not see that there is any special reason for hurrying forward this proposal. The Treasurer might well have allowed it to stand over, and permitted us to deal with that other important measure, the Electoral Bill. He submits this proposal when he knows that the Senate is not going to sit for a fortnight or three weeks. </para>

            <para>- Yes. In the circumstances I think that the Treasurer was not justified in coming down and merely saying, " Here is a resolution, and we want you to pass it." We are entitled to more than that. But if the right honorable gentleman were to come down from time to time and make a reasonable explanation, it would facilitate the passage of his proposals. Instead of that, however, he submits a bald proposal, and if any honorable member on this side asks a question or desires some information, he is told that a statement will be made on the second reading of the Bill . That method of conducting business is not creditable to the right honorable gentleman, because he is always desirous of being extremely courteous and fair to the House. I think he would do himself more justice if he would explain why it is necessary to introduce a Bill for this purpose, and not be content with the mere statement that we have from honorable members opposite that the Government want to carry out the unanimous recommendation of the Royal Commission on the Tasmanian Customs leakages. I am not prepared at present to say whether that is a good or a bad reason, but I must certainly enter my protest against this method of conducting the business of the House. If the Treasurer will not give us more information concerning this matter I trust that the Prime Minister will do so. No one was more ready than he was when in Opposition to give information to the House in regard to all sorts of questions. I hope that he is not ill, and that there is nothing to prevent his giving the Committee this afternoon the benefit of that fund of knowledge, the possession of which he showed so well when he sat on this side of the chamber. If the Treasurer does not know the exact policy in the mind of the Prime Minister in regard to this proposal, perhaps the Prime Minister himself will tell us what he proposes to do. Is the money to be paid over in one lump sum this year, or is it to be paid by instalments, distributed over a number of years ? </para>

          <para>. - I do not like it to be thought that I have any desire to keep back from the Committee information that should be in its possession, and no one knows better than does the honorable member for Kennedy that the proper time to explain the details of a Bill is when the motion for a second reading is submitted. This practice of debating a preliminary motion is quite unusual in this House, and is very inconvenient. On every such motion we now have, during this session, had a long debate. In my Budget, statement, as reported at page 1789 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> I stated fully what we intended to do in regard to the proposed grant to Tasmania, and mentioned the proposed mode of payment, and the amount that would be paid every year. I have explained our reason for introducing this Bill, and have, I think, said all that is necessary till we reach the second-reading stage. </para>

The Treasurer, in his Budget statement, said that the Government proposed to supplement the grant made by the Fisher Government by a further sum of £400,000, so as to bring the payment up to the full amount recommended by the Royal Commission which dealt with this matter. It was the belie! of Tasmanians that that State had suffered great loss because of Customs leakages, due to the stopping of the issue of Inter-State certificates. </para>

            <para>- The Premier of Tasmania, on the basis of the findings of the Commission, made an appeal to this Parliament under section 96 of the Constitution - a very proper provision enabling any State to apply to the Commonwealth for aid. To Tasmania's appeal this Parliament did not turn a deaf ear. The late Government passed a Bill providing for a grant of £500,000. Under that Act we began with a payment approaching £100,000, the last of the instalments which we declared should extend over a period of ten years, falling away to something like £5,000. The present Treasurer, with a great flourish' of trumpets, says, " We are going to pay Tasmania another £400,000." But how do the Government propose to pay it? By granting as a first instalment, this year, the handsome sum of £5,000. In this year of prosperity - the year of a big surplus left by others - the Treasurer proposes to pay an instalment of only £5,000. </para>

However, this is not the time to deal with such matters. When honor able members opposite come out into the open in this House and attempt to make good the statements they have made elsewhere we can deal with them fully.

            <para>- I understood the honorable member to remind me that the grants would go on increasing. That is true. It is proposed that the amount to be voted for the second year shall be £15,000, and for the third year £25,000. Assuming that the present Government continued in office during the full term of the present Parliament, the contribution would be £5,000 plus £15,000 plus £25,000, and would that not be an enormous amount for the Government to contribute in three years out of the proposed grant of £400,000. Is that not a splendid effort on the part of those who profess a desire to help Tasmania? We recognised, when in office, that the need of Tasmania was pressing, and was not a matter for the future, and we therefore paid the highest amount in the first year. But the present proposal is like the present Government in all that they do. They are abounding in promises and do the least possible the way of fulfilment. The Treasurer might very well have told the Committee why ' the Government propose to give Tasmania only £5,000 in the first year. A complaint was made that  the  late Government Hid not deal very handsomely with the report of the Commission, and my rejoinder was that they made an earnest effort to meet the recommendation o'f the Commission, and then left it to Parliament to deal with the matter. I am not opposing the additional grant proposed, but I say that the Government, though they may have shown their real intentions in the method they propose for making it, have not shown their <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> by proposing to give small grants in the early years when the money is required by Tasmania. For that reason the Government proposal is faulty, and ought to be altered. </para>

            <para>- I compliment the Government on being in a position to be liberal to Tasmania, but I remind the Treasurer that the Government can claim no credit for that, because it is due to the surplus left them by the wise financial administration of their predecessors. It is easy for the present Treasurer to be liberal with the money saved by other people. It is all very well for the right honorable gentleman to assume the <inline font-style="italic">rtlt</inline> of bountiful father to Tasmania by paying away money left to him by the previous Government. If the previous Government had not left a surplus, what chance would Tasmania have of getting this money? The Government have been left a surplus of £2,600,000 by their predecessors, who managed the finances of the Commonwealth in an exemplary way, but what does their liberality consist of? A paltry 5,000 sovereigns for the first year is to be given to this necessitous State. The object is to provide something with which tq dress the Government shop window. They have a few things hanging up in it already. They started by hanging up a great deal of dirty linen, and it will be found to overshadow every other thing they hang in their window. I thought that, when the Treasurer rose after the honorable member for Kennedy, he intended to give the information which the Committee required. Is the Treasurer, or is the Prime Minister, aware that there is a far better justification for a grant of this money to the people of Sydney to meet the losses they have suffered by reason of the actions of the Government than there is to give it to Tasmania. The Government are hoping that this grant will be a placard which they may use effectively in the sweet by-and-by. </para>

In Committee I shall move that the grant be increased to £1,000,000.

            <para>- Because, unlike the honorable member, we do not desire to go to extremes in everything. If the Treasurer recognised his responsibility, we should get on splendidly. But is it fair to ask us to carry the first reading of a Bill that we have never seen? If we allow the measure to be introduced, we may then discover that it ought never to have seen the light of day. Why does the Treasurer desire to placate Tasmania at the present time? Is the right honorable gentleman going to pay that State £5,000 during the first year, and, if not, what amount does he propose to pay it? He prefers to look through his papers rather than to pay any heed to the request of honorable members for information. At a later stage I shall move for the appointment of a Royal Commission to investigate the claims of the people of Sydney who reside within the proclaimed quarantine area to some compensation, with a view to seeing if they cannot get something out of this surplus. I do not wish to say anything further. I could say a great deal more, but I do not think it is necessary. I cannot discuss a blank sheet. </para>

The exPrimeMinister also expressed surprise that there should not be more information given, and I suppose we must take it that if he had been Treasurer he would have made a full explanation in submitting the same motion to the House. </para>

He must have known what the Bill was even if his party did not. The utterances of honorable members opposite are but a poor attempt at " stone-walling.'' Certainly they answer the purpose of delaying business, and I am sure the people outside will recognise that the object of honorable members opposite is to prevent the passage of business in this House, though they do it very clumsily. </para>

            <para>- It was mentioned in the Budget speech made by the ex-Prime Minister, and the Bill was afterwards brought forward. The honorable member for Bass must be congratulated in reference to this matter. He it was who first moved for a Select Committee, and as  chairman  of that Committee he applied to have it turned into a Royal Commission. Those who were here at the time know that the original purpose of the inquiry was to ascertain the amount of an alleged Customs leakage, but it was not possible to discover a penny of Customs leakage, and there is not a word about leakage in the report of the Commission. </para>

I went into this matter very carefully when in office, and came to the conclusion that there was no leakage. </para>

            <para>- I obtained evidence from persons sending goods to Tasmania. Manufacturers sending imported goods from here were not likely to place the value of the imported" raw material on a low basis; they were more likely to keep it at a high value, as it would then appear that their profits were small. I know of twenty or thirty manufacturers in Victoria who could give evidence to that effect. It is no wish of mine to do Tasmania an injustice, and I congratulate the State on its success, though I do not think that the grant is deserved. </para>

            <para>- For the first five years of Federation Western Australia had a special tariff, which was reduced according to a sliding scale. Then came a period during which the State received no special treatment, but now it is again being specially treated. Tasmania, if necessitous, is equally entitled to special treatment.. But the financial position of the States should be dealt with as a whole. However, I shall reserve my further remarks until the Bill has been introduced. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. ROBERTS</inline>'(Adelaide) [3.42';.- This is wholly a financial matter. Some time ago a Royal Commission investigated the financial position of Tasmania as affected by Federation, and recommended a grant to the State in aid of its finances. The majority of the members of that Commission were Labour members, and I congratulate the Treasurer and his supporters that, notwithstanding their repeated denunciations of Labour, and their continual assertion that Labour members know little about finance, they have accepted in full the recommendation of the Commission. So I. again offer my sincere congratulations to the Treasurer. There is not a shadow of a doubt but that the right honorable gentleman, with others behind him, have, from their own point of view, seen the necessity of undercutting, or, if they do not like that word, out-bidding the Labour party. They look upon the action of the Fisher Ministry last year, in deciding to assist Tasmania to the extent of £500,000, as having had some favorable result with the electors. </para>

          <para>- They consider the situation of such a nature that it is imperative on their part to do something in a similar direction, and they propose to do it in such a way as to get the greatest possible credit, while giving at the present time, and within their reasonable life, the least possible sum of money. I intend to support the motion. I have not the slightest objection to the introduction of the Bill. But I do take exception to the method adopted by the Treasurer in endeavouring to secure kudos for his party, and at the same time attempting to belittle what was done by his predecessors. </para>

            <para>- Rather than do what is being done - attempting to undercut the other party, and to depreciate the one action while belauding the other ? If a comparison has to be made, it should be made, in my belief, in something like this way, namely, that the Fisher Administration committed the Commonwealth to assist Tasmania, on an average, to the extent of £50,000 a year for ten years; while the present Government propose to add to that assistance to the extent of £44,444 per year for nine years. If the Treasurer desires a comparison, he comes out in a somewhat weak position - at any rate, in a secondary position; and, as there are only two in the race, he could not possibly be further behind. That is the extent of the commitments that will be made under this proposition. When we were inquiring into the financial conditions of this small State - small in area, and, I am sorry to say, small in statesmanship - we found that it had been rather hard pressed. A direct request was made from the responsible Government for assistance from the Commonwealth under section 96 of the Constitution. Taking that request into consideration, together with the general condition of the State, the Royal Commission unanimously approved of a grant of £900,000 over a period of ten years, starting with a payment of £120,000, and gradually reducing the annual payment until, in the tenth year it would be £50,000. The Government of the day were unable to see their way clear to accept in full the recommendation of the Commission at that particular time , but they committed the Commonwealth to the extent which they thought it was advisable to do, while at the same time rendering material assistance to the little State. Their method of procedure was precisely opposite to that adopted by the present Administration. Peeling that at that time the greatest necessity of the State existed, they decided to make the largest payment during the first year, gradually reducing the amount during the period of ten years; or, in other words, last year the Fisher Administration were able to meet the situation to the extent of £95,000, gradually reducing the sum, so that, in the event of them being put out by any strange mischance in a national catastrophe, such as happened a little time ago, at any rate their successors would not be too heavily committed. They themselves, feeling the necessity for that commitment, undertook to pay the largest possible sum, leaving the smallest possible amount to be provided by their successors. What is the position of the Treasurer and those who, with flare of trumpets and flag waving, are dealing with this particular situation ? They propose to give to Tasmania, this year, the smallest possible sum (that they could give to that State, and to gradually increase the amount, so that, if the political awakening comes within a reasonable time and they are removed from office, the heaviest commitments will have to be faced by their successors. </para>

            <para>- When my honorable friend sits behind a Ministry who commit the Commonwealth to an expenditure, he, at any rate, ought to ask the Ministry to meet the heaviest possible items of it, and not to put that responsibility on the shoulders of somebody else. To-day, there are loud comments and: complaints - erroneous, misleading, grossly misrepresenting the situation - to the effect that the colossal expenditure about to be, or being, indulged in by the- present Administration is due to commitments made by their predecessors. The statements are inaccurate; they are as incorrect as it is possible for statements to be. But here is a striking illustration of the way in wh'ich these honorable gentlemen do deliberately make the heavier commitments for their successors, whoever they may be. The present Ministry are to pay, this year, £5,000; next year, when somebody else succeeds them, which, please God, they will in the best interests of this country, the new Ministry will have to find £15,000, and in the next year £25,000. If even, by a system of political jugglery, the present  Government  should remain in office three years - and it is inconceivable that political darkness will remain so long over the land that they could remain in office longer than that period - they will have given to Tasmania £45,000; or, to put it in another way, less than half of what their predecessors gave to that State in one year. In these circumstances, I feel justified in continuing the comparison which the Treasurer started, and which honorable members on the other s'ide seek to belaud in such excessive terms. I happened to be a member of the Royal Commission which inquired into the circumstances of Tasmania, and, naturally, I approve of the action which is being taken to comply fully with its recommendation. I think I am quite justified in publicly offering my sincere congratulations to the honorable member for Bass, who was its  Chairman. </para>

            <para>- The right honorable gentleman must not suppose that because he happens to have a few pounds' worth of the good things of this world he necessarily has a knowledge of finance. It does not follow that the possession of wealth indicates the possession of brains or ability. He must not suppose that the chance which gave him a little wealth has added to his personal knowledge.. I was making a statement when I was interrupted by the right honorable gentleman, and may I point out to him that while be is regularly disposed to interrupt other honorable members, when he but a day or two ago was reading his Budget speech, he was so rude as to refrain from answering even ordinary questions which were put to him with the view 'of a little more- information 'being obtained : he was a Sphinx in that direction. As he declines to reply to interjections, he ought to set an example, and not make them when others are speaking. I want to offer again my sincere congratulation's to the 'honorable member for Bass. At <inline font-weight="bold">Ms instance</inline> the Royal Commission was 'appointed, and he was made the  Chairman,  and an exceptionally able one -he . proved throughout  the inquiry. His ability was most marked, and I must say that abi'lity and tact went a long way in securing  for  his State the assistance it needed. I am happy to be able to occupy a seat in i&amp;e House when the full recommendation of the Commission is to be indorsed' ,by Parliament, and I sincerely trust that the money, when it goes to Tasmania, .will be of use in helping it over its temporary difficulty. </para>

It has been suggested here to-day that this proposal of the Treasurer has the appearance of electioneering, of trying to outbid the other fellow. </para>

I da-re say that when our own Government settled the question of the Federal 'Capital in New South Wales, they expected 'some reward. "What reward did they get? I bring this matter under the notice of- the Treasurer, not that he may be led into thinking that Tasmania is going to send him a couple of extra supporters, because if that is his view, I can assure him-, from my observations during the past ten years or so&gt; he is very likely to be disappointed. Take, 'for example, the establishment of woollen mills at Geelong; 'did. that bring the Labour party any support ? </para>

It has been 'suggested that the carrying of this proposed grant may give the Government political support at the coming contest. I think I discharge a public duty in pointing" out to 'Governments that if they will keep on 'the straight and narrow path they will reach the goal of their  ambition,  But if they get on the broad way  that  leadeth  to destruction by giving giants of this kind in the hope that they will bring political support they are likely to be sadly disappointed. The Treasurer, no doubt, feels that, in view of his long political career, he is entitled to refuse to give to this Committee the information that is demanded. I would remind him, however, that rank imposes obligations, and that -the higher a man's position in the social and political world the greater should be his urbanity. </para>

            <para>- As to that, everything depends upon what Government is in power. Believing, as I do, that the present Ministry have the interests, not of Australia, but of the capitalists alone, at heart, I think it my duty to elicit further information. Does Tasmania want this money ? I think it does. It is badly governed, and is in the grip of a disgraceful land monopoly. Its Government makes no effort to bring about the proper settlement of its magnificent lands. Tasmania is the gambling State of Australia. The institution known as Tattersalls, which was driven out of the other States by the force of public opinion, finds a resting-place there. On that account the State has a bad repute. I think there are plenty of people who would decline to reside in a State which gains any part of its revenue from such a disreputable source. </para>

            <para>- I was about to  emphasize  my argument by pointing out the grave effects which gambling must have upon a nation. I shall not, however, deal with the matter from the stand-point of eugenics. I should like to ask the honorable member for Wentworth whether he will be coming forward later on with an appeal for a grant to New South Wales because of the injury done to that State by the operation of the quarantine laws as applied by his own Government. No doubt Tasmania wants money, and has suffered because of Federation. A proposal has been made that she should be added to the State of Victoria 1 do not know whether that would not be a very good thing for Tasmania. It certainly might prevent further application for grants of this character. The framers of the Constitution inserted in it a clause empowering the Commonwealth Parliament to assist a necessitous State. Those wise men - and the Treasurer was one of them, although he is not doing many wise things at the present time to justify his reputation - saw that this giant Federation, which will, in future days, realize the hope3 of many, would, in all probability, detrimentally affect the finances of one or more States in attaining a great position amongst the nations of the world. Poor little Tasmania, badly governed, in' the grip of land monopoly, and controlled by unwise administrators who probably secured their election by unfair means, is now suffering, and it is our duty to come to her assistance. I congratulate the honorable member for Bass on his success in putting before this Parliament the claims of Tasmania for assistance at the hands of the Commonwealth Parliament. I would also congratulate the honorable member for Denison who. has ably supported him. The honorable member for Franklin, I suppose, deserves a little praise, but nothing like as much as do honorable members on this side of the House. </para>

            <para>- No. Because he did not succeed in obtaining the full amount recommended by the Royal Commission he was opposed. Indeed, I am led to ask whether we ought to make this further grant to people who can, apparently, be so miserably ungrateful. Tasmanians have not shown much gratitude. I think that the honorable member for Adelaide rightly emphasized the point that the Treasurer is trying to get the greatest possible credit at the least possible expense. There is nothing like an old dog for a hard road, and no doubt the right honorable gentleman has much perspicacity. When reading his Budget speech he would not reply to an interjection ; but when the Leader of the Opposition was discussing the Budget, the right honorable gentleman was very anxious to obtain information from him by way of interjection, and demanded that it should be forthcoming. The proposed grant is to be extended over a period of years, so that the generosity of this Parliament will soon be forgotten. If Tasmania's gratitude is likely to materialize in the form of a few extra votes, the Treasurer will most likely experience it at the next election. As the honorable member has pointed out, only £5,000 is to be paid in the first year. The Government propose to leave to their successors the payment of the bulk of this further grant of £400,000. We have had to discover this information for ourselves. But what does the Treasurer care about our request for information ? He says, " We have a majority, and, with the exception of the honorable member for Werriwa, we have them well drilled, and we care nothing for the complaints of honorable members who ask for information." Honorable members opposite throughout the country declared that the late Government spent millions of money " like toffs," to. use the expression of the cultured gentleman who leads the present Government. In the circumstances, I ask the Treasurer how he can have the audacity to come here and ask for £400,000 as a grant for Tasmania, when he and his followers complained at the last elections of our financial extravagance, although the vote of £500,000 for Tasmania was a part of <inline font-style="italic">it</inline></para>

            <para>- The late Government, at all events, paid more than £5,000, which is the amount the present Treasurer proposes to pay. From the extraordinary method adopted by the Government in taking up Bills and then dropping them, we do not know whether the Treasurer really proposes to go through with this Bill; but if, in the plenitude of time, it should get into Committee, I hope that the honorable member for Bass and other representatives of Tasmania will move that the larger payments be made first. I am sure that they have no wish that they should pass away before justice is done to the State they represent. It should be done right away, while the Commonwealth is in a prosperous condition. I do not suggest for a moment that I intend to support the Treasurer in the extraordinary naval expenditure which he proposes, and which, I hope, will never be carried by this Parliament. The right honorable gentleman proposes to vote £5,700,000 for the Navy; but he does not propose to pay honorable members the salary which was docked from them just- before the last Federal elections. There would be a strike in most professions and trades if six or seven weeks' pay was stopped in the same way without any reason whatever. When we have millions of money to dispose of, justice should be done to members of this Parliament, and also to Tasmania; but that justice should be done at once; there should be no long-drawn-out payments to the people of a necessitous State. I make a final appeal to the Treasurer to give the Committee some information. Tact and courtesy are very necessary qualifications for a Minister, and the exercise of a little tact by the right honorable gentleman just now would greatly assist the passage of this Bill through Parliament. If the right honorable gentleman persists in his supercilious, sneering, and cynical attitude towards honorable members on this side, I suppose we shall have to put up with it; but it will only hasten the downfall of the Government, which, no doubt, the public would be glad to see. I again congratulate my honorable friends from Tasmania upon their success in the carrying out of a thankless task for the benefit of ungrateful citizens. </para>

          <para>. - lb is not my intention to delay the Committee. I hope the resolution and the Bill will go through rapidly, and that Tasmania will be given the justice she is entitled to. The majority of the people of that State are grateful indeed to the Fisher Government for the measure of justice given them, but a section of the people wished to have- it believed that the Fisher Government had robbed Tasmania of about £400,000. The majority of the people of the State did not believe that, and notwithstanding the expenditure of large sums of money, and the strong op.position brought against him, we find the -honorable member for Bass again  returned  with the respect of all sections of th© people, for his efforts in securing this  special grant. I wish to say, with all the emphasis at my command, that the representatives of Tasmania, on both sides, in this Parliament have in this matter but the one. object in view, and that is to secure for. their State the grant  of £900,000 recommended by the Commission. I hope that honorable members generally will assist us to secure this money for Tasmania to enable her to tide over a very trying time, and that for this purpose' the Treasurer will see his way clear to give the State the larger sums at this particular time. This would be invaluable to Tasmania, because she has spent a considerable amount of borrowed money on public works that are not immediately reproductive. As soon as they  become  so, we shall be able to retain our population ia the- richest State, for its size, of any in the Commonwealth. I want  honorable  members to display a Federal spirit. Recently, in another State, I heard nothing but jealousy of a neighbouring State,- and we were told of the course which that State would have followed if the Fleet had called first at her ports. We should do what I found the Canadians doing when I met them. Wherever they are found, Canadians, are Canadians all the time. Even those of French descent, coming  from  Quebec, regard Canada as. their country,, and not merely the State of  Quebec.  The sooner we do away with  our State jealousies, ' the better it ' will be for Australia. </para>

            <para>- Is that the reason there are so many unfortunate persons in Tasmania who are not educated ? That benighted State has a lake in the centre of it from which, power could be transmitted to any point, and yet the infamous laws which have operated there have made that splendid little island a mendicant among the States. I am glad to know that owing to the action of the late Government, and the efforts of the honorable member for Bass, Tasmania is to receive a grant of £900,000 during a period of ten years. That little island has been blessed, with a soil as black as coal, and it possesses water-power second to none in Australia, and second only to New </para>

        <para class="block">Zealand, south of the line. The Treasurer, notwithstanding his wonderful Budget - a Budget of boom, borrow, and burst - proposes to borrow £3,080,000, and offers to pay to Tasmania a paltry sum of £5,000 during the first year that this additional grant is to operate. Why does he not say that the Government will give Tasmania the whole additional £400,000 during that year ? If he will take up that attitude, he will be able to claim my vote. I do not believe in this cheese-paring policy under which Tasmania is to be granted £5,000 this year, £10,000 next year, and £15,000 the following year, thus leaving the bulk of the total grant provided' for in this Bill to be found by another Treasurer. Where is the brave old political warrior described by the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> to be discerned in a proposal of that sort? Does not Tasmania hold her own in mineral wealth ? Is not the north-west of that State known throughout the world for its mineral wealth ? Then from the stand-point of agricultural products, the land will grow anything. Honorable members may think that I am rather hard upon the Treasurer. But we all remember the unctuous tones in which he told us that £25,000,000 worth of minerals were being annually taken from the Commonwealth. Why, a little country only half the size of Tasmania takes for her produce every year no less a sum than £24,000,000 from Great Britain. That country is Denmark, where, during seven months of each year, people have to house their stock. Id some parts of Tasmania the owners of stock have not to do that. </para>

            <para>- But Victoria is so much larger that the comparison would not be fair. Denmark embraces an area of only 15,582 square miles, as against 26,215 square miles comprised in Tasmania; and yet the former obtains for her produce, each year, more than the total value of the gold output of Australia. What is the nature of that produce ? It consists of eggs, poultry', butter, <inline font-style="italic">&amp;.c,</inline> all of which can be produced in Tasmania. Then, in the matter of fruit, we know perfectly well that Tasmania can produce apples equal to any produced in the world. She holds her own in the markets of the world, and sometimes leads the world in the high prices which she obtains for her apples. The Federal land tax will, I hope, open up a new era of prosperity in that little island. If I have spoken severely this afternoon, it is because the hand of the dead past is still controlling Tasmania in a way that it ought not to control her. Why this cheese-paring policy of granting to that State £5,000 during the current year out of the total of £400,000? The present Government were going to be very economical in their administration. They were going to teach the spendthrift Governments of the past how to administer the affairs of the country, notwithstanding that, the Fisher Government never borrowed a penny piece. In the face of all this, the Treasurer has' the audacity to ask Parliament to sanction a loan for £3,000,000, and to tell his Tasmanian supporters that the Government will grant that State £5,000 this year, and - if they continue in office - £10,000 next year, and £15,000 during the third year. Such conduct is unworthy of the Government. At the instance of the Fisher Ministry, this Parliament granted Tasmania a sum of £500,000- </para>

            <para>- Then, under the Bill which the Government now seek to introduce, at least, £40,000 should be paid to that State during the present year. Is not £5,000 a paltry sum to grant her, especially when the Treasurer is about to borrow £3,000,000 ? If the right honorable gentleman will borrow another £500,000 and pay this £400,000 to Tasmania at once, I will vote for the proposal. I wish that little island State every success, and I am sorry that it has been in the Slough of Despond for years.

            <para>- The honorable member is not just. He knows that, under the resolution passed during last Parliament, and made one of our standing orders, an honorable member is precluded from speaking longer than a certain time, and that no "stone-walling" can take place in those circumstances. I maintain that last session honorable members voted away their privileges to a very large extent. But the point I was about to make when the Treasurer interrupted me was that I would not be surprised if, instead of the schedule in the Bill to be introduced being based upon that which we find recorded in the Budget speech, the discussion that has taken place this afternoon will reverse the order of things, and instead of the smaller sum of £5,000 being paid to Tasmania in the first year, it will be £80,000, dwindling down in future years to the £5,000. I am certain that if the honorable member for Franklin desired a friend to be helpful, and that friend came forward, and offered him a mean little sum, though he required a larger sum, the honorable member would say, " You are not the kind of friend I took you to be." Yet that is the attitude of the present Ministry towards honorable members representing Tasmania, and towards Tasmania itself. I hope the schedule will be altered. The matter of granting assistance to Tasmania is not new. As far back as 1903, appeals for assistance to Tasmania were made in both Houses of the Commonwealth Parliament by the then honorable members representing Tasmania. I take it that Tasmania was then beginning to feel the effects of the first Tariff Bill, and the effect of a small State entering into a large Union, which must be considerable in the initial stages of that Union's history. From time to time, I presume, during 1903, honorable members representing Tasmania urged on the Treasurer of the day that some assistance should be granted to Tasmania, but evidently their appeals fell on deaf ears for many years. The present Treasurer occupied the same honorable position in previous Governments, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner and others have filled the position, but to all the appeals made by Tasmanian representatives, Fusion or Liberal Governments turned a deaf ear. </para>

The money was there to allot; and instead of having to wait for twelve years, and lose a good portion of money all this time, Tasmania could have been granted assistance in 1903 ; but the numerous appeals made for assistance were all resisted. </para>

He must have turned up the records in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and in the parliamentary papers, and been thoroughly satisfied, as a member of that Royal Commission, before that paragraph was incorporated in the report. The paragraph shows that, as far back as 1903, some reference had been made to the financial position of Tasmania owing to the operation of the Tariff. No doubt applications were repeated from year to year, but the Treasurers of the day turned deaf ears to them. </para>

        </quote>
        <para class="block">It seems from this that after elaborate evidence was placed before the Treasurer, in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin's</inline> absence at the Imperial Conference, the right honorable gentleman came to the conclusion that Tasmania was not entitled to any consideration so far as the Customs leakage loss was concerned, and that the State should go to Victoria and New South Wales, who were chiefly benefiting by the trade they were transacting with her, for the assistance she required. In fact, the right honorable gentleman deliberately turned down the Tasmanian appeal; he showed callous indifference to the needs of Tasmania. The State should have received assistance many years earlier, but it was not until- a Labour Government came into power that the Commonwealth came to her aid. There has been a slight lapse of memory on the part of many Tasmanians, but when they come to read the report of this debate they will realize that the first Government to render the State financial assistance was the Fisher Administration. It provided for a grant of ?500,000, with a first payment of ?95,000:. The present Administration is providing as a first payment only ?5,000, leaving it to another generation almost to pay the larger instalments. This Ministry has not taken a very big financial burden on its shoulders in connexion with the payments to Tasmania. But what we should do is to assist the States in our years of prosperity, when the Treasury is overflowing, as it is now, largely because of the successful management of affairs by the Fisher Government. The present Government received a legacy from its predecessor such as no other Government in any part- of the world has received. When the honorable member for Melbourne was speaking in glowing terms of the wonderful resources of " the tight little island," the honorable member for Wimmera interjected, ' ' Tasmania is a good country, but need's money." We, on this side, wish to give Tasmania a little more than the Treasurer proposes to give. When in Tasmania some time ago, I met a large number of electors there, and one of the questions put to me was why, seeing that the Royal Commission recommended a grant of ?900,000, did the Fisher Government provide for a grant of only ?500,000? My reply was that that grant was not the end of the matter, and that if at any time the State would come forward and show that her claims had not been fully satisfied, or produce evidence that a larger sum was needed, I, for one, would be only too glad to assist in getting a larger grant. Of course, in saying that, I was expressing my individual opinion. This Government is doing only what I believe the Fisher Government would have done had it remained in power ; but the Fisher  Government would have been more liberal </para>

            <para>- That money came in afterwards. My only complaint is that the Treasurer is making the first instalment of the proposed grant too small. The little State of Tasmania came into the Union without claiming any special treatment, and for many years suffered immense loss. In the country from which I caine, States which found themselves embarrassed had not to declare themselves paupers; they had not to beg of the Federation for assistance. The Treasurers helped them indirectly, without letting the world know. When the population of those States increased, and prosperity set in, they again assumed the position of substantial integral portions of the Union on an honorary basis. </para>

            <para>- Necessitous States never have to ask for an appropriation. The American people recognise that part of a nation cannot be bankrupt without it affecting the credit of the whole nation. That was not recognised before the war, because then America was only a half-Union country, some persons thinking it a Confederation, and others a Federation. The submission of the case by the South to the arbitrament of war settled the question, and made a great Union. Ever since, the States have stood by each other ; all for each and each for all. If the Treasurer could make the first instalment of the proposed grant £40,000, that would provide interest for a loan of £1,000,000 for great developmental works. </para>

            <para>- Last year, I was only one of ten; the members of an Administration must stand together. Of course, Tasmania must take what it can get, but if the  first  instalment were made larger, the State could enter upon many enterprises that would produce revenue. If it were able to borrow at a reasonable rate for the construction of reproductive works, it would have a larger revenue- to expend. </para>

            <para>- Perhaps she is, but I have the right to express my views, and I have had some experience in finance. My remarks are not due to any enmity towards the Treasurer. I am not trying to drive poisoned arrows into his cranium. But I have a proposition to make. I am more of a business man than I am of a politician. I do not know much about politics, and I want to know less. But I know a little about business. If the first instalment were increased, the Commonwealth would be committed to the later instalments. But if the first payment is only £5,000, a subsequent Government, or even this Government, may decline to go on with the grant. If you get a deposit of only a few shillings in regard to a contract, you may find the contractor dropping his work, and it is the same with this matter. I have brought the subject before the Treasurer already, this being no new idea with me. If we cannot get £40,000 for the first instalment, we might perhaps get £30,000. This would enable Tasmania to go into the market and borrow sufficient to build a railway to Balfour, and to extend the line from Flowerdale into the interior. It will not be denied that Tasmania has suffered financially. Are we to understand that the Royal Commission, with the honorable member for Bass as  Chairman,  and with all grades, and degrees, and kinds of Christians that composed it, made a unanimous recommendation which it did not want to have carried into effect? Its report was the first unanimous report from a Royal Commission that has ever been laid before this House, and it recommended a grant of £900,000. I have always been in favour of that recommendation being complied with. If I had been Treasurer I would have paid the money in the morning, and there would have been no talk about the matter. Let the little State get the money in such a way that we shall know it is there for all time. I have no ill-feeling in the matter. If the Treasurer cannot, or will not, give way, we hope that he will think over our suggestion. Even if he should decide to give only £25,000, at any rate, let him give that which will mean a commitment of £400,000. </para>

          <para>.- I intend to support the Government in this matter, because one cannot look a gift horse in the mouth and ask how old the horse is, as long as he will carry one. The proposal of the Government means that the Tasmanian Government are to get from the Commonwealth £90,000 a year until a total sum of £900,000 is paid. That is a nice little nest-egg for the State to have coming in every year. I think it is justly entitled to the money, because its representatives on both sides of the Chamber have convinced me that, as regards trading concerns, the State is only a suburb of Melbourne. These "drummers" from Melbourne- </para>

            <para>- What else are they? They " drum " the State from one end to the other. Tasmania is in this position, that it cannot hold its own like the other States can do. These " drummers" have to go to other States because the competition is so keen; but in Tasmania that is not the case. It is very easy for the "drummers" to get across Bass Strait, and now the Postmaster-General has promised a daily service with Tasmania it will be still harder for the State to hold its own against the Flinders-lane people. </para>

            <para>- We are not going to be so small because the Government have brought forward this proposal, are we ? I said, in the first place, that Tasmania should have got the £900,000; in fact, I do not think it is enough. If these factories were in good going order in Tasmania, instead of in Victoria and New South Wales, where they are doing a big business, they would have to pay income tax, and the wages of the employes would be paid in Tasmania. </para>

            <para>- They would have to pay all taxation, no matter 'from what source it might come. Tasmania would get the benefit of the manufacturers paying the taxes, the benefit of the people consuming the different goods which were manufactured there, and the benefit of the people spending the wages earned in the State. What benefit does it get out of the wages that are earned in New South Wales or Victoria ? That is the only way in which we could equalize things. I do not see anything in the Bill to cavil at. In fact, I am very pleased indeed that the Government have done something in this direction. I, in common with honorable members on each side of the House, would have liked to see the annual payments made larger, but, as I said before, the Government are only equalizing the payments so that Tasmania shall get £90,000 a year. </para>

          <para>.- I desire to congratulate the Government upon bringing down this proposal, and, on behalf of Tasmania, to thank them for complying with the recommendation of the Royal Commission which was appointed to inquire into its financial position since Federation. As a representative of that State, I resent the action of any honorable member in classifying it as a necessitous State. </para>

I feel sure that had he participated in the inquiry, and had the pleasure of examining witnesses, he would have fallen in with the other members of the Commission, and become a willing signatory to the recommendation. </para>

            <para>- Yes, thoroughly. I congratulate the Government upon their proposal to give Tasmania £900,000, but I wish to point out that they are not entirely carrying out the recommendations of the Commission. If they will do that, as T desire they should, it will make a difference to Tasmania straight away. The Commission recommended that the £900,000 should be paid during the following ten years. We recommended, for instance, that in the year 1911-12 the State should get £120,000, but the Fisher Administration awarded only £95,000. Now the present Government are in power, and our award was that the State should receive £115,000 this year, but instead of that it is to get only £90,000. £85,000 under the Act passed by the Fisher Government, and £5,000 from the present Government. As  Chairman  of the Royal Commission, I would ask the Government to carry out our recommendation in its entirety by paying this money in the instalments which we suggested. If Tasmania is entitled to this grant, as she certainly is, in my opinion, she has a right to receive it .as. soon as possible. If the Treasurer will promise to carry out our recommendations in this regard, I shall sit down at once, and make no reference to the unkind things said about me and my party at the last general election. The Tasmanian press then denounced me in the most scandalous way for being associated with the Labour party, and allowing Tasmania, as they said, to go to the dogs. They tried to take from me the little kudos due to me for my action in securing the appointment of the Commission. They made malicious and treacherous statements concerning our party, even going so far as to criticise the way in which the ex-Speaker and the  ex-Chairman of Committees controlled the business of the Chamber. They asserted that I had jockeyed the honorable member for Wilmot out of the credit of being the first to place on the business-paper a notice of motion regarding Tasmania's financial position. But I say now, in front of the honorable member, that until the present session he never had on the business-paper a notice of motion with regard to this matter. </para>

            <para>- During the recent campaign the Labour Government and its supporters were classed with robbers and thieves for their action in regard to Tasmania. -Notwithstanding that the then Prime Minister, the honorable member for Wide Bay, stated from the public platform that if he saw that Tasmania was in need of more money he would bring in a Bill to grant the full amount recommended by the Commission, members of the State Ministry were mean enough to denounce our party as robbers and thieves, who were doing an injustice to Tasmania. I am here to praise the Government for the action they are now' taking) but I am here also to defend my party from malicious attacks such as those to  which  it was subjected during the last election. I shall reserve until the second-reading stage the further remarks that I desire to make in regard to this matter, and shall conclude by congratulating the Government on their proposal to grant Tasmania the balance of the amount which the Royal Commission recommended she should receive. </para>

            <para>- The Treasurer is solely responsible for what has taken place this afternoon. He had an opportunity to give the Committee the information for which we asked, but he failed to do so. We know quite well that the Treasurer and his colleagues are capable of deception in every form, and I wish to learn whether this is merely a political move on their part? Is this Bill being introduced merely with the object of advertising in Tasmania a desire on the part of this Government to spoon-feed that State to an even greater extent than the late Government did? I objected to the grant of £500,000 proposed by the Fisher Government, not because I did not want Tasmania to get justice, but because, after carefully considering the report of the Royal Commission, I thought it was clearly proved that, during the ten years following the establishment of Federation, the island State, at the very most, had not lost more than £120,000 by reason of Customs leakages. </para>

Whilst Tasmania has undoubtedly lost something as the result of Federation', no one can say that her losses have amounted to £900,000. </para>

            <para>- I do not know about that, but the report shows that the Commission recommended a grant of £900,000, not to make good Customs leakages, but because Tasmania was a necessitous State. Later on, the Premier of Tasmania had not the manliness to appeal to this Parliament for assistance to Tasmania as a necessitous State, but in a roundabout way applied for something which he seemed to think Tasmania had a right to receive. He applied for a grant which he thought, apparently, he could obtain from the Fisher Government, backed up by the three representatives of Tasmania on this side of the House, who, if they had had the chance, would have robbed the rest of Australia, not of £500,000, but of £5,000,000, in order to give it to Tasmania. The cry of the horse-leech's daughter for more, more, more, was nothing as compared with the demands of these three honorable members. </para>

            <para>- The honorable member for Bass and the honorable member for Denison were bad enough, but the long-haired brother would have been even worse if he had had a chance.- We all know that Tasmania has no more right to be regarded as a separate State of the Commonwealth than has my constituency. I doubt whether the population of Tasmania is as great as that of my electorate alone ; yet she has five representatives in this House and six in another place. The State ought to have been tacked on to Victoria; but when the suggestion was made twenty-five years ago, the Conservatives who ruled Victoria were looked upon by the crusted old Tories who controlled affairs in Tasmania as  dynamitards.  The trouble with Tasmania is that, ever since she obtained responsible government, she has been owned and controlled by the greatest Tories that the English system could produce in any community. A few families ruled the State for years. They had their direct representatives in the State Parliament, and by legislation of the most Conservative character they blocked the progress of the country. There is hardly an acre of bad land in Tasmania ; her agricultural resources are very great, and her mineral possibilities are enormous ; but the reason why they have not been developed, and she is obliged to come here and ask for a further grant from the Commonwealth, is that she has been ruled by Tories since she has enjoyed responsible government. I am not one of those who belittle their opponents, and I credit the present Federal Government with being fairly long-sighted. They know that the day of the Tory in the State Parliament is almost past. The writing is on the wall. The past elections have shown that in a State in which, seven or eight years ago, there was not a single representative of Labour in the local Parliament, there are to-day fourteen Labour representatives out of a total of thirty. The Government can see that, in the very near future, the Tory party must pass, and a Labour Government assume control. When a Labour Government do come into power in that State, they will not ask the Commonwealth to assist them, but will decide that they should pay their own way, as do the other States of Australia.. The Government propose to .give Tasmania as little as they can while they are in power, leaving the larger amounts to be paid when they have been supplanted by the party on this side. </para>

If there is one member of this House who, more than another, can claim to be an adept at carrying out that which he charges us with doing, it is the honorable gentleman.

I find that honorable members from that State can deal with one another better than a Victorian can deal with them. </para>

            <para>- I am tired of having to recognise that Victorians are the only Australians in the Commonwealth. The representatives of the other States seem to me to look upon Australia as something good to bleed, and they bleed the Commonwealth in every direction whenever they can. I am getting tired of it. There are three points to be considered in connexion with this matter. First of all, the Treasurer should give us some information concerning the Bill at this stage. The Prime Minister has said that this is not the stage at which the "information for ' which we ask is usually given. I am not an old Parliamentarian, but I know enough of parliamentary usage to be certain that this procedure was established for a definite reason. The practice of the past must have proved the necessity for it, and I «an conceive of no other reason than that it affords an opportunity to explain why the proposed Bill should be introduced. </para>

            <para>- It is only during the last few years that unionism has wrested something like fair wages from the Tories of Tasmania. During the last few years, the Victorian miners who went over to that State formed the Miners Association, and wrested their rights from the Tories of the State. There is scarcely any trade or calling in which the wages paid in Tasmania are not less by shillings per day than those paid on the mainland. Yet, with all their cheap labour, they have never been able to develop the resources of the State, because Tory Governments have controlled its affairs. </para>

            <para>- And that is why they offer Tasmania a paltry sum of £5,000 during the present financial year. I am surprised that the Attorney-General,, with his breadth of mind and keen sympathies, should vote for a Bill of this description. If the Government wish to prove their sincerity in this matter, they will vote a substantial sum to Tasmania straight away. They are endeavouring: to convince the people of Australia that they lean towards "the weaker States. This Bill is merely another political dodge. I do not say that it constitutes corruption, but it certainly goes so close to it that one can scarcely distinguish between the two things. Many honorable members opposite did not entertain too kindly a feeling towards the proposal of the Fisher Government to grant Tasmania a sum of £500,000. They bitterly opposed that proposition. Yet they are dumb now. They are Caucus-ridden. They have been deprived of their independence and rights. </para>

            <para>- The honorable member need not trouble about the majority for this Bill. I shall vote for it; but in Committee I shall move to double the amount. Seeing that I can get- no answer from the Treasurer, who sits like something on a pedestal too high for honorable members to appeal to him for an explanation as to why he gave <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> instructions to give that reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap,</inline> I would like to know from the Attorney-General what has happened since the 13th August to bring about this change of opinion. The answer given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> conveys more than appears on the surface. This change of front shows that the Government are determined to hang on to the flesh-pots of office at the sacrifice of any principle, or any decision. They cannot expect us to swallow it without protest. If they carry on like this, their supporters will have a great deal to answer for. Whether the Treasurer cares to reply or not, or whether the Attorney-General sits with a placid and self-satisfied air, matters little; individual members of the Ministerial party, when they get on the platform, and the electors put the acid on them and ask why they have supported a Government that changes its mind in six weeks, what can they say? All they can say is, " We do not know why the Government did it, but you sent us in to support that Government whether they did right or wrong, and we have done what you told us to do, and have carried these measures, believing we were carrying out your behest." What confidence can we place in the measures placed before the House by a Government prepared to say one thing today and another thing to-morrow ? Is it fair to ask honorable members to take a blank cheque from a Government that do not know their own mind ? Is it fair, as a matter of common, decent dealing ? Was the Postmaster-General a party to giving this reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> ? I hear not a word from him. The Treasurer says he put something in the Budget relating to this matter, but we cannot mix up the Budget with this question. The two things do not run on the same lines. </para>

            <para>- I desire to correct, in the few minutes that are left to me, a wrong impression that may have been created by something that occurred before the dinner adjournment. The honorable member for Franklin referred to an amendment that he moved when the Bill of the last Government was in Committee, increasing the grant to Tasmania by £70,000. I voted for the grant proposed by the Government, namely, £500,000; but I did not vote for his amendment, because I understood that it was merely a political manoeuvre, and I was not to be caught. I claim credit for not being trapped by that amendment, just as I claim credit for giving relief to Tasmania by voting for the original proposition of the Fisher Government. I hope that when the Treasurer is in charge of another Bill he will take honorable members into his confidence, and tell us what it contains, instead of compelling us to find out, as best we can, for ourselves. The right honorable gentleman is always magnanimous, except when he is introducing a Bill; and if, at such times, he showed a little courteous condescension, and gave us a little information, his work would be much easier. The Government, I understand, propose to give to Tasmania this year a paltry £5,000 ; but no provision is made for the expenditure on the Estimates, so what guarantee have we that the money will be paid? I have already pointed out* that the  Minister  of Defence, in another place, told <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> that it was not intended to increase the grant to Tasmania, because the arrangement made by the Fisher Government had eight years to run. When a Government are so lost to all sense of what is right and just that they will, within six weeks, go back on a statement, and declare black to be white, and white to be no colour at all, it cannot be expected that honorable members will readily accept their promises. Those who have big responsibilities on their shoulders should not perform their duties in the slip-shod way which the Treasurer follows in introducing measures. I trust that this will be the last time that I shall have to speak on the subject. Honorable members opposite envy my freedom in this respect. They are like dumb-stricken brutes, unable to speak. They are muzzled. </para>

When delivering my Budget speech, I said that the Commonwealth expenditure had grown so large that it was no longer possible to pay for all public works out of revenue, and that it would be necessary to meet part of the expenditure from loan funds. The works to be provided for in this way are all of a permanent character, and such as are properly chargeable to loan funds. Those who have been members of State Parliaments will have had experience of measures of this kind. The first work that is to be provided for in this way is the railway from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta, for which it is proposed to borrow £1,400,000. I have been informed that about £1,500,000 will be required for that railway during the present financial year, and as there is a balance from last year in hand, we shall have sufficient authorization for the current year. </para>

            <para>- The honorable member is aware that the estimated cost of the whole line is about £4,000,000, and I should say that this authorization should complete about 350 miles. We propose to borrow another £400,000 for the construction of  a  railway in the Northern Territory, from Pine Creek to the Katherine River. The survey of  a  route for the line was sanctioned by the last Parliament, and in making arrangements for the construction of the railway this Government is carrying out an undertaking practically approved by the last Parliament. I believe that the length of the line will be about 60 miles, and its construction will probably cost not more than £5,000 a mile. </para>

            <para>- I think that the working railways are in the control of the Northern Territory Administration, which is under the External Affairs Department. The next item is one for the construction of a railway of about twenty miles in length from Port Moresby, in Papua, to Astrolabe, and the erection of wharfs at' Port Moresby and Samarai. It is believed that a railway between those two points will greatly assist agricultural development, as well as the copper mines which exist in the district to be served. </para>

I do not know the width of the gauge which is to be adopted, but I should say that it will probably be 3 ft. 6 in. </para>

            <para>- Yes, we will. Tins is an appropriation only for the purpose of the railway, and the money will be raised and spent as it is required. We could not enter into ah arrangement to build the line unless we had a vote authorizing us to make a survey and generally to prepare to carry out the work. That is the ordinary way. Before the Government can build a railway or any other great public work, it must get parliamentary sanction for the expenditure before it undertakes the work itself, otherwise it might undertake a work for which there was no money legally available, or commence a work of which Parliament might not approve afterwards. </para>

The Postmaster-General will tell honorable members about the proposed expenditure on land for post-offices, and the proposed expenditure on conduits for laying wires underground. The Honorary Minister will explain the expenditure on defence generally, and on machinery and machine shops, and the construction of wharfs at Cockatoo Island, at a cost of £175,000; and the Minister of Home Affairs will indicate the expenditure on railways, while the expenditure in regard to the London Offices will be explained by the Minister of External Affairs. I do not think it is expected of me, at this stage, to go into details of all these matters. I am quite willing, indeed anxious, to give any information I possess; but I really think that that is not necessary at this time, as I am merely asking for leave to introduce the measure. If honorable members think that these works are such as will conduce to the prosperity and advancement of the country, I ask them to give me leave to introduce the Bill, and on its second reading I shall give all details, and in Committee still further details. </para>

When previously in office honorable members opposite attempted to borrow £3,500,000 for the purpose of building a Fleet; but that policy, they found Out, was not tenable, and, with that .peculiar ability which, I believe, characterizes certain American politicians, and which is indicated in the couplet - </para>

On this occasion they do not propose to borrow for fleet-building purposes. As a matter of fact, it is difficult to find out whether they intend to make any additions to our Fleet, either by borrowing or in any other way, although I remember the Prime Minister's statement, when before the electors, in respect of additions to the Fleet. At that time he possibly felt it necessary to say something as a counterpoint to what was said by the party on this side of the House. But, so far as the Fleet is concerned, I have not yet been able to discover whether it is the intention of the Government to proceed with additions, or merely to complete the first unit now in hand, and then have a period of calm. </para>

            <para>- It is not quite raised in this measure, hut the question of loans, as indicated previously when the honorable gentleman was in office, is raised in that we find that the Government propose to borrow for other than Fleet purposes. I merely instance this in order to show that the germ of borrowing is still running in a most lively way through the honorable gentleman's arteries, and apparently breaks out in various directions. </para>

            <para>- I do not suggest" that, because of the opposition which may come from the honorable member for Werriwa, they should be vaccinated in any way in order to kill this germ. Nevertheless, it has broken out afresh. We find that the Government propose to borrow for certain purposes. The Prime Minister will not object to my making it clear that honorable members opposite, with their Ministry, propose to spend every penny which they estimate to receive during the current year. That amounts to £21,462,000. Honorable gentlemen on the other side practically contested the elections on the point of economy. Their complaints and their allegations respecting the expenditure indulged in by the previous Administration were loud and long, and the ear of the public was tickled, as also were a very large number of persons frightened, by the references to colossal expenditure. " Torrential," for instance, was the word used by the Attorney-General to describe the expenditure. The Prime Minister said we had indulged in "a financial carnival." Being himself a political coryphee, that would appeal naturally to him. And the Treasurer used a different word entirely. He said that we had indulged in "a financial debauch." Those were the three principal words with which the public were alarmed, and with which it is reasonable to believe honorable gentlemen frightened a number of electors into voting otherwise than they might have done. On this occasion, the Government propose to spend every penny they conceive will be brought in- £21,462,000. Not satisfied with that' situation, honorable gentlemen opposite - and this indicates the hollowness a.nd the sham of their utterances at the general elections - propose to expend the comfortable little nest-egg we left them amounting to no less than £2,652,000. That is in addition to the money which they estimate they will receive. </para>

            <para>- On the Budget, I intend to deal in detail with matters of this description ; but these are just general references for the special edification of the Prime Minister, who was most prolific in his allegations respecting expenditure on this side, and who was particularly acute - I might almost say cunning - in his innuendoes concerning the expenditure by the previous Administration. He left much to the imagination and to the fears of the electors. Whilst on several occasions we were able to catch him making reasonably definite statements, and to prove conclusively that they were inaccurate, the honorable gentleman was fairly ready in denying the accuracy of reports of his speeches which appeared in his own party newspapers. In addition to spending every penny that they estimate to receive, as well as the surplus of £2,652,000 which we left them, these honorable members, who sought the suffrages of the people on statements that they were going to put a safe check upon, and to reduce, the expenditure of the Commonwealth, now propose to borrow a further sum of £3,080,000. If an expenditure of £22,000,000 in round figures was, as they allege, either " torrential," a " financial carnival," or a " financial debauch," on our part, how shall we characterize this proposed expenditure of £27,000,000 by the present Administration? </para>

            <para>- While the irresponsible member for Parkes will make statements as to our imposing fresh taxation, the Prime Minister will not. I should like to ask the Prime Minister whether he supports the honorable member for Parkes in the contention that a revision of the Tariff would mean extra taxation ? If that is so, my retort is that honorable members opposite, the honorable member for Werriwa alone excepted, are equally committed. Are we to understand that if the present Ministry brings in a proposal for the revision of the Tariff their supporters will not be behind them ? . </para>

            <para>- If within three months the Government propose to spend everything they can lay their hands on, and to borrow every penny they can, what, in the name of fortune, will they do if the electors allow them to remain in office for three years ? I fear that the country will be reduced to a state of financial chaos which, whilst alarming, will not be without its redeeming feature. It will lay bare the awful incapacity of the present Ministry. The hollowness of their cries to the electors will be exposed, and they will stand before the people as financial shams of the most horrible kind. First of all, the Treasurer proposes to borrow £1,400,000 for the purposes of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway. </para>

            <para>- Beyond all doubt, this amount cannot be expended within the financial year, three months of which have already expired. Why, then, does the right honorable member propose to borrow it? Do the Government desire to show the electors more plainly than ever that every statement they made during the last election campaign, in reference to the finances, was misleading? We are asked to permit the Government to borrow money which they cannot expend within the period named. Then we have a proposal to borrow £400,000 for the Northern Territory railway, and also £60,000 for the Port Moresby railway. Does the honorable member who asked a question just now in regard to commitments suggest that we committed the present Government to the last-named expenditure ? </para>

            <para>- I come now to two  or three other items which, for the first time in the history of the Commonwealth, are included under the heading of "Loans." We have, first of all, an item with regard to the purchase of land for post and telegraph purposes. Perhaps the Treasurer feels that he is justified in. making this proposal, in view of the fact that the late Government purchased the Post-office site in Perth out of loan money. We did so, however, because it was clear that the purchase of that site would return 5 per cent, interest on the outlay. </para>

            <para>- I am not touching those items. I am dealing only with three of these proposals. Apparently, the Ministry is about to introduce the policy of borrowing to buy all land required for post and telegraph purposes, since, during this a year, they propose to expend out of loan  moneys  £170,000 in that direction. Those honorable members who are in the good graces of the Government, and who desire the purchase of allotments in their electorates - allotments on which some future Ministry may erect post-offices - should go quickly to the -Treasurer, because, if thiss Bill passes, he will have £170,000 with which to purchase land all over the country for such purposes, and which he hopes, possibly, will have a placating effect. Unless the Ministry can demonstrate clearly that the purchase of these lands out of loan account will give a clear return in the shape of interest over and above the ordinary rates, after providing for a sinking fund which will mean the redemption of the loan within a specified time, I regret that they should set out upon what is practically a new policy - that they should place the Commonwealth under an indebtedness in respect of loans of which all previous Governments have been able to steer clear. </para>

            <para>- I am not now dealing with the Federal Territory, but I can quite understand that the honorable member can get no other idea into his head. I leave him to the tender mercies of the honorable member for Wimmera. That honorable member will find that the present Government propose to spend £285,000 on the Federal Capital, as against an expenditure of £137,000 by the previous Government, and in supporting them he will, no doubt, find his opportunity to make . good to the electors, his pledge to stop further expenditure in. that direction. I quite fail to understand his present mental condition when I find him sitting behind a Government proposing to increase expenditure upon the Federal Capital, and I shall fail also to understand the condition of mind of his electors if they do not protest against his action. There is another proposal to purchase land for defence purposes from borrowed money. </para>

            <para>- To be quite frank with the Treasurer, I do not know why he desires to spend so much money. When we spent £22,000,000, that was said to be a " financial debauch," and I ask the Treasurer to find for me a suitable word to characterize the proposed expenditure of £27,000,000 by the present Government. Another item of loan expenditure is £425,000 for the construction of conduits and the laying of wires underground. </para>

            <para>- The honorable member for Parkes considers underground engineering' virtuous, and perhaps it does appeal to the honorable member in that way. The Government propose to spend only £425,000 in connexion with this item. I take no exception whatever to the construction of conduits and the laying of wires, but I do take exception to the expenditure being met from loan money when the cost of similar work undertaken by previous Governments has been met from revenue. During the last three years, the expenditure from revenue in this way met all reasonable requirements. </para>

The Government propose an entirely new policy, which must ultimately involve a considerable increase in the indebtedness of the Commonwealth; and, in characteristic fashion, they propose to pass it on to posterity. We seldom find them meeting their political obligations in the ordinary sense; and they are now doing their best to relieve themselves of the necessity of meeting their financial obligations. They propose to commit for all time succeeding Ministries, and the people of the Commonwealth, to indebtedness, and they make no provision whatever for the repayment of these loans. </para>

          <para>.- I shall not detain honorable members much longer. The Treasurer asked me what item I would strike out of the Estimates of expenditure. Personally, I say that I object emphatically to the proposed alteration of the policy which has been pursued for the last twelve or thirteen years of constructing works and making purchases of land from revenue. In the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of yesterday, honorable members on this side were asked if they objected to the colossal expenditure proposed by the Fusion Government, to mention the particular items to which they objected. That was precisely the stand we took a few months ago when before the electors. We were being charged with extravagant expenditure. No details were given, but millions were spoken of, and the public mind was considerably disturbed. At the time, we asked the <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> and every honorable member opposite, to tell the electors which  line  of expenditure undertaken, or proposed to be undertaken, by the late Government they objected to. They were absolutely unable to reply. The Budget which has just been introduced indicates clearly that, not only were the members of the present Government not opposed 'to any one lies of expenditure proposed or undertaken by the late Government, but they have added to the lines of expenditure, and also to the total amount. It ill-becomes any member of the Ministry, or any of their press organs in the circumstances, to ask us which line of expenditure included in the present Government's Estimates we would strike out. It is for the Government and their supporters to "make good" to the electors. If their promises aud pledges are so unstable, and they think so lightly of what they said to secure office that they will break their promises ruthlessly at the first opportunity, it is for them to explain. I do not know the form the proposed Bill will take. If it is of an open character, permitting the Treasurer to borrow either from the Note Fund, the Trust Funds, or' from some outside source, the right honorable gentleman must expect opposition from this side; but if, on the other hand, it confines the Government to borrowing from the Note Fund, or from the Commonwealth Trust Funds, it is possible that there will not be any serious exception taken to such borrowing, unless it be that honorable members take exception to the new form of policy, namely, constructing out of loans certain works that were previously constructed nut of revenue. I think the right honorable gentleman hinted in his Budget speech that if the Note Fund and Trust Funds were not sufficient to meet the loan of £3,080,000, he would go elsewhere, and, so far as I am personally concerned, he must look for the most strenuous opposition if he proposes to go elsewhere. On the other hand, a condition that would confine him to borrowing from our own resources would be most wise, for he could borrow with much greater advantage. </para>

            <para>- With the exception of the loans from the Note Fund, the money was borrowed from Trust Funds, which we had built up during our three years' term of office. On this occasion, the Government propose to spend £6,000,000 more than they estimate to receive, not from any surplus that they themselves put by, but from our surplus. And yet, by some curious mental process, they alleged during the last election that wo were guilty of extravagant expenditure. To borrow from those two funds is safer than to go elsewhere. ' It can be done at a more reasonable rate, while still allowing the fund to earn reasonable and fair interest, and permitting of provision for a redemption fund. It is safer to borrow from one's own savings than from other persons. . </para>

            <para>- Did the right honorable member expect us to keep the money idle, or throw it in the gutter, or follow his example by spending it merely for spending's sake? Our method of financing was such that we were able to save some millions of pounds more than we spent, and invest it at reasonable rates of interest. We helped certain private banks, and certain State Governments, to tide over their difficulties, thus showing conclusively that the allegation of honorable gentlemen opposite, that we were going in for a policy inimical to the welfare of the Commonwealth, was quite erroneous. Some of the loans that we made to the State Governments were for long periods, and some were short dated ; they were at fair rates of interest, and "free from all brokerage and other charges that would have had to be paid if the loans had been drawn from other sources. Certain of that money will become available during the next twelve months, and to the extent that it is available I have no doubt it will be spent, because the right honorable gentleman's Budget proves that he will spend every penny that he can lay his hands on. 1 can see no cause for taking exception to borrowing from those two funds, but I do trust that the honorable member doss not propose to initiate a new policy of borrowing from outside sources. The elections of 1910 proved conclusively, among other things, that the majority of the people of Australia do not approve of the Commonwealth borrowing from outside sources. The proposal then was to borrow for building a fleet. That was disapproved of by the people, and there was also general dissatisfaction with that form of borrowing. I would suggest to the right honorable member that, as his policy was turned down so emphatically on that occasion by the electors, it would be unwise of him to attempt to again force it on the country, especially in view of the  smallness  of the majority commanded by the Government. </para>

          <para>. - As the speech to which we have just listened will go all over Adelaide to-morrow, I should like to send out just a little antidote with it. I know the tricks of the trade commanded by the honorable member, and want to correct all the tali statements that he has been making. We are accused of proposing to spend this year £6,000,000 more than we expect to receive in revenue. That is substantially so, if loan moneys be added to. the other totals of our expenditure. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>But may I remind my honorable friend that last year the Government to which he belonged also proposed to spend many millions more than they had revenue to cover <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> I want to set those two sums side by side, just to show the extent of our so-called extravagance, and the way in which, according to my honorable friend's statements, the expenditure is piled up. I find that last year they appropriated, as we are proposing to appropriate now, £22,683,541. In addition to that, although they appropriated much more, they actually spent out of loan moneys £1,339.000. They also purchased a dock in Sydney which cost £850,000. Those sums make a total of £24,872,000. Our total appropriations for this year are £27,246,000, or £2,374,000 more. The increase in expenditure during the last three years has averaged about 33^ per cent., whereas the total increase for this year is only 8 or 9 per cent. </para>

They cannot deny this; yet we heard all over the country during the recent election campaign that there was <inline font-style="italic">going to</inline> be economical administration. I believe the present Attorney-General stated, at the St. Kilda Town Hall, that the administration was going to be more economical, and that his party were going to cut things down; yet what do we find now ?

        <para class="block">I presume that the present season is one of the most prosperous we have ever experienced. Yet, the Government propose to spend, this year, £2,600,000 of an accumulated surplus, and an additional £3,080,000, which is to be obtained from loan moneys. As I remarked the other evening at a social gathering, if a man's income is only £20 a year and he spends £27, he knows where he will eventually land himself. No less a sum than £895,000 is to be spent out of loan moneys upon works which have hitherto been paid for out of revenue. I hold that the system of paying for public works out of revenue is the right one to adopt. </para>

            <para>- I feel sure that there are some honorable members opposite who are reluctant to see the Commonwealth enter the money market as the seventh borrower. The Treasurer has stated that many millions of pounds have been loaned by the Commonwealth up to 1926. As a matter of fact, the Government will have available next year, at varying dates, namely, on the 1st April, 15th April, 13th June, and 21st June, no less a sum than £2,190,000. In addition to that, between March and September, 1914, they will get another £400,000. A sum of £2,590,000 will be available within twelve months, much of it during the early part of next year. I regret exceedingly that some of these items are to appear in a Loan Bill. I hope that the matter will be reconsidered, and that, as far as possible, we shall pay for public works out of revenue. </para>

          <para>.- I am very grateful to the Treasurer for the condescension which he exhibited in introducing this proposal. It shows that, after all, he is amenable to reason and capable of appreciating what is due to honorable members. The right honorable gentleman endeavoured to elucidate, as far as he was capable of doing so, the items involved in the proposed loan expenditure. He gyrated from his own speech to the Budget-papers, and from the Budget-papers to his own speech, in an endeavour to explain what is meant by  this proposal to commit the Commonwealth to a loan policy. Only a few months ago, the Government were telling the electors that the Labour party were driving this country to insolvency. Those' who knew it, and those who did not, took up the allegation as a parrot-cry.' They repeated it like a lot of cockatoos. The Prime Minister, knowing the tricks of the trade, tried that little trick upon the people in an endeavour to throw dust into their eyes. </para>

            <para>- The honorable member cannot be humorous. Nobody regrets more than I do that the Government are about to embark upon -a policy of wholesale borrowing. " Hitherto, this Parliament has been held in esteem by the ' people of Australia because it has refused to resort to a borrowing policy. The States have borrowed to cover deficits whenever they have occurred, and to carry out legitimate public works. The danger of such a policy is that it affords an opportunity to a Treasurer to evade his responsibilities. </para>

            <para>- Honorable members are taking advantage of the legislation of the Labour party, or they would be in the position of having to borrow in the open market. To-day, fortunately for them, owing to the administration of the Labour party during the last three years, they are able to take advantage of our foresight and keen discernment, and borrow money we got without  paying interest. I do not object to money being borrowed for railways, because railways are an asset with a certain life. Any asset with a life that can be reasonably measured may be a just proposition to borrow money on, and can be managed so as to redeem the money borrowed out of the profits earned. In fact, it is impossible for us to build railways out of revenue, and I have not a word to say against the proposal to borrow money for railways. On the other hand, the proposal to borrow £895,000 for the three items mentioned by the honorable member for Yarra is a big departure from the previous policy. In the past, these works have always been carried out from revenue, but even if we admit, for the sake of argument, that there is some justification for borrowing money for these works, it is the duty of the Treasurer to show that they are of a character that will lead to the redemption of the money borrowed during their life. Take the item for the purchase of land for post and telegraph purposes. When the Labour party are in power, land naturally rises in value, but there is strong doubt as to whether land will not decrease in value while the Fusion party are in power. There is another item of £425,000 for the construction of conduits and laying telephone wires underground. Why lay the wires underground ? Has the Treasurer looked into the life of these wires underground? He has not told us whether they are single wires, live wires, copper wires, or brass wires, and he has not condescended to tell us what will be the life of these wires. Has the honorable member inquired as to what sinking fund will be necessary to redeem the money borrowed for these works? </para>

Gas-pipes and water-pipes laid by municipalities were expected to last twenty-five years, but in ten years many have had to be torn up because of the inability of the pipes to carry sufficient gas or water. </para>

            <para>- There is no warrant for borrowing money to build conduits, because the Government cannot estimate their life. I venture to say that the officers of the Postal Department cannot do it, judging by their ability in the past to estimate the necessities of the Department. They have been notorious for not being able to see far enough ahead. Time and again they have made mistakes in not preparing for the growth and expansion of the postal service, and  they have the Department tangled up in such a way that it has brought, not only confusion, ' but heartburning to every Postmaster-General. We are warranted in borrowing money for any work the life of which can be fixed, because then we can establish a sinking fund to redeem the loan, but if we cannot fix the life of a work, and, therefore, cannot assess the sinking fund necessary to redeem the loan, we are treading on treacherous ground in borrowing, and we are allowing the Government to steer a course never yet steered by any previous Government, a course that is likely to lead them on to the rocks. We should know something from the Treasurer as to the nature of these conduits; we should know what we are to borrow this money for; also whether it is to be well borrowed or well spent, and whether we are to get the money back again. We are not told how much is to be borrowed for conduits, and how much for wires. This Government, which was going to reduce expenditure, has increased it from £22,000,000 to £27,000,000. </para>

            <para>- The honorable member, who went about the country carping as to the extravagant expenditure of the Labour Government, is now prepared to support a Government which increases the expenditure by £5,000,000 in one year. I cannot understand how he can look his fellow men in the face after telling these stories, which were like those also told by the honorable member for Gippsland in his wild ravings before the electors during the last campaign. I strongly object to the spending of borrowed money on works of this kind. I ask the Treasurer whether money borrowed for Post Office works is to be charged to a general loan account, or to a separate account ? </para>

Is the Treasurer going to debit against the Department the cost of the conduits for which he is borrowing, or will the cost be charged to loan account generally ?

          <para>.- I do not know that I should have said anything at this stage had it not been for the exceptional eagerness shown by the Attorney-General to defend the borrowing of money from other sources than the ordinary Trust Funds, an eagerness that was shown by his persistent questioning of the honorable member for Adelaide. The Treasurer said, in effect, "It is all very well to talk about borrowing from the Trust Funds, but I cannot lay my hands on the money, because it has already been invested." The Budget-papers, however, show how the money has been invested, and when the payments fall due. </para>

            <para>- We are almost within two months of the end of the calendar year, yet within two months and two weeks, £1,350,000 will come into the hands of the Treasurer from Trust Funds for expenditure. Then early in 1914. there will come into his hands a sum of £1,125,000. This is money that was well invested by the late Treasurer with State Governments. Therefore, within about six months from that  particular source alone the Treasurer will become the possessor of money to the extent of £2,475,000, and within twelve months - that is by the 30th June, 1914 - there will mature other sums, making a total of £3,800,000. There are only, I repeat, about eight months of this financial year to go. .We are not now talking about money which we intend to expend within a period of twelve months. I admit that some of the money has already been spent. </para>

            <para>- I am not going to say that  that  money has not been spent. But within the remaining eight months of the present financial year the Treasurer will have coming into his hands £3,800,000. Yet he is wondering where he is going to get the; money to carry out the works authorized by the Loan Bill to the amount of £3,080,000. I take it that, with the exception of the Note Issue Fund, there will also be a considerable amount of interest accruing from our splendid investments. </para>

            <para>- This evening the right honorable gentleman has been complaining, " Where am I to lay my hands on the money to carry out these works?" and he has made that the sole reason, apparently, why he has to resort to this plan of going outside the Trust Funds. We do not want that to take place. By the method of borrowing from the Trust Funds the late Government saved all borrowing charges. We have not had to go to our uncle in London, or to the local market where it costs every borrower a considerable sum. Why are the Treasurer and the Attorney-General so anxious at the present time to go outside and borrow money from their friends the financiers in this or any other part of the world ? Have they any particular purpose to serve when there will come into their hands, not only in small sums, but in big sums, and within a period of eight and a half months, no less than £3,800,000 of Trust Funds money. I have dealt with the sums that will come in during the present financial year. But if the figures are only analyzed, it will be found that, early in the next financial year, considerable sums will come in. That shows the wonderful prudence, ability, and capacity of the late Ministry in husbanding the resources of the Commonwealth, and especially in carefully safeguarding its financial interests. I wish to quote the figures, if you, sir, will permit me to do so. On the 17th September, of this year, £100,000 came into the' Treasurer's hands; in October, £100,000; in November, £100,000; and in December, £100,000. On the 5th March, of next year, that is in less than six months from this date, £840,000 of loans maturing will come into the Treasurer's hands; in December of this year, £750,000 will come into his hands; on the 5th March of next year, £150,000; and in November and December, of the present year, £200,000 more. Seeing that the Budget figures disclose that all this money will be available - and it is more than will he wanted within a period of eight months - why are the Treasurer and the Attorney-General so anxious to go out side the Trust Funds in order to procure money to carry out these works? I trust that it will not he done. I think that we have had enough experience of taking that course. We talk about the passing on to posterity of some of the burdens of the Commonwealth. We are the posterity of those who preceded us. I do not complain about the very fine work carried out by the pioneers of this country, but one of the biggest burdens which the people of Australia are carrying is the nearly £12,000,000 of interest that has to be sent abroad every year. We want to prevent the sending of vast sums out of the country for that purpose. </para>

            <para>- How is it that the Attorney-General seems to be so anxious to go outside our own Trust Funds to borrow? Every twenty-six years, at our present rate, we are making up our National Debt once again. We are paying out £285,000,000 in interest every twenty-six years. Yet we have in office a Government who seem inclined to rush outside the Trust Funds in order to borrow money from their financial friends outside Australia. </para>

            <para>- These Governmental undertakings can be provided for either by borrowing or taxation. By borrowing, we place a perpetual charge upon future generations. It is idle- to say, so - far as this loan is concerned, that it will be redeemed within a certain time. I do ' not think the Treasurer has indicated that a sinking fund is to be provided. ' Most  of the States, with the exception of Western Australia, have failed to provide-  any sinking funds worth talking about for the redemption of their loans. As a homely illustration, let me point out that, if we borrow £1,000,000 at 3 per cent, for fifty years, at the end of that period we', shall have paid £1,500,000 in interest, and  will still owe the amount originally borrowed. We shall then have to go on the market to borrow £1,000,000 in order to pay off the first loan. Such a system must come to an end sooner or later. If we go on borrowing large sums from abroad instead of endeavouring to raise the money locally, we shall place upon the  people a burden that they will be unable to bear. Only a few years ago the value of our imports exceeded the value of our ex= ' ports by nearly £25,000,000, and the. pre- - sent Prime Minister then pointed out that - the time was fast approaching when steps would have to be taken to prevent such a large sum of money annually leaving the country. Having regard to, the present'- state of the London money market, T do not suppose we shall be able to obtain this money for less than 4 per cent.; so that, with respect to this loan, we shall have an annual interest bill of £120,000. </para>

            <para>- If we raise this money abroad and have to pay 4 per cent, for it, we shall have an interest bill of £120,000 a year to meet. In other words, if men, after providing for their maintenance, could earn sufficient to set apart -£100 a year for the use of the nation, it would mean that 1,200 men would have to toil all the year round to produce an amount sufficient to pay interest on this loan. Already the people of Australia are paying, in respect of the national debt, an interest bill amounting to nearly £12,000,000 a year. About £80,000,000 of the national debt has been borrowed within the Commonwealth. </para>

            <para>- Borrowed money should be expended only upon permanent reproductive works, and on such works we should never spend more than about £1,500,000 in any one year. The honorable member will find that on the great Transcontinental Railway, which is estimated to cost over £4,000,000, the Treasurer estimates that he will require for this year only about £1,500,000, and that is all that will be provided for in the Loan Bill which is now to be introduced. I have no very great objection to this Loan Bill, as we now have the assurance of the Treasurer that the money required is to be taken out of our own Trust Funds. </para>

            <para>- No, the right honorable gentleman did not. The matter was left in doubt by the Budget speech, but there is now no doubt about it, as the Treasurer has given us his distinct assurance that the money will be taken from the Trust Funds. If that be so, there will be no very strong objection to the loan from this side, whatever objection we may have to the details of expenditure proposed. If it were proposed to borrow the money abroad, I should take very strong exception to it, because I think it is quite time we adopted a better method of finance than that which has been adopted in the past. All parties in the States in the past desired to carry on what they called "a progressive works policy," and in carrying out such a policy they spent huge sums of borrowed money. While  the money was being spent everything was booming, and they all thought how prosperous they were. But a time came when they had to pay back the borrowed money, and difficulties at once arose. They are faced to-day with the fact that the rate of interest has gone up from 3 to 3½ and 4 per cent., and they have placed themselves in the hands of the money-lenders at the other end of the world, because they have made no provision to meet their obligations as their loans fall due. That is a humiliating position for the States to occupy, and I am afraid that that state of affairs will continue for some time longer. It must be remembered that on the passing of this Loan. Bill there will be another borrower on the market, and we shall have seven borrowers in Australia instead of six. We know the complications which take place because of the number of States desiring to borrow. Only a little time ago we had a lamentable exhibition of the haste of the various State' Treasurers to get money on the London market. Four States- New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia - had loans falling due, and required a certain amount of money to meet them. The amounts required by New South Wales and Victoria were very large. The different States sent the State Treasurers or other Ministers to London to negotiate their loans. What was the result <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Queensland came upon the scene.  Her  Treasurer whipped into the London market while the representatives of the other States were on their way to the Old Country, and secured a loan of £2,000,000, the whole of which he did not want, because he lent, or offered to lend, a certain portion of it to the other States as soon as he got it.  His  action placed the representatives of the other States at the mercy of the money-lenders, and some of them have been unable to complete their loans up to the present time. That is a state of affairs which should not exist. I should regret it very much if we had to go upon the London money market in competition with the different States, and I repeat that the objection to the proposed loan is greatly minimized by the assurance of the Treasurer that the money will be taken from the Trust Funds. The Treasurer said that he Government had not the money they required, and that is what led to the impression that they intended to go outside to borrow. I remind honorable members that the Government have been left with a handsome surplus of £2,600,000, and there is an amount of about £7,000,000 included in short-dated loans, the greater portion of which will fall due in the' next sixteen or eighteen months.: In the circumstances, the present Treasurer should be the last to complain, because he must recognise that all the money he is likely to require to carry on the great works to which the Commonwealth is committed will be available. In the next four months about £2,400,000 will be falling due, and in the next eight months about £4,000,000. Then, within the next sixteen or seventeen months, I understand that nearly £7,000,000 will be available. </para>

        <para>It is intended that the loan moneys required shall be found by making investments of the Australian Notes Fund and the general Trust Fund in Commonwealth inscribed stock.

I trust that the time will never come when the Government will have to go on to the London market to obtain money. That would only add to the difficulties we have had in the past in relation to loan matters.
