                        <para>- I do not know who are the authorities referred to, but no such representations as are mentioned have reached the Department in Melbourne. I shall cause a telegram to be sent immediately to ascertain the facts, and to ask that, whatever investigations were made, a copy of the report shall be forwarded at once to the central office. When they have been received, I shall at once have inquiries made into them. I had a letter from the Lord Mayor of Sydney, informing me of certain allegations as to the condition of the Quarantine Station, and this morning I telegraphed for specific details, the names of the complainants, and the nature of the complaints, stating that the complaints, when known, would be fully investigated, and investigated immediately. Last week some general statements appeared in a newspaper, but no name was attached to them. I brought them under the notice of the officers in Sydney, with a view to a report being made upon them, and I have received their report, but have not yet had an opportunity to examine it in detail. Generally it shows that the allegations were not sustained. Accompanying the report is a statement by several patients, members of the Public Service, expressing the fullest and most complete satisfaction with all that was done on their behalf when they were confined in the quarantine area. </para>

                            <para>- I ask the Minister of Trade and Customs if he has noticed that, because of the quarantine proclamation affecting Sydney aud its surrounding country, the passengers by the first excursion train from Sydney to Melbourne, conveying people to witness the Melbourne Cup, have been reduced from &#60;100 to 60. I ask whether, under these circumstances, the Government will suspend the operation of the quarantine for the week, to enable people to come to a carnival here, and to test the efficacy of the quarantine in preventing the spread of small-pox? </para>

                            <para>- The question raised by the honorable member relates more directly to diplomatic relations between the Imperial Government and the Government of the United States of America. Apart from that altogether, and from the interest in American matters that we share with the other parts of the Empire, our relation with the Pacific, I think, as well as our friendship with the United States of America, justifies our taking a separate stand in regard to this matter. I have not allowed the question raised by the honorable member to interfere to any extent with what I may describe as my enthusiasm in  regard  to the representation of Australia at the Panama Exposition. I am afraid that I did not recognise the full scope of the question put to me by the honorable member for New England a few moments ago. I think that he asked whether steps had been taken to have the Commonwealth permanently represented in the United States of America. That matter is also under consideration, as well as the possibility of establishing some trade representatives in Canada. </para>

                                <para>- The Prime Minister will not deny the accuracy of the report. He is silent, and we are told that silence gives consent. I may say that both the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Ar&#60;/us</inline> report the Prime Minister in almost similar terms. I shall, therefore, assume that the report is true, and I make this statement deliberately - knowing what I am saying - that what the Prime Minister said at this meeting last night is an absolute falsehood. </para>

The only two members to whom I promised pairs were the Treasurer and the honorable member for Kooyong; and I faithfully kept my promise. I went out myself, and at the last moment I asked the honorable member for Kalgoorlie to come out with me because I wanted a pair, and he willingly did so. I only had a few seconds in which to do this. </para>

                                <para>- Quite so; and the honorable member for Kalgoorlie left the chamber at my bidding. The Assistant Government Whip, the honorable member for Cowper, came into the room between 1 and 2 o&#39;clock, and  told  me there were several members of his party who were going to the funeral of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knox,</inline> and that he supposed &#34; it would be all right.&#34; I replied that so far as I or my party was concerned we were going to do nothing, and the members he spoke of could go. Our party honorably kept that understanding. It is all very well for honorable members opposite to laugh, but what was the outcome of all this? The Government refused an adjournment of a debate on a financial statement, although every Prime Minister I have known in this House has granted adjournments under similar circumstances. </para>

                                <para>- I now come to the question of the pairs. I do not know any one, so far as pairs are concerned in this matter, except the honorable member for Eden-Monaro, another honorable member, whose name I forget, the Treasurer, and the member for Kooyong; and all these are accounted for quite easily. After the division was taken I found out that there were some of our members away, particularly the honorable member for Fremantle, to whom I had promised a pair, and I paired him with the honorable member for Eden-Monaro, while I paired the honorable member for West Sydney with the honorable member for Werriwa. Every man that went to&#39;that funeral is accounted for in the pair-book. </para>

Every member was paired but the honorable member for Corio, and I did not know he was away until I saw the fact stated in the newspaper afterwards. But after the pair-book had been made up, the two  Government Whips came and crossed out the pair&#39; between Catts and Sampson, and West and Bruce Smith, and they inserted West and Kendell. </para>

He was interjecting two or three times when 1 called him to order, and then I had to call him specifically by the name of his electorate, upon which he immediately interjected again. It is not in order  for an honorable member immediately he is called to order and asked to apologize for disregarding the directions of the Chair, to apologize and then ask whether it is out of order to tell another honorable member that he is telling the truth. I. ask the honorable member to apologize unreservedly. </para>

                            <para>- By way of personal explanation, I may say that there has not been a correct statement made by the Prime Minister regarding myself since he opened his mouth in the Chamber to-day. I knew nothing of the circumstances; it had even escaped my mind that the funeral of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knox</inline> was to take place yesterday afternoon. No communication passed between our Whip and myself. The reason why I spoke immediately following the Treasurer is given in the opening sentences of my speech. The carefully prepared statement read by the Treasurer was of such a character that it would have misled a large number of innocent electors if it went out uncommented  on in the same newspapers and probably in the same <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> Therefore, I attacked the subject immediately, but under grave difficulties, because of my lack of exact information. I dealt with it in half my speech right off, and then -I appealed to the only Minister present, the Minister of Trade and Customs, to be allowed to continue the other half of my speech at some future date. The Minister said he would like to consult the Prime Minister about it. I did not have the slightest doubt that my request would be readily granted, in accordance with the practice of this Parliament. I had no knowledge of any arrangement with regard to pairs. There was not a single member of the Opposition who knew of any arrangement or any conditions whatever, and, in my wildest dreams, I never thought the Prime Minister would object to my continuing my speech on another occasion. For some time after I commenced my  speech  there was not a single Minister present, but I made no complaint on that score because I thought there might be something important demanding their absence from the Chamber. </para>

                                <para>- I did not know that a single honorable member was going to the funeral. I did not know of it until after the division. The Treasurer, in speaking, did not mention it. I believe there were one or two members to whom he told something, but what that was I do not know. If he did utter anything about it, I did not hear it. It was outside my knowledge. Honorable members can believe me or not. There is not a word of truth in what the Prime Minister has said concerning myself. I am not called upon to traverse the things he has said. It is enough for the people of the Commonwealth, and I believe for my colleagues, to hear me say that there was nothing premeditated in connexion with yesterday&#39;s affair, and that it was accidental. </para>

                            <para>- I wish to make a personal explanation in regard to the matter of the pair-book. I wish to relate the circumstances of what actually happened. After the division was taken and the House adjourned, I approached the honorable member for Maranoa and asked him to fix up the pairs that were announced. I took the book and wrote the standing pair existing between the honorable member for Barker and the honorable member for Dalley, and . then- proceeded to the two pairs announced in the House by the honorable member for Maranoa immediately after the division, namely, the honorable member for Maranoa with the Treasurer, and the honorable member for Kalgoorlie with the honorable member for Kooyong. These two pairs I put into the book. Then I said to the Opposition Whip that I would not recognise any other pairs except &#34; live &#34; pairs. The honorable member for Maranoa then proceeded to write in the book a number of pairs, among which were two to which I took particular objection. These were the pairs of the honorable member for Wimmera with the honorable member for Cook, and the honorable member for Parkes with the honorable member for East Sydney. I said that the  honorable  members for Cook and East Sydney had not been here this week, and that I would  not, in the circumstances, accept them as pairs for that particular division. Any one who has knowledge of this particular class of work would never, in the circumstances, dream of accepting those gentlemen as pairs. </para>

The honorable member was directly concerned in moving the motion for the adjournment of the debate, and, therefore, reference, if not directly, certainly indirectly, has been made to him. He, therefore, stands in a different relation from the majority of honorable members. </para>

                                <para>- The incident to which I desire to refer took place yesterday, and has been characterized by the Prime Minister as a gross breach of faith. So far as I am personally concerned, quite apart from any general statement made by the honorable member for- Maranoa on this side relating to pairs, or what would or would not happen, there was no decision arrived at respecting pairs so far as the Government Whip was concerned, because immediately the Leader of the Opposition started to speak yesterday, in reply to the Treasurer, the Government Whip came to me, sat down between the honorable member for Yarra and myself, and informed me that the honorable member for Maranoa, our Whip, could not be found ; that some Government members had gone away to a funeral ; and he asked if I would undertake the duty of pairing on behalf of our Whip, and generally assume the duties of Whip on this side, because he desired pairs for those members of his side who had gone to the funeral. I distinctly declined to undertake any such duty. He asked me if anything would happen. I declined to say whether anything would or would not happen. I did not know of anything that was about to happen, neither was I aware that the Prime Minister would refuse our leader leave to continue his speech on another day. These facts are borne out by what took place at the time. The Government Whip was so anxious to get pairs for members on his side who had gone away that he actually started to argue with me, and had to go to his own side of the House in order that the Leader of the Opposition might be allowed to speak. In those circumstances I had the clearest possible  intimation from the Government Whip, firstly, that our Whip was out of the House, and could not be found; and, secondly, that members of his own side had gone away to attend the funeral of one of their late colleagues; thirdly, that he had not paired his members; fourthly, that he wanted pairs for them because they were absent; fifthly, that our members were here to be paired if they so desired; and, sixthly, that I declined to do what he wanted. Yesterday&#39;s occurrence was entirely his fault. </para>

                                <para>- That is so. I had forgotten it for the moment, as I admitted to the honorable member afterwards. The statement of facts by the honorable member for Adelaide is materially correct. It was the fact that I knew there was a general arrangement as to pairs with the Opposition Whip, and that I could not find him to adjust the pairs, that led me to go to the honorable member for Adelaide, and ask him for assistance in fixing matters up. Of the result, every one is aware. </para>

                            <para>.- When I moved the motion, I pointed out that, although its adoption would necessitate slight changes in the machinery now used for the inspection of produce- passing from State to State, the consequences would be of great value to the trading community. If what I propose were adopted, there would be uniformity in the inspection of produce passing from State to State, and a more Federal feeling would exist than is occasionally now found. At the present time, when some disease affecting produce breaks out, unf  federal  &#39; feeling is occasionally aroused by the uncertainty of the action likely to be taken by the authorities of the States other than that in which the disease has appeared. No one connected with the produce business knows exactly what will be done. When the produce of one State is rejected by another, the consigning State feels that it has been unfairly treated. But if the work of inspection were done by Federal officers, the consignors of produce would know that they were being dealt with by impartial authorities, and the ill-feeling which is now created would be unknown. This subject has often been discussed here during the past six or seven years, and attention has been drawn to the confusion that is frequently created under the present arrangements. For instance, last year, or the year before, some potatoes were shipped from Melbourne to Queensland. Before leaving Melbourne they had been passed by the Victorian inspectors, but on arriving in Queensland they were condemned by the inspectors of that State. They were brought back to Melbourne, and after they had been lying on the wharf for some time, the Victorian inspectors again looked through them, and declared them to be still sound. On a still earlier occasion some potatoes which had been _ rejected at Sydney were returned fo the port of shipment, put into different bags, sent back to Sydney, and on the second occasion accepted. Many cases of this kind have occurred, but their effect is to create unfederal feeling. Trouble is occasioned in connexion with the Inter-State movements of fruit, and of bacon and pork,&#39; as well as of ordinary produce. The produce traffic between the various States is very large, and as the population of Australia increases, it will grow. The producers are the backbone of the country. Their labour should be encouraged by every legitimate and reasonable means, and their interests, which are the interests of the whole community, should&#39; be safeguarded in every possible way. Primary production employs a- great deal of labour at all stages in cultivating, harvesting, and handling, and its transport and sale provide business for a great many merchants, and give employment to very many clerks and others. I do not desire to remove safeguards against the spread of diseases. These safeguards will not be removed if my motion is passed, because Federal inspectors will then take the place of State inspectors, and will be as strict as they are to prevent diseased produce from passing from one part of Australia to another. We need sufficient power to enable us to say that when sound produce is sent from one State to another, and is passed by Federal inspectors, it shall be allowed without delay to go on to the markets for which it is intended. It would be no advantage to any one for the Commonwealth to take over the power of inspection if, at the same time, the State authorities could bold back produce for a month, in order to see that it was free from disease. </para>

                            <para>- 1 had a good deal to say about this matter. Some four or five years ago the honorable member for Darwin, as well as myself and other representatives of Tasmania, frequently brought before the House the question of State inspection laws in connexion with the outbreak of Irish Blight, and &#34;at the Federal elections of 1910, the honorable member for Darwin told the farmers of Tasmania that if the Labour party were returned to power they would put the matter right in three weeks. The Labour party was returned to power, and remained in office for three years. But although the ex-Minister of Trade and Customs promised me that he would do what he could, nothing was done. Then in connexion with the referenda, the honorable member for Darwin told the producers of Tasmania that if they agreed to the proposed amendments of the Constitution, this Parliament would be able to put all these matters right. </para>

                            <para>- It may be, but I desire before dealing with that matter to complete my reply to the honorable member&#39;s interjection of a few moments ago. I  wrote  to the Tasmanian newspapers, challenging the statement made by the honorable member for Darwin, and he was unable to show the farmers that the passing of the referenda would benefit them one iota. Although extensive changes would have been made if the referenda had been carried, the position, so far as this particular question is concerned, would have remained practically unaltered. There is a constitutional element involved in the consideration of this question which makes it by no means an easy one to cope with. The States Have reserved to them certain police powers,  which  they exercise chiefly through the medium of Vegetation Diseases Acts, and regulations providing for the inspection of produce. It is right that the States should have these reserve powers vested in them, since they are charged with the safeguard ins; of the health of the community, and it is necessary for them to take precautions to prevent a disease crossing their borders. Disease, however, is not a trade and commerce mattei1. </para>

                            <para>- If there were danger of a disease being introduced by any particular article of commerce, then the Federal inspectors, under my proposal, would do &#39;just what the State inspectors are empowered to do, and would see that the article of commerce was rejected. The actual machinery changes which my proposal involves are very small, but the advantages which it would give to the producers of the several States, and through them to the workers and traders alike,, are very substantial. The only interference which I propose with the police powers retained by the States, is that the Federal authority should have power to insure produce being placed on the market :for which it is intended as soon as the Federal inspectors declare it to be sound and wholesome. This, I believe, could be done under the Constitution, as it stands, and for that belief I have good authority. I base it, in the  first  place, on an 0111111011 given by the present Minister of External Affairs, when he held office as Attorney-General, in 1909, as well as upon statements made by the present Minister of Trade and Customs, and the ex-Minister. Then, again, </para>

                    <para class="block">I would remind the House that section 92 of the Constitution declares that all Inter-State trade shall be free. In the said opinion of the present Minister of External Affairs upon a regulation passed by South Australia, which excluded certain Inter-State produce, he shows clearly to what extent these police powers are reserved to the States, and how far the Commonwealth may go. I believe that we could achieve the object at which I am aiming by an amendment of the Quarantine Act, and without any alteration of the Constitution. Section 112 of the Constitution gives power to the States to pass inspection laws, but it is open to the Commonwealth to annul those laws when it thinks fit. Thus, if a State inspection law were really designed to serve an ulterior purpose - if it were designed to protect local growers from the competition of those in another State, just as an import duty would do, it could be annulled by the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- I cannot say that it does. The question of whether produce should or should not be placed in new bags or cases is a matter for experts, and I do not propose to deal with it. Such questions can be taken in hand by the authorities when we secure the machinery changes that I advocate. I recognise that the regulation referred to by the honorable member for Ballarat in regard to the use of new bags is a serious one. The price of bags has increased by leaps and bounds during the last few years, whereas the price of potatoes is low, so that producers are heavily handicapped. I can understand the concern displayed by the honorable member for Ballarat for producers of potatoes in his constituency. I have in my electorate a very large area of potato-growing country, and I know that the question is a very serious one for potato farmers. </para>

                            <para>- All produce, including carcass meat. At the present time, sound, wholesome produce, passing from one State to another, is often rejected as soon as it is landed on the wharfs, whereas it should be allowed to go on to the market to feed the hungry masses, who very often, because of the high prices charged, cannot buy the produce they desire. I am not going to say that there should be only one inspection, and that that should be at the port of shipment or entry. That is a detail which should be left to the experts who would be employed under my scheme. I do not want to make it more dangerous than it is at present for a State to allow produce from another State to enter its territory. I merely desire a small machinery change on which will hinge great advantages for the producers, workers, and traders alike. This, I contend, can be secured under section 112. We have power to annul an unreasonable State inspection law. When Western Australia, for instance, imposed very high inspectional charges, obviously with the object of shutting out certain produce- </para>

Section 112 of the Constitution leaves the States power to make Inspection laws, but it gives the Commonwealth power to annul those laws when they are unreasonable or used for some ulterior motive, such as I have indicated, because it is not a proper use of the reserved police powers. In Western Australia there were such charges imposed, but, when representations were made, the Government of that State recognised the situation, and modified their regulation. </para>

                    <para>In the Commonwealth Constitution, State inspection laws are implied, sanctioned by section 112, which defines the power of States to levy charges for their enforcement. Reading sections 51 (i) and 92 together, it would appear that in Australia - whether or not a State Act or regulation would be unconstitutional merely because it was a direct regulation of Inter-State commerce - it would, as in the United States, be unconstitutional if it imposed an unnecessary or unreasonable burden on Inter-State commerce.  . . . I think that an absolute prohibition of certain kinds of plants (healthy and diseased alike) is an unnecessary burden on Inter-State commerce, and cannot be justified on the ground that it is a precautionary measure against the introduction of disease. - R.

                    <para class="block">From all the authorities I have referred to it must be clear that we have very large powers if we will take the trouble to use them; and our Quarantine Act could Be very largely amended. Our legislation in this connexion by no means absorbs all our powers; and I think that with further amendment of the Quarantine Act we. could achieve our object. I have no desire to raise trouble between the Federal and the State authorities, but merely to render what service I can to the producers in a perfectly reasonable way. The producers of Australia are a portion, of the community, and the Federal Parliament and the State Parliaments are merely separate agents of the same principal. It is not the province or duty of those  agents  to bicker or squabble, because if they do so their principal must suffer. It is the duty of the State and Federal authorities to devise some working means whereby the conditions of the producers and workers throughout the country can be improved. The Commonwealth Government ought to take this matter seriously into consideration, and find out exactly how far they can go, and then they should endeavour to come to some amicable arrangement with the States that will be satisfactory to all concerned. I have better hopes than I used to have that some real practical benefit will result from a conference between the States and the Federal authorities. Every year now the agricultural bodies of the various States confer, and are beginning to know one another better. In this way many difficulties are bridged over, and compromises arrived at which could not possibly have been achieved had these agricultural authorities remained apart. Even in the matter of inspection, I believe that, with a little assistance from the Federal authorities, it would be possible to bring about some satisfactory arrangement without unnecessary trouble or harshness cn our part. The InterState Commission will, I think, help us in the matter, because to that body will probably be referred most of these questions. Then we have before us a Bill for the establishment of an Agricultural Bureau ; and this, providing for the assistance of the best experts upon pests and diseases, will prove another agency, the influence of which must work for the benefit of the people. Altogether, I think that the time is now ripe for the Commonwealth to make a move, and to let the States understand that if they do not come together and make some reasonable arrangement to assist the trading and producing interests, the Commonwealth will exercise the powers it undoubtedly has, and see that the goods are allowed to go on the market. Unless some such step is taken no practical benefit would be achieved, so that I hope the Minister of Trade and Customs will give the matter serious consideration. He comes from the State of Queensland, where so many varied products are grown, and he is fully cognisant of the importance of the matter and of the issues involved. I believe, therefore, he will give it most earnest attention. I hope so, at any rate. There are many areas in Australia that should be producing, and should be closely settled, which to-day are not producing, and upon which we find very few people. We should encourage production on these areas. If we do not do so we are not doing our duty. I am satisfied that what is suggested in the motion would be of great assistance in that direction. I hope that before very long the Minister of Trade and Customs will meet the State authorities with a common view to providing a working arrangement for the transfer of produce from State to State. The price of bags touches the producing interests. I should like the Minister to also look into this question. I do not believe, from what I have read, that the present high price is due to a combine, as many of our friends opposite believe. </para>

                            <para>- I believe that every member of the House is pledged against trusts and combines fleecing the public. If these bags are controlled by a combine it is time the Government did something to protect the producer. If that be the case, I hope the Minister will let us know, and then we can deal with the matter. But I do not think the price of bags is altogether due to a combine - I believe it is due to the poor jute crop, and the very large amount of grain that is grown in Argentine, Australia, India, and other parts. While the jute crop happens to be small, the crop for which the bags are needed happens to be large. The fact that we have a big demand and a small supply has a lot to do with the rise in the price of bags during the last year or two. I believe it has more to do with it than has a combine. </para>

                            <para>. - No one but can appreciate the way in which the honorable member for Wilmot has moved the motion. One had only to listen to his earnest pleading to realize that he has taken action purely out of desire to assist the primary producers in Australia. &#39; But the motion is one that cannot be readily accepted. It is not new to the House. The question came before us in 1910, and was fully discussed. On that occasion the Minister of Trade and Customs, the honorable member for Yarra, pointed out the impracticability of taking over the inspection as has been suggested. My view is exactly the same. It would not be feasible for the Commonwealth - leaving constitutional matters out of question - to take over the control and inspection of all products passing from State to State in Australia. That, however, does not relieve the Commonwealth of its supervising responsibility. It is clearly the intention of the Constitution that there should be a free passage of goods from State to State, and that no State, under the guise of inspection laws, should have the right to prohibit and block that free passage of goods, or make excessive charges so as to prevent it. For instance, in a particular case mentioned by the honorable member for Ballarat the other day, and which I promised to look into, I took the necessary action. The duty upon potatoes under the Tariff is ls. per cwt., or <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> per ton. I have made inquiries into the question of inspection charges in respect of potatoes, and find that the fee charged in Western Australia is ls. a bag, as has been stated by the honorable member for Ballarat. Potatoes weigh, approximately, 150 lbs. in the bag, or go fifteen bags to the ton, so that the fee per ton is 15s. The protective duty is &#163;\, so that the inspection fee on potatoes imported into Western Australia is three-quarters as high. That is a very high charge indeed. The fee charged iii other States of Australia is only 6d. per ton of fifteen bags. On the face of it, the Western Australian charge of 15s. per ton does not appear to be. a fair charge for ain inspection fee. I have asked the Prime Minister to cause a despatch to be forwarded to Western Australia, with a view to inquiring into the matter, and having the question of the reasonableness of this charge investigated. In another case in which we were concerned, in the year 1907. we were furnished with some information with respect to Western Australia as regards the charges which were made in connexion with fruit. Inquiry showed that no uniform scale of fees was adopted. Fort instance, on each case of fruit that went into Western Australia, there was a charge of 2s. 6d., in South Australia the charge was 3d., and in Victoria Jd. In New South Wales, Queensland, and Tasmania, no charge at all was made. Representations; were made to Western Australia and the other States, and ultimately a more common form of action was arrived at, all the other States agreeing to a fee of Jd. a bunch for bananas, and &#163;d. per bushel case for fruit. Western Australia continued to charge 3d. per half -bushel case, and 6d. for a bushel case. I quite admit that, in Western Australia, there might be some justification for higher rates, but there should not be such a great disproportion as in the case of potatoes. </para>

At present the whole of the; system of inspection of fruits and plants generally is based upon State legislation, which begins with the orchards and practically ends with the .place of export, and: that from the other point begins at the port .qf import, if you look at it from the importing State&#39;s point of view. There is a whole set of machinery built upon that, and it would be very difficult for the Commonwealth to intervene now with any advantage. At the same time, it is the duty of the Commonwealth to keep an eye on the general position, to see that the powers of inspection are exercised legitimately, that is, for inspection purposes only, and not for other purposes. I certainly think that, wherever difficulties exist, the Commonwealth can exercise a sort of coordinating power, as it has done in the past, so as to bring the States together in order to facilitate Inter-State trade, while preserving such an amount of inspection as will prevent the- spread of disease. The object of the Commonwealth should be to assist in the repression and extermination of the diseases affecting plant life in Australia. One cannot find fault with the States if they are sometimes a little apprehensive as regards the introduction of diseases from other places, because, when once they are introduced, it is exceedingly hard to eradicate them. That is a case where prevention is certainly better than cure. So far as the States are exercising their powers legitimately for purposes of inspection one cannot make any complaint. I sympathize a good deal with those who desire an examination at the place of export, instead of leaving it to the place of import. It is far better for a man to know his fate at the beginning, instead of paying all the charges for carriage, say, right to Western Australia, only to find that his goods are condemned there. The examination at the port of export may facilitate the entry, provided that the goods are accompanied with a clean certificate. I think that, on the whole, the honorable member for Wilmot has done exceedingly good service in drawing attention to these matters, although we may not be able to see eye to eye with him as regards the methods he has proposed. The matter will be given most careful consideration, and notice will be taken of the various points that he has submitted. Perhaps from a departmental point of view it may be well to hear any views which other honorable members may desire to submit, in order that we may carry on the work of facilitating InterState trade, while, at the same time, preventing the introduction of disease. </para>

                                <para>.- I am glad that the motion has been brought forward, whether by carrying it we effect anything or not; at any rate, some good will be done by the fact that we are discussing these questions. In fact, through the discussion the other day of the high charge made by the Western Australian Government on potatoes, I am pleased to see that the Government have already taken action. I have no doubt that now the attention of the Western Australian Government has been drawn to the way this charge must affect growers in other parts, and must certainly be detrimental to the consumers in Western Australia, they will accede to the wishes of the Commonwealth Government. I am delighted to see honorable members on the Government side trying to assist us in the work that we are endeavouring to do in promoting the interests of the producers of this country. I can assure them that we welcome their support. </para>

                                <para>- It is impossible for the potato-grower to deal with this question. It was discussed here in 1910, and I think it was the then honorable member for Bendigo, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Quick, who said that the question would have to be taken to the High Court. It is impossible for the individual grower to do this, and from a financial point of view alone. .1 do not contend that the Federal Government should take it up, but they have influence with the State Governments who belong to the same party. </para>

                                <para>- We are trying to use our influence in that case, and the question of whether the charge is constitutional or not will probably be tested. As regards the resolution that has been submitted, the honorable member said, in 1910, &#34; I do not think that we can constitutionally take from the State authorities the right to themselves inspect in the first instance.&#34; According to the honorable member for Wilmot, he now desires to take away from them the right to inspect, and bases his argument upon section .112 of the Constitution. I would point out that, although the Federal Parliament, has the power to annul inspection fees, they can be reimposed by the State Government the next day, and thus the evident intention of the Constitution may be to a large extent defeated. </para>

This all tends to show the urgent necessity for any alteration of the Constitution, to give us greater powers over trade and commerce. We realize the necessity of having uniformity in connexion with inspection. We do not want to have diseased produce introduced into any State. If there is a disease in Tasmania we, in Victoria, will do the best we can to keep it out. </para>

                <para class="block">The case in regard to this matter was fully placed before the House last year by the ex-member for Fremantle, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hedges.</inline> I am satisfied that all my colleagues from Western Australia will be extremely pleased if, upon investigation, it is proved that by powellising or any other process, we can make karri into a useful timber for underground purposes, because, we have enormous forests of karri. If this timber could be successfully treated We should have a great industry in connexion with it, but we -must remember that if this process does not do all that its supporters claim for it great loss will accrue. Undoubtedly, karri without treatment is not a good timber to place in the ground. It is splendid for carriage building and many other purposes above ground, but it has proved a great failure in Western Australia as a sleeper timber;. The Great Southern Railway was built with karri sleepers, and almost before the railway was completed the sleepers which had been first put in had to be taken out, and the whole of that line has, been replaced with jarrah sleepers. The only case, so far as I have heard, of any tests made in powellising this timber was when about a chain of karri sleepers were treated by the process at Perth. Some thirty sleepers treated in this way were laid six or seven years ago, and I believe this is looked upon as complete evidence of the efficacy of the process. </para>

                        <para>- Ninepence, if the work is done by the State, and, I think, 2s. to others. In reading the reports of the debates in the Western Australian Parliament, I have not been able to clearly ascertain the true facts ; but I gather from a statement of the Premier of the State that the Commonwealth will not have to pay at a higher rate than is charged to the State - that is, 9d. per hundred - though it will have to pay &#163;3,750 royalty, whether it treats any timber or not, and royalty must be paid for some five years after the expiry of the patent. I do not wish to condemn the process. If it proves to be a good one it will be very beneficial. But we are taking a great risk in adopting it without proof of its usefulness. The cost of maintaining the line from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta will be excessive if sleepers laid in remote places have to be renewed by reason of the failure of the powellising process. Besides, it is proposed to construct other railways, such as that running north and south across the continent. Before committing ourselves we should be quite satisfied that the standard sleeper that is used will be effective for its work. We should, therefore, ask for the fullest particulars regarding the powellising system. Western Australia has done a great trade in  jarrah sleepers, and jarrah has proved a good timber for sleepers. In Western Australia we use nothing else, and there is no suggestion in the railway reports that powellised sleepers should be used. I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane,</inline> in a -report on the powellising system, stated that when in Western Australia he travelled over the Denmark line, a small railway, 34 miles in length, constructed in the old days by Millar Brothers, with karri sleepers. He mentioned how well some  of  the sleepers had stood. But only three or four years ago, after the Government had purchased the line, I approved of the replacing of the karri sleepers with jarrah, and that was done. It is stated on page 7  of  the report of the Commissioner of Railways, for the year 1911-12, that the Denmark line has been  re-sleepered with jarrah sleepers of the standard size; that fact shows that the Commissioner of Railways had little faith in powellised karri. Reporting on light district railways, and speaking of the necessity for a standard specification, he has written - </para>

                    <para>Small sleepers give another form of expression to the policy of cheap construction, and the road bed is laid with little ballast, or none at all, and almost devoid of drainage. Yet the State is rich in timber unrivalled for railway sleepers, and ballast is everywhere obtainable within reasonable distances. Leaving speed or convenience out of consideration there can be no question that a well-drained road bed carrying adequately substantial sleepers properly ballasted, and of lasting quality, is the only proposition on which economical maintenance of permanent way can be based. </para>

                <para class="block">That statement appears in his report for 1911-12. I have gone through the report published this year, but find no mention in it of proposals for powellising timber for railway construction. The chief evidence submitted in this House in favour of the powellising process was that it had been satisfactorily tested in Western Australia. Seven or eight years ago a chain of powellised karri sleepers was laid in East Perth, in sandy ground, the situation tending to give the sleepers a long life. When examined, some two years ago, these sleepers were found to be in specially good order. That is the only test that has been made of powellised karri in the State. </para>

Such sleepers used in that country have a life up to twenty and thirty years. </para>

                        <para>- In that case, the timber  used was jarrah, which we know will stand Well against white ants., even without being powellised, though it is occasionally, attacked. I do not think that there :is any country in the world which is so, bad for white ants as is the northern portion of Western Australia. Knowing that, the Government df the day wished to take the most effective means for preserving the sleepers used on the Port Hedland railway. . We knew that jarrah was good timber, but went to extra expense to increase the life of the sleepers by powellising, should the powellising process be able to do that. The result, however, does not amount to proof of the efficacy of the process, the timber treated being jarrah, and having been only three years in the ground. Karri timber is notoriously a bad timber under ground. It has been said that the powellising process has been a :great success in New Zealand. To ascertain the facts, I wired to the Prime Minister of the Dominion, asking whether the process met with approbation there, and &#39;whether the Government were satisfied with its results.

                <para class="block">I merely asked whether the powellising of the native timbers of New Zealand had proved satisfactory. It had been claimed that it was, but the answer that I received from the Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Massey,</inline> in clear and decisive language, was that the sleepers treated were not satisfactory, and that no more were being treated. The question of! .the application of the process to timber required for other purposes is quite immaterial, because karri can be used with excellent results above the surface, although when placed in the ground it is unsatisfactory. The experience of the Western Australian Government in connexion with the Great Southern Rail way should convince honorable members that karri timber is no good for sleepers. We have to ask ourselves whether the powellising process is one that we can adopt in connexion with the timber required in the building of all our Commonwealth railways.  We are going to construct many more lines, and surely the House should demand further information regarding the success or otherwise of this process. A Select Committee should &#39;be appointed to make inquiries into the system in order that we may determine whether we should adopt it in connexion with future work, or cast it out and use only the regular standard sleepers of Australia. I trust that the House will adopt this motion. </para>

                    <para>.- I shall second this motion for the reason that I am not at all satisfied with the results so far secured, or with the evidence at present available as to the durability of timber subjected to the powellising process. We must not forget that these powellised sleepers are going to cost us about 9d. more than the cost of an ordinary jarrah sleeper landed at either end of the line. There is a further cost to be taken into account, because I am assured that men will not handle powellised timber without extra payment. It is also reported that the arsenic used in the powellising process has a very bad effect on the steel roadways laid upon these sleepers. All these are matters that could be cleared up by a Select Committee. If we are committed to the present contract, it is most important that there should be a clear and definite understanding as to what &#34; powellising &#34; really means. There should also be a supervision of the process on behalf of the Commonwealth. The difficulty is, however, to obtain an independent powellising expert, save from the company itself. We need further information as to the time required for the solution to penetrate hardwood of given thicknesses, and we should have a test with an auger by our own experts to make sure that the solution has thoroughly penetrated the timber. There is no doubt that ordinary soft woods, such as flooring boards, can be powellised, and that the life of any timber is extended by subjecting it to this process. But the question is whether a piece of timber 5 inches in thickness can be so penetrated by the solution as to give it an additional life that will make it preferable to unpowellised jarrah. These sleepers might be run into tanks, and taken out so quickly thu the solution would run off them just as water runs off a duck&#39;s back. I am convinced that we have heard a lot of erroneous statements regarding the ravages of white ants in the country to be traversed by the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway. I have been over 300 miles of the route, and I would remind the House that unpowellised sleepers were used in the construction of the line from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta, and that they have remained in the ground for about thirty years and have stood remarkably well. That fact in itself is a proof that the ravages of the white ants and dry rot have not been experienced in that part of the country. Prom what I can gather, karri, in its natural state, is the worst class of timber that could be put underground. It is more liable than any other timber to dry rot. Tasmanian bluegum has a fairly good life, whilst redgum has an exceptionally good life. There are other hardwoods that are fairly good, but mountain ash is another rotten class of timber. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable member desires any information as to the suitableness of mountain ash for use as railway sleepers, he can obtain it from the Engineer-in-Chief of the Victorian Railways. Karri, like mountain ash, is also quite useless for this purpose, although it is a very fair timber for superstructures. We should have further information in regard to this process. The only tests submitted in the last Parliament were supplied by the Powellising Company itself. That was admitted. I think a Select Committee should be appointed. I regret to learn that there has been a loading of the royalties. </para>

                        <para>- The question was raised in the last Parliament on a direct motion of want of confidence in the Government. During the debate on that motion, I said that we should lay down a short piece of roadway with powellised sleepers, and so test the process before committing ourselves to the purchase of a large quantity of such sleepers. I pointed out that if karri sleepers treated in this way proved effective, the great forests of this timber could then be utilized. But because I voted with the Government on that motion of censure, I was charged with having voted for the use of powellised karri sleepers. That was an absolute misrepresentation of the facts. If there had been no question of censure involved - if the motion had been submitted in the ordinary way - the voting upon it would have been very different. I am pleased to support this motion, because I recognise, with the honorable member for Dampier, that we have to consider, not only our present commitments, but the fact that we shall have to build, in the near future, 1,000 miles of roadway in the Northern Territory. The time occupied in making this inquiry would be very short, and the cost would be small. I think the Select Committee should be appointed. </para>

                    <para>.- I shall support this motion with very great heartiness. Coming, as I do, from Western Australia, 1 have taken a keen interest in this matter from the time that it first appeared on the horizon, and I must confess that &#39;the more I make myself acquainted with it, the more incomprehensible does it appear to me. It has been urged against those of us who take up the position- that further light should be thrown on the contracts for the supply of powellised&#39; timber, that we are hostile to the utilization of our great reserves of karri in Western Australia. Nothing could be further from the truth. Karri, as already stated, is a magnificent timber for the purposes for which it is designed by nature. But, undoubtedly, nature has not intended that it shall be utilized for railway sleepers. On several occasions it has had a set-back all over the world by reason of its having been put to unsuitable uses, and particularly by reason of the; fact that it has been utilized as railway sleepers. These sleepers in a very little while have had to be tom up. In fact, it was hardly necessary to tear them up, .because in many cases they simply crumbled to pieces where they lay, aud had to be replaced by jarrah sleepers. I do not wish to see karri get another &#34; set-back &#34; by being used in a rash and quite unnecessary experiment. In view of the undoubted fact that we have in jarrah one pf the finest timbers in the world for sleepers, it passes all understanding why we should resort to the experimental powellised karri, and pay a larger price than for the other timber. An investigation of the whole question is absolutely necessary in the interests of the Commonwealth, and I trust that the motion will be carried. </para>

                    <para>. - I shall vote for the motion, because it is only right that there should be an investigation into the whole matter. The late Government endeavoured to secure all possible knowledge on the subject before letting the contract. I quite agree that the use . of karri had to be abandoned in the early days; but since the discovery of the powellising process it is considered by the experts to be the one timber that holds the dog spikes more firmly than any other. It has been dis covered that powellised jarrah opens up. </para>

Even if only one sleeper is attacked, the fact justifies the declaration of the experts that jarrah would, in the long run, be eaten up.

                            is considered to be a  very able man; but, of course, we all have our own opinions, and we should not think that those who disagree with us have no brains. If Napoleon were here, I do not suppose we should think alike as to the way in which he fought his battles. I fancy I could have fought them better myself; but that only shows that Napoleon would not agree with me. In Western Australia, there are mighty forests of karri.

We had an investigation made into the merits of mountain ash; and when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane</inline> recommended a contract for the supply of that timber I set it aside for a long time for consideration. Later on the contract was again put before me by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane,</inline> after he had obtained all the knowledge he could from the Victorian Railways people. </para>

                        <para>- Not so; the Department had no option in face of the opinions of its experts. There was one contract, the selection of Chinn, that I let, and hell was kicked up here. What I did without experts did not please, neither did my action when I consulted the experts; so that it was difficult to know what to do. The proposed investigation will not affect the contract that has already been let, but will affect- future contracts. </para>

In Western America what i3 known as the zinc process has been in use for thirty or forty years, but I was informed that it is a very costly one, though it makes the timber absolutely immune from white ants. But surely my honorable friends will not say that science will prove unable to surmount this difficulty, as it has surmounted them in the case of fruit pests? Our friends opposite put up a hard fight last year, no doubt conscientiously, but without knowledge; and I am hopeful that after the proposed investigation they will, like the sinner at the penitent form, come here and ask for forgiveness. </para>

                        <para>- I can assure my friend that, so far as the Department is concerned, we will do everything to see that the rights of the Commonwealth are in no way compromised. At this juncture I express no opinion as to the powellising process, or the agreement ; but if it is found that the supply of sleepers cannot -be maintained, of course we shall have to consider making other arrangements. The honorable member for Darwin said that there would have been a great  uproar  if he had not made this arrangement, because, if the railway had not been gone on with, there would have been grave dissatisfaction; but I regard the agreement itself as likely to be a most serious factor in delaying the ultimate construction of the line, because, under the agreement, the final deliveries of powellised sleepers are not due until January, 1916, whereas, under the most favorable circumstances, as much as 7 miles a day of plate-laying has been carried out in the United States of America with a track-laying machine such as the Department has provided. Of course, that is merely a record-breaking business, and the  survey,  the formation work, and the cuttings work are very considerable factors in tie time limit for railway construction purposes; but giving due consideration to a fairly conservative&#39; estimate of all the difficulties on the transcontinental railway, and allowing for a maximum of a mile a day track-laying at each end in place of the record of 7 miles a day, if we start in earnest with this work, it will probably not be long before we shall find ourselves awaiting the delivery of powellised sleepers. In other words, tire terms of the agreement will determine the speed of the work of construction. I only mention this because the difficulty of powellising  heavy  timber such a? sleepers is one that should enter into consideration when dealing with the allotment of contracts. Another matter that I can see standing out largely before us is the labour difficulties that will be involved in handling poisoned timber. With the track-layers provided by the previous Administration, we shall be getting away fi om a great deal of the labour difficulty in connexion with the loading and transporting of the timber, but those of my friends who deal in labour matters will intimately realize that the handling of poisoned timber is likely to create a grave labour difficulty. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know whether they have enlarged the works at Sydney, but some years ago, when I was thinking of investing in a powellising project in Victoria, to guide myself I went over the Sydney works, and I saw that it was a very small plant - I believe the capital is only &#163;25,000. There would not be a tremendous labour difficulty over there on such a small plant. I do not say one word against the powellising process. I think there is something in it. </para>

                        <para>- At any rate, honorable members will see that difficulty is likely to arise. I only touch on it to show the need for some independent and unbiased inquiry into a matter of such great importance. The appointment of a committee would not affect the contract for 1,500,000 sleepers already entered into. Whatever report is brought in by the committee, we are bound by that agreement; we are bound by it in law. Nevertheless, so far as our present obligation is concerned, the Government will take every measure necessary to see that the interests of the Commonwealth are completely safeguarded, so far as we can safeguard them in connexion with this venture. </para>

                    <para>. - I was glad to hear the remark of the Honorary Minister that, even if this select committee be appointed - and, personally, I hope it will - it will not in any way interfere with the agreement now existing between the Western Australian Government and the Commonwealth for the supply of powellised karri sleepers. There is one remark indelibly printed on my mind. During the recent campaign I had a great deal to do with the powellising of sleepers, and I frequently used a quotation from some remarks made by the Honorable Frank Wilson, Leader of the Opposition in the Western Australian Legislative Assembly, who is recognised in Western Australia as a gentleman who thoroughly understands the timber business. Speaking from memory, he. said that &#34; He did not agree with the ex-member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hedges)</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest in regard to the use of the powellising process, because he knew that powellised karri was a very good timber indeed.&#34; I know these words were used, because I used them repeatedly in quoting from the Western Australian <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> in reference to this question. </para>

                        <para>- So far, the Western Australian Government have not used powellised karri sleepers, except for test purposes. It is interesting to note that the powellising plant erected at Bunbury, in Western Australia, and which powellised nearly all the timber used on the Marble Bar railway for sleepers or for station buildings, was built by a Liberal Government in the State. I am glad they did so, because the tests that were made demonstrated that the powellising process is certainly a good one. Between East Perth and Burswood, on the Southwestern Railway, about fifty powellised karri sleepers were put into the track in a cutting, which, from the nature of the ground owing to springs, is constantly wet. All experts advise that damp ground acts adversely to karri, so that the test which I am now mentioning has a double significance. These powellised karri sleepers were placed in the track in 1906, and, if my memory serves me rightly, they were examined in November, 1912, in the presence of the then Governor of Western Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Gerald</inline> Strickland, now the Governor of New South Wales. It was found that the powellised sleepers had stood the test of about six years in the worst conditions, and were absolutely sound. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. As a representative of Western Australia, I do not wish to decry jarrah, which is certainly a good timber; but in the north -west of Western Australia it was found necessary to employ some preservative to enable the jarrah to withstand the ravages of white ants. Several processes were tried. The bulk of the timber for the Marble Bar railway was powellised, but some of it was treated with Taylor&#39;s White Ant Exterminator, and some with jodelite. </para>

                        <para>- Not very well. On account of certain complaints, a number of sleepers were brought down from that railway to Perth for examination, and it was proved that not one of them had been powellised, and that they had been treated by the other preparations. The Honorable W. D. Johnson, Minister for Works in Western Australia, in submitting to the Western Australian Legislative Assembly, the other day, the agreement with the Commonwealth, dealt very exhaustively with the different tests that had been made. I do not wish to go into the merits of powellising <inline font-style="italic">versus</inline> nonpowellising. One could mention many illustrations of the good powellising has done. I simply say that, in my opinion, the powellised karri sleeper is equal to the jarrah sleeper for endurance, and it certainly is a superior sleeper in regard to the holding power of a dog-spike. </para>

                        <para>- In my opinion, the powellisedkarri sleeper is equal to the powellised jarrah sleeper, but when we have a long line of railway to manage, the very fact that the karri sleepers will hold the dog-spikes will make a material reduction in the cost of maintenance, because it will not be so necessary to have such a rigid examination. In Western Australia there is a constant shifting of dog-spikes when they are used in jarrah, with the result that the jarrah sleepers have often to be taken out at a shorter period, in some cases after three years, not because the timber has deteriorated in any way, but because it will not hold the dog-spikes. I am satisfied that when the Western, Australian Government have their powellising plant actually at work in the karri area, the supply of powellised sleepers for the transcontinental railway will be all that the Honorary Minister can possibly desire.

                    <para>. - On the evidence of the honorable member who has just resumed his seat, the Commonwealth has let a contract for a million and a half of sleepers on a test of six years. The utmost evidence that he can give is a test lasting for six years, and because that timber has not decayed he holds that as evidence of the desirability of the Commonwealth going on with the contract for karri sleepers. I am sorry to hear that we are committed to this contract. I tried last year, before we were committed to it, to get a committee of inquiry, but the members who were then sitting on this side of the House, in a majority, refused to grant it. I am very glad that we shall have an inquiry now. I am afraid it will be a serious thing for the Commonwealth if we are committed to the contract. </para>

We have before us the fact that the State of Western Australia, in which karri grows, Has not a mile of karri sleepers laid within its borders.

                        <para>- If the Western Australian Government believe that this process is so good, how is it they have not adopted karri sleepers? The Commonwealth has made an exceedingly  risky bargain. I have here that very admirable publication, the digest of the Home Affairs Department, in which the contracts accepted are set out, and the price of powellised karri delivered at Port Augusta is stated at 7s. 9d. per sleeper. We offered to deliver tested and proved timber from Tasmania, unpowellised, at 5s. 9d. per sleeper. If the powellising process will not give the karri a longer life than that of the known tested blue gum or stringy-bark of Tasmania - and we have practically all stringybark in our railways, its life running from fourteen and sometimes up to twenty-five years - it is evident that the Commonwealth is deliberately throwing away 2s. per sleeper on every sleeper it proposes to use for the transcontinental railway. The honorable member for Denison will bear me out as to the life of our stringy-bark sleepers. </para>

                        <para>- of  course, it was; and i urged the late Minister, and late Government, before committing the Commonwealth in this very serious matter, to hold an inquiry into the process. If it is what its advocates claim it to be, if it will lengthen the life of a rotten timber like karri, which, unpowellised, is no better than willow, and the life of which as a railway sleeper would not be more than four or five years untreated, why should not the process add to the life of a reliable timber? A first-class railway sleeper can be obtained in Tasmania, and it is a bad thing for the Commonwealth if we are committed to this contract, because it is not going to be only a first and great loss. I pointed out in the House before that if these sleepers are laid down and prove to be defective it will cost tens of thousands of pounds te take them up while the railway is running and replace them with others. It will be exceedingly serious if we have committed ourselves to an untried process for an acknowledged inferior timber. I hope that when the committee is appointed they will hold a thorough and complete investigation. Whilst the honorable member for Darwin was speaking I interjected that- the Engineer-in-Chief was not an expert. I did not mean to reflect on his capability as an engineer. What I mean was that he is not an expert as far as timber is concerned. I was glad to hear the Minister say that the services of a really good timber expert had been secured. </para>

                        <para>- -All that i say is that the Engineer-in-Chief , from his very training, is not a timber expert, and we could not expect him to be. I have never been able to understand the influences and interests at work to commit the Commonwealth to this contract for the supply of a million and a half sleepers of an acknowledged inferior timber treated with an unproved process. Where the Commonwealth is committing itself to an expenditure of at least &#163;20,000,000 for railway construction, it is of the utmost importance that the question of timber preparation should be thoroughly investigated. Twelve months ago, and two years ago, I urged the then Minister to have works prepared in one or in several States where the known processes for preserving timber should be given a thorough test. I believe that it will save the Commonwealth probably millions . of money before our railways are finished if we can find some known and proved process to materially increase the life of our timber, and protect it from the ravages of pests. The expenditure on sleepers will be continuous, as we are now building a railway from east to west; there is a proposal to start a railway from north to south, and there is the railway from the Federal Capital to Jervis Bay. I urge upon the Minister the importance of his Department taking the matter in hand, making a thorough test of all known systems for the preservation of timber, and securing the best timbers for the different localities. The lives of timbers vary exceedingly. Some timber is much better in damp country than in dry country, while others can successfully resist for a long period wet, swampy country where other timbers would rot away almost at once. One of the most important Departments that we should have now would consist of one or  two thoroughly well &#39;trained timber men, who have spent their lives in the timber industry. Such men are obtainable in&#39; practically every State, and it would probably be .necessary to get men who have .had experience in the different States. The question of timber for use on our railways is one of the most important that the Minister will have to consider. I believe it is estimated that on the east to west railway alone it will take | over three million sleepers to lay the line down. This will involve an expenditure of practically &#163;1,500,000 on sleepers alone. If we. made a &#39; failure there, and had to take up the whole of them in the early history of the railway, and relay them when the rails are down, it would be a very costly process. I welcome the appointment of a committee. It will do a vast amount pf good, and I hope it will get to work at once and present a report as early as possible. I trust that no further contract for powellised sleepers will be let until an investigation has been made and proof has been afforded of the efficacy of the process. </para>

                    <para>.- That honorable members may be under no misapprehension&#39;, and that my remarks may not have attached to them more weight than is proper, I begin with the declaration that I am a director of the Victorian Powell Process Company. I make that statement so &#39;that honorable members may know exactly from what  stand-point  I speak. I  have  no objection whatever to the appointment of a committee to inquire into the Powell process; indeed, I welcome an inquiry. But the gentleman who has moved for the appointment of a committee stated in his speech that he has an antipathy to the process, a statement which, should disqualify him for membership of the committee. Although it is the parliamentary practice to appoint to, and make  chairman  of, a committee, the member! on whose motion it is - appointed, it would be distinctly unfair to make the honorable member for Dampier  chairman,  or a member of the committee for which he has moved. The treatment of timbers is a subject -which has received consideration from eminent timber experts and engineers throughout the world, and particularly from railway engineers. </para>

If the process does that, every member of the House will welcome it. as increasing the assets of the country. &#34;In Western Australia there are hundreds of thousands of acres of karri, and if the committee makes an inquiry, it will ascertain that the powellising process extracts from timber its sappy matter, and hardens its texture. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member may know that, and yet know nothing about the powellising process. I do not wish to weary the Committee, but, as the ex-member for Fremantle, in this Chamber, made several attacks on the powellising process, in most cases misrepresenting the facts, it might be well for me to give the House some idea of its nature. The honorable member for Grey, when speaking to the motion, said that he &#39;did not know &#34; whether they were in the habit of dipping the sleepers into- the solution and then taking them out.&#34; The solution is a solution of saccharine matter, consisting of water and molasses mixed, with a percentage of arsenic. As to the risk involved in handling the timber that has been treated, I may mention that the percentage of arsenic is about . 005 per cent. That would not hurt anybody. </para>

                        <para>- Experiments have been made with karri, and with both hard and soft woods. In the experiment to which I refer, the untreated wood was destroyed within a few months, the other remaining sound, for the reason that, when the white ants attempted to eat the arsenic in it, they died. I might mention that the jarrah sleepers that have been stacked at the Kalgoorlie end of the transcontinental railway have already been attacked by white ants. </para>

                        <para>- The solution is in tanks 36 feet long by 15 feet deep, and the timber is put into the tanks and boiled. The solution boils at a temperature of 214 deg. Fahrenheit, that is, at 2 deg. above the boiling point of water. When the temperature of the solution has been raised to 212 deg., the sap in the timber, which is merely water, evaporates as steam, passing through the solution. When the sap has evaporated, the temperature of the solution is increased to 214 deg., when the solution percolates through the interstices of the timber. The saccharine matter in the solution, which comes from sugar-cane, is akin to timber in its properties, and, being absorbed into the tissues, becomes part and parcel of the treated timber, so that analysis sometimes cannot separate it from that timber. </para>

                        <para>- The Sydney company is not associated with the Victorian company, and I do not know that a consulting engineer has any direct interest in a company, having merely to advise in an engineering capacity. The paper read by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Julius</inline> dealt not merely with the Powell process, but with all the processes for treating timber known to science. Having dealt with one after another, he speaks of the Powell process in this way- </para>

                    <para>Although soft woods and moderately hard woods that have been treated in England have shown, on test, that the solution penetrated to the very centre of the timbers, even in the case of such resinous woods as pitch pine, balks of which 24 inches square by many feet in length have been treated ; yet, to determine this point definitely with respect to our hardwoods, a number of large sections of our hardest and densest timbers were treated, some green and some dry, amongst them being 5- ft. lengths of 12-in. by 12-in. ironbark. </para>
                    <para>Upon cutting sections from the centre of these timbers, after toiling, chemical tests showed the presence of the saccharine matter and of the other chemicals carried with it, at the very centre of these sections. Conclusive evidence was thus obtained as to the thorough permeation of the solution throughout the whole of the treated timber, thus satisfying the second of the conditions laid down for the ideal process. </para>

                        <para>- I know nothing about that particular experiment, but, generally, sleepers, telegraph poles, and similar timber are boiled for twelve hours. Those interested in the Powell process wish to run it on business lines. If the process is a useless one, they have no desire to be associated with it. They do not wish to employ it merely to extract money from the Commonwealth or State Governments, or from any one else. The process has satisfied all the tests that have been required of it. That is all that can be said . </para>

                        <para>- Small tests have been made in the Northern Territory and in Western Australia. Powellised jarrah sleepers have been tested on the Port Hedland railway. The question has been raised as to why the Western Australian Government do not utilize these sleepers themselves if they believe in the process. I would point out in reply that they are spending &#163;280,000 - I think my figures are correct - in the erection of works to powellise sleepers for use on their own railways as well as for the Commonwealth. The Western Australian Government are totally dissociated from the Victorian Company. The Victorian company is not interested in the contract for powellised sleepers between the Commonwealth Government and the Government of Western Australia. It is a matter entirely between the two Governments, and the company with which I am connected will receive no benefit whatsoever from the contract. </para>

                        <para>- No. Six thousand have been treated under the close supervision of an inspector, and have been accepted by the Government. The experience of the inspector was, I think, that the sleepers were turned out in perfect condition and they have already been shipped. Returning to the process of treating ordinary timber, let me explain that, after the boiling has taken place, the timber is put into drying-rooms, where, if it is required for cabinet work, it may have to remain for a fortnight before it is fit for the market. It is then thoroughly shrunken. We have, in Melbourne, desks made of ordinary common </para>

This timber, after being subjected to the powellising process, was used in making a cabinet six weeks after the tree from which it was taken had been cut down. Yet there is not the sign of a warp or of shrinkage. Any honorable member may see it for himself, and judge how the process deals with inferior timbers. </para>

                        <para>- There is. I can give my honorable friend numerous cases. Inquiries were made by the Indian authorities with regard to the use of timbers for sleepers in that country, and reports were asked for with regard to the suitability of Australian and other timbers. Very eminent engineers recommend the application of the process to timbers required for the Indian railways. The Victorian Powellising Company can get whatever orders it wants for the supply of powellised timber for the Indian railways. It has no need to consider the Australian railways in any way whatever. </para>

                    <para>With regard to Tasmanian sleepers, however, all the evidence goes to show that they are unsuited to India, either in the dry zones or in the wet zones. In the dry zones they arc found to be very liable to split badly; they are also liable to white-ant attacks and dry rot, whilst enlargement of the spike-holes due to excessive shrinkage of the timber and decay is a serious matter. In the wet zones the most serious defects of the Tasmanian sleepers are tendency to split and rot. In the wet and dry zones the Tasmanian sleepers get very badly cut into at the rail-seat under heavy traffic. </para>

                    <para>.- I desire to refer very briefly to a remark made by the honorable member for Henty in regard to myself. I was particularly careful in submitting this motion to avoid making any statement which might be construed as reflecting on the powellising process. I have submitted this motion because I am afraid of the contracts that have been entered into. I am afraid of the process, and I do not think that it is going to be effective. But for that opinion I should not have taken action. My sole desire <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> that there shall be an investigation, and honorable members may rest assured that I, together with the other members of the Select Committee, I hope, will enter upon the inquiry with an open mind and with a desire to do the best we can for the Commonwealth and for Western Australia and its industries. If the powellising process is a good one, and if those enormous forests, with millions of tons of timber, could be made available for this purpose, I should welcome the fact; but we are in duty bound to make some investigation before we are committed to any further expenditure. I ask leave to add the following words to the motion - </para>

                    <para>- I submit that a debate upon the second reading of this Bill is not in order, inasmuch as yesterday after the motion for the adjournment of the debate was carried, the Prime Minister moved the adjournment of the House without moving to fix the  resumption  of the debate for to-day, or any other day. This is not in conformity with standing order 147, which says - </para>

            <para>An Order of the Day is a Bill or other matter which the House has ordered to be taken into consideration on <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> particular day. I think that you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> will admit that the debate on the second reading of the Bill having been adjourned, and the resumption of the debate not having been fixed for any particular day, it cannot come on for consideration now. In support of my contention, I desire to quote from the tenth edition of <inline font-style="italic">May,</inline> as follows: - </para>
            <para>The ordinary public business of the House consists of Orders of the Day, <inline font-style="italic">i.e.,</inline> a Bill oi other matter which the House has ordered to be taken into consideration on a particular day ; and notices of motion. </para>
            <para class="block">As the resumption of this debate was not fixed for any particular day, it cannot be discussed to-day. To admit of the second reading of the Bill being discussed at this sitting, the Prime Minister should have moved to fix the resumption of the debate for today. Seeing that that was not done, I ask whether it is in order to consider the question, &#34; That the Bill be now read a second time.&#34; </para>

                    <para>- There was a personal explanation - no one else spoke - and the Prime Minister at once replied in a speech to which exception might have been taken, and, as a matter of fact, was taken. It was rather well done by the Prime Minister. When he said nothing in moving the adjournment of the House, we thought that there would be no debate; but after the personal explanation was made, he got up to reply, and used his opportunity in closing the debate to make some observations. There was, however, no motion that the debate be made an Order of the Day for a future sitting, and I submit that, because a mistake was made in the excitement of the moment, it is 110 reason why we should not follow our practice. </para>

                    <para>- I suppose the notice-paper was not altered. It was first in the list, and remained there. It is not necessary to add anything further in support of the point of order. We have a practice to follow, and though it may be inconvenient to come here ready to launch our ideas on this Loan Bill, and to have to postpone them, we must, of necessity, bottle them up in order to comply with the Standing Orders. It is quite possible that an honorable member who was watching the proceedings yesterday might say to himself that, inasmuch as no motion was submitted to fix a future day for the consideration of this Bill, it dropped off the notice-paper, and he need not trouble to come to the House to-day. He would expect that, in due course, the motion would come on again, when he would be in a position to make his speech. If we consider the measure to-night, some honorable member might be taken by surprise, which is another reason why the standing order, should be complied with. We have other business to go on with. There is that important measure, the Norfolk Island Bill, which should be dealt with as soon as possible ; but if the Prime Minister does not consider it an urgent matter, we .have the Electoral Bill, the Tasmania Grant, Bill, and the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Bill, all important measures that should be dealt with. Putting aside the Loan Bill for a day or two will not hamper the Ministry in their proposals to carry out their policy. The Invalid and Old-age Pensions Bill is a subject about which we can all agree. We are most anxious to have the amendment made as soon as possible. We are anxious to consider also the Electoral Bill. </para>

                        <para>- The Prime Minister need not try to apply the &#34; gag &#34; to me even if he does apply it to his followers. He can &#34; gag &#34; them, but he has no power to &#34;gag&#34; me. I see no reason for departing from the Standing Orders. No emergency has arisen. If an emergency has arisen, let the Prime Minister move that the Standing Orders be suspended to permit him to deal with the Loan Bill this evening. Of course, this position would never have, arisen had the Prime Minister taken the advice of that eloquent writer of the <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> &#34;Ithuriel,&#34; who says that if a Prime Minister desires to be a success he must cultivate urbanity and that serenity of1 mind which refuses to be disturbed by any happening. The Prime Minister proposes to break the Standing Orders, which are provided for the proper conduct of business and in order that everything; may be done decently, and in order. </para>

                        <para>- I must take notice of them when they are insulting. This is one of the questions we have to take seriously. If this business can be on the business-paper for to-day, certain of our Standing Orders are wiped out for all time, and there is no need for the Government to fix any particular day upon which a matter shall be settled. We are here to-day, but to-morrow a majority of us may be gone. To-day we are in Opposition, but next day we may be across the chamber, and <inline font-style="italic">vice versa.</inline> In the circumstances, we have the right to see that the. business of the House is carried on in a way that is fair and just to all parties. I think that the proper course for the Prime Minister to have taken in this case was to have come down and candidly admitted a mistake, and asked for the second reading of the Bill to be restored to the business-paper. </para>

                        <para>- I hope it is not too late for the Government to adopt that course. Any other course is irregular. How do we get Orders of the Day, and why are they required? They are required for the protection of the House, in order that nothing may be hastily rushed through, arid they are fixed for a special day, so that honorable members will know that not a minute before the day for which they are fixed can they&#39; be dealt with, excepting in a case of grave emergency - say, in the case of war, or some extraordinary thing which needs extraordinary procedure, when it is necessary that the Standing Orders should be put on one side for the protection of the community. If we are dealing with a motion, notice is given that on such-and-such a day it will be moved. When the motion is dealt with, and we wish to give it further consideration, we. adopt this course : that the motion shall be fixed for further consideration on a certain day. Otherwise it lapses. If the honorable member moving the motion is not prepared to go on with it it lapses, and goes by the board. If we wish to kill a Bill, we merely move to drop the word &#34;now &#34; from the motion, &#34; That this Bill be now read a second time,&#34; and add the words, &#34; this day six months,&#34; knowing that the House will not be sitting then. Or we may refuse to fix a day on which it shall be further discussed, and thus the thing is at an end. Had the motion been moved yesterday to fix the resumption of the debate on the second reading of the Loan Bill for a certain day, it is quite possible that honorable members may have taken the same course as in regard to the previous vote, and refused to fix a future day.. On that, the Bill would be gone. It is not wise to break down rules. This particular rule is as well known in parliamentary practice as the statement of grievances before Supply. It does not date back several centuries, I admit. The other matter arose really before we had representative or responsible government ; but, as regards this particular practice, it was placed in the Standing Orders of the House of Commons, and has been placed in the Standing Orders of Legislative Chambers throughout the world, to prevent any Government from taking advantage of the House at any particular moment it may think fit. Every one can see how necessary it is. We fix the business-paper so as to show the order in which our business will be taken. When a motion or a Bill is placed on the notice-paper as an Order of the Day for to-morrow, every one knows that it is not necessarily to be discussed tomorrow ; but it enables the Government to have ample opportunity of arranging their business in whatever order they think proper. If we pick up to-day&#39;s business-paper, we find that the first Order of the Day is the Loan Bill, which was never made an Order of the Day. Everything must be done by motion. The Norfolk Island Bill, Invalid and Old-age Pensions Bill, Tasmania Grant Bill, Public Debts Bill, &#38;c, have all been arranged in their order by the Government, but all of them were made an Order of the Day for the next day by a distinct and clear resolution of the House. </para>

There is nothing that we want to hide in this matter, or should hide. It is a question that affects &#39; every honorable member vitally, because it concerns the conduct of the business of the House. I should not like to express a strong opinion on the law; but it is very questionable after this question has been raised whether, if the Bill was attempted to be put into law, it would be held to be legal. In the circumstances, the proper course to follow is to i ask that the Bill be restored to the notice-paper. The honorable member has only to give notice to-night, go on with another Bill now, and have this&#39; one restored to-morrow. The business will then be done in a proper and constitutional way. Otherwise we shall be taking a course which we shall very much regret, and which will be very detrimental to the best interests of the House. In the 10th edition of <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> the ;matter is put very clearly. It is stated there that the ordinary public business of &#39;the House consists of Orders of the Day, &#39;that is, a Bill or other matter which the House has ordered to be taken into consideration on a particular day, and notices of motions. The House has given no direction for this Bill to be placed on the paper. There are cases where Bills and motions lapse, and it is necessary for them to be restored to the notice-paper. The practice in this House has been that in the event of a count out the business on which it takes place can only be restored to the paper by a direct and specific motion by one of the Ministers. This motion could be debated. . We amended the standing order afterwards to provide that in the event of a count out the business should be restored to the paper on motion without debate. Previously a lengthy debate ensued, and for that reason <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> introduced the new standing order I mentioned. In <inline font-style="italic">May,</inline> 11th edition, page 263, the revival &#39;of Orders of the Day is set out thus - </para>

                <para>There is a clear distinction in this case - no particular day was fixed for the business, and our contention is that even if our own Standing Orders were silent, which they are not, the procedure which I have quoted from <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> is that which we must follow.

                <para class="block">That standing order does not apply in this case, because&#39; the motion for the second reading of the Loan Bill was already an Order of the Day for yesterday, and was moved by the Treasurer. What actually happened was this: After the motion, which was an Order of the Day, had been moved, and while it was being discussed, an honorable member moved, &#34; That the debate be adjourned,&#34; which was carried. But after the adjournment, the customary motion fixing the time or date for the resumption of the debate was not moved. There was not a refusal to make the resumption of the debate an Order of the Day, but there was a failure to do so, apparently through inadvertence; and there is a wide distinction between the two positions. I must have regard to the fact that the debate on the Order of the Day was adjourned without anything further being done. That amounted to an indication by the House that the debate would be resumed at some future time. But, in the face of the fact that the House had not determined when the debate should be resumed, I did not feel prepared to take on myself the responsibility of - saying when it should be resumed, as that is a question for the House itself to determine. There was no direction to the Chair as to the resumption of the debate. With regard to the reference of the honorable member for Kennedy to <inline font-style="italic">May&#39;s Practice,</inline> in this case proceedings were not in course of transaction, but had been adjourned by vote of the House before the motion to adjourn the House itself was moved. Therefore, when the  Clerk  of the House called my attention to the peculiar position of affairs, I felt that I had no right to interfere with the business-paper, but should leave it as it was. The House omitted to decide when the debate should be resumed, and that is why I simply directed the  Clerk  to leave the notice for the resumption of the debate where it was, and to let the House decide for itself as to when the adjourned debate should be proceeded with. With regard to the argument of- the honorable member for Kennedy, I am not able to agree with him that the statement on page 257 of the eleventh edition of <inline font-style="italic">May,</inline> dealing with the ordinary course of business, applies. As to the revival of Orders of the Day, which is referred to on page 263 of the same work, the reference is to dropped Orders - </para>

                    <para>The proceedings thereon may be cut short by the adjournment of the House whilst those proceedings are in course of transaction. An Order of the Day in such a case, or if when the Order is read no day is appointed for its future consideration, drops off the notice-paper, as the House has made no order thereon. </para>

                <para>The whole argument is governed by the words, &#34; When the order has been read.&#34; The proceedings yesterday were not interrupted when the Order of the Day had been read,, but after debate had proceeded on the Order of the Day, and had been adjourned on division. As I have said, I took the &#39; carrying of the motion for the adjournment of the debate as an expression of the intention of the House to continue the debate at some future time, although no particular time for its resumption was fixed. If the House had not desired to continue the debate, the motion would have been moved, &#34; That the Bill be read this day six months,&#34; or some other motion which would have been equivalent to a motion discharging it from the notice-paper. No such motion was moved, and, therefore, I take it&#39; that there was no. desire that the Order of the Day should be dropped off the business-paper. In any case, it does not seem to me that the Order of the Day can be regarded as a lapsed motion. The Government is responsible for the order of business on the notice-paper. Unless the House intervenes, I propose to call it on in the ordinary way, but I think a motion, by leave, for resumption would be preferable. </para>

                        <para>- You have, not ruled, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> that the motion is out of order, and you have not ruled . that it is in order. Do I understand that some other motion must be moved ? I suggest that the easy and proper way of getting out of the difficulty is for the Prime Minister to move that the Order of the Day be restored to the business-paper. I make these suggestions to assist you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> and to assist the whole House. I do not desire to provoke any discussion on this matter, because I shall never be one, when a question seriously affecting the Standing Orders is before us, to take advantage of the circumstances to use them for party or personal advantage. I shall never be one to bring down the discussion of questions of order to the level of party debates. Therefore, in all sincerity, I make this suggestion as to the proper way to deal with the matter. The course that I suggest will relieve <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> of his difficulty, and put the House right. It is the duty of the Prime Minister to do that. </para>

                <para>No member shall, unless it be otherwise specially  provided  by the Standing Orders, make any motion except in pursuance of notice openly given at a previous sitting of the House and duly entered on the notice-paper. How is it possible for the &#39;Prime Minister to move this motion of which he has not given notice? There is a regular course of procedure prescribed by our rules, and notice must be given of all motions. If notice were not given, how could members be made acquainted with the business of the House? </para>

The proper course to pursue will be to ask the leave of the House to submit a motion. </para>

                        <para>- I do not wish to repeat what I have already said. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> I think, rather under-estimated what would be expected of him, and what guidance this House would take from him if he made up his mind and gave us a definite ruling one way or the other. I submit, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> that for you to leave to the House the important question of the procedure m to be adopted under the Standing  Orders was a very dangerous course of action. It may lead to a wrangle. We desire guidance from the Chair, and a distinct and definite expression of opinion from you. It would be a fatal mistake to allow the position to remain as it is. If we do, then it will not be necessary to fix a day for the resumption of the debate on any measure. That is the important point which we have to bear in mind. There could be no more drastic departure from the Standing Orders and from rulings which are so clearly the other way. I think that the Government should at once settle the matter. Having made this statement, I wish to say now to the Government - and I think I can speak on behalf of all the members of my party - that we will give them every facility in remedying the oversight that evidently occurred last night. But let it be remedied in a way that will be in accordance with our &#39; Standing Orders. The remedy is to be found in obtaining the leave of the House to submit a motion, bringing us back to the original position which we occupied when the debate on the motion for the second reading of the Bill was adjourned. The Government could then move that the further consideration of the Bill be taken forthwith. If the House adopts that motion there will be an end to the matter, and the whole trouble will have been overcome without the creation of any new precedent. </para>

                        <para>- Order 1 The House failed to fix any particular time for the resumption of the debate. It gave no direction to the Chair, and therefore I, as  Speaker,  directed the  Clerk  to leave it, unless otherwise directed by the Prime Minister, in the position it occupied when the debate was adjourned. I rule that the Order of the Day for the resumption of the debate on the motion for the second reading of the Bill is properly on the business-paper, and, unless a motion to disagree with that ruling is submitted, I suggest the debate proceed by leave of the House, and on motion to that effect. </para>

May I suggest to the House what seems to me to be the common-sense view of the situation. The position in which we find ourselves to-night is unprecedented in the whole history of the Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> with all the expert knowledge around him, has taken the course of fixing the Order of the Day in the order in which it appears on the business-paper. It seems to me, therefore, that we might well defer to those who have more experience and more expert knowledge of these matters than we have.

Either the debate upon the Order of the Day must be proceeded with at once, or some other course must be taken by direction of the House. J have decided that the Order of the Day is properly on the business-paper, and unless action be taken to disagree with that ruling, the debate on the Order of the Day must be dealt with in a definite way. </para>

It seems to me that if my honorable friends opposite are anxious to get on with the business of the country, we might well agree not to raise any more technicalities in connexion with the unprecedented situation that has arisen. No precedent has been cited, and the circumstances are quite new. To create a precedent can be  the only object of all this talk; and, therefore, we ought to proceed with the business down on the notice-paper. </para>

We are most desirous, apart altogether from the party issues raised by the Prime Minister, to see that the rules, customs, and practices of this Parliament are safeguarded, not only for ourselves, but  for  future members. The introduction of political matters by the Prime Minister is unfortunate. </para>

                        <para>-  I do not care a button whether the Prime Minister thinks so or not. I can assure the honorable gentleman that I am as sincere as any man could be in taking up my present position. We have afforded the Prime Minister every possible facility, and I would not like to move that the Speaker&#39;s ruling be disagreed with, for the reason that I know that this position is not the Speaker&#39;s fault. If it were the Speaker&#39;s fault, and I thought it necessary, I should not hesitate for a moment to move such a motion. There is the one proper and legitimate course for the Prime Minister, as Leader of the House, to follow, in order to bring this Bill properly before the Chamber. The Leader of the Opposition has already stated that he is prepared, on behalf of the party on this side, to allow such a motion as I have suggested to pass without discussion; and the Prime Minister has merely to ask leave to have the Bill restored to the paper. </para>

                        <para>-  It is not an uncommon thing, but quite usual, for a House of Parliament to get into a tangle, and such a step as I have suggested would not injure the Prime Minister&#39;s dignity in the slightest, although he may think that it would. The House has got into tangles forty times, not only under you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> but under myself, and every other  Speaker.  Indeed, it would be an extraordinary House that did not get into a difficulty of the kind now and again, because people, when they are a little excited, do things that are never intended. We are in a tangle now; and when the , question was brought up, you left it entirely to the House to decide. The Leader of the House has failed to take the course you suggested, and I deeply regret the fact. If you, sir, rule, that the Bill can be debated now, you leave us no other course but to take exception to your ruling, and move that it be disagreed with. That, as I have said, I do not wish to do, because the position that has arisen is not your fault, but the fault of the House. I am not blaming any particular member, and, under the circumstances, I think that the Leader of the House should be the first to get us out of the difficulty. </para>

                        <para>- May I again point out that this is an unfortunate position that has arisen through an oversight of the House itself. I have already stated that, so far as the business itself is concerned, it is properly on the business-paper, and should not be dropped off ; but where it should go on the business-paper is not for me to decide, the House having given me no direction on the matter. But if honorable members will allow me  to make a suggestion, it is to drop all party heat, and to view the matter in a calm and dispassionate way, altogether free from party issues, as sensible men desirous of getting out of a position into which they have placed themselves. I suggest that the simplest and easiest way would be for the Prime Minister to ask the leave of the House to resume the debate at the point where it was interrupted. This, if agreed to, would get over the difficulty ; but, of course, if there is any objection, it cannot be done. </para>

                    <para>. - We are indebted to the Treasurer for giving us, in a very able speech, some valuable information in regard to the measure. The right honorable gentleman was brief to an extent, yet, in my opinion, he covered all the requirements of the case ; and I do not think any charge could be made against the Treasurer of not giving us the information necessary for a proper discussion of the measure. I regret, however, that the speech lacked a full explanation of the whole of the situation. What I mean is that the statements of the right honorable gentleman were liable to mislead the country. Let it not be supposed for one moment that I accuse the right honorable gentleman of any attempt to wilfully mislead ; but those of long years of familiarity with what is sometimes regarded as a dismal science are prone to present the subject in a manner which may be perfectly intelligible, and easily understood, by others equally proficient in the subject, though not so clear to those not so favorably circumstanced.  I am inclined to think, however, that even amongst those who pose so often as great financiers there are humbugs as great as any in the community. There is another method of dealing with financial questions, and that is to present them in such a manner that the ordinary intelligent citizen can grasp their full purport. The Treasurer stated that the Labour Government introduced a borrowing policy, and that they were responsible for borrowing to the extent, in round figures, of  &#163;3,000,000.  I think it preferable to deal in round figures, which are the more easily grasped, greater detail being difficult of apprehension, certainly by those who read financial speeches. We are asked now to pass a Loan Bill authorizing the borrowing of some &#163;3,080,000; and it is strange to notice how the expenditure of the country is steadily increasing. Not many months ago, we heard a great deal about the necessity of stemming the tide of extravagance that was said to be going on all over the country under the administration of the Fisher Government; and it is truly remarkable to find their successors proposing, practically, to increase the expenditure by something like &#163;5,000,000, the sum of &#163;3.000,000 odd to be provided by means of this Loan Bill. The House and the country must realize that the expenditure on the system of defence that we have launched is likely to increase rather than to diminish as the years go on; indeed, it must increase as the population increases. I wish to point out some curious facts regarding national finance. In the days of Bright, Gladstone, and Disraeli, and men of that stamp, in the &#34; sixties,&#34; when the National Budget of Great Britain was something like &#163;80,000,000 sterling, the great cry of the Radicals, and of John </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">Bright in particular, was always a complaint about the great increase of expenditure; but, instead of that expenditure diminishing, I think the expenditure of Great Britain last year amounted to something like &#163;200,000,000. I am afraid that we shall find that as Australia&#39;s population and enterprises increase we shall have to face a similar increase in expenditure, though, at the same time, we shall not be justified in departing from a very vigilant scrutiny of the Estimates as they come down from year to year. I am justified in calling attention to the curious phenomenon of the present party being in office and bringing down this increased expenditure, when they complain so much of the extravagance of their predecessors. The late Government brought down a Loan Bill for something like &#163;3,000,000, and the present Administration are asking for another &#163;3,000,000, which will make the total of &#163;6,000,000. The Treasurer says that the Labour party are responsible for this borrowing. He says that, in addition to the new expenditure for which he is asking sanction, we have a debt of something like &#163;8,000,000 for the Northern Territory, and that there is another &#163;10,000,000, when we take into consideration Cockatoo Island, which has been taken over as a transferred property, and the other properties transferred from the various States, upon which we have to pay interest, which brings the total amount of the debt to &#163;22,000,000. That statement is misleading. The undoubted inference is that the Labour party are responsible for a debt of &#163;22,000,000, so far as the Commonwealth is concerned. Let us examine the Treasurer&#39;s statement, and see what it really amounts to. All that the Commonwealth &#39; has actually borrowed is &#163;3,000,000, and we are now asking for power to borrow another &#163;3,000,000. Where does the &#163;8,000,000 for the Northern Territory come in? I understand that &#163;1,000,000 will be required for expenditure in connexion with the railway from Pine Creek to Katherine River; but, independently of that, there is no funded debt of the Commonwealth in connexion with the Northern Territory, though any one reading the Treasurer&#39;s remarks would gather that the Commonwealth has a total funded debt of &#163;22,000,000. What does the &#163;8.000.000 refer to in connexion with the Northern Territory ? The South Australian Government borrowed to that extent in connexion with the building of a railway from Palmerston to Pine Creek and one from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta, and for the development of the Territory, and, at the present time, South Australia is liable for that loan. The loan must be redeemed by South Australia. All the Commonwealth does is year by year to pay interest to South Australia on this amount spent in connexion with the development of the Northern Territory, with the exception of &#163;400,000 that the late Administration wiped- off from the debt attaching to the Northern Territory. That is a statement any one can understand. I do not charge the Treasurer with misleading the people with any intention by so doing. But there are professors of finance who evidently believe that the object of financial statements should be that those in the immediate circle should understand them, but that they should be obscured to the mass of the people. Tallyrand&#39;s maxim, that language is intended to conceal thought, occurs to me. Certainly financial statements are made for the purpose of misleading the public. As to the &#163;10,000,000 in connexion with transferred properties, any one not knowing the fallacy of the argument would imagine that this was a funded debt of &#163;10,000,000 of the Commonwealth. No such thing exists. The Melbourne Post Office was the property of the State of Victoria, but by an arrangement made for the transfer of properties from the States, it became the property of the Commonwealth, and the Commonwealth pays the Victorian Government interest upon it, which interest goes to meet the debt incurred by Victoria in building the Post Office. That building is simply typical of all the establishments taken over from the various States, and known as transferred properties. That is the extent of the &#163;10,000,000 indebtedness. One of the reasons behind this argument may be that the Government are anxious to create a funded debt of the Commonwealth, seeing that they talked some time ago of some proposal to take over the State debts. If that is their object, well and good ; but they had better say so straightforwardly, and not do it under cover of a proposal like this. The Commonwealth has no funded debt at all. I believe the last Parliament passed an Act to empower the Commonwealth Government to issue  inscribed stock if they desired to do so, but they have not done so up to the present. </para>

                        <para>- That is all right, so far as experts in finance are concerned. The ordinary man will come to the conclusion that it is a funded debt, and that is why I object to the statement that the Labour party are responsible for this borrowing. I admit that the Labour party are responsible for the borrowing of &#163;3,000,000, but that is interest-bearing, and the Labour party have never been opposed to borrowing for reproductive works with a sinking fund attached. They are always opposed to reckless borrowing, and to borrowing under certain conditions. For instance, there is no reproductive work about a navy. There is nothing reproductive in connexion with the material in connexion with our Army. If anything, that should be regarded as an insurance fund for the Commonwealth. We get no revenue out of it, and it should be an annual charge on the community. </para>

                        <para>- That is a very open question. I should certainly say that, in some instances, they should not be an annual charge upon the community, but there are others where they should. I question whether the machinery that is being used at Cockatoo Island, when the place is purchased and equipped, will not be used for other purposes than in connexion with the dockyard. For that reason it should not be in the same position as a railway, or matters of that character. It should be a charge upon the general community, to be met from year to year as ordinary expenses. I have admitted that the last Administration borrowed &#163;3,000,000, but during the last three years we spent &#163;10,000,000 on postal and other works out of revenue, and the </para>

                <para class="block">Commonwealth Royal Navy at present floating in our waters is the absolute property of the Australian people; but it should be remembered that one of the earliest Ministerial acts of the Administration before last was to secure power from Parliament to float a loan of &#163;3,500,000 towards the purchase  of a Navy, and that we promptly repealed that Act in the early days of the last Parliament. The Treasurer is very strongly in favour of this policy of borrowing, and practically describes our policy as a stick-in-the-mud policy. The time has arrived for the Commonwealth, and also the Motherland, to realize the fact that there is nothing very original in our method of government, because it is an axiom that those who own the property in the community will get the power in the community. Through the absence of any policy on the part of our producers, and owing to the mania for borrowing that we have inherited from our predecessors, the public of this country, and the public of England, have no property at all. We own certain buildings, but very little revenue-earning property, and until the community does own property of its own it will be continually liable, owing to the past system of government, to the influences of property out of all proportion to what should obtain in any free country. Honorable members opposite remind me of the old saying of the Frenchman, that the first thing an Englishman said was, &#34; It is a fine morning; let us go out and kill something.&#34; We may well say of the Conservative party of the Commonwealth that their first remark is, &#34; What a beautiful day it is; let us go out and float a loan.&#34; I can recollect a New South Wales Government being- attacked with great ferocity by the Conservative party in New South Wales on the score of extravagance; but their defence, which I think they were entitled to put forward, was that it was a time of drought, and that it was absolutely essential to- keep things going. I am not here to defend their action, but there is a good deal more to be said in defence of .the Government that would do that under those conditions than can be. said- for a Government which, in the best, of seasons,- and with inflated markets, can &#39; think of nothing but floating a loan. A good deal has been done by the pioneers borrowing money and creating public works, but I am reminded of a very rich man in my own State, to whom the Premier of the day said, &#34;You have done a great deal for South Australia;&#34; and he replied,  &#39; But ye ken, South Australia has done a great deal for me.&#34; In the old days borrowed money poured into the various States, and helped to make individuals richer, but was there a corresponding advantage to the community? To-day we have the Treasurer stating that he is providing a sinking fund of <inline font-style="italic">h</inline> per cent, and certainly, if we do go in for borrowing, we ought to increase our sinking fund. The policy being pursued by the Commonwealth, and by all the States, is resulting in the piling up of a heavy debt, and no attempt is being made to escape from it. Take, for instance, the case of the railways. They are not the, property of the Commonwealth, but the argument will apply with equal force to those that we build. There is no likelihood of a big revenue being derived from the east to west railway for some years. The Commonwealth will have to bear the burden, and there is no necessity for us to shirk our responsibilities. The Treasurer, in his speech last evening, referred to the fact that our railways had earned 4 per cent., but it cannot be denied that for all practical purposes the railways of Australia are not the property of the people of Australia, but the property of the bond-holders of the various State Governments. The sooner we, and the people generally, realize that there is nothing original in a Government which wants more revenue proposing to increase taxation the better. We ought to be intelligent enough to have certain revenues coming in, and by that means to diminish taxation to the community. That policy is not likely to be popular on the other side of the House, but the position is a very simple one. A tremendous amount of income is being earned by some people, which they cannot spend. They re-invest it, and we are getting into existence an army of people whom Bismarck very well described thirty years ago in Germany as doing nothing but &#34; cut coupons and sign receipts.&#34; It will not be a good thing for Australia to increase this noble army, but that is what the borrowing brigade are anxious to do. They are always crying out for the States to go into the markets to borrow, and always anxious to encourage capital to come into the community. Every year nearly &#163;200,000,000 pours intO the Old Country as a tribute in interest from the rest of the world, and every part of the Empire is a tributary; but is it not a reflection on the intelligence of our people that .we have no brains to do anything better than that ? Should we not be in a position to have revenues coming into our own coffers? </para>

                    <para>To make any profitable comparison of direct taxation in England and Germany, it is necessary to take into consideration in the case of the latter not merely the Imperial taxes, but also the taxes levied by the Federal States. It is also important to remember that a large portion of the States&#39; expenditure, in Prussia as much as 47 per cent., is covered by the profits of railways and other industrial undertakings, the State being thus enabled,protanto, to dispense with taxation. </para>

In the Commonwealth and in the Motherland, they quarrel about Socialism, but in the German Empire, our great rival, they get their revenue largely from Socialistic enterprises ; they do not depend wholly on the taxation of the people. We have not risen to that. Australia is a rich country, and when the debate on the Budget is resumed, I shall speak again of the wealth of the Commonwealth. I shall show that we are not a poverty stricken country, but are rich in resources, and in the industry of our people. I shall show, too, that our people are not idle.

                <para>Surely it is worth the gravest consideration here that one-half the State revenues of Prussia, the chief State of the German Empire, is derived from the ownership of railways, forests, mines, and other national undertakings.

                <para>In Germany they are opposed to a certain form of Socialism, but the country is run on practical business lines. We talk of boards of directors, and those who are responsible for the various Budgets of Australia constitute a board of directors to watch over the interests of those who cut coupons and sign receipts. The position has to be faced. When it is said that those with whom I am associated have a mania for borrowing, I say &#34; No,&#34; except in the last resort. When you borrow, you should get rid of your liabilities, using the money for revenue-producing purposes, thus relieving the community of taxation. That is a sound principle that I have advocated before to-night, but I cannot say that it is original. I have to label it &#34; Made in Germany &#34; - </para>

                <para class="block">The Treasurer says that we are a stick-in-the-mud party, because we are not in favour of borrowing every fine day. That is the answer that we make to remarks of that character. There is another and a quicker method by means of which we could achieve big revenue earning, but we are not likely to adopt it for possibly a generation or two. This Parliament cannot go in advance of the people&#39;s desires. Like all Parliaments, its intelligence is to be measured by the intelligence of those who created it. I should like to see, not the nationalization of this, that, or the other industry - that does not carry any weight with me - but the nationalization of banking, which is the corner-stone of industry, because it governs the credit of the community. Why were the private bankers opposed to the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank and to the Australian note issue? Because they are shrewd, sensible men, who desire to keep intact the preserves of private interests. What would be gained if banking were nationalized ? We should then have one bank doing all the banking business of the community. That would not make any difference to business men. They would get advances on securities, as they do now. No bank could make advances without requiring security, because if that were done the bank would fail. But the community, if banking were nationalized, could build all its public works on the turnover of the wage-sheet of a week. When an employer pays his men in notes or in gold, what becomes of the money ? It goes into the banks, and comes out again, and, very likely, will return to his hands. Money circulates in this way through the community, everything being done for the purposes of profit. Everything to-day is produced for what it will fetch in the market. But, under the conditions I suggest, the production would be the cheapest in the world, and no private enterprise could compete against it. You would have very little debt, and as your public works were finished and equipped, they would become revenue-earning. Thus the people would be free from taxation. There would be no interest to pay, except on the Savings Banks&#39; deposits of the employes. Ultimately this would have a very big effect on the community. It would create a big industrial population, and would diminish the army of those who cut coupons and sign receipts. If honorable members ask whether I am advocating this, my reply is that I am merely stating what can be done. When the people of Australia understand the question, Parliament will turn its attention to it, but the Australian people must first recognise the force of what I say. That will not happen for some years to come, and not while the electors are content to return a Conservative Government to safeguard their interests. Until then we shall have to put up with the system of borrowing, and all that we can do will be to keep down the loans to the lowest possible limit, except for reproductive purposes, and to see that ample sinking funds are established for the redemption of the loans. Honorable members may ask, &#34;Do you expect a return from the expenditure on the east to west railway?&#34; I certainly do not for many years to come. The expense of that railway is a charge the community must bear. Then the Treasurer has told us that, having regard to what is to be appropriated this session, our liability for the Northern Territory amounts to &#163;8,000,000. But that liability had to be incurred, just as the liability for the east to west railway had to be incurred. It is creditable to South Australia that she carried the burden for a number of years, and kept the Northern Territory white. It cannot be said that the people of Queensland kept that State white. </para>

                        <para>- Be that as it may, we have incurred this immense liability, and the sooner we can make the Northern Territory reproductive the better it will be for the Commonwealth. It can be made reproductive only by railway development. The new lines in Canada, the United States of America, and even in Russia, have preceded settlement. When I first entered the Parliament of a neighbouring State it was quite a common saying, &#34; This railway will not pay, and, therefore, we cannot build it.&#34; That idea in regard to railway construction, however, has long since passed out of the minds of Australians, Canadians, and others who have to deal with vast areas of sparsely-populated country. We have to realize that railroads must be built in order to attract settlement, and I do not anticipate any real development of the Northern Territory until it has been opened up by railway construction. It must be opened up. I question whether we have not spent too much upon its administration. I question whether we could not have done without some of the distinguished, learned, and illustrious men whom we have sent up there. We have spent quite enough in this direction, but I hope there will be no difference of opinion as to the need of developing the Territory by railway construction. The Northern Territory line, for which this Bill provides, must be paid for out of loan account, just as we are paying out of loan money for the construction of the line from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta. </para>

                        <para>- I think we should start from the south, for climatic reasons, and also for the reason that that part of the Territory is closer to a market than is the north. If we did so, and gave those working on the railway an opportunity to settle on the land, we should have a system of pioneering going on from south to north. I ask honorable members to forget  for the moment that I am a representative of South Australia, and to view this question from a purely practical stand-point. The extension of a railway from Fine Creek southwards was bequeathed to the present Administration by the late Government, but I was never strongly in favour of it. Extra expenditure will be incurred in carrying all the material up to Palmerston and taking labour up there. A hundred and one difficulties will have to be overcome which would nob be met with if we started building our railway from the south towards the north. </para>

                        <para>- It could be carried on for a very considerable distance. I am inclined to think that the building of a railway from north to south will be a very expensive undertaking. The question, however, is one for engineers to determine, and we need not dogmatize upon it. If it can be shown that it is cheaper to start from the north and proceed southwards, instead of starting from the south with our railway, then I shall only say that the figures do not work out in the direction that common sense would suggest. </para>

No doubt, there are stretches of inferior country which will have to be traversed by a railway in order to open up the good country. But the honors able member&#39;s argument is that until we know all about the resources of a country we should not open it up by means of railway construction. </para>

                        <para>- Even if the country is not. first class farming land, what about its use for pastoral purposes? Then, again, it has great mineral resources which cannot be developed until cheap carriage is secured. Honorable members may think that I am biased because I am a representative of South Australia. As a matter of fact, I am not. I ask them to consider whether, from a practical point of view, we should not open up the Territory, and so relieve ourselves of a great liability. We need to alter our whole system of finance. There is nothing clever in the British or Australian method of meeting expenditure. We simply say, &#34;Our expenditure is increasing; we must impose more taxation.&#34; With the exception of the Postal Department - and I am doubtful whether its revenue will be much in excess of its working expenses before long - none of our services is paying. </para>

                        <para>- We shall have to look postal matters straight in the face before long. The Postal Department services are a convenience to the public, and the public should pay for them. It must not be regarded as a sort of charitable institution. So far as the Postal Department is concerned, I think the most straightforward course to pursue would be to vote &#163;50,000 or &#163;80,000 to give increased facilities to the pioneers in the back country, and to require other sections of the community to pay for the services which it renders. The postal rates should be in accordance with that principle, and we should not be called upon as a community to make good any deficiency in that direction. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know whether I raise the .ire of the honorable member, but I should be glad if he would allow me to proceed. I have no intention of either curtailing or extending my remarks because of anything that has happened, or may happen. I have a duty to perform to my constituents and myself, and I intend to discharge it. The honorable member for Hindmarsh drew attention to the fact that it is proposed to borrow for postal purposes. It is well known to every honorable member, particularly those who have been here for any length of time, that the Post Office is not paying, and has not for some years paid for itself, and that we are paying into trust funds for the purpose of erecting buildings and giving greater facilities in the country - a policy to which I take no exception. Some three or four months ago, the Postmaster-General, speaking at Toorak, or some other of the southern suburbs, stated that it was intended to appoint commissioners to manage the Post Office; but to-day we have a proposal to borrow for the purpose of the purchase of land for post and telegraph purposes, and for the construction of conduits and putting wires underground. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Indi has several times asked during the course of the debate whether the Labour party are in favour of borrowing for the construction of railways. As I have said, the Loan Bill of 1911 plainly set forth the objects that were in view. There was &#163;1,000,000 for the construction of a railway from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta; &#163;600,000 for the acquisition of land in the Federal Capital Territory; &#163;600,000 for the purchase of land and the erection of buildings in London; &#163;226,000 to redeem Treasury bills issued by the Government of South Australia on account of the Northern Territory; and &#163;34,000 to pay the State of South Australia the amount  expended  from revenue towards the construction of the railway from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think so, but if we had not those London offices we should have to pay rent for the accommodation of the High Commissioner; and the time will come sooner or later when, like Canada, Australia will have no Agents-General for the separate States, but one representative for the whole country. Further, the London offices will be a great advertisement for Australia, and, in view of our export trade with the Mother Country, who is our principal customer, it is necessary to have representatives, who must, of course, be &#93; loused. </para>

I can point with a little pride to the fact that it was during my term of office as Minister of Trade and Customs that, on my suggestion to the first Fisher Government, a special Customs officer was attached to the High  Commissioners&#39;s  staff for the purpose of examining invoices in London. </para>

                        <para>- It is absolutely correct. Although the honorable member was Minister of Trade and Customs for a long time, and we were sending &#163;4,000,000 worth of beef and mutton to the Old Country, no expert was appointed there until I asked the second Fisher Administration to send one; and the honorable member complimented the Labour Government on the action then taken. There is no doubt that the money spent on the High Commissioner&#39;s offices will prove a good investment, seeing that, by this means, the interests of Australia will be watched over; but the Prime Minister was wrong in suggesting that I would borrow for advertising, for I regard the London Offices as something more than an advertisement. In any case, those offices will give Australia a better status than it would have if we were merely renting . premises for our High Commissioner, or if we had our various officers, stationed in -London, scattered all over the city. In the 1911 Loan Bill, as I have said, there was a  loan for the purposes of the Northern Territory; and I arn sure honorable members will admit that it was impossible to allow South Australia to practically bear  a  burden that should be borne by all Australia. That is the reason why the House was practically unanimous in regard to the taking over of the Territory. </para>

                        <para>- That may be another way of putting the objection to the taking over. In any case, we had to take over the indebtedness as well, and we are now responsible for the interest on the whole of the loans. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; that is if we start borrowing now in a record season to do such works as building post-offices, and laying conduits for telephone wires. I agree with the honorable member for Hindmarsh that if the post-offices do not pay when we are having prosperous times in Australia, it is time that the rates were altered so as to bring them nearer the paying point. We all know that telephone and telegraph systems get out of date. I remember that, in 1901-2, we were glad to point to a switchboard in </para>

                <para>Hobart on the common battery system as being the very latest thing in switchboards. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner, in his first Loan Bill, proposed to pay ford some of these works. One or two members of the Labour party supported that proposal, but with those exceptions the Labour party were unanimous in opposing it, and the House turned it down. Now we are reverting to that principle, and borrowing for such works as the construction of conduits for laying telephone wires underground, and for the purchase of the machinery for Cockatoo Island. I admit we are to have a sinking fund at 5 per cent, to repay the money, but from what we have seen of the progress of telephony during the past few years, is there any honorable member who will be bold enough to say that these works will not be out of date long before they are paid for by means of the sinking fund provided? </para>

                        <para>- I have heard it said in connexion with some of the conduits built in the Melbourne suburbs that before they have been finished it has been found that the additional subscribers on the exchanges have rendered it necessary to duplicate the conduits before putting a cable through. I heard this in connexion with the section towards Brighton. In view of- these circumstances, I ask the Ministry to reconsider these items to which I have referred. Some honorable members think we are not justified in borrowing under any consideration, but surely it must be hard to convince oneself that we are justified in borrowing for works that may be out of date in ten years. It is claimed that we are not justified in borrowing for the construction of the Fleet, but while we are paying for the Fleet out of revenue, we are putting other things on the Loan Bill when we should pay for them out of revenue. </para>

When he brought down his proposal to borrow &#163;3,500,000 I do not remember that it was rushed through in two or three sittings. Yesterday he gave us a &#39; second edition of the Budget speech, and he dealt with matters a little bombastically, in his own style. </para>

                        <para>- I say &#34; the constituency I represent.&#34; The Treasurer blamed the Federal Labour party  for borrowing. He said we were opposed to borrowing, yet we borrowed when we were in office. Of course we did, but the thing was perfectly, open. The proposal was brought forward in a Bill precisely the same as this, although the items were different. If items 4, 5, and 6 were cut out of the Bill now before us, I would take no exception to the measure, because we must complete the railway from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta, and if we are to do anything with the Northern Territory we must build a railway from Pine Creek to Katherine River and southward, and we must build a railway in Papua; while, if we are going to keep Cockatoo Island dockyard up to date, we must acquire up-to-date machinery to equip it; also, we must build the London office. I take no exception to those items. I believe that, in addition to building rail-  ways in the Northern Territory, piers will have to be constructed. A lot of the traffic there will be done by river. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member has the advantage of me in having visited the Territory, but whenever I get the opportunity I shall go there, because I think that members should make themselves acquainted with the Territory, it being proposed to spend such an immense amount of money there. The Treasurer yesterday twitted us with being in favour of borrowing only for certain purposes, but he paraded the fact that some of the States which have elected Labour majorities to Parliament have borrowed largely. The Commonwealth Labour party is not responsible for what is done by State Labour parties, and the Treasurer would not hold himself responsible for all the acts of Liberal members in State Parliaments. In the matter of borrowing, we cannot be too careful. Every item should be scrutinized carefully. Members of this Parliament have come in for adverse criticism because our defence scheme puts the burden of military service, not on the men of the community, but on the youths and boys. That is what we are now doing with regard to our works and buildings. It is now proposed by the Government to spend money, and leave it to posterity to pay the bill. A sinking fund of J per cent, will require sixty-two years in which to pay off the debt to which it is applied, and by that time we shall no longer be here to answer for our borrowing. Moreover, when proposals are made for spending borrowed money, they are generally dealt with more lightly than proposals for spending revenue, because to increase the expenditure out of revenue means&#34; increased taxation. What has happened with loan expenditure in the States? I have heard that when one State raised a loan of &#163;10,000,000, and a deputation waited on the Premier to ask for a post-office costing &#163;1,000, it would be quietly intimated that there was&#39; plenty of money, and a couple of thousand would be demanded. The tendency is to spend borrowed money freely. The Government would be well advised to cut out of the Bill proposals which should find no place there. The Prime Minister has stated that there are many unavoidable increases, but he has not told the public that the loan expenditure in 1911- 12 was only 2s. lOAd. per head, and in 1912-13 only 5s. 0&#163;d. per head, while for this year it is 12s.  6 3/4d.  per head. Moreover, the years 1911-12 and 1912-13 were not blessed with record seasons, as this year is likely to be. This year the Government is borrowing at a time of prosperity, and is doing what no private person would do. These proposals would be very carefully scrutinized if honorable members were dealing with their own private affairs. The Prime Minister said that the estimated expenditure for this year is only &#163;2,000,000 more than that for last year. He puts the cost of the Fitzroy Dockyard into the ordinary loan expenditure. It should, however, be regarded as a transferred property, like the barracks and forts. Speaking here a few nights ago, the honorable gentleman said - and his remarks were repeated by the Government Whip- that there was an increase of 33 per cent, in the expenditure each year that th 3 Fisher Government was in power, and that this Government had increased the expenditure &#39;by only 8 per cent. Those statements are not supported by the Budget figures, but I have ascertained that the total expenditure of 1910-11 was &#163;4 5s.  1 3/4d.  per head, defence costing 18s. 9d., and the return to the States amounting to &#163;1 53. In 1911- 12 the expenditure was &#163;4 9s.  11 1/2d.  per head, including &#163;1 2s. 8id. for defence. That is not an increase of 33 per cent. The Fisher Government was  denounced  for extravagance, but it saved &#163;2,600,000, yet the present Government, which was returned on the promise of economy, is proposing to spend all that it can get, including this &#163;2,600,000, and to borrow, in addition, &#163;3,080,000. </para>

                <para class="block">He is not only increasing the expenditure by 33 per cent, each year - that is taking his figures to be right - but by 8 or 9 per cent, in addition. He proposes to spend an amount equal to what we spent in three years, and to increase that expenditure by 8 and 9 per cent., on his own showing. But what are the actual figures? I have given the figures for 1911-12, as compared with the figures for 1910-11. In 1910-11 the total expenditure per head was &#163;4 5s.1¾d., of which &#163;1 5s. went to the States, a fact which must not be forgotten, while 18s. 9d. went to defence. In 1911-12 the total expenditure was &#163;4 9s.11&#189;d. per head, of which defence took &#163;1 2s. 8&#189;d., being an increase of 3s.11&#189;d. for defence, while the Post Office cost 2s. 10&#189;d. extra per head. So that we had an addition of 6s.10d. Although our actual increase in the total expenditure was only 4s.9¾d. per head, the expenditure on the Post Office and defence alone was 6s.10d. Those two Departments accounted for more than the total increase. In 1911-12 the total expenditure from general revenue, not from loan, was &#163;4 9s.11&#189;d. per head, of which &#163;1 2s. 8&#189;d. went for defence. In 1912-13 the expenditure per head had gone up from &#163;4 9s.11&#189;d. to &#163;4 12s. 6&#189;d., of which &#163;1 0s.10&#188;d.went to defence. There was an increase of 2s. 7d. per head in the total expenditure. The maternity allowance cost1s. 9d. per head. The Liberals, when they were on this side, denounced the Fisher Ministry for bringing in that proposal, which has been termed the &#34;bangle&#34; bonus by some of them. They said, when they were on this side, and their organization said, that it was going to ruin many of the persons to whom it would be given. It was denounced by many of our benevolent societies in Melbourne. Deputations waited upon the then Prime Minister, asking him to amend the proposal, so that the maternity grant should not be given to certain women. If honorable members opposite believe now what they said on this side, why do they not alter the Maternity Allowance Act? The increase in the total expenditure be tween 1911-12 and 1912-13 was 2s. 7d. per head. To-day, the maternity grant accounts for1s. 9d. of that sum; and the expenditure on the Post Office has increased by1s. 3d. per head; so that, although the increase in the total expenditure was only 2s. 7d. per head, the general expenditure per head was 5d. more, the Post Office accounting for 1s. 3d., and the maternity grant for 1s. 9d. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that the expenditure on the maternity grant and the Post Office has a right to be counted in the general expenditure, but I have yet to learn that an increase from &#163;4 9s.11&#189;d. to &#163;4 12s. 6&#189;d. per head is an increase of 33 per cent. I candidly admit that an increase of 2s. 7d. on &#163;4 9s.11&#189;d. is not 33 per cent. The increase in the loan expenditure during the same time was only 2s.1d. per head. Taking the increase in the loan expenditure, and the increase in the revenue expenditure, there was not an increase of 33 per cent., as alleged by the Prime Minister. </para>

                        <para>- I should be very pleased to hear the honorable member for Richmond if he is prepared to say that he can show that those figures are wrong. I admit that I am indebted to the honorable member for Wide Bay for the information which he himself would have given to-day had he been allowed. It was taken out for him from the Budget-papers of this year, and the Budget-papers of the previous year, to show the hollowness, the sham, and the hypocrisy of the claims of some honorable members on the other side in professing to believe that their expenditure per head has been increased by only 8 or 9 per cent., while our expenditure is alleged to have been increased by 33 per cent, each year. It did not increase that amount as alleged by the Prime Minister in his statement in the press to-day, and in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of last week, as recorded on page 2501. </para>

                        <para>- I shall tell the honorable member in a few minutes what the extra expenditure is each year. To take the expenditure per head of the population is the fairest way, because, as the honorable member will see on referring to page 52 of the Budget-papers, the population is increasing; and, as our  population  is increasing, our expenditure is bound to increase. Our expenditure would show a larger proportionate increase than the amount per head. That is the way one can juggle with figures. The Prime Minister would not take this year to show how much the expenditure had been per head, but he took the gross totals, and, adopting the expenditure for 1909-10 as the basis, said, &#34; Yes, you increased the expenditure. In 1909-10 the expenditure was only about &#163;7,500,000, while in 1910-11 it had gone up to &#163;16,000,000.&#34; It had, because we started to pay the States about &#163;6,000,000, which our opponents do not take into consideration. We also&#39; took over from the States the payment of old-age pensions, and other services which previously had not been paid for. During the last three years, when the Fisher Government were on the Treasury Bench, as the honorable member for Gwydir knows, we spent &#163;10,000,000 on public works, whereas, in the preceding three years, when we had Liberal and Fusion Governments, only &#163;2,450,000 was spent in that way. We expended more in public works than did our predecessors; but that is note taken into consideration. You can spend as much as you like on public works. The more we spent, apparently, the worse it would have been for us, . because it would have been counted against us. Every time we erected a country telephone line at great cost, extending the telephone system into the back-blocks, the expenditure was counted against the Fisher Government, because, it was said, we spent so many more hundreds of thousands of pounds. In -my opinion, that expenditure has no right to be counted against us, and it should be analyzed, just as I have had the figures taken out for me, showing the amount of ordinary expenditure per head, the amount spent on the Post Office, and the extra amount spent on defence. It is not right to lump the expenditure, and say, &#34;You spent &#163;16,000,000, whereas, before, only &#163;7,500,000 was spent.&#34; The fact is not taken into consideration that to-day we are spending more on public works. During our three years &#163;10,000,000 was spent, as against &#163;2,250,000 in the previous three years. </para>

                <para class="block">Another point which is overlooked in considering the expenditure during the three years of the Fisher Administration is that it was the first Government to pay interest on the transferred properties. What is the position in that regard! While to-day the  properties  are owned by the people of Australia, previously they were owned by exactly the same people in the various States. Many of the buildings were erected on Crown lands. To-day we pay interest on the value of a property, including the value of the land, as it was, I think, at the beginning of 1910, or when the properties were valued. I do not think it is right that we should be debited with that extra cost. It will be remembered, too, that, during the first eight or nine years of the &#34;Federation, we paid to the States not only the 15s. in the &#163;1 to which they were entitled from the Customs revenue, but, in addition, &#163;6,500,000, which should have been taken as a set-off against the transferred properties. It should have been credited to the Commonwealth that we paid the States more than we need have done. There is another point which it is interesting to note in connexion with the figures given by the Prime Minister. According to the expenditure per head from the revenue, the present Government are going to spend less this year. Instead of spending &#163;4 12s. 6d. per head from that source, they intend to spend only &#163;4 7s. 6d. But what do they propose to do ? They intend to take 10s. lOd. per head .out of the accumulated surplus for Fleet construction. If honorable members will turn to the Budget-papers, on page 53 they will see that the Government are taking 10s. lOd. per head, and that, whereas last year we spent &#163;4 14s.  7 1/2d.  per head out of revenue for general expenditure, this year the amount per head will be &#163;4 18s. 4|d. - an increase, because the Government are taking from the accumulated surplus 10s. lOd. per head towards Fleet construction. The loan expenditure this year will be equal to 12s. 6Jd. per head, and not 5s. 0|d.,- as was the case with the last Ministry. For the purpose of his comparison the Prime Minister says, &#34; Let me take the actual expenditure of the Fisher Administration; not their Estimates.&#34; While he is prepared to take hold of the &#163;2,600,000, and spend it, he is not prepared to give the Fisher Administration credit for saving that money, but he says, &#39; &#39; Let me take their Estimates.&#34; Surely it was a prudent administration that was able to show, at the end of the year, a surplus! In his statement the Prime Minister practically denounces the Fisher Ministry for showing that surplus, although he is glad enough to use it. He says, &#39; &#39; Let me compare our Estimates with theirs.&#34; Let me follow the example of every Treasurer of the Commonwealth,&#39; from <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner. I remember how he compared the actual spending of 1901 with the estimated expenditure of 1902. That is the fairest method to adopt - it has been adopted in connexion with all Budgets - and not the new method introduced by the Prime Minister. He says, &#34; Let me compare our Estimates with theirs.&#34;- </para>

                        <para>- This is a new method. Let the honorable gentleman take, as I have taken to-night, the actual expenditure per head. Let him put down the 25s. per head paid to the States, and the amount per head paid for defence. Let him put down the amount per head that is paid in the Postal Department, and the amount per head which is taken out of loan expenditure, and I venture to say that any Budget introduced by the late Prime Minister will compare more than favorably with the Budget and loan proposals which have been submitted by the present Treasurer. I do hope that this Parliament will be very careful in regard to loan expenditure. &#39; There is always a tendency to become extravagant when we have not to provide the money. If the funds with which to pay for the works scheduled in this Bill had to come out of the people&#39;s pockets, greater care would be exercised in the scrutiny of the various items. When the Prime Minister declares that the Estimates presented by the Government are those prepared by their predecessors, he is stating something which is not correct. The  Fisher Government never had any Estimates laid before them. I defy any member of the Ministry to point to a single estimate of revenue prepared by the Customs Department while I was presiding over it. If I drafted no estimate of revenue for the greatest producing Department in the Commonwealth - a Department which contributes three-fifths or more of our total revenue - is it likely that the late Government ever had an opportunity of considering estimates of revenue and expenditure? As a matter of fact, from the time the honorable member for Wide Bay delivered his policy speech in Maryborough at the end of March,, right up till polling day, Ministers were engaged in electioneering. It was obviously . impossible to consider estimates of revenue and expenditure three months before the close of the financial year. I hope that every item in this Bill will be closely scrutinized, because, when we are dealing with loan moneys, there is a tendency to become extravagant, and it is a regrettable fact that the more we borrow the more pronounced will that tendency become. </para>

                        <para>- This Bill is too important to be rushed through with such haste. When the motion for leave to introduce it was under consideration, we pointed out a serious blemish in it, which the Government have since endeavoured to correct. We emphasized the folly of establishing a sinking fund of&#189; per cent, in connexion with works of a perishable character. The amendment introduced by the Government to correct that defect does not go far enough, because I hold that the sinking fund which is intended to cover these perishable assets should be provided by the Departments which control them. For. instance, when we borrow money for the construction of telephone conduits, the sinking fund for that work should be provided by the Postal Department. It is extremely regrettable that there is not a man in this House who can define the financial position of the Commonwealth to-day. I move - </para>

Apparently, Ministers expect us to allow legislation to go through without any fair discussion, and without reasonable comment. So far, only two speeches have been delivered upon the motion for &#34;the second reading of the Bill. Yet the Prime Minister expects us to sanction an innovation in the form of a Loan Bill without any criticism whatever. </para>

                        <para>- I do mind it, and they will mind it before it is all over. I will guarantee that the honorable member does not know what is contained in the Bill. He is one of the men who occupy seats in this House and have not the courage to express their opinions. We pointed out on a previous occasion the folly of throwing down a Bill so ill-adapted as this originally was to meet the objects sought to be achieved. Adopting the suggestion of honorable members, who, unlike the honorable member for Calare, are taking an interest in the legislation of their country, the Government has circulated an amendment which will bring this Bill into something like reasonable form. I compliment the Treasurer on the good sense he has displayed in adopting our suggestion, although the amendment will not wholly give effect to the view which I expressed on a previous occasion. If we intend to establish a sinking fund to liquidate these loans, the money paid into that sinking fund should come, not out of the Consolidated Revenue, but out of the revenue of the Department on whose works the loan money is spent. If loan money is to be expended on conduits for undergrounding telegraph wires or for other postal works, then the sinking fund in respect of the loan should come from the revenue of the Postal Department. Unfortunately, we have not, and never have had, a balance-sheet showing how the money we vote is spent, and with what result. </para>

                        <para>- No. I say that we have never had one, and but for the investigation made by honorable members on this side of the House, we should not have had in the Postal Department any accountant save those who were responsible for the conditions that had existed from the inception of Federation. Owing to the force of our criticism, an accountant was ultimately appointed to prepare a balance-sheet, but, although three years have elapsed, that balance-sheet is not yet forthcoming. The Postmaster-General told us a mouth ago that we should have it iu four weeks&#39; time, and later on lie said that we would have it shortly. Honorable members opposite evidently do not wish to know how we stand financially, and have no interest in the question of whether or not we should have, in respect of the Postal Department, a balance-sheet such as would be demanded from the directors of any business company. In this Parliament, apparently, a national balance-sheet is not required. A Bill is put before us providing for the expenditure of loan moneys, and we are asked to pass it without discussion or amendment. It is imperative that we should closely scrutinize this measure, which will initiate the borrowing system in connexion with the Commonwealth. In this schedule, provision is made for an appropriation of loan money  amounting to &#163;1,000,000- for the construction of the railway from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta. Many grave doubts have been expressed as to the wisdom of building that line, and, judging by the data before us, I believe that it will , prove a white elephant. I do not think that it will pay interest on the money borrowed to construct it. The working of the line will show a deficit year after year and decade after decade. </para>

                        <para>- We know what to expect. It was said that I was a pessimist when I predicted that there would be little settlement in the Northern Terri tory for many years to come, but my prediction is being verified. Facts are proving the correctness of the view which I took when the Northern Territory Agreement Bill was before us. The schedule to this Bill provides for an appropriation of loan moneys for the construction of a railway from  Piue  Creek to the Katherine River and southwards. Why, &#34;and southwards?&#34; We know that this money is not designed to carry the railway beyond the Katherine River, so that the words &#34; and southwards &#34; have merely been inserted iu the schedule as a sort of sop to the representatives of South Australia - to make them believe that this line is to be carried south of the Katherine when there is no such intention, so far as this Loan Bill is concerned. </para>

                        <para>- I am glad to have that admission from the honorable member. The cunning introduction of the words &#34;and southwards,&#34; in the item, is merely designed to capture votes. It is a piece of political clap-trap, which, it is thought, may satisfy certain honorable members who feel that they are expected to see that this line is extended from the north to the south. Fancy borrowing money to construct a -railway of this character! Does any one expect that it will pay interest on the borrowed money expended upon its construction ? I venture to predict that, like the line from Darwin to Pine Creek, it will not pay working expenses. The country cannot be- developed in such a way as to make the railway a paving one. One of the lamentable features of our parliamentary system is that we spend money without first ascertaining whether the work on which the money is to be expended will be revenue-producing. We have not a works committee, or any other responsible body, to investigate proposals to enter upon certain undertakings involving heavy expenditures. No matter requires more careful scrutiny than does a proposal to expend money on railway construction in the Northern Territory. The Government should have refrained from proposing an expenditure of this kind until it had information as to the possibilities of the&#39; railway being made a payable one. We are asked to vote &#163;400,000 for this one work. What have we to show in the Northern Territory for the money we have already expended  there, and what are we going to get? How many people are rushing the farm lands thrown open there, and how many of those who go to the Northern Territory will remain there ? I have, from the beginning, held the opinion that the Northern Territory is little better than a snare. Attempts are being made to coax people into the belief that they can live there in comparative comfort, whereas the conditions prevailing in the worst parts of Australia are superior to those which offer in the Territory. If people will not go there, why build a railway? We are told that we must push on with railway construction in the Territory in order to encourage settlement, but, in every State of which 1 have any knowledge, settlers have paved the way for railway construction. The authorities have required some evidence that a railway will pay before they have been prepared to construct it. Even trunk lines have only been built section after section as evidence of a reasonable return has been forthcoming. The present Government, however, before they know whether the Territory can be settled by white people, or whether the land is of such a quality as to offer an incentive to settlement, propose to spend &#163;400,000 on this railway. No honorable member, having seen the country for himself, and having any knowledge of its climate and the handicaps to be overcome, would think of taking his wife and children to reside in the Territory permanently. Railways will not alter the climate of the country. </para>

                        <para>- No; but I ask whether any private individual or company would enter upon an expenditure of &#163;400,000, as the commencement of an expenditure of millions, with the information and guidance that the Government has to-day? This item, in my opinion, ought to be left out of the Loan Bill; but the Government insist upon it, without regard to the criticism of honorable members. Then it is proposed to borrow &#163;60,000 for the construction of a railway from Port Moresby to Astrolabe, and for the construction of wharfs at Port Moresby and Samarai, Papua. Whose guidance have the Government sought in regard to this proposed expenditure ? Who has been to Papua in order to satisfy the Government that they ought to undertake this expenditure, the end of which we cannot see. This work ought not to be started until some responsible person or Persons have, under the authority of Parliament, made a report; and it is not fair to ask honorable members to vote such sums with their eyes shut. To me, it seems madness on the part of the Government to rush into enterprises of the kind without sufficient reliable data. I observe that for the first time it is proposed to borrow money to the extent of &#163;170,000 for the purchase of land for post and telegraph purposes. I have read somewhere that the late Government decided to borrow money for the purchase of land for a post-office at Perth; but, if that be so, it is the only case of the kind. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot say that I have any strong objection to borrowing for such a purpose, because land, generally speaking, is an asset that does not depreciate, and may prove of value; and 1 think that the sinking fund of A per cent, will prove sufficient in the ca&#34;se of land for post and telegraph purposes, or for the purchase of land for defence purposes. The next item, however, is one that I do not think any one could justify . It is proposed to borrow &#163;425,000 for the construction of conduits and for laying wires underground. These are works that hitherto have never been carried out with borrowed money ; and the proposal is one upon which every member is entitled to express an opinion. The proposal to set aside 5 per cent, in order to redeem the loans on those perishable works is not quite &#39;satisfactory ; because, in my opinion, this repayment ought to come, not out of the Consolidated Revenue, but out of the revenue of the Department on whose behalf the borrowing has taken place. This would enable accounts to be kept, and a proper balance-sheet prepared, showing the liability of the several Departments concerned. Had we let this Bill go through, it would have proved a dangerous pitfall for both the Departments and Parliament; and because we discuss it, and point out anomalies and imperfections, the . Government have practically to ask for a new message in order to meet the circumstances, thus showing that they really did not understand what they required. The Government have not introduced much  legislation this session, but what little they have introduced, has been of a very immature character; and even in the case of a small measure like this they have not shown that capacity which the country has a right to expect. They may confuse the finances of the country, and delude the people by their mysterious undertakings, but they will be perfectly satisfied if we will let them pass only this one Bill. The Bill, however, is one of the most important, from a financial standpoint, ever submitted to the House; and yet the Government think we on this side are so forgetful of the trust reposed in us by the people as to neglect to do our duty in the way of criticism. The Government either&#39; under-estimates the patriotism of members on this side, or they are reckless in regard to the character of the legislation they propose. It is monstrous on the part of the Government to compel us to discuss an intricate measure of this kind at an hour of the night when we are weary, and our minds are not at their clearest; aud I ask leave to continue my speech on a future occasion. </para>

The innuendoes thrown out, and the calculations in regard to the borrowing negotiated by the previous Government, provide matter justifying discussion at considerable length. We should have the Treasurer&#39;s speech before us in print, so that in dealing with this measure we might be able to reply to it. We were courteous enough to allow the right honorable gentleman to read that speech, but God knows who wrote it! I should like to know who did write it. The Prime Minister is not dealing .fairly with honorable members in trying to force this Bill through in this way. </para>

                        <para>- Because the honorable gentleman is trying to bludgeon legislation through this Parliament without giving honorable members a reasonable opportunity for criticism. &#171; The fact that practically a new Loan Bill has had to be introduced is due to the slip-shod manner in which the honorable gentleman and his colleagues prepare legislation for this House. All they appear to know is that their policy is to borrow. It does not matter to them how the money is to be used, or the loan to be redeemed, so long as they succeed in borrowing money, .and can hand over the burden, which should be borne by the taxpayers of to-day, to those who are to come after them. I understand that some honorable members have copies of the speech delivered by the Treasurer, and I shall let some other honorable member take up the running in order that I may have the points of that speech typed, so that the Opposition may be able to discuss this measure in a manner which will reflect credit upon them, and be becoming a legislative assembly. </para>

                        <para>- Then I wish to say that 1 object to some of the expenditure to be provided for under this Bill, for various reasons, one of which is that I do not believe that the money will be spent in the best interests of the country, because the purchase of sleepers for the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway is to be carried out on the report of a Committee the members of which have already expressed an opinion in the strongest and most biased manner concerning a certain process used in connexion with the  sleepers  Strong exception was taken only a little time ago to the appointment of a Committee by the Senate, on the ground that a member of the Committee had  already  prejudged the case it was appointed to inquire into. We have had the strongest expressions of opinion on powellised sleepers by men who have been appointed to determine a matter after hearing evidence on the subject. If we are going to spend &#163;1,400,000 on the construction of the line from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta, it will be admitted that a considerable portion of that expenditure will be required for the purchase of sleepers. If the responsible engineers are not to be accepted as fair judges of the kind of sleepers which should be purchased, I should like to know how men influenced by a bias that has already been expressed on the floor of this House can judge evidence on the subject submitted to them independently? </para>

                    - The honorable member for Franklin this afternoon urged that not one penny should be spent on sleepers for any of the railways to be provided for out of the money to be borrowed under this Bill until certain inquiries were made. I have no objection to that, but the inquiries should be made by people who are not interested, and who have not already expressed a biased judgment on the matter.

                    <para>. - A considerable amount of party feeling was displayed by the Treasurer in introducing this Loan Bill, and he endeavoured to make as much capital as he could out of it. I admit that his speech was, in many points, lucid and clear, but in other respects there seemed to be a great desire on his part to make things as obscure as possible. I join with other honorable members in saying that if there is anything on winch the electors should be intelligently informed it is finance. It is absolutely essential that, if we are to win the confidence of the people, and bring them into full appreciation of the various schemes submitted to us from time to time, we should place in the clearest and most distinct fashion all the information before those who have to provide the money. The present Government came into power unexpectedly. It was one of the biggest political surprises Australia&#39; has ever known. They claim they come here at the behest of the majority of the people - which, of course, many of us question - and the majority of them have adopted a very antagonistic attitude towards many measures passed during the last Parliament. The present &#34;Treasurer claims that he left something on the stocks in relation to banking, and in regard to the Note Issue, which the late Treasurer says he found no trace of. Now, because he did not have the pleasure of introducing those measures, he is, apparently, a little jealous that some other Treasurer, following him, should have done so. He is antagonistic to the Note Issue and the Commonwealth Bank, but there are no two assets that are more valuable in connexion with the flotation of loans than are the Note Issue and the Commonwealth Bank properly made use of. I believe that, in the future, we shall have in the . Commonwealth Bank a splendid aid, .:specially when Parliament, or somebody authorized by Parliament, will have control and management of loans, not only Commonwealth, but State. In these circumstances the bank would be an institution, not only here, but on the other side of the world, that would be a very valuable agency in connexion with the management of loans, not only the flotation of new loans, but also the redemption of old loans. </para>

                        <para>- It is a pity honorable members on the Ministerial benches have not faith, not only in Australia, but in the Commonwealth Bank. Even ici its infancy it is having considerable influence on the financial world. Recently a loan of &#163;300,000 to the Metropolitan Board of Works was underwritten by the Commonwealth Bank, and that has had a considerable influence on the money-lending institutions in Australia in the direction of bringing down the price of money, and making those people who, a few months earlier, were not inclined to subscribe &#163;300,000 for the Metropolitan Board of Works, except at a rather high rate of interest, and under conditions not acceptable to the Board, tumble over one another in order that the institution might have the use of money at an exceptionally cheap rate to the amount of &#163;50,000. It was a salutary lesson to other banks. When a bank can do that it must have a considerable influence on other institutions; and well supported as it should be by the Treasurer and other people as well, it should become a very valuable influence in the financial world, at any rate, of Australia. Lord George Hamilton,  chairman  of directors of the Bank of Australasia, speaking in London at a meeting of shareholders, said that the Commonwealth Bank would certainly be a serious competitor with the private banks, and would, no doubt, indulge in underwriting loans, and that, properly managed, it would become in Australia as fine an institution as the Bank of England in the United Kingdom. When a financial magnate, holding such a responsible position, makes a declaration like this in Loudon, the centre of the United Kingdom, which has loaned 3,000 millions sterling to  various countries, it is about time we paid some heed to favorable criticism of this kind, and paid a due meed to the Commonwealth Bank; also it ill-becomes pigmies in finance to say anything derogatory of the bank. It is remarkable that there is now about &#163;3,500,000 on deposit in the Savings Bank branch of the bank, though the Governor of the bank is only giving 3 per cent, interest to the depositors, while the State Savings Banks are giving up to 3&#163; per cent. The State Governments, for Credit Foncier purposes and for land advances, have taken considerable sums from State Savings </para>

                <para class="block">Banks, and had <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Denison</inline> Miller not commenced operations in an exceptionally conservative manner, the chances are that there would have been considerable chaos in those Savings Banks. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Murray,</inline> when he was Premier of Victoria, said that it was the working people who put the money into the State Savings Bank. The working people are just as keen at getting a fair rate of interest on their money as others, and if the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank had offered to pay depositors 3&#163; per cent., in a very short space of time between &#163;5,000,000 and &#163;6,000,000 would have been drawn from the Victorian Savings Bank alone, and placed in the Commonwealth Bank. The <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> cannot be said to have ever favoured the Commonwealth Bank, but before the elections - whether it met with the complete approval of the Prime Minister I do not know - it said that the State debts should be consolidated, and that the management of these debts, the redemption of them, and the flotation of new loans, should be done through the Commonwealth Bank in London. It was even made one of the planks of the Liberal party&#39;s platform put before the electors of Victoria. When we find a Conservative journal that advocates the return of Conservatives to Parliament, admitting that the bank would have a good influence in regard to loans in London, we must accept what it says in the spirit in which the advice was tendered. </para>
                <para>The Treasurer made use of quite a number of figures. He was quite correct in saying that if the Bill passed, the Government would have the opportunity of making use of &#163;3,080,000 of loan money. If we add that to the sum borrowed by the previous Government from the Trust Funds, namely &#163;2,990,000, it amounts to &#163;6,070,000. But the Treasurer did not stop there. He went on to deal with various items for which the Commonwealth Parliament is responsible, and he totted up great big items, as the honorable member for Hindmarsh says, as if they were part and parcel of a well-known Australian debt. Every one knows that when we took over the Northern Territory, we did take over a big financial responsibility in respect to loans floated by the South Australian Government, for the purpose of the development of the Territory. </para>
                <para class="block">In connexion with the Northern Territory and the Oodnadatta railway, we have incurred a loan responsibility amounting to &#163;5,295,948. The Treasurer said that another &#163;10,547,755 must be added to the loan account in connexion with the transferred properties and the Cockatoo Island Dockyard. The right honorable gentleman thus makes the Commonwealth debt &#163;21,913,076. I take exception to the way in which the figures have been placed before the public. I do not say that we are not responsible for this sum, but I would point out that we have assets to set against it reaching to nearly one-half the amount. I do not take a pessimistic view of the Northern Territory, though I do not belittle the difficulties that must be faced in its development. We rightly took this burden off the State of South Australia, which, with its limited resources, was unequal to the work of development. But we have in the Territory nearly half a million square miles, some of which may not be very good, though I do not know that we should speak of any of the land in Australia as worthless. Some people ask what has made profitable the Mallee in Victoria, and similar country in South Australia, and say that it is the extension of railways and the providing of water supplies; but I believe that what has helped more than anything else is the discovery of phosphate manures, which supply deficiencies of the soil, and make what we were taught at school was desert land to blossom as the rose. With railway communication and proper administration the Northern Territory will be a valuable asset. We shall have to wait for a number of years to obtain an appreciable return for our expenditure there, but in years to come the generations that are following us will be thankful that the Territory was taken over by the Commonwealth. </para>
                <para>As to the liability in respect to the transferred properties, the honorable member for Hindmarsh has shown what an asset we have in the Melbourne General Post Office. What more desirable property than that could there be, situated as it is at the corner of two main streets, and worth thousands of pounds? In every capital in the Commonwealth we possess a similar property. The Commonwealth has also valuable post-offices in the large provincial towns. Indeed, in nearly every town in Australia there is a fine building occupying a central position and of great value. It is  a  credit to the State Governments that such good sites were  re-  served for postal purposes. Our post-offices are not only useful for the transaction of postal business; they are becoming the banks of the people. I hope that the State Treasurers will come to their senses, and make an arrangement with the Commonwealth Treasurer, so that there will be no more antagonism between the State Savings Banks and the Commonwealth Savings Bank. If they do that we shall have one strong Savings Bank. I believe that on a very conservative estimate the postal buildings and sites owned by the Commonwealth are worth nearly &#163;10,000,000. Therefore, in the Northern Territory and in the transferred properties we have very good assets to set against our indebtedness. - The right honorable member for Swan is the first Treasurer who has spoken of the transferred properties as a loan liability. Certainly we have good value for the money on which  we  pay interest. The valuer who made  a  valuation of the transferred properties did his work well. If anything, he made  an  under-valuation, and our bargain with the States was a good one. </para>
                <para>Speaking of the transfer of the Cockatoo Island Dockyard, the ex-Prime Minister in the policy speech that he delivered at Maryborough on the 31st March, spoke of the amount of shipbuilding and dockyard work associated with the Customs Department in connexion with lighthouses, quarantine, and navigation, and with the Department of External Affairs in connexion with the Northern Territory. The Cockatoo Island Dockyard was taken over&#39; not merely to repair warships, but also to repair the vessels that will be needed&#39; for the work of the Quarantine and Lighthouse Departments. At the present time the Cockatoo Island Dock is the only place where the <inline font-style="italic">Australia</inline> can be docked, which makes it all the worse that this Government should have practically stopped the work at the Cockburn Sound Naval Base. Were the <inline font-style="italic">Australia</inline> cruising on &#34;the western coast of the continent, and were anything to go wrong with her, she would have to be towed right round to Sydney for repairs. I admit that at the present time warships are being built at Cockatoo Island, but the dock is needed also for  repairs  to the large fleet of other vessels  that will be required for the carrying on of various Commonwealth services. These vessels must either be docked and repaired in our own yards or sent to private dockyards, and I think we have learned the advantage of having our own yards and our own staffs and material. Since the ex-Prime Minister spoke, the Commonwealth has made arrangements for taking over Norfolk Island. That will necessitate the establishment of regular communication, as will also the development of Papua and the Northern Territory. &#39; I think that the Cockatoo Island Dock is needed, and will be used to the fullest advantage. I do not wish to discuss the floating of loans and the borrowing of money, without referring to the existing public debt of Australia. I believe that the day is not far distant when there will be only one borrower in Australia. The Commonwealth should take over the debts of the States only on p condition that all future borrowing should be done through it. Unless that is agreed to, what will be gained by taking over the State debts? Money can be saved only by having one borrowing authority and one stock, which, when created, will be one of the best negotiable securities in any market. The public debt of Australia is now &#163;294,000,000, or about &#163;61 7s. per head of population, the annual interest bill being &#163;12,000,000, or &#163;2 10s. per head of population. It means that each family of five persons lias to contribute to the interest burden &#163;12 10s. per year, or 5s. per week. I think that when we are dealing with figures in relation to interest and expenditure we should deal more with breadwinners - at any rate with adults, because it is only in that way that we can arrive at a more accurate conclusion. If we add what has been outlined by the Treasurer, the cost for defence is &#163;1 3s. 6d. per head of the population. For a family of five persons that means a contribution of &#163;5 17s. 6d. per year, or 2s. 5d. per week. Therefore each family of five persons in the Commonwealth has to pay 5s. per week to make up the interest bill on our loans, and 2s. 5d. per week on defence, or, in all,. 7s. 5d., in these times of high cost of living. That is a very serious consideration to poor families. In his <inline font-style="italic">Seven Colonies,</inline> for 1901-2, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coghlan,</inline> formerly the Statistician for New South Wales, and now its Agent-General, has some very pertinent para- graphs in respect to- Australia as a borrower and interest payer - </para>

                        <para>- I do not say that. I am not here to defend any party who indulge in what I may term extravagant borrowing, who do not treat the public finances in the same way as they would treat their private affairs. I have no time for a man, no matter what party he belongs to, if he will not pay due regard to our financial liabilities as they exist, and the incurring of fresh liabilities. Sometimes it is not the amount of money borrowed, but how it is to be spent, which should be the chief consideration. In Australia, we have only scratched the surface. ^1 do not belong to a non-borrowing party at all. A plank in our platform for years lias been restriction of public borrowing. Goodness only knows, it was absolutely essential to introduce such a plank into the platform of some party in Australia to stop some of the extravagance which was going on. No doubt the honorable member for Wannon and the honorable member for Echuca have read up the history of their State. Surely they must know that to-day we are carrying a heavy burden not bequeathed to us by a Labour party, but by a party constituted somewhat the same as the party on the other side, and including the greatest enemies that Victoria ever had. The honorable member for Echuca remembers that the coalition Governments iu this State - and in most States too - have been the most ruinous Governments that we have ever had. </para>

                        <para>- During the late campaign the Prime Minister did not help the representatives of the State Governments when they went home to borrow money by trying to make out to the people of Australia that the finances of the Commonwealth  were in a disgraceful condition. I am not at all surprised that, for that reason . and others, those gentlemen did not get exactly what they went to secure. What has been our policy in regard to borrowing? No effort has been made by the States to reduce the public indebtedness except in the case of Western Australia. I think it was the honorable member for Swan who instituted there a sinking -fund in connexion with loans, and to-day the statistics show Western Australia has made the best effort of all the States to establish a fund of that kind, and that to-day it has a fund of something about half the total of &#163;5,000,000. </para>

For what purpose did he try to raise &#163;4,000,000? For redemption purposes. He went to London to borrow &#163;4,000,000 from Brown to pay off &#163;4,000,000 which he owed to Jones. To change the creditors of Victoria cost &#163;40,000 or &#163;50,000, but its people will have to bear the burden. </para>

                    <para>No combined action is taken to regulate the raising of loans, each- State acting according to the exigencies of its Government, regardless of the financial condition of its neighbours. The placing of a loan on the London market, especially if it be for a large amount, generally results in an all-round fall in the prices of Australian stocks, and subsequent issues of other States are placed at a disadvantage if the market is approached before it has recovered its tone,- in fact the States have, in this respect, all the evil of disintegration and all the liabilities of Federation, without any of the advantages which Federation would give. The evil effects of this lack of consultation between Australian Treasurers will be seen. </para>

                <para class="block">Those remarks, I think, are very pertinent indeed. .In introducing this Bill yesterday, the Treasurer intimated that certain loans made by the previous Government would mature, and that would allow him to have money to handle either in expenditure on public works or for reiuvestment. He said that he would require &#163;5,768,850, but with the loans that would mature prior to the close of this financial year he would only receive - that is, I understand, with the added cash surplus that he found in the Treasury - a sum of &#163;3,945,450. He says, in effect, &#34;That is all the money I shall be able to obtain from the loans effected from the -trust account, and that will leave me a deficiency of &#163;1,823,400 to find.&#34; I should like to know where he is going to get that money. He gave a hint in his Budget statement, and an intimation in his speech on this Bill, that he does not intend to go outside the trust account. I hope that that is so. </para>

I would like more definite information on this matter. I do not care to think that the Government will, for the first time in the history of the Commonwealth, go upon the London market. If they do so, what kind of a reception will they get? Figuratively speaking, it appears to me that- when the representatives of four State Governments went to England recently, for the purpose of floating loans there, the financiers of the Old Country put them across their knees and gave them a sound spanking.  They practically told them to go* home and arrive at some reasonable arrangement between themselves. I dare say that those same financiers, if they were to speak their minds, would declare that it would be far better for Australia to have only one borrower. The honorable member for Riverina has asked where we are to get this money? Yet the Treasurer himself is going to introduce a measure which has for its object the locking up of still more money. Under the Commonwealth Notes Act we are bound to keep a gold reserve of 25 per cent. The Note Issue is absolutely under the control of the Treasury Department, and not under the control of the Commonwealth Bank </para>

In round numbers, there are about &#163;10,000,000 worth of notes out from the Treasury today. Sovereigns have been paid for these notes, and if we kept a gold reserve of only 25 per cent, we should thus have about &#163;7,500,000 available for investment. That sum, if properly handled, could be made to return a considerable revenue. </para>

                        <para>- I am aware of that. It has never been less than 33 per cent., and, at the present time, I believe it is about 40 per cent. I ask the honorable member whether people would turn down a Commonwealth note simply because it had a gold backing of only 25 per cent. ? I say that they would not. The whole of the taxable resources of the Commonwealth stand behind it. Even the greatest opponent of the Note Issue would never dream of saying that there is any danger in that issue. Why, then, should we lock up in the Treasury vault about 1,500,000 more sovereigns than there is any necessity to lock up? Yet, if the Treasurer carries out his intention, he will reduce the available money by at least &#163;500,000. Why? </para>

                        <para>- Can the Argentine be compared with Australia at any time ? Better financiers than the honorable member and myself are investing considerable money in the Argentine, and are getting good interest on it. The Argentine today is very different from the Argentine of thirty years ago. I well recollect the occasion in the State Parliament, when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Robert</inline> Harper, in discussing the banking crisis, said that what was wanted in this country was a central bank backed by the State, adding, &#34; It is ..not cash that we require, but confidence. If we have confidence in the country, we can do better than we can do even with the cash.&#34; I question whether, about twenty or twenty-five years ago, there was a keener intellect than his in Victoria, and I doubt whether there was an individual who understood banking institutions generally better than he did. Yet that was his opinion. What he suggested we should do twenty years ago is almost identically what we did in the last Parliament. When <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Dibbs issued the proclamation in New South Wales that the Government were behind the banks he stopped the rush upon them. It is a pity that we did not have a man of his stamp here. </para>

                        <para>- I think it is about time that this foolish claptrap about the backing of our Commonwealth notes was stopped. I am just as much interested in the solvency of this country, and in its good government, as is any honorable member. Being a family man, and having a love for my country, I am very much interested in all its institutions. Members of &#39; the Labour party are not wreckers. A man would be an absolute fool to take a stand of that kind, because in the common ruin he would be overwhelmed. I believe that a 25 per cent, gold reserve is quite sufficient to hold against our note issue. </para>

                        <para>- The greater number of the loans floated of recent years have been simply for redemption purposes. We have paid &#163;300,000,000 by way of interest on borrowed money, and still owe the principal; but we have some valuable assets to set against our borrowings. We pay by way of interest every year in respect of the national debt &#163;12,000,000, and at this rate, within twenty-six years, we shall have paid in respect of interest alone no less than &#163;312,000,000. </para>

                <para>The public debt of Great Britain at the present time is &#163;716,000,000, a reduction of &#163;82,000,000 having been made during the last ten years. Whereas our public debt cost us &#163;12,000,000 per annum by way of interest, Great Britain&#39;s national debt of &#163;716,000,000 costs the British taxpayers only &#163;24,500,000 per annum, since the Old Country obtains her money at 2&#189; per cent. The assets placed against the national debt of Great Britain represent &#163;59,000,000 - one of the principal items being the Suez Canal shares, purchased by Disraeli, and which are now valued at &#163;44,000,000. Then there is the Exchequer balance of &#163;11,568,591, and other assets representing &#163;3,289,000. The Suez Canal shares earn &#163;1,289,000 per annum. </para>

                    <para>-  I desire to raise a question of privilege affecting the conduct of business in this Chamber. The matter to which I wish to refer vitally affects members on this side particularly. It is just possible that something further may he heard of it, and that it may result in legal proceedings. That is a matter which could be better dealt with by the Attorney-General, but it seems to me that it may lead to endless litigation in connexion with some of the Bills we are now passing. Members of this side were at one stage of the proceedings deprived of a certain privilege, which, I think, is always considered a right which honorable members possess. I refer particularly to the matter of appointing tellers. The position is that a number of divisions have been taken- </para>

The honorable member for Kennedy did not state any breach of privilege which occurred in connexion with the appointment of tellers when I appointed them. I appointed the tellers, and the division has taken place. If there was anything of which the honorable member complains about the appointment of the tellers, he should have raised a question of privilege when they were appointed. </para>

I point out that a question affecting the privileges of honorable members might have arisen yesterday or the day before, and might only have come to our- knowledge at the present time. I contend that such a question may be raised at any time. If that is not so, I shall take your ruling; but, personally, I think that such a question can be raised at any time. </para>

                    <para>- As I have already pointed out, generally speaking, when a question of privilege arises it can be dealt with in the ordinary way before the business of the House is called on, but when a question of privilege arises during the transaction of business by the House, and becomes, a matter of urgency, it is provided for under standing order 283. There is here no question of urgency, as provided for under .standing order 111, or of an emergency suddenly arising, which is provided for under section 283. I therefore cannot accept a motion of privilege at the present time. </para>

                    <para>- If honorable members had assisted the  Speaker,  and conducted the proceedings in an orderly manner, this position would not have arisen. My remarks apply to both sides of the House. It is often impossible for the  Speaker  to make himself heard or to conduct the business of the House. What has happened is an object lesson, and is the result of the disregard of practice and a decorous mode of procedure. The question now is, &#34; That the House do now adjourn.&#34; I interrupted that in order to admit of the formal third reading of the Bill. The third reading has now been carried. </para>

The confusion, so far as I was concerned, was created by two Ministers rising, practically at the same time, one moving &#34; That the question be now put,&#34; and the other moving the adjournment of the House. You accepted the latter motion, proposed by the Prime Minister, when the  Clerk  was in communication with you. The House was quite quiet at that time, but immediately the  Clerk  began to read, I protested, and said that the third reading had not been put. </para>

                        <para>- I have several times called honorable members to order. The proceedings are now of a most unseemly character, which I extremely regret. I have several times had to appeal to honorable members to observe something like decorum in the Chamber. These interchanges are distinctly disorderly, and I hope that they will not be continued. Honorable members should remember that this is a Legislative Chamber, and I hope that they will not make the situation more difficult. The position we have reached is that there is a motion before the Chair for the adjournment of the House, and the further motion has been moved that the question be now put. I now put the question, &#34; That the question be now put.&#34; </para>
