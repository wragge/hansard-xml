                        <para>The statement in regard to the supply of about 60,000 jar rah sleepers, and the powellized karri sleepers not being due until November, is correct. A draft agreement was prepared by the Federal Crown Solicitor and forwarded to the State Government for approval and signature, but that Government, desiring a different wording, prepared, signed, and forwarded an amended draft agreement. The Commonwealth could not agree to the amended draft, and after some telegraphic communication the State Government intimated that it was willing to agree to the Commonwealth wording. It was anticipated that a fresh draft would be prepared and signed in Western Australia, as asked in the Engineer-in-Chief&#39;s telegram, but some misapprehension seems to have arisen as to whether the State or Commonwealth should have the fresh document prepared for signature. </para>

I wish to say that at least as much courtesy will be shown to the Parliament of New South Wales as the Government of that State showed to this Parliament in connexion with the recent banquet which they held. To that banquet, I believe, only the Prime Minister was invited. </para>

                    <para>- I desire to  make a personal explanation. While the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs was speaking yesterday, he said that I was a justice of the peace for South Australia. I want to say that I am not. The lateRight Honorable Charles Cameron Kingston made me a justice of the peace, but I refused to pay the 10s. to take out the commission, because I recognised that I was a partisan, and, therefore, in the capacity of a justice, could not act fairly to my opponents. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member asked me a question on this subject a few days ago, and my predecessor, the honorable member for Kennedy, explained pretty fully what steps&#39; had been taken to improve the ventilation of the chamber. I do not know that it is necessary for me to elaborate that statement more than to say that large sums have been expended in the effort to improve the ventilation, and certainly the ventilation has been improved by comparison with what honorable members in previous Parliaments have experienced here. I have asked our own engineer to inquire into a scheme which is proposed by a recentlyestablished firm here for ozonizing the atmosphere of the chamber. Whether that will be effective or not, I do not know, but I propose to take advantage of the opportunity afforded by the presence of the British Parliamentary visitors to inquire as to their experience of the experiment of the House of Commons under the same system; and, later on, I shall be able to give the honorable member and the House the benefit of the information obtained. </para>

Again, I would ask, what is wrong with Canberra as the head-quarters of this body? </para>

                        <para>There is no evidence of the existence of artesian water in the Territory north of Charlotte Waters; but the Government entered into a contract for the sinking of a trial artesian bore at Anthony&#39;s Lagoon, on the Barklay Tablelands. The contractors failed to carry out the work, and the agreement was then cancelled. Further inquiries were made with a view of putting down both artesian and sub-artesian bores on the tablelands, and on the overland telegraph line between Powell&#39;s Creek and Bitter Springs, but the prices quoted by the boring company were considered too high. It is intended, when money asked for on the Estimates is available, to engage a foreman and a boring party to commence operations to procure subartesian water, and provide troughs, &#38;c, between the Queensland border and the overland telegraph line. </para>

                        <para>- I am not at all anxious that a motion of the kind should be brought on now; but, with all due deference to you, sir, I doubt whether the two motions really deal with the same subject. The motion of the honorable member for East Sydney has reference to the act of a body altogether apart from the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- This, of course, is quite a non-party question. If the placing of a general motion on the notice-paper in reference to a big subject like this can prevent the discussion of, perhaps, a proposal of much greater importance than the original motion, the functions of Parliament could be abrogated by merely filling up the paper. I think, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> that, strictly, your ruling is too narrow, and might be disastrous in its effect. </para>

                        <para>- But those other motions could, I presume, be postponed. In any case, it is a well-known rule in Parliament that when there is a notice of motion on the paper, the subject of that motion cannot be made the subject of another one. In the present case it is, after all, only a minor branch of the subject that is touched by the motion of the honorable member for East Sydney, and I think the matter might well wait until to-morrow. We shall facilitate its discussion tomorrow in every way we can. </para>

I have been looking carefully through the motion and also through the notice of motion given by the honorable member for Gwydir, with the result that it seems to me that the subjects are practically identical, so that the same range of discussion will cover both. That being so, I have no option, under the Standing Orders, but to rule that the discussion of this motion at the present time would be out of order. Standing order 117 provides that - </para>

                        <para>.- I agree with the statement made yesterday by the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs that no more important matter could be dealt with by this House than that of the franchise, and especially the franchise of a country which is ruled on a democratic basis, and controlled by responsible government. The speech delivered by the honorable gentleman was, however, singularly free from evidence of any abuse of the rights and privileges of the electors during the last general election. Both before and after that election, every Liberal organization, and many Liberal supporters, echoed and re-echoed throughout Australia the cry - and, indeed, the statement was made where it could be heard overseas - that the conduct of the election was immoral and wicked. The suggestion was made that a large number of the electors of Australia were so immoral and so corrupt that they had voted more than once. The Assistant Minister of Home Affairs, in moving the second reading of this Bill yesterday, however, had not a tittle of evidence, nor did he make even a suggestion, that there was any ground for such an assertion. He was content to say that Ministers were going to extend the franchise. But honorable members will search in vain through this Bill for any indication of an extension. They will find alterations of the law, and proposals to embarrass the electors in every way, but little else. The Minister actually had the audacity to say that the Government had not changed their attitude since they first made allegations regarding the conduct of the elections. He said that the Opposition had not made any complaint until after the investigations had taken place. The honorable gentleman is entirely wrong. I cannot believe that he wilfully desired to mislead  the  public. . But, as a matter of fact, immediately after Parliament met, on the very first day, when the allegations were still ringing in our ears, and members of the Government were supporting them, I said in my place, speaking for the Opposition, that I believed there was not a tittle of evidence in support of those allegations, and that, as far as I was concerned, I believed that the people of Australia were the most honest and upright people in the world in the matter of electoral conduct. That observation can be found recorded in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and ought to be known to the Minister. It was thought that the Attorney-General wanted an investigation, and I immediately accepted the opportunity. We also had a desire for an investigation. Some of my friends thought that the Government had exceeded their public duty in announcing that an investigation would be made before they had met Parliament, after being constituted as a Government. But many of us felt - I, at any rate, felt strongly, as a result of a long public life in Australia - that there was ample reason for trusting in the sound common sense and honesty of our people. I therefore considered that these allegations demanded the most serious investigation, and that the completest evidence should be brought forth. What is the position now ? There is not a single suggestion that anything was wrong at the elections. According to public statements made, there were thousands of duplications in one electorate. It was alleged that at Ballarat the cemetery gates had opened, and the dead had voted, and voted more than once. We hear nothing of that kind now. The investigations that have taken place, both publicly and privately, have demonstrated that there was less duplication in Ballarat than anywhere else. There was only one case amongst 33,000 voters; and I understand that there is reason to believe, according to the reports of those who know most about that individual, that he is not likely to belong to the Opposition party. Even, however, if we take our half-share of that one case, surely the whole people of Australia are not to be condemned because one person in 33,000 in one electorate committed an offence. </para>

                            <para>- I am taking the most extreme view when I say &#34; he may have committed, an offence.&#34; What was the evidence given to the House by the Minister to show the necessity for the protection of the ballot against fraud and criminal intent? He said that there were no fewer than 144,764 Police Court convictions in &#39;Australia in a year. What analogy is there between Police Court convictions and fraudulent voting at an election? I should like to know whether the Attorney-General and those associated with him would put persons convicted at Police Courts for petty offences in the same category as a person who votes more than once at an election ? </para>

                            <para>- The Minister in charge of this Bill brought forward no other evidence to justify the statements made by Ministers, except that there were many criminals in Australia, and many persons who had been convicted at Police Courts. There can be no analogy between the offences committed by those persons and offences under our Electoral Act. If that be the evidence on which the Go-  vernment  wish to alter the whole basis of our electoral law, I can only express my conviction that the people of Australia will not be willing that this Parliament shall do what the Government desire it to do. As regards the question of the amount of duplication which took place, and the number of fraudulent votes that were given, I should like to ask the Minister whether he has any evidence to give us now, while this debate is proceeding, regarding the conduct of the investigations from the time when they were inaugurated until the present time? I have been unable to find an official statement to justify any of the allegations made by the Minister himself. This is a matter upon which there ought to be no holding back of information by the Government. It is a matter that ought to be dealt with in the fairest and most open way. It is not even a party question. </para>

Have they done so? They have had ample time. Is it true that they have employed private detectives in some electorates and have discovered nothing? We know that it is true that they have had a legal investigation under the superintendence of scrutineers, and discovered nothing by that method. Not only did they discover nothing sensational, but they discovered nothing in the nature of evidence against the honesty of the ordinary voter. If there is other evidence, I hope that it will be forthcoming. </para>

                            <para>- We discovered that there was very little . fraud in connexion with the Maternity Allowance; so little that it is the marvel of the time, though undoubtedly some persons are prepared to act criminally in connexion with it to gain a pecuniary advantage. I hope that no Government will propose the abolition of the Maternity Allowance because some persons may act criminally in connexion with it. It must be remembered that the misuse of the right to vote by post really deprives electors of the privilege of exercising that right, and, indeed, puts therm in a much worse position than if they/ had not the right, because it permits them to be victimized unless they vote for certain candidates. On the other hand, the persons entitled to the Maternity Allowance cannot be injured by anything fraudulent that may be done by other persons. </para>

Since he came to Queensland he had seen mere men frightened to vote than ever he saw in the Old Country, when the electors voted openly. He had seen the most contemptible expedients resorted to to influence votes in Queensland. If members . . . wanted to do their duty to Queensland they would strike out the postal vote root and branch. He defied honorable members to show how they could give a postal vote and not open the door to a wholesale interference with the secrecy of the ballot. Tlie great objection to that vote was that when an elector took his ballot-paper to some place away from scrutineers and the returning officer, political agents  . . and employers&#39; agents would be after him to see he voted in the right way^ Whenever they allowed a man to vote outside the ballot box they destroyed the secrecy of ilu- ballot. </para>

                            <para>- I did not say that it was not a postal vote, and I have never said that it is not the duty of Parliament to make it possible for the sick and infirm to register their votes. But it must be done in such a way as to allow them to be perfectly free to vote just as they may desire and not as some other person may wish them to vote. Honorable members will search in vain for any utterance of mine to the contrary. I had always been a strong advocate of the postal vote. I was however compelled, on the evidence adduced, to conclude that the postal vote was more mischievous than beneficial, and it was with reluctance that I consented to its abolition. One would have thought that, because of the action of the late Government in bringing about the repeal of the postal vote, the number of electors who voted at the last election would have been considerably reduced. The Assistant Minister of Home Affairs told us yester day that, because this privilege had been withdrawn, no fewer than 77,000 electors had been prohibited from voting at the last elections. What are the facts? At the elections held in 1903, 46.86 per cent, of the electors upon the roll voted; in 1906 the percentage had risen  &#163;0  50.21 ; in 1910, it had increased to 62.16; and at the last election it had still further increased to 73.66. There was a larger increase in the number of votes recorded at the last election as compared with the previous election than is to be found in a comparison between any two precedingelections. Indeed, the percentage of those enrolled who voted at the elections during the present year was nearly double that of those who voted in 1903. </para>

                            <para>- I think that the percentage of increase has been about the same in the case of women as in the case of men ; but, of course, I am speaking entirely from memory. I am very anxious that all women who are entitled to vote should exercise the franchise. This is a matter of greater importance than that a particular political party should benefit by it. In dealing with this question yesterday, the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs skipped very lightly over the fact that, under this Bill, it will be necessary to ask each elector to sign the butt of his or her ballot-paper on polling day. I believe that that is an absolutely impracticable, proposition. I believe that it is entirely unnecessary. The point which the Honorary Minister endeavoured to make was that this proposal would assist in the identification of the voter. To my mind that point was of little value. So far as the cry raised by the Government is concerned, this proposal does not touch it at all. It will not help to identify the voter in any way. It may be of value in identifying the vote- </para>

                            <para>- By his remarks the Honorary Minister conveyed more than that to most honorable members. How- ever, I think he merely intended to say that the signing of the butt would enable the vote to be identified. The identification of the vote, however, will be established by the number which appears on the other part of the butt, and not by the signature. </para>

                            <para>- We require to be given more information than we were given yesterday, although that was not entirely the fault of the Minister. Whether there are few or many polling booths does not affect this question one iota. The fewer the polling booths the more difficult will it be to identify the voters. Where only a small number of persons vote at a polling place, almost every elector knows every other elector, so that impersonation is difficult. This proposal is a bastard one, which has been attached to a provision that obtains in Canada. There they have a system in book form, with duplicate butts and a counterfoil attached to the ballot-paper. Upon the counterfoil is placed a distinguishing number and the initials of the Returning Officer. That is held until the ballot-paper which the elector has marked is brought back to the ballot-box and the initials and number are compared. The ballot-paper is then put into the box. The presiding officer thereupon takes the counterfoil which he has initialed and tears it up in the presence of the elector. In a poll-book a poll clerk keeps a record of the elector&#39;s distinguishing number and the fact that he has voted. That is not what is proposed here. I am convinced that the proposition is ill considered, that it is not protective, and that it will not discover the fraudulent voter or impersonator. Under such a system one can imagine an election continuing for a week. It is no reflection on people to say that they very much dislike signing their names when going to the ballot. Quite a number of electors find themselves very excited when they go to vote, and as a result they make errors. The idea of handing out a butt and requiring every voter, in the presence of the Returning Officer, to sign it! Why, the signing of it would probably occupy two or three minutes in most cases, and certainly one minute in the quickest case. What is to be done in the meantime? Everybody else will be kept waiting. The result will be that we shall require very many more presiding officers and considerably more polling places. In a big centre, one Divisional Returning Officer is far more competent to manage twenty presiding officers than each presiding officer is competent to manage a separate polling place. Therefore, under this proposal, large polling places would requireto be established in big centres. Upon that ground alone I hope that the Government will not proceed on the lines which have been indicated. There is another matter upon which the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs enlarged, and in regard to which I entirely disagree with him. The Bill provides for the abolition of the 5s. deposit which is required to accompany objections to the presence of any name upon the roll. I can remember the time in my own State when it was necessary to have some protection against the elimination of names from the electoral rolls. </para>

                            <para>- The proposal of the Government is one to enable interested parties and organizations to give information to the officials, so that they may, on that information, strike the names of persons off the roll. In theory, that may seem admirable and useful, but in practice it has worked disastrously to the toiling masses. The honorable member for Maranoa knows very well that this system was used prior to 1892, and up to 1896, in such a way as to disfranchise whole electorates; and, because of that, the electorates were wrongly represented for years and years. Even a distinguished member of Parliament, and a justice of the peace - we had possession of his original letter - sent word to all the justices of the peace and Electoral Registrars in his own district to take care to purge the roll of Labour voters. There was no deposit of 5s. required at that time; it was enough to make the suggestion that the purging should be done. It could not be done very well by this man, rich as he was, by means of a deposit of 5s., because they were dealing with Labour voters, not by hundreds, but by thousands. Is it suggested by the Minister, or the Ministry, that the officers of the Electoral Department will not take advice from ordinary persons regarding persons who have left a district, and so on ? They can get all the information they want without the 5s. If a deposit of 5s. is made, it simply means . that if a person wishes to make a specific objection against a person who he believes is not entitled to be on the roll, he can do so, and if he is right he can get the money back. </para>

                            <para>- I am glad to hear that statement repeated, though I can assure the Minister that it was quite unnecessary. There was nothing he emphasized so much yesterday as that these proposals have the official sanction of the permanent officers. Few Governments, to my knowledge, have leant so much on the permanent officials as the present Government are doing. Either this is a matter of policy, or it is nothing at all. Why should the Ministry draw the permanent officials into the discussion ? Why do they shelter themselves behind men who cannot speakin self defence here? </para>

                        <para>- Order ! It is almost impossible for me to hear the honorable member for Wide Bay on account of the continuous flow of interjections, and interruptions, and also conversations across the chamber. The honorable member is entitled to make his speech without such interruptions. </para>

                            <para>- Has there been any evidence forthcoming as to the existence of an unclean roll ? We have had figures galore, but no evidence of any duplication except that which is essential to enable everybody to be on the roll. When you are nearing an election - indeed, at any time - if you intend to have every person on the roll, under our sys tem, there must be duplications. In no country do people travel more from one part to the other than is done in Australia, and it is a good thing for Australia that it is done. Those who sit still in one place can always be sure of having the franchise; but those who remove from place to place will experience great difficulty in exercising the franchise unless the existing system is continued. We are making a rule which, I hope, will last as long as we have a franchise Act, and that is that the name of a person shall not be removed from the roll of a division until it has been enrolled effectively in another division, and that a person, though he travels from one part of Australia to another, following his occupation, and helping to produce the wealth of his country, shall remain a citizen, and be entitled to exercise the franchise. Is the Ministry against that ideal? There must be duplication. In no country in the world, not even in America, is the nomadic portion of the community more numerous than in Australia. And that principle must continue to prevail if we want to protect these persons. A great deal has been made - and quite properly made, if the statement is correct - of about 77,000 persons being disfranchised because of infirmity and sickness. I believe that that number is excessive. As regards maternity disability, I think there is a large term involved there, probably over two months, while as regards the other cases of sickness, I can get no statistics from those in authority to bear out the allegation. Suppose that that is so, what is the proposal of the Government on the other hand ? What do they propose to do regarding the 10,000 young Australians who become twenty-one years of age more than a month before the issue of the writs, and whose names are not on the roll before the issue of the writs? The Government are going to deprive these young persons of a vote, although they say they are desirous of every one having a vote. Could inconsistency go further than to have the youth of Australia, who are looking forward to the opportunity of casting their first vote, in all probability deprived of that opportunity for three years and one month by the act of a Government who say they desire to see every one taking part in the elections? This Bill bristles with inconsistencies. </para>

                            <para>- They give it to themselves. That is exactly what they state; this is their own measure, after great and careful deliberation. The Bill contains many minor points, which, of course, are worth considering, and which I should like to deal with. There is quite a number of references which I should be very pleased to put before the House; but it cannot be agreeable to honorable members to listen to my voice, and the use of it is certainly not very pleasant to myself. As regards the postal vote, that is another weakness, and one which cannot be eliminated by any system which might be passed through the House. I refer again to the 15 per cent. of postal votes that were never returned at the 1910 elections. In our own experience, and in the experience of Queensland, generally, these are probably votes given to persons who take charge of them, and destroy them for particular reasons. I believe that the Ministry are honestly desirous of protecting these votes in every possible way once they have been recorded by the electors. But I am apprehensive that we shall never be able to satisfactorily get a larger vote from the persons who are absent from the ballot-box in a proper voting place. And it is for these reasons, I think, that the Government, in their efforts to give these facilities to the sick and the infirm, have failed to carry out their own wishes, and certainly the wishes of the Opposition. We are desirous that every person shall have a vote, and that every facility shall be given for voting. I think I am speaking for the whole of the Opposition when I say that, while we believe that there have been abuses of the postal vote, if any system can be devised that would enable the infirm and the sick to record a vote, we should be glad to cooperate to do so; but this proposal is certainly not one of those which can commend themselves to us. Generally speaking, I think that the Bill fails to do anything to the electoral system which is beneficial. I believe that it is not conceived in the best spirit of a democratic government. Its effect will be restrictive, although its purport, according to the Ministry, is progressive and extensive. The measure will not extend the franchise to any persons who do not now enjoy it, and, in my opinion, it represents a weakening rather than a strengthening of the principle of democratic representation. For those reasons I cannot promise the Government to support the Bill. </para>

                            <para>- May I suggest to my honorable friend that he should say something fresh, and not indulge in a very old and very stale platitude. If we have no policy it is strange that my honorablefriends opposite should be so troubled. Had we not better be allowed to get on with our no-policy, and be done with it If we have no policy we can hurt nobody. </para>

                            <para>- I rise to a point of order, and because I desire instruction myself. I arn, as I stated, a new member, and I am not acquainted with the rules of debate in this particular House. I made an interjection, to which the Prime Minister took exception. I followed the example set by the Prime Minister himself when the honorable member for Wide Bay was speaking. The honorable member for Wide Bay was subject to a constant flow of interjections from the Prime Minister; and if it was in order for the Prime Minister to pursue that course of procedure, I take it that it was quite in order for me also to pursue it. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Fawkner is a new member, and I have, therefore, allowed him some latitude. The honorable member, however, has not stated a point of order. I was not in the chair when the honorable member for Wide Bay was speaking, but if I had been, and the Prime Minister had interjected, I should have protected the honorable member for Wide Bay. I can only say that I am here to carry out the rules of debate, and I shall endeavour to do so,- looking for the assistance of honorable members. </para>

                        <para>.- Personally, I regret that the Government should have introduced the Bill at this early stage of the session. It is not, as the Prime Minister has told us, a Committee Bill, but it is practically a challenge to the Opposition. I also regret that the Bill contains provisions which were eliminated from the Electoral Act last session. We have to face facts as they are; and, in my opinion, it is not statesmanlike to attempt to radically altermeasures after a general election, unless the Government can see a fair possibility of passing their proposals through both Houses. </para>

                            <para>- I quite admit that it has; but it does not appear to me statesmanlike to alter measures that were carried by both Houses in the last Parliament, especially when an opportunity is presented to deal with large non-contentious measures. This House might deal with such subjects as the federalization, of our State debts, the strengthening of our Defence Forces, the building up of our Navy, and the nationalization of the Atlantic cable. These are some of the questions with which the Government might deal at the present stage. The Government, however, are attempting to make radical alterations in an Act that received the support of a substantial majority of the members of both Houses of the Parliament returned at the election previous to the last general election. At the last general election, some of the matters with which this Bill deals were the subject of a great deal of controversy, and, taking the membership of the two Houses, we find that more members were returned in favour of the principles which I have in mind than we had supporting them in the last Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- I am quite prepared to deal only with those who sought reelection, and I would remind the honorable member that the Labour party won the larger number of seats. The point which I wish to emphasize is that we now have in this Parliament a larger number of members in favour of certain amendments made two years ago in the Electoral Act than we had at that time. I am referring more particularly to two or three provisions which the Government are trying to remove from the principal Act, and one which they desire to put back. Dealing with this question, we must have regard to the Constitution as it stands, remembering that the two Houses are elected by the people, and have equal co-ordinate powers except in matters of finance. I have always objected to a Legislature consisting of more than one House. I voted against the Federal referendum in New South Wales on both occasions because the Constitution Bill provided for the bicameral system. It seems to me, however, that having been defeated, those of us who at that time advocated a National Parliament of only one House must, in common with the people of Australia as a whole, work within the sphere of the Constitution which the people of the Commonwealth have seen fit to adopt. In speaking thus,I am not taking up a new position. We had some difficulty between the House of Representatives and the Senate in the very first Parliament, a certain degree of friction and a substantial difference of opinion arising between the two Houses concerning a very important point. I then took up the position that I am now adopting, urging that the people of Australia, having decided upon the bicameral system of legislation, it was our duty to work within the Constitution as it stood. Looking up the debate which then took place, in order to refresh my memory, I found that the present Prime Minister took part in it. I cannot say that he was influenced by any opinions that I had expressed. He spoke shortly after I had addressed the House, and used practically the words that I had uttered, although he spoke with a great deal more power, and with a brilliancy which I do not possess.

                        <para>If a crisis were to occur, and I went to the people of New South Wales and said that I objected to what the Senate had done in regard to the Tariff, they would turn around and say, &#34;We want the Senate to do precisely as it is doing.&#34; Then I might retort, &#34;But look at the danger that is involved to the Constitution.&#34; They would then say, &#34; We had all those dangers pointed out to lis before the referendum was taken. We knew all about them then, and now that the Senate is in favour of our view with regard to the Tariff, we ask you and others to work the Constitution as you find it until it is altered in a constitutional way.&#34; </para>

                    <para class="block">That was in 1903, and to-day I take up the same stand. I do not say for one moment that if the Government of the day hold strong views on a certain math ter, they ought not to submit them to the Parliament, although they may know for a certainty that the Senate will not adopt them. I claim, however, that it is not wise for a Government to adopt such a course unless it deliberately desires to waste the session. It is not wise to introduce a measure of this kind, containing provisions that must inevitably be rejected by the Senate, seeing that that House - which is not a nominee Chamber - has just returned from the country as we have done- </para>

                            <para>- I do not say anything of the kind. But I do say that it is unwise for the Government to do what they are doing just now, in view of the fact that there are quite a number of other matters with which they could deal. If the Government desire to force an election - if they feel that the time has come when they should appeal from a halting Parliament to an awakened  people - well and good. But let us understand the position. No one can imagine for a moment that the Government seriously anticipate that they are likely to succeed in carrying two or three of the provisions of this Bill. I quite admit that there are in the Act some provisions which it would be wise to amend. I agree with the Prime Minister that the Act itself is not perfect. Nothing that comes from the human mind can possibly be perfect; and, however good an Electoral Act may be, after it has run the gantlet of a general election it is usually found to contain provisions that might justifiably be altered. That, however, is quite a different matter from the attitude of the Government with regard to two or three matters which have been made vital, to a very great extent, by one of the parties in this House, in view of the fact that, in the two Houses, we have to-day a bigger majority in favour of them than existed two years ago. I do not propose to deal with the whole of the clauses in this measure, for I recognise that we shall have, in Committee, a good deal of time to consider them. One of the provisions of this Bill does away with the requirement of the present Act that, during an election campaign, political articles published in newspapers shall have attached to them the names of the writers.

                            <para>- I intend to elaborate my argument somewhat on that line. There is no doubt that the press of Australia, in common with the press of the world generally, has, during the past few years, undergone a serious change. There was a time when the press did stand for freedom; when it did stand for the privileges of the poor; when it did stand for the disinherited. But that time has passed. Editors, proprietors, general managers, and those responsible for the conduct of the press - I am not referring so much to the provincial press as to the metropolitan - have become wealthy people or corporations. Consequently, they are not to-day so much inclined to advocate the cause of the defenceless poor,- or to champion the oppressed. I was speaking a few years ago to a very prominent editor of one of our great metropolitan newspapers. He is well known to quite a number of honorable members as editor of one of our fighting journals. I said to him, &#34;Is it not a fact that people do not read leading articles to-day as once they did, and that leading articles do not influence public opinion as they used to do ? But is it not also a fact that, nevertheless, the press has greater influence over the popular mind than it once had?&#34; He said,  &#39; Yes, that is so ; you are correct in both suppositions. I do not believe that people do read leading articles as they did once, but, nevertheless, the press is more powerful than it was. I will give you my reasons. When I was young, and became a reporter on the press, it was my duty simply to report a meeting to which I was sent. No one on the paper was allowed to have any politics except the editor. The politics of the paper were expounded by the leader-writers; but no one else was permitted to allow his political opinions to appear in his work. When we were sent to report a meeting, we were expected to report the facts, and nothing but the facts. But times have changed. Every person on a newspaper nowadays has&#34; to write up to the leading articles. The consequence is that it does not matter what part of a paper you are reading, you must come under the influence of the policy espoused by it.&#34; The tone of the press has absolutely altered. I am much indebted to a useful little book entitled <inline font-style="italic">The Newspaper,</inline> written by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. G.</inline> B. Dibblee,  who is an M.A., and a late fellow of All Souls&#39; College, Oxford. The book is published as one of the volumes of the &#34; Home University Library.&#34; The author says - </para>

So far from being willing to remove this restriction, if it be a restriction, I should like to see it extended to every article.

                        <para>In the United Kingdom the prevailing, practice has followed another course. Anonymous journalism has been found in the end to be a more powerful political weapon, partly because reverence attaches itself more easily to the unknown, and also because the shelter of corporate responsibility adds somewhat to the freedom of writing, and very much to the fertility of invention. </para>

Another objection to the non-signing of articles is, as the author says, that it gives to those who are writing an opportunity for &#34; fertility of invention.&#34; </para>

One advantage of unsigned articles is that it affords an opportunity for a mediocre writer to get behind the reputation of a great newspaper. Brilliant men, this author says, prefer to have nothing to do with journals in which articles are not signed. They prefer to attach their names to what they write. </para>

                            <para>- I mentioned just now that the editor of one of the great journals of Australia told me that nowadays every reporter had to write up to the leading articles, whereas, when he was a youth, a reporter was expected to report a meeting exactly as it took place. I remember an occasion a few years ago when a meeting was held at the Protestant Hall, Sydney. It was addressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne, and the main subject of discussion was Protection. If honorable members want an illustration of the truth of what I have been saying, let them compare the reports of that meeting in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Aye.</inline> Any honorable member who takes the trouble to do that may reasonably ask himself whether it was possible for two such reports to appear unless the reporters were writing up te the political opinions of the journals which sent them to the meeting. </para>

I may be pardoned for reading this extract, because it bears out the contention of some of us. The author speaks very highly of the English press up to a certain time; but he does not believe that it is maintained at so high a standard to-day. He refers to the period since the Boer war and the commencement of the Tariff reform agitation, the result of which has been that practically all the principal metropolitan newspapers in England are on the one side. Consequently, according to this account, there is not that regard for impartiality and truth that at one time was maintained by the newspapers. Then there were newspapers writing on each side of the question. But since then in England the greater part of the rich and powerful newspapers have been writing on one side. The author says that the press has lost its high standing to a large extent, because it is not as careful of the truth as it used to be. He continues - </para>

Society, with a big S, has gone entirely on to o:ie side, and lias imposed on its press that most hopeless form of provincialism which already prevails in high circles in Berlin, of merely refusing to recognise as possible the existence of culture, good faith, and even of common honesty in those who do not adopt the opinions prevailing in its own ranks. From this blindness I sec no ordinary means of deliverance. </para>

                            <para>- I quite recognise that there are some associated with the Labour press who object to the signing of articles; but that makes no difference, so far as I am concerned. I know, for example, that some of those who are associated with a rather powerful organ connected with my own party are strong on the other side on this question ; but that does not influence my opinion. What I want to get is the truth from all sides. I envy no man or party who wins an election by misrepresentation and falsehood. Any party or candidate that wins by misrepresentation or untruth can only triumph for a time. The triumphs of misrepresentation and falsehood are of a very temporary character. It is the triumphs gained by truth that last. There was a time when the liberty, freedom, and greatness of the press were to be extolled, when the newspapers advocated great measures of reform, great causes and great principles, and were not merely money-making machines. But that time has passed. It is now true of them to say, as has been said - </para>

                        <para>There is little distinction now made between newspaper properties and any other, except that their political influence adds some considerable extra value to their market price. In almost the majority of cases they are owned by limited companies. Their possession does not carry with it the feeling of a public trust; to own one means just so much money and so much power. </para>

                    <para class="block">We know that some years ago it was practically a toss up whether the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> should be brought out as a Protectionist or as a Free Trade organ, the directors, by a majority of one, deciding that it should be the latter. They came to that decision, not because they cared particularly about either fiscal policy, but because they wished the newspaper to earn as big dividends as possible, so that their shares might become as valuable as possible; and they thought that more money was to be made by its advocacy of Free Trade. We must deal with things as they are. There are some who think that the signing of newspaper articles is a measure which was first proposed by the Labour party; but that is not so. As the Prime Minister has supported his arguments by references to what happened in the time of Jack Cade, and even of Diocletian, and as one of his supporters referred to something that occurred in China 900 years ago, I may be allowed to go back to the year 1864, and quote the opinion of one whom even the honorable member for Robertson, if he knows anything of history, will recognise as a great Liberal - I refer to John Bright, one of England&#39;s greatest Liberals and tribunes. During the corn law agitation, the <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> assailed both Cobden and Bright very fiercely, publishing leading articles which went beyond what they deemed to be fair criticism. Cobden thereupon demanded that the articles should be signed, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Delane,  one of the greatest editors that the <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> has had, was forced to sign his name to them. John Bright, dealing with this episode at a meeting held in Birmingham a little while afterwards, said, referring to Cobden - </para>

And at last, after denial and equivocation of every kind, this unmasked editor of this great journal was obliged to retire from the personal part of this controversy, and to skulk back into his anonymous hiding place, which suited him better. </para>

                    <para class="block">It is only fair that the walk of those who write for the newspapers should not be  slantendicular.  We do not wish to interfere with the freedom or liberty of the press, but we ask that the walk of its writers be upright. It is important that the writers who made incorrect statements should be known. Speaking on the no-confidence amendment, I referred to an article published in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> which had been written by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Maling,</inline> under instructions from the proprietors, stating that the then Leader of the Opposition and present Prime Minister had thrown off some of the Labour views which he held in the past, as one might throw off infantile complaints. I wrote to the newspaper pointing out that the honorable member had stated recently that his views were unchanged, and that it was of serious interest to the country to know the facts of the case. Some years ago the honorable gentleman told the following story : - </para>

                    <para class="block">We ought to know whether those are still the Prime Minister&#39;s views. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Maling,</inline> the honorable gentleman does not hold those views now, but according to what the Prime Minister himself said, at Lithgow, some twelve months ago, he has not changed his views. Let&#39; me take another incident in which I was personally concerned. When Minister of External Affairs I went to the Northern Territory with a parliamentary party. The original arrangement was that I should leave by train on Sunday, but I changed my plan and left on the Monday. Much to my surprise I read in Monday&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> that on Sunday the train had been kept back, because I had not turned up, that a motor-car had been sent out to find me, that a telephone message had been sent in asking that the train might be stopped, and that a compartment had been reserved for me, and that I had not said that I would not use it. I tried to ascertain what truth there was in these statements, and the stationmaster informed me that the train had not been kept back for a minute on my account, and I had sent him no telephone message, nor had a motor-car been sent out for me. Something to that effect appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> of the same afternoon, but the correspondent of the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> wired to Sydney that what I had stated was nonsense, that the train had been kept back for me, and that three motorcars had gone in search of me. The writer did not sign his name, though I knew it was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Peters,</inline> because he always writes a certain column. He knew that his statement was not true, and might not have made it if he had had to sign his article. When I returned from the Territory, I had a chat with him and his <inline font-style="italic">confrere*,</inline> and before starting business I asked whether I had ever done any injury to him personally, either privately or publicly. He said, &#34; You should not talk in that fashion.&#34; I replied, &#34; Well, why did you send that statementwhen you knew that it was not true?&#34; &#34;Oh,&#34; he answered, &#34;you knew it was a joke.&#34; I replied, &#34; Then you should have stated that it was a joke, so that the people could understand it in that light.&#34; If men are to be assailed, let them be assailed in the open. When a deputation of press representatives - I think the honorable member for Wimmera was among them - waited on me, I spoke on this subject, without mentioning the particular case, and was told that a public man who i night be assailed unfairly or unjustly could appeal to the Courts of Law for justice. Well, in the affair which I have mentioned, I went to Messrs. Sly and Bussell, than whom there are no more eminent solicitors in Sydney, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bussell</inline> was good enough to say that he thought I had a good case, but he added, &#34; I do not advise you to go to law over the matter, because if you win - and you might lose - the other side will appeal. If you are lucky enough to win again, they will appeal again, and even if you win on the third occasion you will be hundreds of pounds out of pocket.&#34; No doubt, men will write unfairly and unjustly even when articles have to be signed, but every man who is assailed by the press ought to be permitted to know the name of his assailant. As honorable members know, it is the intention of the Government to re-introduce the postal voting system, if possible. I voted for the abolition of the postal voting system a year or two ago very reluctantly, because I had previously spoken in favour of the system in this House, and had supported its adoption in the electoral law of New South Wales, but I was forced by the logic of facts to change my opinion with regard to it. We should endeavour, not merely to secure the insertion of electors&#39; names upon the rolls, but also to provide them with reasonable facilities for voting. I have taken up a stand in opposition to the restoration of the postal vote because it cannot be questioned that that vote interferes with the secrecy of the ballot. Out of every one hundred persons who vote by post, I venture to say that how ninety of them exercise their franchise is known to canvassers. That remark is not applicable merely to supporters of the Liberal party, but also to supporters of the Labour party. It is obvious that it must be so. Take the case of 100 persons who are sick or infirm. Ten out of that number may be anxious to vote, and may take the trouble to get the necessary papers to enable them to do so. They may fill in those papers and forward them by post in the ordinary way. Nobody may know how they voted. But, in the other ninety cases, the agents will not bother to secure the requisite papers if they do not know how the persons concerned intend to vote. </para>

Iu 1867 the Conservative party in England introduced a Bill for the purpose of conferring the franchise upon a large number of persons. At that time Lord Cranbourne, who was afterwards the Marquis of Salisbury, the great Conservative Prime Minister of England, introduced a provision for voting by post. In a very able speech he defended voting by post. The whole of the Liberal Opposition opposed that proposal, and no one more ably than did John Bright himself. In replying to Lord Cranbourne, in the House of Commons, he said - </para>

                    <para class="block">I <inline font-style="italic">am not</inline> quite sure that that leaflet was circulated in the busy centres like Sydney. I am rather inclined to think that it was distributed only in remote areas where we could not trace it. We desire to secure as good an Electoral Act as possible. If some provisions in the existing Act require to be amended to enable the people to more clearly express their views on great national questions, we are prepared to assist the Government to amend them. But it is a very great pity that the Ministry should have incorporated in this Bill some clauses which will necessarily provoke a great fight, instead of dealing with the question from a statesmanlike point of view. They have brought down to us something which is not a Bill, but a challenge. </para>

                            <para>- I propose to speak to what I consider one of the most important Bills which this or any other Government could introduce. But before doing so, the Honorary Minister will not object, I am sure, to me criticising his method of presenting the measure. I know no one who can surpass him in flying a kite, or trailing his coat tails and fighting anybody who will tread on them. He speaks with the deep design that, by courting interjections, or giving sometimes a witty reply, culled either from his own brains or from those of others, he may sometimes lead men to place a construction on cleverly used words which he can say afterwards will not bear the. construction. It would have been far better for my honorable friend in introducing the Bill to have followed the good example of the Minister of External Affairs, or the Minister of Trade and Customs. Amongst other things, my honorable friend said, &#34; They have done it - that is, going round to every polling booth, and voting.&#34; I must confess that I took that remark as an insult to a large number of our Australian people. I know from converse with the honorable member that he did not mean that, but that was the construction which would appear to any listener. </para>

                            <para>- My honorable friend also twitted the ex-Attorney-General with having boasted that the Labour party would come back with a majority of four votes. Perhaps the Minister does not know how many supporters we went out with. We went out of this House fortyone strong, lost eleven seats, and gained seven seats, coming back thirty-seven strong. On the other hand, the Opposition went out of the House thirty-two strong, gained thirteen seats, and lost seven seats, returning thirty-eight strong - that is, with a majority of one. In the Senate, however, four members of the Labour party went out, and eleven supporters were returned, giving us in that chamber a majority of twenty-nine against seven. Fourteen supporters of the Opposition went out, and only seven came back. We were forty-one strong in the late House, and only twenty-two strong in the Senate. At present, we are thirty-seven strong here, and twentynine strong in the Senate, showing a clear gain of three supporters. As regards both Houses, we went to the country sixty-three strong, and came back with sixty-six. We could well spare ten members from our majority in the Senate if we could only obtain the majority which the  Speaker  has the distinguished honour of being. That statement will show that when an honorable member, speaking of his party, said, &#34; We will gaiu four seats,&#34; he was perfectly justified in making the prophecy. I certainly did not think that we would lose so many seats as we did, nor would we have done so had we the power to meet the press in the country parts that we have in the town. In that election, for the first time in Victoria, if not in the whole world, the platform faced the press on equal terms, because we had no anonymity, no aliases, no false names. A writer signed his name, and some writers were so honorable that they would not sign or write certain articles for some newspaper proprietors. In the country, however, the press had an advantage. I confess openly - and the Minister will know it - that if the Protectionists in my district ceased to vote for me, my majority would have been nothing. </para>

                            <para>- In a memorable election I had to fight, not only against a wealthy man - for the election cost something like &#163;4,000, although it had to be contested with an expenditure of under &#163;100 - but against a police magistrate, since retired from the Bench. A partisan of the vilest kind, this magistrate asked, &#34; For whom were these votes obtained from our unfortunate sisters?&#34; thinking that my name would come out. He nearly dropped on the bench when he found that the candidate was <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Malcolm</inline> McEacharn. The magistrate, to his eternal disgrace, showed partisanship by his question; and the barrister who was trying to imprison the women, and trying unjustly to do it, too, thinking that they had voted for me, was horrified when it came out whom the vote was cast for. I think I must pay my honorable friend opposite a meed of fair play by saying that he acknowledged that the charge against <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barker</inline> was withdrawn. </para>

                            <para>- In this matter, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barker</inline> stands pre-eminent. During my long State career, I felt that magistrates were too far away from the people ; that they thought themselves little tin gods; and I said I would never nominate to the magistracy a man against whom a single hand could be held up at a public meeting. Two men only did I nominate - one was Stephen Barker - and I am proud of my act. At that huge meeting of over 1,500 people, called by an announcement in the press, not one man held up a hand against Stephen Barker. </para>

                            <para>- We know that men who rob in thousands sometimes get titles, while those who rob in pennies, or bread, to appease their hunger, go to gaol. T would rather face my Maker as a man who had stolen bread for his children than as a man who had robbed widows and orphans of their thousands. If the majority of those 144,000 people, who have been stamped as criminals, have sympathy with the Labour party, it is because we are trying to uplift and help them ; our doors are, perhaps, more open to them than are the dcors of more superfine persons. I see no provisions in the Bill relating to the use of conveyances at elections; and 1 ask whether it can be thought for a moment that &#163;100 will cover the expenses when thirty motor cars are used. I am credibly informed that, in Ballarat, at the recent election, over fifty cars were used on one side only; and I would honour this or any other Government who would stop the use of conveyances. Indeed, I would go so far as to suggest that any conveyance used to bring a voter to the poll should be confiscated. </para>

                            <para>- I am informed that a good many men and women used <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Malcolm</inline> McEacharn&#39;s car, though I believe all did not vote for him. At the same time, such attentions have their effect, just in the same way as have afternoon teas. Then, again, this Bill would have received more support if the Government had proposed to absolutely stop canvassing. It is, of course, absolutely impossible for a candidate to canvass 35,000 votes, and there is a large body composed of silent voters who stay at home, and who may possibly be swayed by newspaper articles or friendly conversation. A man or woman of independent thought would scorn a candidate who asked votes for himself. In the whole course of my twenty-four years of political life, I have never asked a man or a woman for a vote, but have merely pointed- to the planks of my platform, and stated that if the electors were in favour of those planks they ought to vote for me, but that if, on the other hand, they favoured the policy of my opponent, then, of course, he ought to have their support. The touts and other undesirable types of humanity who used to flock round at election times are gradually disappearing, and their disappearance is due more to the last Electoral Act than to any preceding measure. At the last election we know that the privilege of absent voting was exercised to an absurd degree, especially in centres of population, and it would have been well if a clause had been inserted in this Bill fixing a 5-miles radius. It is perfectly absurd that a man residing only a third of a mile from a polling booth should be able to cast an&#39; absent vote, and cause all the subsequent trouble to the officials. I do not see much utility in the provisions for the signing of the butt of the voting paper. As far back as 1891 I suggested that the photograph of the elector ought to appear on his elector&#39;s right, and I am informed that such photographs could be obtained at a minimum cost, possibly as low as a penny each, in centres of population. This plan, or the German plan of a book of life, might be adopted, which would begin a youth&#39;s record when he went up for compulsory training, and would continue until he claimed his vote. This, of course, would absolutely prevent any misrepresentation or impersonation. When I was representing Australia in the Coronation year, I had to obtain photographs of myself for certain purposes, and I got three very fine ones in London for a shilling. One of these, unmounted, was handed in at a railway station in Ostend, and, in return for 7s. 6d., I received a railway ticket bearing that photograph, and entitling me to travel five days and five nights on all the railways of the country. The signing of the butt will only create additional and unnecessary difficulties. The elector should, of course, be checked when he gives his vote. </para>

These balls ore counted by placing them on trays which hold exactly 100 in depressions, and the operation is performed with great celerity. Those of us who have seen the totalizator at work on the race-courses, will agree that it would be very convenient if we could get our election results as rapidly. </para>

                            <para>- Had the Government accepted the advice of the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> a few days ago, and provided for the referendum, initiative, and recall, I should have viewed this Bill with much more favour. Personally, I see no objection to the woman who is about to become a mother being permitted to exercise the postal vote; and I may say the same of the inmates of hospitals, and the sick generally. Why could there not be a clause plainly stating that a woman about to become a mother could so vote ? Where is the disgrace of motherhood? Is there a God-gift which more plainly points to immortality? These unfortunate young women, of whom we have heard, would not have perjured themselves had there been such a provision. Then, again, we could have copied the splendid example of the Home Parliament in their Insurance Act, and have provided for a fee of, say, 2s. 6d., for medical men, within a certain distance, to attend applicants for postal votes, and certify that they were unable to go to the polling booth. I was one of the first to suffer under the system of voting by post, and I had to go into the High Court, at a cost of &#163;200 for three afternoon sittings, to obtain redress. Had I gone on with that case, I should have been involved in an expenditure of fully&#163;1,500. In the circumstances, therefore, I can speak with some feeling upon this question. At the election to which I refer, I had a sworn declaration relating to the conduct of a Melbourne city alderman in connexion with the voting by post system, but at the request of my second legal adviser, I did not use it. This man told our unfortunate sisters that if they did not vote by post for my opponent, so that their votes could be checked, he would never bail them out again. On the day of election, he bailed out some of these women, and took them to the pollingbooth in a carriage and pair. I have already referred to the partisan police magistrate who fined an honorable member of another place. He is an old man now, and perhaps we can forgive him. Who bribed the workers? Who found the &#163;4,000 spent on the election for the division of Melbourne, to which I have referred? And why was it spent? To try to keep me out of Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- But this man was the presiding genius who controlled the work of obtaining votes by post in a certain quarter. There are, in this city today, men who assisted in that work, and who would be willing to say that they knew how 80 per cent. of those who voted by post cast their votes. Indeed, if they Were not afraid of being prosecuted, they would say that, when they knew that the votes were not cast in the direction they wished, the votes disappeared. The Assistant Minister of Home Affairs said that, in one year, there had been 144,000 convictions in the Police Courts of Australia, and that such offenders against the law were most likely to have a kindly feeling towards the Labour party. I find, however, that, at the last general election, in the electorate of Macquarie, which returned a Labour member to this House, there were only eleven cases of alleged duplication out of a total of 23,322 ballot-papers issued. My own electorate comes next with only eighteen out of 27,325 ballot-papers issued; whilst Ballarat is first on the list with 173 out of 32,818 ballot-papers issued. The recent inquiry shows that there was not one case of double voting out of every 1,000 ballot-papers issued; and the Government officials will admit that most of these cases of alleged duplicate voting did not actually occur, but were due to mistakes in marking off the rolls. The postal voting system permitted of flagrant bribery and corruption in my own electorate, some years ago, as proved in the High Court; but, at the next election, there was no mistake, and a majority of seventy-seven obtained by bribery and corruption was converted to a minority of 859. I wish to pay my meed of praise to the public officials who conducted that election. They were not friends of my party, nor were they my own personal friends; they were appointed to act by a Government which wished to have the electorate of Melbourne freed of the stigma of infamy with which it had been branded by the High Court because of what had happened on a previous occasion. Some of our opponents scream from the public platforms, &#34; Why do you rob the unfortunate mothers of Victoria of the right to vote?&#34; Since the birthrate in Victoria is less than that of any other State, it follows that the postal votes recorded should have been less than in any other State. Victoria has also more polling places to the square mile than has any other State of the Commonwealth. Yet, although she has one polling booth to every 58 square miles, 14,049 postal votes were recorded at the 1910 election, as against only 1,751 in South Australia, which has only one polling booth to every 890 square miles, and 1,977 postal votes recorded in Western Australia, where there is only one polling booth to every 1,936 square miles. In other words, 14,049 postal votes were recorded in Victoria out of a total of 29,249 for the whole Commonwealth. I maintain that a great number of these postal votes were obtained by undue pressure. How is it that in Victoria, which has the lowest birth-rate, 7,708 womenfolk applied for postal ballot-papers at one general election; whereas in New South Wales, which has a population 250,000 in excess of our own, and also a very much higher birth-rate, there were only 3,325 applications. Tlie electorate of Melbourne is more compact than is any constituency in the metropolis of Sydney. Sydney, with a population, according to the radii you take, a little larger than that of this city, is divided into four constituencies; whereas the whole of Melbourne is embraced by the one electorate. In the electorate of Melbourne there are polling places only one-third of a mile apart. The subdivision of Gipps is bounded by Elizabeth, Victoria, Spring, and Bourke streets, and no part of that area is half-a-mile away from a polling booth. I find, however, that at the 1904 elections more postal ballot-papers were applied for in that one district than were sought in respect of the rest of the electorate. For Melbourne, 1,098 applications were made for postal ballot-papers, and 815 votes were actually used. In other words, there were more applications for postal ballot-papers than there were for the whole of Queensland in 1903, for the whole of South Australia in 1903 and 1906, for the whole of Western Australia at the referendum of 1911, and for the whole of Tasmania in 1903 or 1906. In 1903 there were only 1,064 postal votes recorded in Queensland, 630 in South Australia, and 816 in Tasmania. In Western Australia, at the referendum in 1911, 647 voted by post; while in 1906, 906 voted by post in Tasmania, and 744 in South Australia. What is behind all this? I have also some information regarding the voting for the Riverina, which should be of interest. It will be remembered that a certain election for that constituency was upset by the High Court, on the motion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chanter,</inline> about the time that I appealed to that tribunal, and the investigation then made showed that there were 162 informal votes out of 511 re: corded by post, whereas there were only 102 informal votes out of 10,484 recorded at the ballot-box. In other words, on the basis of the figures for the voting by ballot, there were thirtytwo times more informal votes than there should have been in connexion with the postal voting system.

In former years there was an old-fashioned feeling that the justice of the peace was created to hold impartially the scales of justice. In hundreds of cases justices of the peace are party political agents. There is little, of any, disguise about it; avowedly in many instances they are appointed to their judicial position for political purposes. It is but natural, in these circumstances, that abuses will result. </para>

                            <para>- It was proved in Queensland that justices were appointed two or three- hundred at a time, on the eve of an election, purely for party purposes. I saw enough when I was up there to convince me that wrong-doing occurred. Some of these magistrates earned as much as <inline font-style="italic">&#163;3</inline> or &#163;4 a week, and travelling expenses, going round collecting votes for a political party. </para>

                    <para class="block">Honorable members may recall that on a former occasion I laid particular stress upon the fact that there is no disgrace in a woman acknowledging the God-given, gift of motherhood. I maintain that it ought to be placed clearly in an Act dealing with this subject, that the postal vote is only to be used by women who are expecting to become mothers. We should then never have such cases as those of men trying to persuade single girls to make a false oath. I suggested the copying of a portion of the English Insurance Act which has placed Great Britain preeminent amongst great nations, providing that any man or woman who is ill shall have the right to call in a medical man to give an honest certificate for which the Government would pay a minimum fee of half-a-crown ; and that that certificate should be sufficient warrant for enabling a person to vote by post. </para>

                            <para>- Then they should be punished. The remedy for that would be to nationalize medicine. It is interesting to compare the number of postal votes passed in constituencies in which the population is nearly equal in size. In Kooyong, Victoria, there were 1,196; in Lang, New South Wales, only 89; in Balaclava, Victoria, 870&#39;; in Parkes, New South Wales, 154; in Fawkner, Victoria, 897; in Parramatta, New South Wales, only 144. How can any one honestly reconcile those figures, which are obtained from the Parliamentary Report of 1904? In the same document, the Divisional Returning Officer for the division of Melbourne reported to the Commonwealth Electoral Officer for the State of Victoria - </para>

I am glad to say that that man is to-day a firm supporter of mine. Out of 815 postal votes in that election, my opponent got 603, and I got 197.

                            <para>- I have shown conclusively that there were more postal votes cast for that constituency in the Commonwealth which had more convenient polling booths than any other than were cast for the whole State of Queensland, where a man can walk 1,500 miles in a direct line without crossing the border, or for the still larger State of Western Australia. I have shown, further, that nearly half of the postal votes were cast for the State that had the lowest birth rate in the Commonwealth. I have shown, too, that bribery and corruption were proved to the hilt in the High Court of Australia. But Ministers have made up their minds that the postal voting system should be a fighting plank, and I shall be ready at any time to meet them, though I should have preferred three months at least to be given up by both parties to sensible legislation. If that is not done, the man in the street will be apt to say, &#34; A plague o&#39; both your parties. Why cannot you show common sense and do some work?&#34; If we provided for the referendum and the initiative, the people, instead of having power one day in three years to create the Parliament, would have the power to control it every day. They would be able to say to a Ministry that had not their confidence, &#34; Out you go.&#34; They might even say to this Parliament, &#34; You are fooling away our time. Go out!&#34; We are paid a very good minimum wage; I wish that the average earnings throughout the land were as good. If we had the initiative, and the people said, &#34; There shall be an elective Ministry,&#34; nothing could gainsay it. If the people said that there should be preferential voting, Parliament could not object to it. Since 1891, I have advocated giving the people this power. This Parliament, good as iti is - possibly it is the best that has ever been elected in Australia - is carrying on a fool&#39;s game. Every honorable member should be permitted to devote the whole of his energies and attention to the welfare of the community. What higher honour could there be than to be a servant of the people in this House, With the privilege of proposing legislation for the benefit of the community ? Instead of that, we have the continual squabbling of parties. When we were on the other side we had a huge majority compared with that of the present Government. You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> hold the scales. I know that you will always do so justly, but you are the omnipotent power in the House, and the position is not fair to the people. Had they the initiative and referendum, they would say, &#34; Get to work, and when it suits us there shall be a dissolution.&#34; Honorable members opposite ask for a double dissolution, but in the Senate we are twenty-nine against seven, and when at the last election eighteen senators had to be chosen, the number of Labour senators returned was eleven, although only four Labour senators had to submit themselves for reelection. It ill-becomes this Parliament to play With a -measure which has been designedly brought forward to cause friction. But we, on this side, have declared against <inline font-style="italic">it,</inline> and Must fight against it at every opportunity. In the United States of America a revolution has taken place against their iron-bound, steel-riveted Constitution, an attempt being made by no Sewer than twenty-two States of the Unionto givethe people more power. </para>

                        <para>.- I desire to say a few words on the second reading, and shall commence with a reference to the manner in which the second reading was moved by the Minister in charge of it. If a man trails his coat on the ground, and as the honorable member for Herbert said the other night, looks for a fight, he is sure to get it; and any one with parliamentary experience knows that the best way of getting a Bill through is not to stir up the Opposition beforehand. Why was not this Bill introduced in the Senate, which has already had three long adjournments this session ? The first adjournment was caused by the moving of the noconfidence amendment; but Ministers proposed then to adjourn for. a longer period than was necessary, until it was pointed out by a Labour senator that an earlier meeting would have to be arranged for to enable a Supply Bill to be passed. The Senate has apparently no work to do. Why, then, were not this Bill and the Arbitration Bill introduced in that Chamber? </para>

                            <para>- In the Senate, I think. At any rate, there is no reason why this measure should not have been originated there. Immediately following the last general election a great outcry was made hy the press and by honorable members opposite regarding the duplicate voting which was alleged to have taken place. Since then the rolls in connexion with every electorate have been carefully scrutinized, but no evidence has been forthcoming that any person was guilty of double voting. </para>

                            <para>- But I will, for the benefit of the Treasurer. If the Government know of any cases of duplicate voting they have a right to prosecute the offenders. I honestly believe that there were no such cases - that what are alleged to be cases of double voting were mistakes on the part of electoral officers. It is true that some names appear twice upon the rolls, but inquiry has revealed that these are either the names of mother and daughter or of father and son. In one of the largest subdivisions in the Commonwealth - a subdivision in which there are 10,000 or 11,000 voters - the names of ten or twenty John Smith&#39;s appear on the roll. That being so, some names are bound to be ticked off in error. At the polling booth at which I voted in Richmond, I saw the people standing round the table four or five deep. In such circumstances some mistakes cannot be avoided. Honorable members opposite do not believe in their hearts that there were 5,000 cases of duplicate voting. Probably, upon investigation, these cases would be narrowed down to less than fifty for the entire Commonwealth. The Government have recently had a special investigation into the conduct of the Ballarat election - an investigation undertaken by a detective. Why has not his report been laid upon the table ? If that investigation was undertaken on the advice -of the Chief Electoral Officer the report ought to be laid on the table. We have as much right to know what is in it as honorable members opposite. </para>

                            <para>- When I was interrupted I waa dealing with electoral irregularities which were alleged to have occurred on the occasion of the last election. I have here a clipping from the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper of the 9th June last. It is headed &#34; Electoral Scandals,&#34; &#34; Alleged Impersonation,&#34; &#34;The Yarra Electorate Rolls,&#34; &#34; Extraordinary Duplicate Entries,&#34; and &#34; A Labour Member&#39;s Impetuosity Resented.&#34; I have read the extract carefully on more than one occasion, and I cannot find in it a reference to any Labour member. It would be assumed by any person who merely glanced at the headings - as many people do - that I had been impetuous on the day of the election, as I was the only Labour candidate for the Yarra electorate, and that some person had resented my action. The statement is signed by L. V. Biggs, of 233 Collinsstreet, Melbourne. It does not contain a single word about a Labour member having done anything. Towards its close it Bays - </para>

                        <para>One wholly gratuitous alteration of the Abbotsford roll nearly led to the loss of a lady&#39;s vote on the 31st May. The lady, <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Emily</inline> Grace Parker, of 393 Johnston-street, tells the story thus : - &#34; When I went to the polling booth and gave my name and address, I was informed that my address had been struck out, and alongside it, in the .:, A., of the roll, was written in red ink <inline font-style="italic">a.</inline> new address, which, I think, was 205 Nicholson-street. On my declaring that that address was wrong, and that I did not live in Nicholson -street, but here, I was refused the vote. Luckily, there happened to be in the booth at the time <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Sforcina,  a baker, who knew me. He courteously stepped forward and said I was stating what was a fact, and eventually I was permitted to vote.&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Parker</inline> is a well-known Liberal worker in Abbotsford. </para>

                    <para class="block">I do not speak of a man who is, or ever has been, connected with the Labour party; he was an opponent of mine at one time. I believe that he would give a fair deal to every elector going to a booth. I have every confidence in him, even though I think it is quite possible that if he had a chance he &#34;might not vote for me. I believe that he is sincere and honest, and would give the lady in question her vote. In this article headed &#34;Election Scandals,&#34; and pointing out in large headlines that &#34; a Labour member&#39;s impetuosity &#34; was resented, there is not one word as to what that action was, or who the Labour member was. When the newspapers adopt such tactics we have <inline font-style="italic">a&#62;</inline> right, as far as we are able, to protect ourselves against them in trying to wilfully mislead their readers regarding elections. Personally, I have no fault to find with the newspapers. I can deal with them on the platform. Like the honorable member for Echuca, I have always had the bitter opposition of the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> but, unlike him, I have also had the bitter opposition of the <inline font-style="italic">Argus.</inline> He has been fortunate enough to have one newspaper backing him up, and, as I have said on more than one occasion, where newspapers have the largest circulation they have the least influence. Every honorable member on the other side knows full well that if we had had not a half, but a fifth, of the newspapers supporting the Labour party and its aims, they would not be sitting opposite to-day with a majority of one; they would be on this side of the chamber. </para>

                            <para>- Elections are not swayed by the editorials, but by the reports of the speeches, the &#34; campaign notes,&#34; the &#34; points for electors,&#34; or the &#34; pith of politics,&#34; which appear from day to day. The average person takes no notice of leading articles. I do not believe that one out of every ten persons who take the newspapers ever reads the leading articles. </para>

If we were to believe the statements published in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> at the last election we should be greatly deceived. We were told, for instance, that at least half-a-dozen members, or more, from this State alone, who are now on the other side, were in favour of preferential voting. Have we heard a single word from them here in favour of that method ? </para>

I was not in a hurry to rise. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> was putting the question when I rose ; in fact, honorable members on the other side said that by rising I had saved the situation. During the last election we read in the press, that preferential voting was to be one of the big features of any amendment of the electoral law. On Friday last the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> in criticising this measure, said that there were some important points left out of it, and that one of them was the question of preferential voting, the question of majority rule; that is, that no person should be returned to the House unless he had the support of a majority of the electors voting at the election. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, and that is why I do not think there is so much necessity to alter the Act, as honorable members assert. Now that the Honorary Minister is here, may I suggest to him that he did not adopt the best method in introducing this measure. He thinks that what he does not know about the political game is really not worth knowing. But I might suggest, for his consideration, that the best way for him to get a Bill put through is not to trail his coat on the ground, because, as a rule, a man who looks for fight gets it. </para>

The honorable member for Ballarat, for instance, has asked for its production half-a-dozen times, and if that is all the Minister wants, I ask him now to produce it, or if he cares to place it on the table at once I shall do my best, even while I am on my feet, to see if I can find any tiling to justify the slanders which have been uttered since the general election. I understand that Ballarat is the  only  place where detectives have been employed in conducting an investigation. If the Minister has had such an investigation made at any other place I am not aware of it. </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps it would have been first laid on the table of the House. If any innocent persons have been slandered we have a right to the information contained in the report from Ballarat, or from any other electorate. If the Ministry are making radical alteratpins in the electoral methods because of the alleged irregularities at the last election, the reports ought to be produced here, and not kept in a pigeon-hole in the Department. The investigation was irudertaken, I presume, not for the information of the Department alone, but for the information of honorable members, too. </para>

                            <para>- Honorable members op? posite were too cunning to pick out any individuals. To-night the Treasurer said that according to a return there were 5,000 proved cases of duplicate voting. I assert that there has not been one proven case of a person having voted more than once on the 31st May, and I, challenge the Attorney- General to take action regarding any or all of the persons. </para>

                            <para>- Will the HonoraryMinister have a return prepared, or will he have the rolls checked - it could easily be done in a few hours at the Department. - to find out how many of these 5,000 persons have the same Christian name and the same surname as other persons whose names have not been struck off ? I have- gone through the whole of the forty-seven or forty-eight alleged duplications in my electorate, and I find that, in nearly all cases, they represent persons of the same names. </para>

This man stated that his father, who bore the same name, had left his home about an hour before in order to vote; and the officials told him that if he brought his father, and the latter was prepared to swear he had voted, it would be seen that a mistake had been made, and the vote of theson would be accepted. </para>

                            <para>- It was; and the man did bring his father along, and the vote was accepted. This, I maintain, is what occurred in the majority of the alleged cases of duplication. All members of Parliament have had, of course, something to do with elections, and they know that on the Saturday afternoon some tables are quite rushed, with eight or ten persons waiting, while other tables are almost deserted. This arises through no fault of those in charge, because the roll has to be divided according to the numbers; and the great outcry about duplication really has for its foundation the fact that honest mistakes have been made by the electoral officials. This afternoon, the Prime Minister quoted the lines from Shakspeare - </para>

                        <para>Makes ill deeds done ! and inferred that the knowledge gained at the last election would lead to much duplication on the next occasion . That is a wrong inference, however, so far as the people of Australia are concerned, because the trouble is to get people to vote at all, much less twice. We all know that practically the object of all our efforts during a campaign is to get people to go to the poll; and hence the great anxiety of candidates to rope in their friends who can lend motor cars. I wish I had a few friends with motor cars to lend. </para>

                            <para>- I never did. What I said was that it is a shame to walk to a polling booth on a wet day when you see a motor car running empty; and so it is. The electors could please themselves how they voted when they got to the booth. I trust that the important return asked for by the honorable member for West Sydney to-day will be laid on the table while this Bill is under discussion. </para>

                            <para>- After the elections, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl,</inline> who is the Vice-President of the Executive Council, speaking at the Fitzroy Town Hall, said that, on the day the writs were issued, there were 314,000 more names on the rolls than there were persons entitled to vote. I am quoting from a report in the <inline font-style="italic">Age.,</inline> which, I presume, as a supporter of the Government, can be relied on not to misreport a Minister. It is true that for a number of years the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> was known as Ananias, after a well-known biblical character, who met his death in a way that I am sure we are not at all anxious to follow. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> went on to say that 60,000 more people voted in Sydney than were eligible. I have looked up the returns for New South Wales, and I find that the percentage which voted was 69.28 per cent., so that if there were 60,000 votes in excess very few must have voted in the country. I should say that the number of persons voting in Sydney would be about 300,000, and if 60,000 voted who had no right to, we must take it, on <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> McColl&#39;s  figures, that over 100 per cent, of the votes were recorded. </para>

We cannot take the numbers on the rolls for our present purpose, because the rolls contain the names of persons who have been transferred to other electorates. In the Yarra electorate, about 2,000 names were struck out as being those of persons who had gone to other electorates or other subdivisions of the same electorate. The certified roll, after all, is the only correct one. The newspapers, in order to make political capital, took the gross figures as to the numbers on the rolls for 1912, and the number of additions made, but not the number who had been transferred. The following table, supplied by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oldham,</inline> shows the number of electors on the certified lists for each State on 31st May, 1913, the number to whom ballot-papers were issued, and the percentage of electors to whom they were issued - </para>

                        statement is perfectly correct. Every Saturday, practically the whole of the steam-boats of Australia leave the ports of our capital cities, and generally with a full list of passengers, so that the 40,000 mentioned by
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oldham</inline>

                        is well within the mark. Many people, from time to time, take a trip to England, the East, or New Zealand. Directly they leave our shores, they are struck off
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs&#39;</inline>
                        records, but their names are not removed from the rolls, because, although they may be temporarily absent from the Commonwealth, they are, in reality, still residents of Australia. There has not been any great discrepancy between the number of persons on the rolls and the number of adults in Australia, so that I think we should be acting unwisely in adopting the provision in this regard&#39; which the Minister has put before us.

This incorrect statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl,</inline> a responsible member of the present Ministry, was published in the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> and scattered broadcast. When he spoke of 60,000 more people voting in Sydney, he obviously meant to refer to New South Wales. That is yet another mistake. I come now to the proposal that the electoral boundaries shall be determined by a Justice of the High Court or of the Supreme Court of a State. What special qualifications has a High Court or a Supreme Court Judge for such work? </para>

                            <para>- Not at all. We stood to our convictions. Even if one or two members of our Ministry were absent when a division took place, surely their position was better than that of the members of the Fusion &#39; Government, who voted against a scheme the adoption of which was moved by one of their colleagues - the Minister of Home Affairs of that day. If this work is to be carried out by a High Court or a Supreme Court Judge, we shall have an official distribution only. A Justice of the High Court will not make any investigation. Members of the High Court Bench have not so much time on their hands that they can deal with the work of redistributing the States into electoral divisions as it should be dealt with. That being so, it will be left to the officials to make the distributions, and we shall have going on in Australia that which is occurring in South Australia at present under a Liberal Administration, which is cutting up the electorates to suit itself. We shall have what is going on in Victoria at present, where scheme after scheme, as some honorable members know, has been arranged. </para>

Whilst I think it is better that this matter should be dealt with by an outside authority rather than by Parliament itself, I do not think that a Justice of the High Court or of the Supreme Court of a State is the best man to determine a distribution. My time has almost expired, and therefore I shall reserve for Committee the comments which I have to offer with regard to the questions of voting by post, and the absent voting provisions of this measure. </para>

                        <para>.- The Ministry have made a mistake in the title of this Bill, which, to be brought into consonance with their obvious desire, should be intituled, &#34;A Bill for an Act to put difficulties in the way of the electors exercising the franchise.&#34; The manner in which the Bill was introduced also indicates very clearly what is in the minds of the Prime Minister and the Assistant Minister ofHome Affairs. It is well expressed in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> - that great Liberal and Democratic organ, which now supports the Honorary Minister, and which, in its leading article this morning, said - </para>

                    <para class="block">That exactly expresses the attitude of the Minister. Never in the history of this Parliament have we had such a miserable exhibition on the part of a Minister introducing a Bill as that which we witnessed last night. The speech by the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs was carefully prepared, and he had at hand quotations to be used whenever an opening offered to abuse the other side.  There  was very little explanation, and practically no reason given for the proposed Amendment. </para>

                            <para>- The <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> has admirably expressed the attitude of Ministers and the lack of information that ought to have been furnished. The major part of the Bill seems to consist of suggestions made by the Electoral Office. One of the extraordinary proposals made by the officials is the alteration of the polling day from Saturday. The only reason given by the Minister for the change was that the Departmental officers found Saturday inconvenient for them. No consideration is shown for the electors. The convenience of the officials is to be the principal matter consulted. </para>

                            <para>- I am not desirous of following the lead of the Minister by being careless about my statements. I am aware that he also gave as a reason the difficulty of taking care of the ballotboxes. But we have had experience under the present Act of an election held on Saturday, and of having to wait till Monday before the decision was known. The reason given is not a sufficient one. What the Minister has overlooked is the convenience of the electors. As a country representative, I am of opinion that Saturday is the most convenient day for most people, and especially for farmers. But the interests of the farmers are not to be considered by this Government. </para>

                            <para>- We might have expected such a Bill as this to emanate from the Ministerial party. In every country it has been discovered that the privileged classes pretend to give the people what they ask for, but do not in reality give it to them. The government of nations in the past has been effected by force, and  foolery.  We have pretty well got beyond the age of force, but we are not yet beyond the age of foolery. This method of dealing with the franchise is only fooling the people. The Government pretend that they are going to give the sick and those who cannot go to the poll an opportunity to vote, but at the same time they are proposing, in other clauses of the Bill, to make the conditions such that thousands of electors will be disfranchised. It is characteristic of Conservatives to deny to the masses the right to a say in the government of the country. Honorable members opposite take the high and mighty position that they know best what is good for the people. They pose as if they were benevolent despots, who alone can be safely intrusted with the management of the affairs of the country. It is evident, however, that the Bill is not a sincere attempt to improve the electoral law, but has been introduced merely to create a row. That could not be hidden by the Honorary Minister last night. But he need not have been so insulting in his statements, because the Government party would have had trouble enough had they merely tried to steal the franchise from some of the people, instead of stirring up temper as well. The Honorary Minister, being driven into a corner in regard to some remarks that he had made about the purity of elections, made the insinuation, and indeed said in so many words, that criminals would naturally vote for Labour candidates as being more likely than others to look after their interests. Those who sit on this side of the chamber are as honest and respectable as honorable members opposite, and no one occupying the position of a Minister of the Crown should make such statements. Had the Bill been a sincere attempt to improve the electoral law, we should have had a calm statement of its provisions from the Minister. Electoral reform is not a party matter; it concerns the people at large. But the Labour party has been fighting specially to widen the franchise, and to purify electoral methods. The Prime Minister, who was associated for a number of years with a gentleman who holds the honorable position of High Commissioner, knows that he spoke highly of the Labour party in this connexion. Old politicians will remember the days of plural voting. I think that at one time a man in Queensland possessed thirty-two votes for the Parliament of that State. Care was taken that these votes should be exercised. I took part in a fight in Victoria many years ago - the honorable member for Kooyong will remember the time - when we were protesting against plural voting and the use of the ratepayers&#39; roll. A great deal of personation took place then, and many crooked things were done in the &#34; good old days,&#34; as they are called by some. I know of a case in which a man voted eight times in the same polling booth, and boasted of having done it. Nowadays, the conduct of elections is so pure that a band of detectives under a budding Sherlock Holmes has been un- able to find anything questionable in regard to the last election to put before this House. Elections have been purified by the appearance of a new element fighting for the full adult suffrage. It has been admitted, even by our opponents, that the advent of the Labour party into politics has purified public life. Adult suffrage is the only safe base on which to&#62; rest representative government. </para>

But how are we to secure the rule of the nation if we do not give every adult in it an opportunity to exercise the franchise ? To do that effectively we must recollect the situation in which many electors are placed. That is just where this Bill fails. Under it, every elector cannot exercise a vote. We are all in favour of providing voting facilities in the case of the sick and infirm, but we must safeguard any system of that kind against abuse. </para>

                            <para>- The Prime Minister knows very well that the complaints which have been made regarding electoral irregularities are due to the tremendous increase that has taken place in the number of names upon our electoral rolls. He knows that under the existing Act a larger percentage of votes was registered at the last elections than had ever been registered previously. What is the use of telling the country that we reduced the facilities for voting simply because we abolished the postal vote? Under the old administration the 80,000 voters in New South Wales, of whom we have heard so much lately, would not have been on the rolls at all. If the Government will put forward a scheme which will give to the sick and infirm a vote, and safeguard it against abuse, we are ready to assist them to pass it. But it is ridiculous to say that a person who is 5 miles distant from a polling booth is unable to record his vote. I know of one case in which a man walked 82 miles to register his vote. I have known women to walk 16 miles in order to exercise their franchise. The proposal embodied in this Bill is an impracticable one, and one which would never have been put forward by anybody who understands the position in which the mass of the voters are placed. In the first place it provides that an elector who desires to vote by post shall make application for a certificate &#34;in the prescribed form.&#34; That form has to be witnessed by certain persons. There are thousands of electors in this country so situated that they cannot find the necessary witnesses. In Western Australia, and elsewhere, there are thousands of electors who cannot find the only persons who are qualified to act as witnesses. Then under the Bill these electors are required to obtain the witnesses twice - first in connexion with the prescribed form, and then to witness their signatures. I come now to the provision in respect of absent voters. The absent voter is not to be permitted to vote at the nearest polling booth after being required to answer questions, make a declaration, and sign his name. He, too, must apply for a certificate. Of what value will that certificate be ? How can the Returning Officer know whether the applicant is the man whose name appears upon the roll? This provision will encourage almost any kind of crooked work. We have heard a good deal about criminals voting at elections. But the professional criminal is too busy dodging the police to vote at all. He does not wish anybody to know his address. What nonsense, it is for the Honorary Minister to talk in the way that he did! It is obvious that he is only endeavouring to fool the people. Suppose that an elector applies for a certificate to enable him to record his vote as an absent voter. He must visit a polling booth and sign the butt of his ballot-paper. What for? In order, so we are informed, that the Electoral Department may have a check upon him. But suppose that he is not the person whom he professes to be, of what use will be this alleged check ? It is true that by a comparison with the signature obtained under the card system the Department can ascertain whether the signature on the ballot-paper is a genuine one. But of what value will that information be ? It will be absolutely valueless. The difficulties which the Bill will put in the way of absent voters will disfranchise thousands of electors. Honorable members behind the Government may not be aware of this, but if they will do a little thinking for themselves they will discover it. Now, if there is one thing which a man who does heavy manual work dislikes, it is writing letters. An immense number of persons do not take as much interest in elections as they ought to, and it is only when they are stirred up that they will exercise the franchise. Yet this Bill .requires them to apply for absent voters&#39; certificates on a prescribed form, and will compel them to hunt round for witnesses. This they will not do, and the Government know it. Ministers do not want them to do it, because they know that the votes of this class will not go their way. The Government think they will score by making it appear that we are opposed to the postal vote. We are, and the evidence against it is sufficiently strong. I would like to call attention to another of the peculiar acts of the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs. He pretended to supply us with a list of the names of those who have been pro ceeded against for breaches of the law in connexion with postal voting. We have always been challenged that we have not produced any evidence of the abuse of that system. Now the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs has discovered that action was taken. </para>

                            <para>- This return deals with one election and one referendum, and in connexion with the former seven cases are mentioned. My objection is to the unfairness of this proposal. The Minister made a great fuss in regard to justices of the peace. What he said about them was inaccurate. He was responsible for leaving out the names I have quoted. The honorable member for Darwin, for instance, was never sworn in, and therefore, he was not qualified to act as a justice of the peace. I see nothing at all in the statement of the Minister, but I do complain of his unfairness. As regards the postal vote, there would be some sense in the new proposal if it provided for only the sick and the infirm; but it proposes to give the privilege to other persons. I intend to quote two or three statements which were made in Queensland about the operation of the postal vote. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kidston,</inline> who was Premier, said - </para>

I consider that it is the duty of this House to wipe out the postal vote root and branch, and wipe it out at once. </para>

                    <para class="block">These opinions emanated from impartial <inline font-style="italic">men</inline> - not only from politicians, but from persons who had dealt with the conduct of elections - and on those opinions a Queensland Liberal Government wiped out the postal vote, and I presume did not retain any provision for the sick and the infirm simply because of the inherent difficulty. Had the Commonwealth Government brought down a provision to meet such cases it would have received fair consideration, but to say that persons other than the sick and the infirm are disfranchised is ridiculous. There is a number of other points on which one must dwell a little further. I have said that the nature of men&#39;s work will prevent them from exercising the franchise. The difficulty of getting a witness, for instance, is a great handicap. </para>

                            <para>- lb goes without saying that the postal vote was abused on that occasion. The Minister in charge of this Bill claims that the system is now safeguarded by providing severe penalties. In the other case penalties were provided, and offenders punished. Twenty-five pounds is a high penalty for a person to pay ; but it is necessary first to catch an offender. I venture to think that the imposition of the penalty will not insure the system being carried out honestly, because of the opportunity which will be afforded for the exercise of influence. In the back country there will be no person at hand who is qualified to act as a witness. Under the Electoral Act it is a criminal offence on the part of any employer to interfere so as to prevent an elector from exercising the franchise. But the postal voting system will leave a loophole to an employer to prevent an employe from exercising the franchise, because it will permit him to say, &#34; Now, you have no occasion to leave your work in order to go to a polling place some distance away. Why not take out a postal ballot-paper?&#34; The squatter, being a justice of the peace, will be the only person on the station who is qualified to be a witness, and he will say to his station employes, and the rest of them, &#34; I cannot spare you on polling day, because such and such work will have to be done. You have no occasion to go to a polling booth, because you can get a postal ballot-paper.&#34; We know how influence can be used on stations. That is an unfair position to put working men in, and it is only being done to carry out what has been referred to here before. </para>

                            <para>- It is not. I know what I am talking about. Employes have been threatened with the sack, and men have been sacked because they voted the wrong way to suit the &#34; boss.&#34; To give employers an opening to interfere is wrong. No interference with employes should be allowed. The prating of the Honorary Minister leads me to say that what we want is freedom to vote without interference, freedom from corruption, freedom from the exercise of influence. There never was any interference with the freedom of the press, because any newspapers could say what they liked. The statement about the press being gagged had no foundation, but I do not intend to dwell on that argument, and I do not know that it counts very much at all. The Labour party has won its battles in spite of the press. It will continue to win its battles. It is going to have its own press, and perhaps take possession of the old press in the course of a few years. As one who has been associated with very many members of the nomadic class, I am in a position to say that absent voting was the only system that ever met the situation of an immense number of the working classes. To introduce the drawbacks and the difficulties which are now proposed would be to disfranchise them effectively. The present Government came in for economic, honest, and effective administration, but in their first big Bill they propose to enormously add to the public expenditure. They propose to do about the most stupid thing which has ever been proposed in a Parliament when they propose to require voters to sign their names on election day. No doubt, every honorable member has noticed how timid nervous men and women are in a polling place. They are hardly capable of signing their names. They certainly cannot sign them in the same way as they do in their own home, simply because of their nervousness. Even with sympathetic Returning Officers, electors will continue to be affected by nervousness, and when they have signed their names what will be the good of the signatures. Why put a man to the trouble of getting an absent voter&#39;s certificate if he still must goto a polling booth; what is the gain ? The Minister has said that we shall have a check, and can find out how a vote is given, but that position will only arise if there is a recount or a case taken to the Court of Disputed Returns. In an average election, no appeal will be made. It is costly to fight an appeal. This proposal may suit honorable members on the other side, who are rolling in riches, but it will not suit honorable members on this side. The appeals will be few, and the result will be that we shall have unchecked corruption introduced into our elections. Suppose that an examination is made, you cannot bowl out the individual who committed the offence. Who is to swear to his identity? He has sported the name of somebody else, even if he has done it clumsily, but nobody will be able to say who he was or where he went. Boiled down, this is only a proposal to disfranchise electors. I expect nothing else from the Liberal party, having regard to the elements of which it is composed . I will point out one objection which, of course, will not influence honorable members opposite, for they care only to disfranchise people. In some parts, the mails are once a week; in other cases, once a fortnight, and in some cases once a month. To start with, an elector will not be able to find a witness. Even if a witness is found after a lot of trouble, there will be no time for the return of the papers before polling day. It is our duty as an Opposition to criticise, and to expose the fraud, fallacy, and hypocrisy of this Bill as an improvement of the electoral law. The increase in the staff suggested by the Minister will add enormously to the cost of the administration of the Electoral Act. If we had increased efficiency for the extra cost it might be worth while, because no one nan say that we have anything like sufficient polling booths now; but the proposal of the Government simply means additional cost with less efficiency and fewer votes recorded. Honorable members would be astonished if they  knew the  immense percentage of electors who change their abode every year, much less every three years. Those who have to travel in order to make their living do not know where they will be at election time; and the absent vote has been a great boon to them. </para>

                    <para>This House and the country are in an exceptionally unfortunate position in respect to this measure. The Honorary Minister, in introducing it, gave a most limited explanation of the provisions, and now wo find that any further explanation from the Ministerial benches is withheld. I am not an old parliamentarian, but I never remember, in any deliberative assembly, a measure of such importance being treated as the Government are treating this one tonight. New members opposite may be under the impression that a similar course of conduct wasfollowed by the late Government and their supporters. </para>

                            <para>- I hope that every member in the House is particularly jealous of that sacred thing which we call the secrecy of the ballot. Authorities bear me out when I say that this system of voting was first introduced in the State of Victoria in 1856, was adopted in England in 1S72, and in quite a number of the States of America as far back as 1888. I have to enter my protest against the absence of any provision in the Bill for the institution of the initiative and referenda, and I should like to know whether it is the intention of the Government this, session to introduce a measure to carry, those desirable reforms into effect. I see that by this Bill it is proposed to close the rolls at least a month earlier than was the  case prior to the last election. This, I understand, is owing to the fact that officials at the Electoral Office complain that, under the present arrangement, they have not time to purge the rolls. My own opinion is that we may pay too big a price for having the rolls closed a month earlier than hitherto. The Leader of the Opposition informed us this afternoon that, if this alteration be carried into effect, it will mean that 10,000 young people - this, I think, is a very conservative estimate - who will come of age in that month, will be deprived of the franchise. The Government boast that this measure will increase the facilities for voting, and yet, in order to strike off the names of the few people who may die or may move from a particular State or from the Commonwealth, all these young people are to be denied the right to record their first vote at the next election. In the event of a strong Government being returned to power, and remaining in office for the full term, those young men and women will have to wait three years and one month before they can exercise the franchise. That is a wholesale disfranchisement of a very important section of our population. If there is one section of the community which more than any other we should encourage to vote, it is our young people. As a Radical, I look to the young folk of this country to establish far and away better systems than we have been able to put into practice. Seeing the mistakes that we have made, they will be able to go on and on until they get as near as possible to perfection in respect of electoral matters and various reforms. If we agree that the rolls shall be closed not less than one month before the date of the issue of the writs, at least 10,000 persons coming of age in that month will be denied the right to vote, and will thus receive what is practically a snub at the very inception of their manhood and womanhood. </para>

                    <para>Mr.FENTON. - Time will not permit me to follow the honorable member along the by-paths into which he would lead me. Many of the proposals made in this Bill are very fantastic, and some are exceedingly silly. One that is both foolish and wrong is that which requires an elector to subscribe his signature on the block from which the ballot-paper is taken. We all know how polling booths in the more populous centres are overcrowded during certain periods of the day, although under the present system the electors have only to give their names and receive a ballot-paper. Very often there is much confusion, excitement, and turmoil in our polling booths in the carrying out of this simple process ; but the Government are now asking a body of intelligent men to agree to a very retrograde, step. Many old men and women are much troubled and excited when called upon to sign the electoral cards while in the midst of their own families. What will be their condition of mind when they are called upon in a crowded polling booth to write their names on the ballot-paper blocks? Does the honorable member for Franklin think that the signature of an elderly person, written under such conditions, would be at all similar to that written on the electoral card in his own home? </para>

I understand that the chief object of this proposal is to enable the identity of the voter to be established by comparing his signature on the ballot-paper block with that on the electoral card in the departmental cabinet. But we have all witnessed the condition of nervous excitement into which many old people get when signing their names, and I am sure that the signatures of old people on these blocks will not be much like those attached to the electoral cards. Many of us are such peculiar writers that a comparison of some of our signatures to different letters would lead some people to believe that they had not been written by the same hand. When I am away from home my wife has very great difficulty in deciphering what I write. </para>

                            <para>- I shall not insist upon its withdrawal, but I hope that this mild rebuke will be sufficient to keep the honorable member for Maranoa in his place. I take it that the meaning of the word &#34; wowser &#34; is &#34; hypocrite &#34; or &#34; Pharisee,&#34; and I certainly do not like such an epithet to be applied to me. </para>

                    <para>I take it thatthis Bill has been introduced, not to give every facility to the people to vote, but to try to frighten away from the polling places as many men &#34;and women as possible. Thousands ofpeople will refrain from going to a polling booth when they learn that they will have to sign their names there before they are allowed to vote. There are many who would sooner do a hard day&#39;s work than write a line. This is not only a retrograde, but an exceedingly harsh, proposal, and should not be pressed. </para>
                    <para>I am not going to give the Government the credit of having initiated some of the provisions of this Bill. To a large extent the occupants of the Treasury bench, if not the rank and file of their following, are under the control of the leagues outside. Honorable members may laugh, but I hope to be able to show that the Government are beholden to their electoral leagues - to leagues here in Melbourne - for many of the provisions of this Bill. Take that, for instance, to which I have just been alluding. I know that a report has been issued, either by the Liberal Union or the Liberal Speakers Union, in which many of these so-called reforms are outlined. In one report, covering a number of pages of foolscap, a suggestion in reference to the signing of the blocks of the ballot-papers is made. The recommendation did not go as far as the Ministry propose, but it was suggested that where a vote was disputed the person desiring to vote should sign the ballot-paper block. </para>

I believe I shall find, on comparingthis report with the Bill itself, that there is a wonderful similarity between the two. Instead of our politics being made in the Trades Hall, as used to be said, they are being manufactured in the rooms of theConstitutional party, the Women&#39;s National League, the Liberal party, or the People&#39;s party. </para>

                    <para>I come now to the postal voting provisions of this measure. The chief complaint levelled against postal voting is that it opens the door to fraud, and that frauds have been committed in connexion with it. I have said that if the postal vote could be hedged round with sufficient restrictions to prevent those who are inclined to manipulate it from doing so, we should be only too glad to give the privilege to every one who wished to vote in this way. The late Government tried to give the sick and infirm in our public hospitals an opportunity of voting. The Home Affairs Department communicated with the hospitals in every State, but with two exceptions the offer was declined. </para>

                            <para>- I am glad to hear that. That information places in a worse light what was done in the State of Victoria, at the instigation of the Premier, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt.</inline> He, as Treasurer, contributes the greater amount of the funds at the disposal of the hospitals, and he sent out a circular to all boards of management of hospitals over which he had any influence, telling them that they were not to allow their institutions to be used as polling booths on the 31st May. Consequently, if these sick persons were not allowed to exercise the franchise the blame does not rest with the late Government, but with the State Premier and those who sympathize with him. A great deal of objection has been raised by honorable members opposite to the criticism of the postal vote made by the Opposition. I have in my possession a report from members of the police force in respect to the worst case of abuse that came under the notice of the Home Affairs Department in Victoria. I refer to the prosecution of a justice of the peace named Lesser, at Coleraine. The case was heard at Hamilton, but the offence was committed at Coleraine. Constable Harrington, of Coleraine, who made the inquiries, reported - </para>

                        <para>With regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Louis</inline> Lesser, of Coleraine, illegally witnessing postal ballot applications, I beg to report as follows :  - &#34; On the 6th and 7th instant I made careful inquiries regarding this matter, and interviewed and obtained statements from all persons whose names appear in attached certificates. The first eleven applicants whose names appear in attached brief pre strong, healthy young women, all living from 300 yards to half a mile from the polling booth ; had no reason whatever for applying for certificates, and I have very little doubt they would have gone to the booth had not <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lesser</inline> taken them the application forms and asked them to vote by post. Most of them are poor people, and either tenants or are in debt to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lesser,</inline> who is a storekeeper at Coleraine, and also a money lender. All the persons interviewed gave their statements freely, and, I believe, if on oath, would say more. The statements of these eleven are exact copies of statements signed by them to me on the 6th and 7th instant. </para>

I am sure it is not the desire of the Postmaster-General that any members of the Public Service should suffer in this way, but I understand that funds are not available for the payment of the men. Surelv the Government have not yet been in power long enough to deplete the Treasury. I hope that the Minister will inquire into the matter early tomorrow, and instruct that the men be paid at once. </para>
