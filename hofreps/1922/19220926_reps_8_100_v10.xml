                        <para>- The telephone position generally is improving. Presuming the honorable member's question refers specifically to the Melbourne metropolitan area, the subscribers' services now outstanding are held up principally on account of lack of cables and telephone  switchboards. Large quantities of telephone cable are at present on order, . and  will be placed into service as the material comes to hand. With regard to switchboards, a new exchange is about to be opened at Collingwood ; tenders have been called for new. exchanges at Ascot and North Melbourne; and the Public Works Committee has under consideration a proposal to establish a new exchange at South. Melbourne. </para>

                    <para>I have no objection to the motion, provided we are given some reason for its submission. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> has failed to take the House into his confidence. As I said a week ago, and as I repeat now, if there is only the business' on the notice-paper to be considered, there is no occasion for us, at this time of the year, to meet on Wednesday morning.. Such a course is most unusual at this stage of the session. From time to time, towards the end of a session, the House has been called together on Tuesday, but never until approaching Christmas have  we been asked to meet on Wednesday morning. As a matter of fact, there is far less business on the notice-paper to-day than has 'been the case in previous years, and a glance at the measures shows very little to cause discussion. The "War Service Homes Bill is a small but very necessary measure. The Public Service Bill may take some time, but the Nationality Bill and the Trades Marks Bill are only small measures. The Jury Exemption Bill, the Service and Execution, of Process Bill, the New Guinea Bill, and other measures could go through at one sitting. </para>

                        <para>- We have between now and the middle of December at our disposal, if there is to be no election. Why does the Minister not take the House into his confidence and inform us whether there is to be an early election ? It is time we knew exactly what is taking place. We ought not to be kept in the dark. I say, without the slightest hesitation, that there will be an election not later than the 9th December, but we ought not to be left to guess about it, for we have a perfect right to be informed as to the intentions of the Government. Not only members of the House, but the public, should know if, and when, an election is to take place. Does the Government think that some advantage is to be gained by keeping such matters secret, and rushing the business through in two or three weeks? The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> refused to give us full information - he refused to give us any information - in regard to the amendments of the Constitution which are so necessary. Those amendments ought to be before the House this week, and be sent to the Senate, if an election is to take place on the 9th December, or otherwise there will not be time for the necessary interval of two months before their submission to the people. The Government have evidently made up their minds, and know exactly at what they are driving, and it is time that we, and the public also, knew. The party on this side wish to know whether these Constitutional proposals are to be gone on with, especially in view of the promise made by the Prime Minister at Bendigo, a promise which he has repeated in the House since. We are now asked to sit on Wednesday morning, although the business-paper, with the exception of the Budget debate, shows no more than a week's work; though, of course, other measures may be brought in. Next week we may get to know that there is to be an election, and there will not then be time to give the Budget the consideration which it deserves. If there is to be an early election, members will desire to get away to their constituencies. We ought to fee told at once whether there is to be an election on the 9 th December, and informed what business the Government propose to bring forward, and particularly whether it is intended to submit any amendments of the Constitution. The Government, if I may so put it, is treating  us in a discourteous way. We are just near the end of September, and, under ordinary circumstances, there would be still three months of the session to go. There is not enough business on the paper to keep us going one month, and yet we are asked to meet on Wednesday morning this week, and probably will be asked to sit on Monday next week. It is only fair that we should know the reasons which actuate the Government. I have no objection to an election; indeed, I should like an early election, but I desire the Constitutional amendments to be submitted to the people at the same time. I am prepared to sit on Thursday morning, and every other morning, in order to deal with those amendments, for they are truly a matter of urgency. Honorable members may ask as many questions as they like; but they can get no satisfaction from the Government in this respect. I would have no abjection to the House meeting on Wednesday morning if it could be shown that there was need, and if we knew that the Government intended to go to the country at an early date. Honorable members should not be obliged to question Ministers as to what is going to happen. The Government should indicate straight out what they propose to do.. They should take honorable members into their  confidence as to whether the Constitutional amendments are to be considered or not. If we knew all these things we would know where we stood, and how to act. </para>

                    <para>. The business-paper does not indicate any necessity for the House to meet on Wednesday mornings at 11 o'clock. Unless the Government know considerably more than honorable members, there is no particular reason why we should sit tomorrow morning. I am prepared to concede a certain amount of prescience to the Government in connexion with the forthcoming election ; but not otherwise. It would appear that the Government are exhibiting indecent haste. Honorable members would have no objection to Wednesday morning sittings if we were going to transact genuine business for- the community; but so far as we can judge there is no urgency. If Parliament is to run its usual course there should be ample time for the consideration of all the measures on the business-paper. We members of the Country party are quite prepared to face our constituents, but have no desire to do that before we have completed the business which we were sent here to do, as far as the Government will allow us to do it. ThisHouse has become accustomed to being treated as though it did not count. This motion is only another instance of the treatment that has been meted out to honorable members of late. It is only fair that the Government should give some indication of their intention. The Royal Agricultural Show now being held in Melbourne is of such importance that honorable members should have time to visit it - they can well stand some education along the lines of primary production. It would be very much better if honorable members had more time to seriously and thoroughly consider the measures on the business-paper. Before we finish I intend to bring- some proposals before the House in connexion with one particular Bill. It seems, however, that the Government are determined to rush business, so that honorable members will have very little chance of dealing properly with any of the measures, including the Superannuation Bill, that are set down for consideration. We would have no objection to meeting on Wednesday morning if the purpose was to look after the interests of the community. If the Government would only give some explanation as to why it is necessary we should meet on Wednesday morning, we would be satisfied. It will not be outside the merest statement of fact to say, of the Superannuation Bill, that not half-a-dozen members of this House can state definitely where that measure is going to lead us; but, like everything else, it is to be rushed through. The Government simply, come along and say," in effect, that they are going to meet early, apply the guillotine, and destroy all opportunity which should be given to honorable members to safeguard the interests of the community. </para>

                <para>Mr.BRENNAN (Batman) [8.87].- I am disappointed at the action of the Government, and I feel that, on a vital question, I could almost be persuaded to vote against them, although, as every one knows, in the past I have given them a cordial, if somewhat discriminating, support, on the well-known principle that by sparing the rod you are likely to spoil the child. I was particularly disappointed with the answer which the Acting Leader of . the House <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> gave to my question as to the facilities to be given to honorable members to visit the Agricultural Show now being held in this city. It ill-becomes the honorable member for Richmond, and a Minister who is supposed to be the patron and protector of the primary producing industry, thus to contemptuously disregard this great agricultural achievement.  His  attitude, I fear, is likely to create for him a bad odour in his own electorate. I remind him, as a friend and a brother, that the Country party is making a " dead set " at him in New South Wales. With this introduction,I suggest to the Minister, in association with my Leader, <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton),</inline> that the House should be treated with a greater measure of respect than we have received from the hands of the Minister in moving this motion. If the Government desire to complete the session by a succession of applications of the " gag," of course, it is within their power to do so. But if they wish honorable members to have sufficient time to do the work we were sent here to do, then I suggest they should conduct the business of the House in a reasonable and orderly manner, and not, on the one hand, interfere with the arrangements that honorable members may have made by making changes from day to day in the hours of sitting, and on the other send candidates into the constituencies - and especially my own - in order to defeat them while they stand guard in this House to oppose the application of the "gag." This aspect of the case, I feel sure, appeals to honorable members. I do not propose to submit with perfect docility to this proposal to meet on Wednesday morning. I am not clear whether the Government mean to sit every Wednesday morning, or if this motion  relates  only to to-morrow morning. </para>

                    <para>- The honorable member for South Sydney has summed up in a few words what I have been endeavouring to say in a number of words. Therefore, little remains for me to say, but I must add that, although it is not generally believed that we are a hard-worked body of men, if we are to meet on Wednesday morning it will be impossible for honorable members to attend to their routine work satisfactorily. I protest against the habit that has grown up in this Parliament of rushing most important business at the end of the session. I am entirely at one with the honorable member for Robertson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fleming)</inline> in this matter. We never have a session without a bunch of important measures being hurried through at the very end, when honorable members cannot have an opportunity to digest all the Bills ; indeed, it is very doubtful if they have opportunity to even thoroughly read them. That is very unfair to the House and to the country. Enactments that are passed in a hurry during the last days of the session are of as much importance to the people as are those passed with due deliberation in the early days of the session. Indeed, they are usually more important, because a discriminating Ministry, such as that now in office, usually selects the last days of the session for the most important work, especially that class of work which is controversial, and would in the early days of the session meet with a great deal of opposition. The Minister, having received this kindly advice from me, he will, I hope, act upon it, and tell us when the election will be held, so that we may in a proper spirit of repentance order the remainder of our parliamentary lives and bend ourselves to the task that lies before us. </para>

                        <para>- And probably it was an affectation by the Leader of a party who does not desire to disclose his distaste of the" prospect of an early appeal to the country. But, generally speaking, every  word which the honorable gentleman urged is worthy of the consideration of the Leader of the House. Having already in the middle of September agreed to an additional sitting day, we would not be justified in ordinary circumstances in superimposing morning sessions on  three of the four sitting days. If there is ground for urgency which demands the taking of this exceptional course three months before the session usually closes, the House generally should know it. I do not mean that the House should know the date of the election. The fixing of that is entirely the  prerogative of the Governor-General, acting on the advice of his Ministers, but when we are asked to extend the sitting days in these exceptional circumstances - exceptional, at any rate, so far as the last eight or nine years are concerned we should know what it is for, and approximately the programme which Parliament will be expected to deal with before it rises. If, for example, the Government declared their desire that we should leave these premises within a month, and that we should in the meantime pass the business already on the notice-paper and some other important measures to which allusion has been made, or notice of which has been given, the House would be better equipped to decide whether or not it should pass this motion. I do not, and never did, believe in the adoption of secretive tactics by a Government in connexion with, an election. They do not win, they do not aid the Government or the House, and they have little or no value as a party move. Therefore, if the Minister in charge of the House feels embarrassed by the appeal of the Leader of the Opposition to indicate at this stage the pro- gramme we are expected to deal with, the House is entitled to have that information as soon as the Prime Minister returns. I think the Opposition has been more patient than most Oppositions have been in matters of this kind. The Country party, so far as I have been able to judge, has not urged anything, as it has a perfect right to do, as a separate entity in this House, to secure a declaration of the Government's intentions, but both parties, as well as individual members of the House, are entitled to know as early as possible the programme we have to discharge, the reasons for increasing the sessional days and hours, and generally how long the House is expected to sit. </para>

                        <para>- Probably I shall not vote for many of the measures which the Government will bring down. But I shall certainly do my best to improve them, and, if necessary, to reject them. However, I do think that out of consideration for the producing interests of Victoria, and Australia generally, the House might have adjourned over part of 'Thursday in order to enable honorable members, especially those from other States, to see the magnificent Agricultural Show. I hope that even at this late hour the Minister in charge of the House will consider the advisability of asking the House to meet at 7 p.m. instead of 2.30p.m. on Thursday, so that honorable members may make themselves acquainted with the very fine display of agricultural products which is to be seen at Flemington. It seems quits impossible to discuss a question of this kind without introducing King Charles' head - the date of the election. </para>

Everybody clamours for an election at the earliest possible date, except myself and perhaps one other. I know that my words find an echo in the bosom of my esteemed friend the honorable member for Barrier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Considine),</inline> who is in a position somewhat similar to my own. I am one of those members whose seat has been taken from him; I am to be torn reluctant from the arms of the most intelligent, brightest, and fairest electors the world has ever known. </para>

                    <para>. - I cannot say that I am very greatly impressed by the Government's display of consideration for the rural community. First of all, they threaten to hold the election oh the 9th December, when harvesting operations will be in full swing, and in the second place they are not disposed to give honorable members half a day off to enable them to attend the Melbourne Show, one of the finest expositions in the southern hemisphere. I support the plea urged that the Ministry should at least postpone the meeting of the House on Thursday until 7 p.m. There would be little actual loss of time by that arrangement. All honorable members, particularly those on the Ministerial side, realize the necessity for education on rural matters. The Show is held at a choice spot, in a choice electorate, and I desire the members of the House to see the display. I can assure the Ministry that nothing would be lost by submitting a motion to-morrow night that the House adjourn until 7 p.m. on Thursday. </para>

                <para>As to the proposition now before the House, how is all; the business to be disposed of, even if such a motion is carried ? As the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> has stated, the majority of the matters on the notice-paper could be disposed of in a very short space of time ; but, in addition, there is a sheaf of business to be dealt with before the session closes. Practically the whole of the Budget debate has yet to engage our attention. If there is one item more than another on which the House should apply itself with, industry and intelligence, it is on the financial statement of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce).</inline> Yet this subject, apparently, is to be left until the eleventh hour, when the Budget will be forced through, Department by Department, by use of the guillotine. If the Government indulge in tactics of that nature, they will brand themselves before the electors as a Ministry and a party who are not prepared to give serious consideration to the great financial problems that confront us. It is all very well to say, " We shall remit these questions to the electors." The Treasurer has presented a most important statement, and it should be discussed in all aspects. In my opinion the Budget contains many items that ought not to be in it, and there are many matters missing from it that ought to be included. The Ministry would do well to give ample opportunity to the House to discuss it in detail. I feel disposed to vote against the present motion-, and I hope that honorable members on the Ministerial side will take the same view. To simply blindly vote with the Government' would be supporting a policy of " hurry up " and " hush up." I oppose the motion. </para>

                    <para>.- There is one thing for which we can admire the Government, and that is the consistency of- their policy. ' The honorable member for South Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Riley)</inline> stated, by interjection, that the Government had increased honorable members' hours and reduced their wages. I suppose that, for the same reason that actuated the Government in bringing about a reduction in honorable members' salaries, they now propose to increase their hours of labour. I am not personally favorable to the suggestion to adjourn the House to enable honorable members to attend the Agricultural Show, because there is ample opportunity for any member, who wishes, to visit it, just as members can absent themselves from the House on other occasions. If they wish to go to the Show it is their own affair, and there is no reason why the business of the country should be hung up. If I desire to see the Show I can go to it, and do the same as many honorable members do - arrange for a pair in my absence. I do not see why the importance of the fixture from an agricultural point of view should weigh with honorable members in the matter of the adjournment of the House. The necessity for increasing the hours of labour in Parliament does not seem to be very apparent. </para>

                <para>As has been stated by previous, speakers, the date of the election is wrapt in mystery. Various newspapers have essayed to fix the probable time. Some say it will be held on the 9th December, and others predict the 16th December. We are told, also, that the election may possibly be held on the 25th November. The honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> stated that it was for the Governor-General, on the advice of his Ministers, to fix the date, and the honorable member expressed the opinion that it was not desirable to acquaint honorable members with the date. I believe that the people most concerned ought to be informed on the point, and no body of men can be more concerned, with the exception of the electors, than honorable members themselves. I fail to see what the Government have to gain, or what possible party advantage there is, in adopting this policy of concealment. The Government appear to have developed the habit of keeping interesting inform-  lion secret. If the election is to take place in December, it is possible that the Ministry are anxious to rush through the legislation in hand in order to reach the recess. There has been no official statement by the Ministry as to when the election is to take place. The only official announcement made so far is that it is to be held as early as possible. It may be that the Government, taking advantage of the fact that honorable members are anxious to return to their electorates, thinking that the people are to be consulted speedily, intend with the help of the guillotine to put their programme through in a thin House. But even then there is no guarantee that an election will take place immediately after the House adjourns. </para>

                        <para>- I am not doing so. I am merely crediting the Government with being more reasonable than I thought they were. One honorable member has suggested that the consideration of the Budget is to be left until the closing hours of the session, when experience shows that the attendance of honorable members is very poor; and when the Government get the Appropriation Bill through there will be no necessity for an election before this Parliament runs its full time. That may be the policy of the Government, or the newspapers may be correct in their surmise that an early election is to be held, but in any case it is quite evident that there is no need at the present time for an increase in the sitting hours. The Government have given no indication of their intentions other than what we find on the business-paper to-day. As they have brought forward no reason for prolonging the hours of sitting by meeting at 11 o'clock in the morning, I shall vote against the proposal. </para>

                    <para>.- The Leader of the Opposition and other honorable members who have spoken against the Government's proposal have based their calculations on the business as it appears on the business-paper, but have lost sight of quite a number of pronouncements made by the Prime Minister from time to time as to measures the Government intended to submit for the consideration of Parliament. If honorable members will turn their minds back for a moment to the Financial Statement made by the Treasurer, they will remember that mention was made of a long list of Bills, which, with the exception of two quite insignificant ones, have not yet been dealt with, and which it will take a considerable time to dispose of. The Income Tax Assessment Bill and the measure for dealing with the Commonwealth Government Line of Steamers are two which will take a good deal of discussion, and that very unpleasant measure relating to the remuneration received by honorable members will also need consideration. There is a notice on the business-paper dealing with a Bill for the unification of the railway gauges which is likely to cause a considerable amount of debate. Each of these measures I have mentioned will occupy a considerable time if it is to be dealt with in detail. There is also the Defence Bill, upon which the Senate spent five or six weeks. It is a lengthy measure, containing a great number of details, and if it is proceeded with will involve a great deal of debate. If all these measures are to be cleared up in the ordinary course before the House rises much time will be taken up in dealing with them. </para>

                <para>Honorable members have suggested that further time should be given on Thursday, so that they may have the opportunity of visiting the Victorian Royal Agricultural Show. I am quite aware that the exhibition at the showgrounds is a valuable one, and I dare say that many honorable members visiting it would learn a great deal more than they know at present. All I can say in regard to the point is that the matter will be given consideration. We might meet on Thursday at a later hour. </para>
                <para>Before the Government ask for any further time to be given this session other than that which is referred to in the motion, I trust it will be possible for us to give honorable members further information as to the actual details of the business the Government propose to have considered before the House is asked to rise. At any rate, I can promise on behalf of myself and the Prime Minister that if the motion submitted to-day is carried, before any similar motion is discussed asking for further extended sitting hours, the Prime Minister will announce exactly what business it is proposed to complete before the House rises. </para>

                    <para>,- The more one looks into this clause the more is one impressed with the suggestion of the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> that the Bill should be put into the hands of a Committee for close examination. If honorable members were now being called upon to amend the Income Tax Act. for example, their actions would not be regarded as final; that is to say, the incoming Parliament, or any other, which may follow, would be able to amend our present legislative, work. With respect to the Superannuation Ball, however, when it shall have been put into operation it will be like the marriage bond, an established fact, for good and all. The measure is being dealt with precipitately. This Parliament is a Federal one; we should legislate Federally. There are many persons who will be called upon to contribute- according to the terms of clause 12 for whom contributions should be made. The people of Australia are: seeking for some system, of national insurance under which contributions shall be made both by employees and employers. I have received a communication from the Australian Natives Association, in Western. Australia, urging the institution of a national insurance scheme. </para>

                <para class="block">This is one of those provisions which, if it is agreed to, will have the effect of increasing the amount involved by the Bill to a sum over and above that contained in the original Appropriation message. However, it will not increase the estimated amount which I put before honorable members when presenting the report of the actuaries. ' In the original draft of the Bill, as placed before the actuaries, there appeared a clause which proposed to give greater privileges to employees in respect of taking up additional units. The sum thus involved was included in the estimates of the actuaries. I have now been advised that my proposal will not increase the total. The actuaries were unable to provide me with the specific sum; but it was undoubtedly allowed for in the general estimate. The provision of the new sub-clause is intended to meet the case of employees in the lower ranks of the Service. The Bill, as originally drafted, placed the pension rate for these at about £78 per annum - a sum which, on th© face of it, would be only about equivalent to the receipt of old-age pensions by husband and wife. However, there is now offered this opportunity to secure a higher pension, in addition to which there are the rights of pension in cases of invalidity. If an employee who has been the prescribed period in the Service takes advantage of the new subclause, and becomes invalided shortly after making his first payment, he will receive a pension during the whole period of invalidity. Then there are the further privileges to be bestowed upon the widow and children in the case of his death. </para>

                    <para>.- I am hot quite satisfied with the pro visions of clause 13. Upon the second reading I pointed out that this measure might bear harshly on a great body of those employed in the Public Service. Perhaps, half the total of our public servants have no hope of ever rising beyond the £208 stage. Their opportunities of promotion from the General to the Clerical Division are remote, quite apart from their ability or otherwise tei pass the necessary examination. The trouble is that there are not sufficient openings in the higher division, and the position has become even more acute since the war. Only a few months ago about 400 returned soldiers passed their examination for entrance to the Clerical Division. Two hundred have already been appointed, but if the other 200 are not placed within six months or so, they will not be eligible, as the regulations provide that a person who has passed an examination qualifying him for entry into the Public Service must be appointed within a certain period after passing an examination. There are so many returned soldiers awaiting appointment that men already in the Service have little hope of entering the Clerical Division, no matter how qualified they may be, because there will be many returned soldiers who, under the present policy of the Government, will have preference. These men must be first absorbed, which means that the general body of applicants will not have any opportunity. If that is so, and we provide that public servants must contribute from <inline font-style="italic">1\</inline> to 4 units, some in the Service whose salaries do not exceed £208 per annum will take up four units, which is the maximum, and will receive £104 per annum as a pension on retiring. It will mean that they will have to contribute approximately £7 or £8 per annum from, the time they enter the Service until they reach sixty-five years of age, which will represent a fairly substantial sum. When such officers retire, either in consequence of having reached the age limit or through any other cause, they will get only £104 per annum, whereas if they did not contribute to the Superannuation Fund at all, when they reached the age of sixty-five years, if married men, they would be entitled to the old-age pension, and their wives would also be entitled to a pension, which would amount in all to £78 per annum. Should Labour be returned to power after the next elections, the pension rate will be increased to 20s. per week; the man and his wife would then receive £104 per annum. It will be seen, therefore, that although a public servant contributes from £7 to £8 per annum in order to obtain the benefits outlined in this Bill, he may not be any better off at the expiration of forty or  forty-five years if payments have been made from when he was a youth than the ordinary citizen who makes no provision at all. </para>

                        <para>- I hope so, and that is a point which I intend bringing before the electors during the forthcoming campaign. We have, however, to consider the position that confronts us to-day. and realize the benefits public servants are to derive under this Bill. If, after contributing payments for forty or forty-five years, a public servant will not be any better off than if he had not contributed anything, the measure is unjust and we cannot expect public servants, particularly those in the lower grades, to accept this proposal without protest. </para>

I have already shown that a public servant who does not contribute anything at all would receive an old-age pension which would be worth £39 per annum when he reached sixty-five, and that a similar amount would be payable to his wife without making any contributions at all. </para>

                    <para>.- The effect of the amendment would be to destroy the whole basis of the Bill. The measure contemplates the compulsory contribution of all permanent employees of the Service; its essence is compulsion. If the  scheme were a voluntary one, many of those who are healthy and strong would exercise the option which the honorable member wishes to give, by dissociating themselves from it, and chiefly the sickly and weak would come under it. If you make the entry or withdrawal of contributors voluntary, you load the scheme with bad lives. The basis of the scheme has been fixed after an actuarial investigation which has taken into account the strength of the Service and the data available in mortality tables and the like. The larger . the area to which calculations thus made are applied, the nearer the average computation is approximated. </para>

                        <para>- When the scheme is in full working order, each man will carry his own burden. The benefits to be conferred are on 'the basis of contribution. No doubt these benefits are not what the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> would like them to be, but we must provide, not in accordance with our individual wishes, but in accordance with the actuarial computation of what we can give. It must not be forgotten that for every £1 contributed to the Superannuation Fund by a public servant the Commonwealth Government pays another £1. What chance would a man on a small salary have of buying from an insurance society benefits equivalent to those given by the Bill? A man whose age is 30, and whose salary is, say, £157, will be entitled to contribute for 4 units of pension, for which he will pay according to the prescribed scale, and the benefits to which his contributions will entitle him are these: First, a pension on attaining the age of 65 years, or, should he be called on to retire on reaching the age of 60 years, the actuarial benefits then accruing. Should he be retrenched, he will get certain allowances. Should he, having been in the Service for the prescribed time, die, even within twelve months of the payment of his first contribution, his wife will get a pension of £52 a year for life, or until she remarries, and for each child under the age of 16 years there will be an allowance of £13 a year until it reaches that age. The knowledge that, should anything happen to himself, his wife and children will be provided for, must be of great comfort to any man. At the present time an officer such as I am speaking of, who has been earning for a comparatively short* time only, has probably not yet begun to pay for a home, and certainly not saved very much money, so that in the event of his death his wife and children are without resources. </para>

It must be remembered, too, that the Bill does not interfere with any compensation that might otherwise come to a man who meets with an accident.

Clause 39 provides that if a contributor resigns, he shall be paid the amount of his actual contributions, but without interest.

                        <para>- An officer already in the Service who is thirty years of age is not compelled to contribute for more than two units of pension, but officers under the age of thirty years must increase their contributions with the increase of their salaries, according to a prescribed scale, and until reaching the age of forty years; after which they need not contribute for additional units. The objection to the proposal of the honorable member for Hunter is that if public servants were allowed to contribute to and withdraw from the Pensions Fund as they liked, the whole scheme would be destroyed. Naturally we wish to be as liberal as possible to the public servants who are receiving least pay, but we cannot go beyond what is actuarially sound. We are making an exemption in their favour, and, under the circumstances, I ask the honorable member not to press his amendment. </para>

                    <para>.- I have served my purpose in moving the amendment, namely, to place on record the fact that, in my opinion, this clause is not quite so lenient as it might be towards the lower-paid public servants. Prior to the statement by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom),</inline> I had thought that the amendment might interfere with the actuarial computation, and the Minister has now definitely shown us that it would so interfere, and' would mean the wrecking of the Bill. I have no desire to wreck the Bill; on the contrary, I am in favour of it, but I wish to improve it as much as possible in the interests of the lower-paid men. It is a pity that the measure as it stands will press hardly on those who are in receipt of small salaries, and who really have no hope of advancement. I know good men who have been in the Service for years, and who, so far as promotion is concerned, are practically at a dead-end. It was in the interests of those men that I submitted my amendment. However, in view of the statement by the Minister, I propose, with the concurrence . of the' Committee,' to withdraw the amendment. </para>

                        <para>- I suppose that the Victorian Minister, when introducing the State scheme, said it was actuarially sound, as no doubt the Minister in New South Wales did also. Members of Parliament then knew very little about the matter, and had to swallow what was told them, the public being left to pay afterwards. That is just what I think will happen with the scheme now under consideration. Various nations of the world have attempted similar schemes, Germany leading with one, not to deal with the public servants, or any particular class, but with the whole of the people. I have no objection to benefiting the Commonwealth public servants, but I desire an insurance and superannuation scheme for the whole people. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> described the public servants as " our servants " ; but we are the servants of the people, and trustees for the people, and we have no right to extend to the public servants greater privileges than are offered to other citizens. </para>

                        <para>- No doubt we shall arrive at a clause on which I can discuss that phase. The scheme, so far as concerns clauses 12 and 13, may be right or it may not. The Committee is not in a position to know, because there has not been sufficient investigation to enable us to form a sound opinion. Under the circumstances, the Minister ought not to unnecessarily hasten the passing of the measure, for we shall have a long time to repent if it proves to be wrong. Both the Government and the public servants admit that it will be necessary to appoint three gentlemen to inquire into the whole subject periodically in order to put the scheme on a. business footing. </para>

                    <para>.- No opposition to this measure will come from me. I can assure the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse)</inline> that the action of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid and his party, when in power in New South Wales, was most disastrous to the public servants and the superannuation scheme of that State. With that the honorable member agrees; but, unfortunately for him, if I may say so without being offensive, he is a misfit, so far as this measure is concerned. For twenty-five or thirty years the Labour party has been in favour of insurance under the Government. I am like Pussyfoot Johnson, the prohibitionist, who said that if we wish to deal with a great measure we must go to the " breeding ground "; and I regard the Bill before us as the " breeding ground " for the insurance of others besides public servants under Government supervision. I invite the honorable member for Swan to go on to the platform with me and seek to return a Government which will promote a scheme of general insurance. </para>

                <para>The clause before us is based on actuarial investigation, and the three actuaries appointed to make the investigation well know their business. Under, the circumstances, I pin my faith to them, for we are not competent to go into such calculations. I remember that once I undertook the job of finding a basis for superannuation and insurance in connexion with a friendly society, and after working on it for two years I found that the cost would be too great for any persons to contribute without some assistance. The late member for Maranoa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James Page),</inline> in the early days of Federation, was a consistent advocate of a superannuation scheme for the Commonwealth public servants, and in this he was supported by members of the Labour party. I am now somewhat following in that gentleman's footsteps; and I think we should do well to make no attempts to hinder the passing, of this measure at the present time. All Acts of Parliament, after they 'have been in existence for a period, disclose anomalies which call for an amendment of the law; indeed, it is not possible to test an Act except in actual operation. No doubt in the future we shall find that some amendments are necessary, but I think the Government are doing well in introducing this Bill now, after the promises made to the public servants and the length of time they have been waiting for it. I am a member of the Opposition, but merely because of that I do not feel called upon to oppose a measure which I personally approve. </para>

                    <para>.- Last week I took exception to the fact that the Government were not going to meet their obligations - that they were prepared to enter into obligations which would fall, not on themselves, but on their successors in future years. The Minister has told us, as he told us last week, that this Bill has <inline font-style="italic">been</inline> examined by actuaries, who report that it is actuarially sound. But was that guarantee by the actuaries given on the basis of immediate payments by the Government, in accordance with the payments of the public servants, or was it on the basis as now disclosed in the Bill? If it was given on the supposition that the Government would pay their share as the scheme went along, just as the contributors to the fund will pay, it is on an utterly different basis from the proposal before us. On what basis did the actuaries give their report? I have here the opinion of a very competent actuary in New South Wales. </para>

                    <para>The Commonwealth Superannuation Bill forecasts what appears to be a perfectly Bound scheme assuming that the country is prepared to pay the cost, with one exception. The exception is the provision that the Commonwealth is not to pay its share by periodical payments, as will dts employees. It is to meet its liabilities by paying one-half, or, in the case of employees entering the fund over thirty years of age, more than one-half of the pension payments, ais and when they become payable. That is to say, in the case of a young man of twenty-five, he will make substantial payments, which will be accumulated, less certain subsidiary payments, at interest for forty years if he lives to enter on his pension at sixty-five, while the Commonwealth will pay nothing until the end of forty years, but then becomes liable for half the pension payments. </para>

                    <para>It is reported that the Prime Minister .has stated that, if the proper payments were made, the yearly cost to the Commonwealth would be £500,000.* In the future, therefore, an appalling annual cost will be laid upon the Commonwealth by these yearly payments bema withheld. For this £500,000, less certain items*of outgo provided for in the Bill, if paid and accumulated at interest, would amount to a huge sum in the period between now and the time when the heavy charge for pensions arrives. If this sum were then in hand to pay the pensions falling due, the Commonwealth would only require to continue its yearly contribution to provide for other pensions falling due in .the then future. If no provision is made from the commencement of the fund (£500,000 per annum, or more or less), the ultimate call on the public exchequer may well be many millions annually. </para>

I have some doubt as to whether it is actuarially sound to postpone Commonwealth contributions to this Superannuation Fund. The simpler way, and one that would appeal to an ordinary man, would be for the Government to make contributions to the fund in the same proportion as any public servant. But the Minister has told us that this is financially impossible, and that this scheme is actuarially sound. I cannot say. I have some doubt, but I am willing to accept his assurance and the opinion of the actuaries. I realize that they know a good deal more about figures than I do, although my experience is that actuaries, like other experts, will argue both sides of the question. </para>

                    <para>.- I listened with a good deal of interest to the remarks of the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> upon this provision of the Bill. 1 think it should be struck out. A public servant may have a thousand and one reasons why he should not be required to contribute for more than two units of pension, but in his own interests and in the interests of his family he should be required, by means of this scheme, to make adequate provision for the future. He should have due regard to his family obligations. An employee, at thirty years of age, may have a family of only two children, and on that basis he may persuade the Board to exempt him from contributing for more than a minimum of units; but if his family increases subsequently his pension privileges will then be quite inadequate. In such circumstances, if, unfortunately, the head of a family is taken, the widow and children will suffer severely. There should be no exemption. Every public servant should contribute to the fund according to his salary. </para>

Many public servants, having lost hope of a superannuation scheme being brought into being to benefit them, have already undertaken heavy obligations in order to make provision for their future. If the honorable member's suggested amendment were carried those men would be further burdened by being compelled to take four units in the superannuation scheme. I would prefer that it should be optional for the officer to come under the scheme or not, according to the other provision he has made for his old age, but, failing that, this clause is necessary. </para>

                    <para>. - The conditions governing the New South Wales Railway Superannuation Fund are essentially different from those set out in this Bill. The former involved a contribution of 11/2 per cent, of salaries by employees and an inadequate contribution of 1 per cent, of salaries by the employers, making a total contribution of 21/2 per cent, of salaries. The Commonwealth scheme involves a contribution on the part of the employee of about3 per cent, of his salary if he commences to contribute just before his twenty-first birthday and 41/2 per cent, if the contributions commence after he is thirty years of age. Moreover, the Commonwealth, instead of paying into the fund a fixed percentage, undertakes to supplement the contributions of the employees on a £1 for £1 basis as benefits become due. The New South Wales scheme fell into arrears because of the inadequacy of the contributions provided for. The scheme was not placed upon a proper basis in the first  instance. The Commonwealth scheme is to be placed upon a definite actuarial basis, and in arriving at that basis we have had the experience of the working of the New South Wales Railways Superannuation Act to guide us. This has given us a good guide for making the estimate of future commitments. </para>

                    <para>.- The proportions' contributed by the Government and the . railway servants under the New South Wales Railways Superannuation Act are approximately the same as the proportions to be contributed by the Commonwealth and the public servants under this Bill. Under the New South Wales scheme, with 41,448 contributors and 2,029 present annuitants, it is estimated that the State will, within a year or two, be paying £1,000,000 in benefits. The public servants who will come under the Commonwealth scheme will number more than 41,000. </para>

                        <para>- Even though the officers are merely transferred from the State Government to the Commonwealth Government, a liability in respect of them will exist under this Act. I am anxious that this scheme shall be placed on a safe basis for the sake of the Public Service, and also on account of the tremendous burden that may be imposed upon the people in future. The Minister quoted the New South Wales Railways Superannuation Act as affording a good basis ' upon which to work ; but he said that the rate of contribution originally fixed was much too small, and that the fund got into difficulties in consequence. I repeat that although the contributions from both the employees and the Government are to be higher under the Commonwealth scheme, the respective proportions will be much the same as under the New South Wales scheme. The number of contributors to the State scheme is not as great as will be the number under, the Commonwealth scheme twenty years hence ; yet the State authorities can foresee a liability of £1,000,000 per annum. That information comes to me from one of the best actuaries in New South Wales. The Attorney-General has said that the New South Wales scheme has broken down of its own weight. We do not wish the same fate to befall the scheme we are now considering, and the Minister would be well advised to look further into the matter. </para>

                        <para>- It is useless to compare what is done in the Old Country with what is done here, where the conditions are entirely different. England is a country of accumulated wealth. The Commonwealth is undeveloped, and we require all the money that is available for the improvement of our property and the increase of production. Too often I have heard arguments in this chamber based on similar false premises. If a man has a complete property, with all improvements made, he may do what he likes with his income; but a man whose property has to be improved and made productive has to conserve his resources. In this country, which is awaiting development, we would have to be more careful with these schemes than has an old country with a vast amount of accumulated wealth. If the Government are basing their scheme on what has happened in England they are looking for trouble. The past experience of superannuation in Australia is such as should make us extremely careful. I urge further investigation, not because I wish to do any disservice to the public servant - on the  contrary, I desire his future to be made secure - but because I do not wish the future development of the country to be hampered by liabilities under a badly balanced scheme. </para>

All societies, except those dealing only with miners, are accumulating enormous funds. If the payments to the fund are as high as they would be according to English actuarial calculations, they should be quite sufficient, judging by my experience of friendly societies. It is to be expected that actuaries who have not been consulted would differ from . those whose advice has not been obtained. </para>

In the light of past experience, surely the Government and the officials advising them would not trust to the actuarial calculation on which the New South Wales Railways Fund was based.

                    <para>. - I regret that critics of the scheme have not paid attention to the South Australian system. I am familiar with the Act that applies to the Education Department in that State. I know more about that system than any other, because at the time the superannuation scheme was introduced in Tasmania, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Neale,</inline> formerly of the South Australian Education Department, helped us in every way. He suggested to us - I thought at the time that his advice was wrong, and I think so now - that no Government money should be paid into the fund, because . then the Government would not have power to retire officers when they came on the fund. The Tasmanian Government, unfortunately, acted on that advice, and consequently officers in the railways service do not receive very large pensions. I have not made special inquiries, but if the Tasmanian Railway Retiring Fund had broken down from an actuarial point of view I would have heard of it. Nor has the South Australian Superannuation Fund proved actuarially unsound. The Commonwealth Government have had actuarial calculations made, and they are prepared to subsidize the fund to be established under the Bill. I fail to see how it could break down from an actuarial point of view, because it is eminently sound. It is quite a correct policy for the Government to refrain from contributing to the fund immediately.  It would be most unwise to spend a huge sum in subsidies, because money might be invested in such a way as not to give a good return. The Government will be able instead to devote the money to reproductive works, which will result in increased population, and when Australia has been more fully developed it will be easier for the Government to contribute their share to the fund. Honorable members and people outside who have criticised the Bill fail to appreciate the benefit the measure will afford to the Government and to the country. It is simply a case of helping men who are willing to help themselves. Quite a number of private firms are adopting exactly the same course. An obligation rests on the Government to look after the interests of the Public Service, and the fact that officials will have provision made for them on retirement will be an inducement to them to remain in the Service. It is often said that there are men in the Service who could do much better for themselves in private employment. </para>

                        <para>- But what sort of men are they? If the honorable member ever becomes Treasurer, he will find that, notwithstanding his business training, he will need to rely to a very great extent on the services of officials who have had many years of training in that particular Department. If our public servants arc worthy of the salary paid to them, by reason of the responsibilities intrusted to them, the Commonwealth should be prepared to remunerate them adequately, and part of that remuneration should take the form of provision for superannuation. I know of ii case where an official who was receiving £300 a year in the Government service was induced to leave it because a large Melbourne firm offered this officer £500 per annum. This firm appreciated the value of the service given. Government in Great Britain has not the same ramifications as in Australia, where railway and other' highly technical services have to be conducted, and where the most efficient officers are needed. Take the great British firm of Brasseys, contractors, Do they throw their employees upon the world when their services are no longer required? Have Lever Brothers, Cadburys, or  Frys  taken that attitude? Not one of them. I do not look upon the Bill as a proposal to give a pension to an officer on retirement. The payment to -be drawn by the officer at the end of his term should be regarded as portion of his salary and part of the inducement offered to him to serve the Commonwealth. The people of Australia are relieved of a great responsibility by this measure. </para>

                        <para>- The rate of contribution to superannuation funds has occupied the attention of almost all countries, and not many of them have acted similarly. Countries like the United States of America and France have found that they could not devise any compulsory scheme which they could regularly maintain. Very few countries have aimed at the establishment of a scheme for any particular section of the community. Germany devised a plan, which Austria, and other lands to a greater or lesser extent, copied, to superannuate all its people. Great Britain, acting on the experience of other parts of the world, drew up a scheme which made certain provision for unemployment, accident, or sickness, and it had the wisdom not to' permit the contributions to remain in the exchequer. The administration of the fund was conducted with the assistance of friendly societies, which for centuries had had the handling of such work. I maintain that the provisions of the Bill will not fit in with a national system of superannuation. I do not think that delaying the present Bill for the purpose of introducing a national scheme would handicap. * the Public Service. If this Bill is to be delayed with that object in view, T should like the Public Service to be assured that it will not bo the loser thereby. </para>

                    <para>. - At this stage it is perhaps advisable that I should refer to a number of related matters. I have already spoken of the case of the man who' retires at the age prescribed by law or when he is called upon to do so. Clause 31 provides that the pension is payable to the widow and children of the man whose employment may be terminated by death. Clause 30 provides that the contributor who has been, in the Service for at least ten years, and is retired on the ground of invalidity or physical or. mental incapacity to perform his duties is entitled to the full pension if the invalidity or incapacity is not due to his own fault, or to a pension which is the actuarial equivalent of the contributions made by him up to the time of his retirement if the invalidity or incapacity is due to his own fault. Under clause 38 the man who is retrenched is entitled to receive the contributions paid by him, and the actuarial equivalent of the share of pension payable by the Commonwealth, and within one month after his retrenchment may choose to take such equivalent in the form of a lump sum payment, or as a pension. The case of the man who is discharged - he has not been in the Service for ten years - is covered by clause 39. He will receive the amount of the actual contributions paid by him. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. The matter is entirely in the hands of a man's superior officer. The honorable member has been fortunate if he has not had brought under his notice during his parliamentary term many complaints of dismissal from the Public Service for very small matters. Pew honorable members have not had a list of complaints in this respect brought under their notice. A man dismissed in these circumstances may have been paying into the fund for a lengthy period, and may have been looking forward to the time when he would be called upon to retire. He may have given the whole of his life-time to a certain occupation in one Department, and it may have physically handicapped him from taking up any other class of work. And his only compensation is the return of his contributions to the superannuation fund. There are very few men in any avocation who go through their service without making a small mistake at one time or another. But, because a man happens to incur the displeasure of certain people in control, he may be dismissed and deprived of all the advantages that would otherwise accrue to him under the superannuation scheme, except the repayment of the contributions he has made to it. Most likely, not being fitted to follow any other occupation, he is placed at considerable disadvantage. I do not know whether ' anything can be done in the Bill to meet the case, but I draw the Minister's attention to the case of dismissed men. It should be pointed out to those in control that- unless some big mistake has been made by the official he should receive fairly lenient consideration. He should not be dismissed from the Service because of merely a small offence. </para>

                        <para>- But they are. Quite a number of such instances occur in our Public Service, especially in the case of employees in receipt of less than £200 a year. We hear of such cases in connexion with letter deliverers, and in other branches of the General Division of the Post Office. When a little thing goes wrong the man concerned is dismissed, and such dismissal is hard upon a man who has given the best part of his life to the Service, and has arrived at fifty-five or sixty years of age. At that age he is of no use for any other occupation, and has, no doubt, been living in the hope of coming under the provisions of this Bill in a tew years, but without any prospects he is thrown upon the world. I hope the Minister will take steps to see that reasonable treatment is given to such men. </para>

                    <para>. - I would remind the honorable member that members of the Commonwealth Public Service are not dismissed for light or trivial reasons. Even under the present law an employes can only be dismissed for a very serious offence. Section 46 of the Public Service Act says that " If the Chief Officer considers the alleged offence to be of so serious a nature that an investigation thereof should be made by a Board of Inquiry, he may forthwith suspend such officer," but dismissal, can only be ordered by the Governor-General. First, there must be a report by the Board, which must go to the Public Service Commissioner, and then a recommendation is made to the Governor-General. Dismissal is only ordered in very serious cases. Under the Bill it is not proposed that an employee dismissed shall forfeit any of his rights in the sense of forfeiting what he has paid into the fund. He may have been guilty of gross misconduct, but even in that case he would not forfeit his payments, but they would be refunded to him. All he would lose would be the benefits that he would have received under the Act if he had continued in the Service and paid all his contributions. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not entirely approve of this section in so far as it affects senior officers of the Service. Under the Public Service Act the Public Service Commissioner has the right to call upon anybody to retire after he has reached the age of sixty. If an employee has been in the Service for many years, and has paid into the Superannuation Fund for twelve or eighteen months, or two years, and is then called upon to retire through no. fault of his own, he would not get a pension, but would be limited, apparently, to an actuarial amount calculated on the amount he has actually paid in. It seems to me to be most unfair that some senior men should be treated in this way, while others are put on a much more favorable footing. A man who is sixty-five, or who has retired within the last year or eighteen months, will receive the full benefits of the fund, but a man who is under that age may, because the Public Service Commissioner sees fit to retire him before he is sixty-five years of age, be limited to an altogether inadequate pension calculated upon the payments that he has made to the fund in two,' three, or four years. </para>

                        <para>- He may be in good health and perfectly fit. Any man who is over sixty years of age in the Public Service is liable to be called upon to retire, whether he is fit or ill. When he has reached sixty-five years he must retire. It is a question of age, not of disability. If the Public Service Commissioner calls upon him to retire he is put in an altogether false position, because he cannot get the full benefits under this Bill. If, on the contrary, a man continues in the Service . for any special purpose after he is sixty- five years of age, Le will not, under section 23, which we have just passed, draw any pension so long as he remains in the Service. A man who is sixty years of age, and is compelled to. retire, can only receive a pension fixed actuarially upon his payments for a limited time. Another question also arises in relation to a man who wishes to retire at the age of sixty because he feels that he is not fit for the work. I was going to suggest to the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> that such a man should be allowed to pay in a lump sum equivalent to what he would have- paid if he had continued in the Service until he was sixty-five years of age, and, if he did that, he should be entitled to the full benefits of the scheme. </para>

                        <para>- It would, but if the Government would treat him as though these payments had been made up to sixty years of age, and say to him, " You would pay under the scheme so much, but because you are drawing a pension so many years earlier you ought to pay a little more." That might not be a very large amount actuarially, but if we take the amount which is actuarially necessary to make his payments, which cover only a few years, up to , an amount which would entitle him. to a pension at sixty-five years of age, it would be a sum which it would be impossible for him to pay. We can compel a man to leave the Service at sixty years of age, and under this Bill we may pay him only a trifling few pounds a year, equivalent to the amount which he would be entitled to as a contributor to the fund for a few years. I do not think that is fair, and some provision ought to be made to meet such cases. The Minister ought to leave out the words, " called upon to retire before attaining that age." If a man chooses to retire before the age, he has himself to blame to some extent ; but if we make him retire I think the least we can do is to give him the same privileges that we give to the men who have already retired, or have nearly reached the age of sixty-five. </para>

                <para class="block">There are two things we could have done. We could have made the retiring age for all members of the Public Service sixty years. If we had done that we would have had to do two other things. We would have had to increase the amount of the contributions, because contributors would automatically fall upon the pension scheme five years earlier, and would contribute for five years less. That would have increased the payments very greatly, as happened in New South Wales. The provision in the Bill was the proper course to take. It is only in exceptional circumstances that a man is called upon to retire at sixty years of age. The provision relating to the retiring age is in the Public Service Act in the interests of the public. It is the rare exception* and not the rule, for a man to be retired at sixty years of age. All that we can do is to estimate actuarially the value of a man's pension, and take into account the number of years he has been in the Service and the amounts he has contributed. We cannot create an exception and say that a man called upon to retire at the age of sixty years shall get greater privileges and benefits .than if he continued in the Service until he had attained the age of sixty-five. If a man is retired because of invalidity he will get his pension. If we alter the basis of the scheme in certain cases we must alter its whole basis. It is impossible to tell whether a man will be called upon to retire thirty or forty years hence. We have, in fact, given him a concession in the clause to which I have referred the honorable member. There are two factors to be considered in connexion with a pension, and they are the age at which a man is retiring and the amount of the pension. The second proviso to sub-clause 2 of clause 12 makes provision for him to get an increased pension. All we ask him to do is to make contributions up to an amount not exceeding that specified for his age, which will give him an increased pension. </para>

                        <para>- If a man is retired before he has reached the age of  sixty-five  he is thrown right back upon the actuarial basis. He is entitled only to that which is the actuarial equivalent of his contributions. On the one hand, this measure treats an officer, if he remains in the Service until he is sixty-five, with greater generosity than his contributions actuarially entitle him to receive; but, if for any reason he goes out of the Service before reaching the age limit, he is thrown back upon the actuarial basis, pure and simple, and that is not fair. Further, if an officer is incapacitated because of invalidity, he is entitled to the full pension. The only reason which I can conceive for a public employee being called upon to retire between the age of sixty and sixty-five is that he has become incapable of continuing in the performance of his  duties.  There may be those who, while not in an actual condition of invalidity, have so deteriorated in general capacity as to be no longer fit to carry on. In the interests of the Service they ought to be retired at that stage rather than be kept on until they have reached the age of sixty-five. In such circumstances, however, they would be penalized as I have indicated. There are not many such cases, I am sure, but the least the Government can do is to treat them in the same way as if they were entitled to come under the invalidity clause. I stress the view that these older men should be entitled to the full pension if their services must be dispensed with after they have reached the age of sixty. </para>

For example, I have heard of the spleen of a superior officer being responsible for the retirement of an old servant who has got beyond the stage of giving his best, but has not yet reached the retiring age. It is possible for an officer to remain in, the Service for very many years, paying his contributions right up to the age of sixty one, and a little longer, and then to be told that, for some cause over which he has no control, his services are to be dispensed with. </para>

                    <para>.- I consider that the period of ten years is too long. The clause does not bear fairly on persons who, through the very nature of their work, have lost their health, or who have met with an accident necessitating their retirement. Why should they be cut off from the benefits of the  superannuation  scheme merely because they have not been in the Service for. ten years? It should not be forgotten that, before any one may join the Public Service, he must undergo a searching medical examination. He is not accepted unless he is certified to be constitutionally sound. There must be some limitation, of course: but I suggest that the period be five years. </para>

                        <para>.- This clause provides that on the death of a male contributor before retirement, a pension equal to one-half of the contributor's pension shall be paid to his widow during her own life, and that in respect of each of her or the contributor's children a pension of £13 per annum shall be paid until the age of sixteen years has been attained. I do not know whether the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> is prepared to liberalize that a little; because it will be noticed at once that , if a public servant is entitled to four units his widow would receive only one-half, which would be £52. If she received £13 for each child she would require a family of four in' order to bring the pension up to £104 per annum, which is a very small sum to have at her disposal for maintaining herself and children. I should like to know whether the Minister could not provide that the total amount to be paid should be at least equal to the amount which would have been received by the contributor if he had reached the retiring age. It should be possible to provide for the payment of an amount not in excess of that which woluld be payable to the pensioner. If the Minister were to agree to a payment of £20 instead of £13 for' each child, the clause would be more liberal. </para>

                        <para>- I am not saying that it is not fairly liberal. Supposing a man pays into the fund for thirty or forty years, and' . dies before he reaches the age of sixty-five when he would have retired on' a pension, is there any reason why we should not 'allow the widow and children to get at least £104 per annum? If a widow had only two children she would receive £52 plus £26, which is £78, and I am suggesting that we should allow a little more in the case of each child so long as the total amount does not exceed £104, which would be the amount that would be received by the pensioner. </para>

In the case of a female there is always the probability of her resigning in consequence of some happy event which may occur in her life before she reaches the age of sixty-five. If she does not marry we provide that the money shall be paid to her representative. </para>

                        <para>.- Clauses 35, 36, and 37 contain retrospective provisions, and, in accordance with the promise made to the Committee, T intend to move an amendment later which will have the I effect of slightly increasing some of the. pensions. Officers under the Defence Act ' are compelled to retire at an age earlier than' sixty-five years, and these officers are, therefore, not in the same position as other members of the Public Service who retire at sixty-five. We are there-, fore proposing to provide in this clause that officers of the Defence Department who are compelled to retire at an earlier age than sixty-five years, instead of receiving pensions of four units, shall receive the actuarial equivalent. The object of the amendment is to place them on the same basis as other public servants, having regard to the longer period for which the pension, in their case, will be payable. </para>

Otherwise there would be a hiatus between the commencement of the Act and the date on which contributions would begin. .

                    <para>.- The meaning of the clause may be perfectly clear to the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom),</inline> but although I have read the Bill somewhat carefully, and have listened to the honorable gentleman's explanation, I am in doubt as to the effect of this provision as it is proposed to amend it. I understand that the clause is primarily intended to cover  the  cases of men who, having been ten years in the Service, and having attained  the  statutory age - which, in the case  of  naval and military officers, is less than sixty-five years - retire after the passing  of the  Act and before the Superannuation Fund is established. </para>

                        <para>- Was the Government in a position to let the actuaries know how many men were likely to- come under this provision? I cannot imagine that in 1920 Ministers were in a position to furnish reliable figures, and I am inclined to think that we should find, if we could make an accurate calculation, that we were loading the scheme very much beyond expectations. I do not feel disposed to liberalize any of these provisions if the Government intends to keep to its main scheme. I would sooner have the stitches . taken out of the Bill, and have it referred to a Committee, should that boat all possible, for the ascertainment of the actual cost in which , we are involving the country. The Minister should give us an estimate of cost whenever he proposes an alteration of the scheme. </para>

                        <para>.- Seeing that these pensions are not based on contributions to the pensions fund, the proposal of the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> does not seem to me equitable. Of course, in the case of contributors, a larger pension would be payable to those who had' been in the Service from the age of thirty to that of sixty-five years than that payable to those who retired at the age of sixty years; but in this case, we are not concerning ourselves with contributors. All the money for these pensions has to be found by the Commonwealth. I hold that, as the Commonwealth calls on its naval and military men to retire at the age of sixty years, it. should provide, for those men a pension of four units,, just as it provides that pension for the men who have been permitted to stay on in the general Public Service until, at , the date of the commencement of the Act, they have reached the age of sixty-five years. It seems to me that the Minister' acts ungenerously in this case, comparing what is to be given to officers of full age. retiring from the general Service with what is to be given to naval and military men retiring at sixty years of age. </para>

                    <para>.- According to the definition clause, an employee is a person employed in a permanent, capacity in the Public Service. In the Military Forces the colonels, majors, captains, and other commissioned officers are permanently employed, and will come under the Bill, but there is a doubt whether the instructional and warrant officers in the artillery and other branches of the Service will come under it. They are men who are permanently employed, although their engagements are for three-years periods, which are constantly renewed. I ask the Minister to see that these men  are  included. </para>

                    <para>.- The Bill covers officers employed in a permanent capacity. In the Naval Forces, the naval ratings engage for a certain period of service, and can then re-engage. I think these periods are twelve and eight years, and many of the men do not serve longer than twelve years. In the Military Forces the non-commissioned officers, I think, enlist for five years, and may engage for three years, and then re-engage until they have reached the age of fifty-five years. These men do not come within the Bill. This scheme is based on the regular contributions of a permanent service. Obviously, Navy ratings could not come within this scheme, because the men are there for only short periods. We could not include a body of men whose periods of employment do not exceed twelve years, and give them all the privileges enjoyed by men who contribute to the fund up to sixty-five years of age. Therefore, the actuaries recommended that Navy ratings should not be included. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. This matter has given the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> and the Government some concern. We feel that these men ought to receive special consideration, but they do not fit in with this scheme. Many of the men engaged for five years go out at the end of that period, and we could not think of giving them the same rates of pension as are given to permanent men who contribute over a long series of years. However, we are looking into the matter, and, in consultation with the actuaries and others, are trying to devise some legislation to enable us to meet the case. </para>

                    <para>.- The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom),</inline> has told us that legislation will be introduced if we have time this session. It is remarkable that in all legislation affecting the military there is no doubt about the treatment of the officer class - they are always well, treated. Here, again, is the case of the non-commissioned officers - warrant officers, sergeant-majors, and so forth - who are willing to be permanently employed, and who are permanently employed today, but cannot obtain from the Government an engagement for a longer period  than three years. Some of these men have worked from ten to twenty years and longer for the Government, and worked much harder than many of the officer class. The Minister calmly says that he realizes the justice of their case, and that in the far distant future, if the Government are lucky enough to be returned to power, they will be justly dealt with. No indication, however, is given that the necessary legislation will be introduced this' session. </para>

                    <para>. -  I know of a number of such men who have been employed at the Victoria Barracks, Sydney, for twenty years and over, and who cannot get an engagement for a longer period than three years. At the end of that time they have to be, what is called " re-enlisted," though, it has to be noted, the men never leave their positions. These men are, to all intents and purposes, permanent, and have been anticipating coming under this Bill. With all due respect to those in the higher positions, the most important officer is the warrant officer, who does the training of even the officers themselves. I am surprised . that they are left out in the cold. </para>

                    <para>. - If 'we interpret the word " permanent " in a narrow sense we shall exclude from the benefits of this Bill a number of men who perform most valuable functions in the defence of this country. I know of no body of men, if we are to have military training here, who perform more valuable work than the area officers, some of whom, I believe, are permanent, though most of them are not, but are on a threeyears' basis. At the end of the three years they are re-employed, and they may be continuously employed for over thirty years; yet, according to the interpretation of the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom),</inline> they are excluded from the operation of this Bill. This seems to be making a very invidious distinction, one likely to create, in certain circles, a feeling that ought not to exist. I wonder if the Government have considered that aspect of the question. Of course, under any scheme certain hard cases occur ; but here we have a number of officers whose positions are practically assured, and whose duties are important. It is cruel to deny them the benefits of this legislation. </para>

                    <para>. - I am quite in accord with the two previous sneakers. It will come as a shock to a good many men in the Military Forces to learn that they are not to have the benefit of this superannuation scheme. It is quite true that a number of these men have been practically permanently engaged in the Defence Forces over long periods. I have in my mind one man who has been engaged for over thirty-four years, and if he is denied the privileges of this Bill there will be trouble so far as he is concerned. Men so situated ought to have some consideration from this House when we. are devising a superannuation scheme: and I hope that before the clause is passed the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Grrom)</inline> will give us an assurance that it is the intention of the Government to deal justly with them. </para>

It would be quite wrong to endeavour to give the benefits of a superannuation fund, whether contributory or otherwise, to men with only three, five, or seven years' engagements. </para>

                        <para>- I can imagine that there are men in the Defence Forces, just as there are men in the civil branches, who desire to remain there as long as they are' able to do the work. If that be so, I recommend the Minister not to alter the scheme, but to see whether some safe system can be devised to give the benefits of the Bill to the lower ranks referred to. It appears to be invidious that officers should get the advantage of this scheme and the men who do valuable service under them should not. That, however, is not the fault of the scheme, but the fault of the system of engagements under which the Defence Department operates. </para>

                    <para>.- ' The honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> seems to have touched the real crux of the question. At the same time that will hardly satisfy those men who have been doing good work, and who are, according to the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom),</inline> temporary men. They are temporary men belonging to the Permanent Forces, and they have their terms renewed in such a way as to practically make them permanent. The honorable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lister)</inline> is quite right when he says that some of these men have been employed by the Government for many years, and look upon themselves as permanent employees from the day they were appointed, and make their plans accordingly. To describe them as temporary employees is, strictly speaking, correct, but, as has been suggested, the description rests on a mere technicality. They go into the Forces believing that their positions will be as permanent as those of the officers, and in many cases they are so. Of course, they are not bound in precisely the same way as are the officers, but they join, with the intention of making the work their life-long calling; and something should be done for them. If the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> cannot see his way to meet the case, the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> may possibly be able to do so. We are, as it were, leaving these men " between two stools," and we ought to have some definite expression of opinion from one or other of the Ministers. </para>

It is true that they are members of the Permanent Forces, but honorable members know that they are engaged for five years, with the right of a further period of employment, because, in many cases, they will not enlist for an indefinite period. </para>

                        <para>- I am only pointing out that under the present system the best men, and consequently those with the longest service, are enabled to attain to a certain rank, and provided their conduct is good they can go on from year to year, to all intents and purposes permanent men. If we allowed every man who enlisted to became permanently engaged in the Service, the probabilities are that we would get a very inefficient Force. </para>

                        <para>- Our officers must be graduates of the Duntroon College. They have to pass a very severe examination,.  and in ninety-nine cases out of one hundred it is certain that incompetents would be weeded out in the initial stages of their work. Their position is altogether different from that of the rank and file. However, the Government propose to try and get a scheme that will enable those men who go on in the Service to secure some of the benefits of these superannuation proposals, but we must make special provision for them. Without definitely committing myself at the moment, I think it can be said that once they reach the stage of being regarded as permanent officers they will be entitled to these advantages. In all probability they will be called upon to contribute from the date of their enlistment, and if they pass out of the Service before a certain stage is reached their contributions will be returned to them. There may be some difficulty as to our obligation in respect of widows and children, but I have no doubt that this problem can be actuarially met. I want to make it clear that it is the intention of the Government to do something in this direction as soon as possible. So far as the Naval ratings are concerned, I cannot see how we can do other than what the actuaries have already suggested, and that is to leave them out. It may be possible to include a certain number, but with respect to the majority, that is, those who enlist for twelve years and then pass out of the Service, or these who enlist for one term and then an extra period of eight years, I think we shall have to rely upon the system of deferred pay. I am afraid it will be impracticable to include those men in the superannuation scheme, but we are looking into the whole question, with every desire to help these cases, and I feel confident that, at all events, in regard to those men who have long service to their credit, it will be possible to find ways and means of bringing them in. </para>

                    <para>.- My remarks will be directed more to the clause than the amendment. The clause is retrospective in that it provides that pensions shall be paid to employees who, on or after the 31st day of December, 1920, and before the passing of this Act, have been retired, or permitted to retire, or who, at the time of retirement had been in the Service for at least ten years, and were of or over the age of sixty-five years. I am wondering , if there is to be provision for the widow and children of an officer retired between 1920 and the passing of this Act and who had since become deceased. </para>

                        <para>- Then there is no need for me to stress that point any further. During the debate on clause 35, it was pointed out that officers below the rank of warrant officers would not come under the provisions of the Bill. What is troubling me is the fact that recently we passed a measure to provide for the payment of compensation to' certain individuals . who were compulsorily retired from the Defence Forces. Will they get pensions under this scheme after having received compensation under the other measure? </para>

                        <para>- That may be so. Some excellent retired officers have made representations to honorable members on this point. They have just as meritorious a case for consideration as those officers who were retired after 31st December, 1920. They want to know why they are going to be left out, and why that date was fixed. That is the vital point. Clearly it is not the date that was first suggested, because the Bill was promised away back in October, 1919, when the Government announced, as an act of policy, that they were bringing in a superannuation scheme. Will the Minister tell us how the Government arrived at this date? Was it to cover some obligation, or was it merely an accident of circumstances when the Bill was first prepared ? </para>

                    <para>. - The date fixed was, as nearly as possible, the date of the closing of the first session following the general elections of 1919. It is true that the scheme was under consideration before the general elections of 1919, but it was only definitely promised, during that election, as part of the Government's policy. ' Owing; to certain circumstances, it could not be dealt with in the first session. Naturally, members of the Public Service expected it to be in operation not later than a year after the general elections of 1919, and so the Government fixed the date in accordance with expectations. </para>

                    <para>.- As I stated, by way of interjection when the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> was speaking, the choice of date will operate more harshly upon the older men in the Service. I think any reference to the date should be excluded altogether. The condition is that the officer shall have been at least ten -years in the Service and shall have attained the age of sixty-five years. It follows that persons who retired prior to 1921, upon having attained the age of sixty-five &lt; year3, and are still in the land of the living, are old men whose merits are quite equal to those of the men who are to receive the pension, but they will he excluded. It follows also, from the weight of years that persons have to carry in order to win this pension, that their num  bers will be small. I am not in a position to say to what extent the omission of the date would add to the appropriation, but I have been reminded that I would not be in order in moving an amendment to that effect. I do propose, however, to test the feeling of the Committee by' asking honorable members not to accept the clause in its present form. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> may have information before him which will enable him to say how much would be added to the appropriation by including all those who had attained the age of sixty-five at the date of their retirement and had been in the Service at least ten years, but who are excluded from the benefits under the Bill because they were retired before the 31st December, 1920. One feels inclined to go a little further, and say that the age of sixty-five years is too high. But, hopeless of having that view accepted, I think the Committee should seriously consider the extension of the benefits of this pension scheme to persons of the class I have mentioned. In its present form, the clause is unjust and arbitrary, and presses most harshly on older persons, who, so far as I can see, have an equal claim with others to participate in the benefits of the scheme. </para>

                        <para>- That is a different matter. The Bill provides that anybody who has retired since 1920 shall receive a pension without contribution. There cannot be many of those who retired at sixty-five before 31st December, 1920. By way of illustration I shall mention the circumstances of one man who has come to me. This man joined the Service in the days before pensions were abolished by the State Government. With a number of others he was retired on " Black Wednesday "; he was subsequently re-engaged about two months after the pensions scheme had been can celled, and before compulsory insurance had been introduced. He <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> what is known in the Service as a " Twilighter." He has neither the advantage of a pension under the old Act nor compulsory insurance under the modern Act, and he will be denied benefits under this Bill. I do not think it would add much to the cost of the scheme if he and a few others who retired before the 31st December, 1920, were included in the scheme, and given a small pension for the few remaining years of their lives. At any rate, I ask the Attorney-General to investigate the number of such persons who will be affected, and the probable cost of their inclusion in the scheme. I think he will find the numbers and cost so small that he will agree to make this concession. The persons for whom I am appealing must be over sixty-seven years of age now, and they must have been ten years in the Service ; there cannot be many of them. </para>

                    <para>.- The Bill provides for a pension of £13 for each child, and £26 for the widow of a retired officer. I understand that what the honorable member for Nepean <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bowden)</inline> has in mind is that the pension payable to the widow would be granted to the children in the event of her death. That is what, should be provided. A payment of £104 a year to an officer will mean a pension of £26 for his widow, and £13 for each child. In the event of the death of both father and mother, the children should receive the benefit of the contributions that the father has made. </para>

                    <para>.-I would like to see the pension made retrospective to the time when the superannuation scheme was promised to the Service in December, 1919. If the Bill had been dealt with earlier in the Parliament then elected it would probably have been made retrospective to an earlier date. I know a retired officer who has had forty-five years in the Service, and he will not come under the scheme, although within a few months of the time limit fixed. I hope the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> will see his way clear to postpone consideration of the clause, in order to make inquiries as to whether the number of officers embraced by the scheme would be very materially increased by making the measure retrospective for a further twelve months. </para>

                    <para>.- -The Bill was definitely promised in the election campaign in October, 1919, and had it been dealt with at the beginning of the next session the earliest year in which the measure could have been brought into operation would have been 1920. The Government have tried to fulfil the election promise as soon as they could. The honorable member for Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mackay)</inline> has referred to a retired officer of forty-five years' service who will be deprived of the benefit of the scheme. I know another official who retired in 1919, after having given forty-seven years' service. He was one of the most capable and self-sacrificing public officers we have had in Queensland. It has been found necessary, however, to draw the line somewhere. </para>

                    <para>.- There is much to be said in favour of the argument advanced by the honorable member for Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mackay)</inline> and honorable members on this side, that the Bill should be made applicable to all aged servants of the Commonwealth. The clause is governed by the fact that the person to receive the benefit must be sixty-five years of age on retirement. We propose to make the measure retrospective for two years, meaning that officers sixty-seven years of age would come under it. It is unfortunate that other men who have rendered good and faithful service should be deprived of the benefit of the scheme simply because they happened to retire a few years, or perhaps only a few weeks before the date on which the Act is to come into operation. I am acquainted with men who have given good service in the Commonwealth, and who retired three or four years ago. At present they are not in very good circumstances. Probably the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> will urge that the cost of the scheme would be increased too much by extending the benefits to all old employees of the Commonwealth. It is obvious that, by adopting that course, the cost would be increased, but there cannot be a great many retired officers for whom the Bill does not provide. Not many of us pass the allotted span of three score years and ten, and from the- point of view of equity, I think we ought to make the measure retrospective, to embrace all officers who have given service to the Commonwealth up to the age of sixty-five years. </para>

                        <para>- That would reduce the number of whom the Minister speaks. It is not the fault of these officers that they have been left without provision; it is the fault of Parliament. Had they remained in the service of the States, they would have been well provided for under the State Acts. Simply because they were transferred to the Commonwealth, and the Federal Parliament has made no legislative provision for their superannuation, many of them now have to depend on old-age pensions. I know men who have served up to the age of sixty-five years under the Commonwealth, and they are now drawing those pensions. The Government ought to be ideal employers, setting an example to private employers. The Minister would be well advised if he gave a little more consideration to this provision. If he postponed the clause for the time being, to enable him to look into the question raised, it could be dealt with at a later period. I do not think any very great additional cost would be involved by extending the benefits of the Bill to all those officers who have served up to the age of sixty-five years, and are not in receipt of a State pension. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member must be referring to officers in the Postal Department and other branches of the Commonwealth Service who have drawn pay in lieu of furlough to which they were justly entitled, and which could not by any means be regarded as a retiring allowance. Many private firms give pay in lieu of holiday allowance. That principle is followed in the Police Force in many of the States. As a matter of fact, many of the Commonwealth officers who have retired were actually entitled to two furloughs according to their period of service, but only drew allowance for one furlough. During the war many of our public servants did additional work without extra pay, and did not take the holidays to which they were entitled. </para>

In any case, those who would be affected by the present proposal were over the military age. It is very unfair for the honorable member to speak as he has done concerning men who have given good and faithful service to their country, possibly just as much as the honorable member himself rendered during the war. </para>

However, I appeal to the Minister, to give this matter a little further consideration, and see if he cannot meet the wishes of the Committee by postponing the clause. By doing so he might get the rest of the Bill through at this sitting. It is the only clause which seems to give honorable members concern. Quite a number on both sides of the Chamber think that the provision should be made more liberal. </para>

                        <para>- I have not the figures here, but I can assure the Committee, without troubling them with the details, that the additional cost would be considerable. At any rate, if we were to sweep away all restrictions as regards the old men, why should we not also do so in regard to the men who have been retired on account of invalidity, many of whom are, perhaps, more in need of assistance than are those over the age of sixty-five? If we start nibbling in the way suggested, the whole scheme will get out of gear. A logical date has been set down to which we should adhere. For one thing, our actuarial estimates have been based upon it. Naturally we would all like to be generous and vote money out of the Consolidated Revenue. It would be very nice to dispense moneys in this way, but we have a responsibility to undertake. </para>

                <para>I hope that the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> will not expect the Committee to be affected by the sophistries he tenders as argument. For instance, he declares that if we extend the benefits of this measure to the limited section of old and faithful servants of the Commonwealth we seek to have included, there will be no logical reason for not extending it also to those who through illness or infirmity retired in the years gone by. I would not be afraid to support an extension of the scheme to those particularly deserving public servants, but the Labour party to-night have been more moderate in their request, and have asked the Minister to meet the argument we have put up on its merits, and not suggest that there are many other equally deserving people who might be benefited. So far, our contention has not been met. The persons concerned must, as has been said, be at least sixty-seven years of age. In fact they must be more than that, because this pension will be payable only, under this clause, from the passing of the Act, and will carry widows' and children's benefits in accordance with the Act. As the Minister was looking for what he as a lawyer would recognise as <inline font-style="italic">ad captandum</inline> arguments, I am surprised that he did not point out that if we were to accept the proposal which I made when first speaking on this clause, it would also involve additional expenditure in making provision for widows and children. We would like to put the acid test on the Minister in this way. If he is not prepared to give the benefit of his suggested amendment to others, such as those who have retired through invalidity, or if he is not prepared to extend it to the wider area involved in applying it to widows and children, we ask him to bear in mind that there are a few old and faithful servants of the Commonwealth, limited in number and very advanced in age, who have an unanswerable claim to a pension - in fact a better claim than persons to whom he proposes to give it. We claim that the pension should be given to this small number of persons, unless the. Minister can advance some reason other than the miserable pretext of expense why it should not be done. I would like to soothe those who laugh when I use the words "miserable pretext of expense,'" by assuring them that I do not ignore the matter of finance in connexion with this question. I realize that it must be taken into consideration, but I claim that it must not be used as an argument in support of palpable injustice. In a matter of this kind, we should have the courage to do right in scorn of consequences, namely, by extending the benefits of this measure logically to those for whom honorable members of the Committee on both sides of the Chamber have made a plea to-night. The Minister has not even promised to reconsider the clause. He tells us that he does not even know to what extent it will involve an extra expenditure of public money. He admits that he is not informed of the effect of the proposal. </para>

                        <para>-  Why should he not be? He made some inquiries, but they were not adequate inquiries. He has  some " impressions " as to the cost. If the honorable member for Darwin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bell)</inline> insists that the Minister is ignorant on the point, he can have his way. i do not know that the Minister has ever done anything that I have asked him to do. In that regard, however, it is never too late to begin. I beg of him not to prejudice his mind by the fact that I have put the case for these men, but I ask him to consider their, case on its merits, without regard, if he prefers that, to my advocacy of it. When he has considered their case on its merits, the only thing that will remain for him and his Government to do will be to grant the request. Honorable members on the Government side of the House will no doubt see that there are . not many votes involved, but though the votes are few, and though they cannot influence the electorates very much, still, on their merits, they are entitled to succeed. The honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> quoted one instance, and I could quote others, of men who have given, not only good, but distinguished, service to the Commonwealth, and who justly hoped and believed that they would participate in this pension scheme, but who are now excluded. I can see that the honorable member for Denison <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Laird Smith)</inline> is anxious to rise and justify himself for his sneering attitude to these old people, and I will make way for him to do so as far as he can, because I realize the difficulty of his position. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not need to justify my position. I have no desire to kill this Bill. I am most anxious 'that it should go through. There are two ways of killing it. One is to go outside the ambit laid down by the actuaries iri their calculations, so that when the Bill goes to another place it may be shown that it is quite unworkable. I have watched the attitude of some honorable members who pose as friends of the Public Service, and I have come to the conclusion that they are doing their utmost to kill the Bill. I cannot understand why the honorable member who has just resumed his seat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> is now putting in so much time in his place in this House. On other nights we do not find him here after a certain hour. He has spoken about me being in my electorate. 1 would remind him that I took up an electorate where there was hard fighting to be done. I did not go to a place where ;I could get a selection, ana my seat would be assured for life, without any further fighting. I can explain my position by saying that I do not desire to do anything on the floor of this House that will jeopardize the Bill. I notice how attentive my honorable friend has been to his duties since the announcement of the candidature of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir James</inline> Barrett, who is about to oppose him. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir J</inline> James  Barrett has succeeded, at least, in keeping the honorable member for Batman in his place in this House. The announcement of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir James</inline> Barrett's name as a political candidate has been of great service to a section of the Public Service. If the Minister changes his mind on this subject it will not be because of the speech of the honorable member for Batman, but the thanks will be due to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir James</inline> Barrett. I have rarely seen the honorable member here at this hour of the night. One generally sees him making a beeline for the St. Kilda tram or train at night long before the House rises. </para>

                    <para>.- I am somewhat disappointed at the reply of the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> on this question. The request was very mildly put forward by members on this side of the House. There is nothing to answer in the speech by the honorable member for Denison <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Laird Smith),</inline> and when I listened to him I wondered why he rose to speak at all. The Minister has said that the adoption of the proposal would cost a lot of money. I asked him if he could give an estimate of the cost, and he said he was not prepared to give even a rough estimate. In the absence of any such estimate I do. not accept the statement that the adoption of the proposal would cost a lot of money. These are men who retired at sixty-five years of age two or more years ago, and, therefore, many of them entered the Service just after the payment of compensation was abolished in the States. When I hear honorable members, particularly those of the Corner party, who seem to be very anxious about the cost of anything relating to the working section of the community, speak of the cost of the proposal, I am reminded of the wonderful support which the Government has received from the Corner party, and the slavish following it has had from members like the honorable member for Denison, in reducing taxation to the rich. When members on this side of the House come forward with a proposal to do justice to old people who have served this country faithfully for many years, and have reached the evening of their day, we arc met with questions of cost, just as we were when the payment of old-age pensions was before the House. It was only last week that the Government passed a measure to remit £400,000 of taxation from the large land monopolists of this country. On that occasion the Government were supported by the honorable member for Denison. Other proposals for remitting taxation were outlined in the Budget speech. For the benefit of the big Flinders-lane warehouses of this country, and all big businesses, there is to be a remission of income tax amounting to 10 per cent. The Government are proposing to remit something like £3,000,000 a year from the taxes paid by the big landed interests and the big business houses. The point at issue is whether this country can afford to do justice to these old people. If we are so bankrupt that we cannot find a few pounds to pay these people £2 a week for the remaining days of their lives, we are not in a position to remit £3,000,000 of taxation to the richest people in the community. I am surprised that the Minister should come down with  a  statement that the cost would be too heavy in the face of what has been happening in this House during the last week: It is  a  pity that the Minister has not been able to find a sounder argument. As for the statement of the honorable member for Denison, that members of the Opposition are doing their best to kill the Bill, I repudiate that suggestion. He knows it cannot be true. There is no party in this House, and there are no honorable members in this House, who have done more to assist the Minister in getting the measure through than have members of the Opposition, and I believe the Minister would support that statement. The speeches made in this House have been of a minimum length, and the criticism from this side of the House has always been helpful, and it is, therefore, most unjustifiable for the honorable member for Denison to try to make a bit of cheap political capita] out of the situation by saying that our object is to kill the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- And the honorable member at the same time gave a sweeping glance around the benches on this side  of the House. I would point out to the Minister that the cost of adopting the proposal would be a mere bagatelle to this Commonwealth. I regret that we cannot test the opinion of the Committee by moving an amendment on the clause to wipe out the limitation as to date. Such an amendment would be ruled out of order, as it would involve an increase in the appropriation. I believe that if such an amendment were put to the vote, the sense of justice of the Committee would prevail, and these aged men and women would get their rights. This measure has been promised to them for many years, and, because they have been denied justice in the past, that is no reason why we should not start now to do justice to them. If others are to get the pension without making any contribution, then these men are not less entitled to it. This measure does bare justice to the lower paid men in the Service, while it deals generously with those in the higher branches, I agree with the principle that the Government should contribute half of the fund to be provided. On the one hand, however, certain persons in the Service who have been drawing high salaries will be able to retire on a pension of £400 a year; while, on the other, the great mass of retiring public servants, who have been receiving low salaries, will be entitled to only a small pension. Officers who have been in receipt of big salaries are to be handsomely treated; but when honorable members ask for pensions of £104 a year for officers who have reached the age of sixty-seven years, and even seventy years and more, the Government reply that the cost would be too great. I can only urge that the argument is a weak one. </para>

                    <para>.- Why does this clause insist upon . deserted wives being required to obtain an order of a Court? In an analogous case, in connexion with the administration of the Old-age Pensions Act, it is necessary to obtain an order of a Court for maintenance, or to secure some form or deed of separation, before a deserted wife may obtain the benefits of a pension. Considering that a Board is to be established to administer this measure, why should the Government insist upon the injured party being put to the necessity for taking the very public and painful proceeding of going to a Court, apparently for the purpose of obtaining an order for maintenance? </para>

                    <para>. - As- a matter of fact, this measure follows the precedent  of the New South Wales Act. But, in addition, there is the practical side to be considered. The Board will be called upon to administer this Act. One of its members will be a full-time officer. The others may or may not be; but the operations of the measure will cover the whole of the continent. How can the Board, sitting here in Melbourne, be expected to take evidence and hear cases which may arise all over the country ? Some tribunal must be provided. The Courts are accustomed to deal with maintenance cases, and the procedure is well known. It is objectionable, of course, for any person, in any circumstances, to be called upon to make such use of these tribunals. The point is, however, that this measure will deal with continental conditions, and that there must be a tribunal available in the neighbourhood where the person concerned resides. </para>

                    <para>.- I should like the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> to give attention to another phase of the question. The clause which he has moved to omit provides that the Act shall not apply to employees who have a vested or contingent right to a pension or retiring allowance under any other Act or State Act, which means that no one who comes under a State Act can derive any benefit from this particular measure. In New South Wales they have a similar Act, under which many public servants pay 4 per cent, of their salary in order to participate in the scheme; but no provision is made for their widows and children. In the event of an officer dying, his widow or children do not receive any pension, and I would like the Minister to give that phase of the matter consideration in connexion with the proposed new clause. It is hardly fair for them to be placed in a different position to other public servants, and I would like the Minister to make provision, in the event of death of such servants, that the widow and children should, at least, be in the same position as the widows and children of officers who will benefit under this scheme. </para>

I understood him to say, however, that the honorable member for Brisbane <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Cameron)</inline> raised the question of returned soldiers, and I would like to know if the soldiers' rights have been fully protected. </para>

When certain Tasmanian State public servants were transferred, an Act was not in force; but they came over with certain rights which were to be preserved to them. It was understood that they were to receive one month's pay for the first year of service, and one week's pay for every year of subsequent service; and I would like to know whether those rights have been protected. </para>

Tasmania, but, at least, one or two of the other States. The Bill provides that where there is an existing right by virtue of a Commonwealth or State Act, a public servant is not to receive the benefits provided under this measure.

In order that the officers transferred to the Commonwealth should not, by reason of their transfer, have to bear the loss of these gratuities, it was arranged with the State Governments that the payments should, from time to time, be made 'by the Commonwealth as an act of grace, subject to the State Government first concurring before any payment is made.

In New South Wales the three members of the Board devote all their time to its work, but inasmuch as the cost of administration will have to be paid out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, there will be a natural desire on the part of the responsible Minister to keep down expenditure as much . as is reasonable, and the two members of the Board other than the  President  may be asked to devote only a portion of their time to its work. </para>

                    <para>.- I agree with the Minister that it is necessary to economize as much as possible <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> the working of the Act, but I am doubtful whether the member of the Board who represents the employees of the Public Service may not be prejudiced both as a member of the Board and as a departmental officer, if he is asked to give two or three days a week to the service of the Board and the rest of his time to the duties of his departmental office, with a substitute filling his place during his absence at the Board meeting. It might happen that exception might be taken to an officer employed thus intermittently in two offices and that he might thereby incur some damage. The drawing up of regulations will entail  a  great deal of work on the members of the Board. </para>

                        <para>- Possibly half-a-dozen names may be submitted, and the officer chosen may be one occupying  a  very important departmental post. Such an officer could not give satisfaction both as a member of the Board and as  a  departmental official, since in the latter capacity a substitute would have to do his work for much of the time, and the public interests might suffer in consequence. It seems to me that it might be advisable to require the members of the Board to devote all their time to their duties, though I would not wish for that arrangement to be made if there were not sufficient work to justify it. </para>

                    <para>.- I have long had a feeling that this Government has in the past been noted for the number of Boards it has created, thus adding considerably to the expenditure of the Commonwealth.I do not like (he manner in which the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> has placed this matter before us to-night. I cannot see that there will bo any large amount of work for this Board to do, because public servants who retire each year will not number many thousand. Certainly the whole administration will call for considerably less effort than that involved, for instance, in the payment of old-age and invalid pensions. The great trouble with Boards is that they have a tendency to grow in size and cost as they get older, and I think we are entitled to a little information before we consent to this clause. As a member of the Public Accounts Committee I have been more than astonished at the fever there seems to be in the Departments to have Boards appointed, and, as I say, the cost is alarming. Only to-day I received , a letter from an important association - not a Labour association - asking for a list of the Boards appointed since the present Prime Minister. <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> took office, and, fearful of giving that association a shook, I wrote back to-day giving only a few. What will be the effect on the association when I tell it of the cost of the various Boards, I do not know. What does the Minister really intend by the appointment of this Board, with its  chairman  at £2,000 a year, its members at proportionate salaries, with its clerks, messengers and lady typistes? I suppose, however, that the appointment of these Boards finds positions for some people. At the present moment, we have not an idea within £5,000 of what this Board will cost ' per annum, and in my opinion the clause ought not to be passed until we have further information' in order that we may safeguard the public purse. I am not the only member of the community who is concerned at the enormous increase in the public expenditure. </para>

I ask that question because there is a doubt in the minds of some people, and in my own mind, as. to whether that is the case or not. As the public servants will pay about £300,000per annum into the fund, they should he represented on the Board by a permanent full-time member. In the earlier stages, there will he a great deal of administrative work to do, and, therefore, the Minister should consider the expediency of making the appointment on the lines I have indicated. </para>
