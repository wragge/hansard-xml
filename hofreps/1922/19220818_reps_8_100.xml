The copies that were made available for despatch to the other States the night before were not complete. I regret that it was not possible to hav( ready in time for the meeting of the House yesterday afternoon complete copies for the use of honorable members. The work of printing the Budget statement, however, has been completed, and copies are now available. </para>

            <para>, - The honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fowler)</inline> has consulted me about this motion, and I have told him of my views in regard to it. Shortly stated, I have no objection to the motion itself. I, and my colleagues, however, take the gravest possible exception to the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the Committee which is now inquiring into certain phases of the sugar control in so &#39; far as it includes the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse)</inline> and the honorable member for Robertson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fleming).</inline> Those two members, by their attitude, have put themselves outside the panel of persons who can be properly placed on, what may be termed, a judicial inquiry. It was not suggested for one moment, that the inquiry into the question of sugar control should be a partisan one, and that I and my colleagues and our party generally should be tried by a jury of our opponents as such. The suggestion was that an inquiry of a judicial character should be made. I am not censuring the honorable member for Swan and the honorable member for Robertson for any action they have taken in this House, and I hope they will acquit me of any such intention. They have done no more than they were entitled to do as members of this Parliament. I submit, however, that it is not proper that they should sit on this inquiry. I take no exception to the other members of the Committee, who happen to be our political- opponents, because they did not associate themselves with one of the charges which is to be the subject of inquiry by the Committee, and which amounts to a charge of corruption. I did not hoar what the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse)</inline> had to say, but I am informed that he went so far as to read what purported to be a document that had come from my  office,  and to have been in the handwriting of the secretary to the Prime Minister&#39;s Department. If that is so, then he stopped little  short,  if at all, of a definite charge of corruption against- either the Department, or a Minister, or the Government as a whole, and he did this after the question of sugar control had been referred to the Public Accounts Committee, of which he is a member. I think the honorable member will admit that, while he has a perfect right, as a member of this Parliament, to make any charges he pleases, he ought not to be a member of the jury which is to decide whether they are well, or ill, founded. He ought not to be both accuser and judge. I wish to make it perfectly clear that I take no exception whatever to the honorable member exercising his rights in this House in the freest possible manner. The honorable member for Robertson spoke in a more general way,, but he also associated himself, as he had a perfect right to do, with the charges made by  the Leader of the Country party. Having been the accusers, these two honorable members have no right to be the judges. As to the rest, I have only to say that the Government is anxious to expedite the inquiry, and to place every facility in its way. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I have not seen the officialreport of the proceedings of the Committee in connexion with its inquiry into the sugar question. I have seen only newspaper reports, but I am told that there is a suggestion that my honorable colleague <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene),</inline> who was in charge of the sugar business during the greater portion of the control period&#39;, is not to be called. I hope I have been misinformed. </para>

          <para>There is another matter to which. I must refer, and I trust that honorable members will bear with me while I do so, since it is of concern to every one. According to the newspaper reports of the examination of witnesses before the Committee, several members of it have been anxious to obtain information about Colonel Oldershaw. It is suggested that there is something sinister about his departure. It is suggested also that he was a man at once incompetent and almost corrupt. </para>

            <para>- Strictly speaking, the whole discussion is not really in order, since leave to move his motion has not yet been granted to the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fowler).</inline> Leave has to be granted without a dissentient voice, otherwise the motion cannot be moved. But debate at this stage is not in order. I did not know that the Prime Minister, when he rose, was going to make a speech. I thought that he was merely rising to make a formal statement. Honorable members know of the physical disability under which he labours, and how difficult it is to intervene. Leave must be given to the honorable member to submit his motion before the motion itself can be proposed. </para>

            <para>.- The Prime Minister has taken advantage ofthe motion submitted by the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fowler)</inline> to ventilate his dissatisfaction with the method in which the Public Accounts Committee is inquiring into the sugar question. I remind the right honorable gentleman that it was he who accepted the Committee&#39;s investigation, and, in fact, requested the House to defeat other motions brought forward so that the Committee in question might be directed to institute this inquiry. However, I can understand his objection to honorable members sitting as members of the Committee who have, by the expression of their views in this House, shown that they are prejudiced upon this question. That sort of thing would not be permitted in any inquiry. But when the Prime Minister was arguing that, upon this particular issue, he would have a majority against the Government on the Committee, let me point out that, even if the two members in question be replaced by two others, the Government will still have a majority. The numbers may be even, but the chairman&#39;s casting vote will be with the Government. If, however, exception is taken to the presence of two members of the Committee who have voiced their opinions upon the matter about to be investigated, I ask, without the slightest hesitation: &#34;What about the majority of honorable members who, by their votes in this House, supported the Government?&#34; In fact, whether it is or is not an unbiased Committee may be called in question. We generally expect matters of this kind to be decided from a judicial aspect by men who have not previously expressed opinions upon them; but, in this case, although one or two members of the Public Accounts Committee may have given vent to their feelings on the floor  of this House, other members of the Committee have just as plainly, by their votes in this Chamber, given expression to their feelings upon the subject-matter of their investigation. Honorable members of the Opposition did not wish the sugar question to be referred to the Committee, believing that it was a matter that should have been dealt with in the House, and that its reference to an inquiry was merely procrastination. The Prime Minister is not entitled to take exception to the evidence which has been given in reference to  Colonel Oldershaw,  or any one else. I was a member of the Public Accounts Committee from its inception until quite recently, and I know that the members of that Committee, no matter what subject they may be investigating, forget everything outside, and apply themselves solely to the matter before them, with a desire to give a verdict on the evidence submitted. Why, therefore, should not the actions of any public officer be the subject of inquiry? Why should not the Committee be permitted to ascertain why  Colonel Oldershaw  left Australia, and whether his typiste went with him? It is true that  Colonel Oldershaw  had a high position in the Army, and is of independent means, but we might just as well have no sugar inquiry at all if the whole subject is not to be dealt with on its merits. It ill becomes the Prime Minister to assail the Committee&#39;s methods. Once this House has acquiesced in the reference of the matter to the Public Accounts Committee no one is entitled to call in question the Committee&#39;s methods of conducting its inquiry. Of course, what I am now saying is quite apart from the matter of challenging the possibility of members of the Committee giving a biased judgment. In any case the Prime Minister is seeking to criticise a matter of his own creation. </para>

              <para>- I agree that these inquiries should be conducted by men who are not prejudiced,, and that it is regrettable that men should commit themselves beforehand upon the matter into which they were about to inquire, but nevertheless&#39; the fact remains that even after the Government had decided to remit this question to the Public Accounts Committee, every Government supporter gave a vote in this House upon the matter. Votes speak louder than words; they count. Therefore, if we support the Prime Minister in the stand he has taken against those members of the Public Accounts Committee who had already expressed their views on the sugar question in this Chamber, we must apply the same objection to every other member of the Committee. </para>

              <para>- The vote had every relation to those charges, and by their votes honorable members expressed their opinions. If I had been a member of a Committee which was about to commence an inquiry into the sugar question, realizing that I was supposed to be impartial and was expected to sift the evidence available, and come to a verdict upon it for submission to Parliament, I would have hesitated before giving a vote in this Chamber. Therefore, the Prime Minister&#39;s complaint is against the Committee as a whole. I have all along been opposed to referring the sugar question to the Public Accounts Committee, because I held the view- that it was a matter that the House should have decided upon its merits, and that an inquiry would only mean delay. I felt also that an investigation to be of any use to the public should be made by some person outside, and not by members of this Parliament. It ill becomes the Prime Minister, because certain evidence was given, to take exception to it. He is too late in raising his objection now. It is right that the public should know how matters have been conducted, and how persons in high positions have acted. Now, because the right honorable gentleman takes objection to certain evidence given before the Committee, he questions the Committee&#39;s methods. </para>

              <para>- There is no difference. I am perfectly entitled to put that view. There is no need for me to elaborate the views which I have already expressed. The Prime Minister has taken exception to two particular members of this House acting upon the Accounts Committee; but 1 want to know why he did. not do so immediatejly J after they had given utterance to the expressions to which he objects and which, he holds, disqualify them from continuing to act. It would have been far wiser and fairer to do so at that stage, rather than that those members! should have continued to attend and take part in the investigations of the Accounts Committee throughout this past week, day after day. The Prime Minister asks me, by interjection, at what stage he could have taken exception, following the delivery of the speeches of the two honorable members in question. It <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> well known to the House that those honorable members had spoken in very similar terms prior to the division upon my amendment. It waa immediately thereafter that the proper opportunity presented itself for the Prime Minister to challenge their right to take part in the Accounts Committee&#39;s investigation of the sugar business - that is, if the members were to be challenged at&#39; all. It comes with bad grace now for the Government to challenge them when they have become involved in continuous investigations covering a week, and after certain evidence has been adduced to which the Prime Minister takes exception. It appears that, as an outcome of the revelations made to the Accounts Committee, matters are not proceeding as smoothly and satisfactorily as the Government could &#39;wish. It seems that the evidence so far secured goes to show that the sugar business has not been conducted as it should have been. </para>

            <para>.- The attitude of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> is astounding. The members of the Accounts Committee to whom he has referred were not of the opinion - and they so expressed themselves at meetings of that Committee - that the sugar inquiry was one which the Committee should conduct. The  Chairman,  the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Eowler),</inline> will confirm that statement. The Country party considered that a Select Committee should be appointed to carry out the investigation. The Prime Minister is not correct in asserting that I have made any charge against the Government or any Government official. I have simply submitted certain matters of fact. I asked that the Government should appoint a Select Committee to make the fullest and deepest inquiry. I went so far as to say that I &#34; hoped to God &#34; that those people who had been indicated&#39; were not really implicated as they unhappily appeared to be. I am not prejudiced. I do not desire that any official of the Commonwealth should be revealed in a guilty light; but if any public servants have been guilty of wrong-doing, I advocated, and still desire, the appointment of a Select Committee to discover the guilty parties and learn all they have done. The state of mind in which I have carried on my duties as a member of the Accounts Committee has been absolutely unprejudiced. But was it not due to the attitude of the Prime Minister himself that the sugar investigation came to be placed in the hands of the Accounts Committee? While I and other members of my party sought earnestly to have a distinct and separate body of inquiry appointed - so taking the subject out of the hands of the permanent Committee; to which. I belong - the Government refused to accept the proposition. It was unquestionably the will of the Prime Minister which caused the inquiry to be  taken up by the Accounts Committee.  invite, the Prime Minister -to read again those remarks of mine which he characterizes as charges, and I shall be content to leave it to him to say, fairly and truly, whether I&#39; uttered one word which can be regarded as the expression of a prejudiced mind. The Prime Minister&#39;s attitude and accusations are a reflection upon the Accounts Committee as a whole. What an astounding position it is - after the Prime Minister has made use of every form, and method, privilege, and opportunity which he has at his command to prevent the appointment of a Select Committee, and; has succeeded in handing over the- investigation to one of the permanent Committees of this Parliament - that he should take exception to certain members of that body continuing to act thereon, for the reason that: they happen to have certain informs tion! The possession of this information he described as prejudice.. The. Prime Minister, would seek to make the House believe, that we. members who have been impugned possess all the prejudice  and, hatred that exists in this Parliament.. I. assert that. I have no such feelings towards any member of the Public Service, or of Parliament, or of the Ministry. I have no desire to make charges against any individual inside or outside of Parliament or the Service. Indeed, I cannot see why, if the Prime Minister himself is not deeply prejudiced, he should take such an objection as has been raised this morning. It has-been rightly asserted by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> that every member of this Chamber who voted in the division upon his motion for the reduction of the price of sugar must be equally prejudiced, in that we, by our votes, adopted at definite attitude in the matter. If the possession of information which is so serious as to war- rant inquiry disqualifies a member of the </para>

What is behind- the&#39; attitude of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> ? &#39; He would not have a specially selected Committee; he deliberately pre- ferred and chose that theJoint Parliamentary Committee of Public Accounts should take up the investigation of the sugar business. Now, in the first place-, that Committee was originally appointed by the Government. Its <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> was their own choice. It appears at this stage that there are likely to be more sensational disclosures than could have been dreamed of by the Government when they promised that the inquiryshould. be placed in the hands of the Accounts Committee. How did they come to make such apromise? Was it not merely in order to- carry, them over a troublesome motion of censure ? The Government have now climbedthat stile ; they are on the safe side of it. They gave effect to their undertaking.. The Committee has commenced its inquiry. Why should&#34; they not now proceed to the next logical step and take the inquiry out of the hands of the Committee? They have survived the censureattack ; they are safe. I say to the Prime. Minister, &#34; You have the numbers.. Abolish, the Committee if its investigations threaten to produce&#39; results which are likely to, be obnoxious to you.. Put an end. to. the investigation-. You have the: power; use it!&#34; I have never before heard of a Government placing a specificinvestigation in. the hands of a permanent, Committee of Parliament and then taking exception to its <inline font-style="italic">personnel.</inline></para>

Therefore they are partisans; and the majority of them are partisans of the Government. Why should not the Government now take the obvious step? I tell them that they have the numbers. </para>

          <para>As for Colonel Oldershaw, I have no objection to that gentleman. I do not wish to implicate anybody. Bnt what is the Prime Minister&#39;s method of defending Colonel Oldershaw? He says, in effect, &#34; This gentleman is an officer of our Army, or he was an officer on active service, and, while so serving, he performed gallant deeds somewhere, somehow, at some time. And, in addition, he is a man of independent means.&#34; From all that we have heard of the sugar business, I am bound to say, with respect to that latter aspect, that no man having either direct or indirect connexion with the sugar control - unless he possesses absurd notions of honesty - can be expected to be other than a gentleman of independent means. </para>

I am bound to accept that statement; but the Government still have the casting vote, and thus they can get or do whatever they desire, if they only take care to manage that casting vote properly. The  Chairman  of the Accounts Committee, the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fowler),</inline> desires that the Committee shall be given special opportunities to do the work which the Government have given it to do. Under cover of his notice of motion, however, a denunciation is hurled at the procedure of the Committee, and at the state of mind of certain of its members; and, in effect, regarding everything having to do with it. The Government do not now want the Accounts Committee to do that which they have only just authorized it to do. I do not know, nor have I troubled to lead or ask, what any specific members of the Committee have done or said. I take it for granted, however, that in connexion with every reference to the </para>

          <para class="block">Accounts Committee there is bound to be a full and definite inquiry; there is certain to be gathered every possible shred of evidence; and that evidence is bound to be carefully and minutely sifted. As for the partisan relationships of the members of the Committee, those on the one side will not only be anxious to maintain high standards of public morality, but will be equally earnest in their endeavour, at any and all times, to turn out the Government which appointed them. It is inevitable that they should endeavour to bring forth every fragment of evidence which might be calculated to discredit the Government. On the other hand, those members on the other side, while equally zealous to safeguard public morality, will be just as keen upon adducing anything and everything which will go to establish the credit of the Government in their dealings. They will go to the limit in their efforts to defend themselves, their party, and their Government, by trying to produce, or subvert, or suppress evidence. If there was to be any honest investigation it could be made, not by partisans, but only by a properly constituted Court not connected with any of the parties in this House. What is the use of the Prime Minister rising at this stage and objecting to what members of the Country party or members of the Labour party may have said? What does it matter whether members of the Accounts Committee remain silent or speak? In any case, Nationalist members mean to defend the Government and themselves against any accusation or suspicion, and it is equally true that the honorable members who represent on the Committee the Country party and the Labour party will do their best to produce evidence that will traduce the Government and purify and glorify themselves and their parties at the same time. Therefore, what is the use of squealing at this hour? The matter has been referred to the Committee, and the investigation must go on. So far as members on this side are concerned, all evidence that can be producedwill be produced. At this stage it does not become the Prime Minister or the Leader of the Opposition to either assail or defend any members who new constitute the Accounts Committee, to which this inquiry was in-  trusted by the Government, or any individual who may -give evidence before the Committee. If any man wishes to defend  Colonel Oldershaw,  there is a proper place in which to do it; that place is not this Chamber, but before the Committee which is making the investigation. If any man&#39;s character is to be assailed it should be assailed, not in this Chamber under cover of parliamentary privilege, but before the Committee, where he may have an opportunity to defend himself in a regular way. The Committee can investigate this matter, and nothing should be said to prevent it continuing its inquiry to the end and reporting its verdict to the House. When the Committee does submit its verdict, we can, in this Chamber, sum up the pros and cons, but, at the time, the objections and accusations which have arisen out of the motion proposed by the honorable member for Perth are entirely out of place. </para>

I have previously stated that when a proposal to investigate the sugar transactions was mentioned before the Public Accounts Committee some time ago, I took strong exception to the Committee having anything to do with such an investigation. This was a matter I said that, in my opinion, should rightly be referred to a Select Committee. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member for Swan also took exception to the Committee inquiring into the sugar question, because he said that such an inquiry would take too long. The ground of my objection was that the matter was a partisan one, and should be threshed out on the floor of the House. Members of the Country party asked for the appointment of a Select Committee. The Prime Minister, being, apparently, afraid of a Select Committee, asked the House to refer the question to the Public Accounts Committee, consisting of members of both Houses, his object being, no doubt, that when the report of the Committee came before the House, he could browbeat honorable members. </para>

              <para>- Yes; but the Prime ^Minister could not charge members of the Select Committee with not having a right to inquire into a matter when the House had specially elected them to carry out the investigation. Had a Committee been specially appointed by the House to investigate the sugar transactions the Prime Minister could not have challenged its <inline font-style="italic">bona fides.</inline> But as the matter has been referred in an extraordinary way to the Public Accounts Committee, the Prime Minister now raises an objection. He has risen in his place and made a deliberate attempt to close the mouths of the representatives of the people. The effect of his action, if carried into effect, will be that in future no member of the House will be prepared to take- a seat on the Public Accounts Committee or the Public Works Committee, as he is not to be allowed to say in the House those things which he believes he should say. The value of these Committees is being absolutely destroyed. The Government are seeking to make them partisan Committees, and to convert them into mere tools of the Ministry. If honorable members are not to be allowed to express themselves as representatives of the people because they happen to be members of a Standing Committee, no man with any independence will in future take a seat on such a Committee. Every honorable member who sits in these Committees has a right to make his finding on the evidence adduced, and to come into the House, either before or after an inquiry, and speak on any question raised here, so long as he does not bring before the House or the public any information that was privately divulged, before the Committee. I defy the Prime Minister, or anybody else, to say that any member of the Public Accounts Committee has divulged to the House or to the public one word of evidence that came to his knowledge in private as a member of the Committee. The <inline font-weight="bold">Chairman (Mr. Fowler)</inline> will bear me out in that statement. No member of the Committee has  given away any secrets. The Prime Minister&#39; is trying now to still furtherdebase this Parliament by making every member of the Committee his tool, and to prevent us from sitting on the Committee and, at the same time, doing, our duty as representatives of the people. </para>

Under cover of the motion moved by the  Chairman  of the Committee, the Prime Minister has attacked the Committee in such a way as to prejudice beforehand its finding. Can the Committee be considered to be getting a fair deal when the Prime Minister tells the House and the public that the Committee is prejudiced ? What is the reason for the. Prime Minister&#39;s attitude? Is the evidence that has been taken by the Com mittee not tending in the direction that he desires it to. go? Or is it that the Committee&#39;s reports on the War Service Homes were not to the liking of. the right: honorable: gentleman?, </para>

              <para>- The Public Accounts Committee was created for the purpose of inquiring into any matter affecting the public finances of Australia, and we are doing that to the best of our ability. Now the Prime Minister accuses us of inquiring into one matter from a partisan stand-point, and he is . trying to prejudice the finding of the Committee in, the eyes of the public and the House. It is utterly unfair and improper for any Minister, particularly the Leader of the House, to prejudice the finding of a Committee before it is given. We are trying honestly to do our duty. </para>

              <para>- The Minister cannot see the difference: between a man representing his constituency in this House when he has not only a right, but an absolute duty to say what he believes to be true, and a man making a judicial inquiry in another sphere. We can,, as honorable men, make a proper inquiry into the matter that is before the Committee, and. at the same time express our opinion in the House on matters that are being threshed out here. If, and when, the Committee obtains the full facts, we shall be in a position to express definitely out opinion. The finding of the Committee will be such as the evidence warrants. That is all we seek to achieve. The right honorable gentleman said, also, that memben of the Committee were questioning Colonel Oldershaw&#39;s honour: There has been no question of Colonel Oldershiaw&#39;s honour. The Prime Minister must know that newspaper reports of evidence may create an impression one way or the other ; but without any knowledge of what has transpired in the Committee the, right honorable gentleman accepts the newspaper reports becausethey suit his purpose, and uses them to browbeat members and cast a reflection on. the Committee. </para>

            <para>.- I &#39;remind the House that the Public Accounts Committee may continue its inquiry regardless of the objections of the Prime Ministeror of the House. The Act under which the Committee is constituted gives it full power to investigate of its own volition the financial transac tionsof any Department. Therefore, the mere fact of the Prime Minister objecting cannot interfere with the &#39;inquiry. The only point in dispute is as to whether the Committee . should be given the aright to sit during the sittings of the House. </para>

              <para>- It is a bad precedentf or the Prime Minister to object to the personnel of the iCommittee, seeing that he was prepared to accept it rather than a Select Committee. Had the Country party voted solidly with the Opposition, there wouldhave been a Select Committee appointed; but the Government won, and have obtained . the fruits they wereseeking. I may.say that the  Chairman  of the Public Works Committee <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> is very hostile to the building of the Federal Capital at this time, and so are other members of the Committee, including the honorable member for Bass <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jackson)</inline> and the honorable member for Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mackay).</inline> Did we here raise any objection to those men serving on the Piiblic Works Committee in the investigation of the Federal Capital question, simplybecause they had expressedtheir opinions in the House? As a matter of fact, the Public Works Committee &#39;has inquired into the FederalCapital matter, and reportedfavorably. <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> feel confident that the members of the Public Accounts Committee arehonorable enough togive.averdict on the evidence. I myself hold . strong -opinions -on certain matters, butevery man has sufficient honour to be guided byevidence. Until a man shows that he is utterly dishonest, weshould stand by the Committeeas a whole If &#39;the evidence does not suit the Government, that is not . the fault . of the Committee; if the . newspaper reportsof the proceedings of the Committee throw a shadow on certain transactions connected withsugar, the Committee cannot surely be blamed for that. </para>

          <para class="block"> Mr.RILEY. - The press reports may be highly coloured, but the Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> will have an opportunity to go before the Committee and combat any evidence already given. Personally, I feel confident that the Committee, as now composed, will be fair, and we ought to allow them to bring in their report.

            <para>.- I shall not touch on the subject-matter of the inquiry, because I think that ought to be left to the Public Accounts Committee. I have listened to speeches by two members of the Committee, and I take strong exception to their practically prejudging the case on which they were asked to give an impartial verdict. It has been said that nobody objected to this procedure by members of the Committee; but, as a matter of fact, the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> did object, and, had he not done so, I should. I do. not object, of course, to the words used by the two members of the Committee to whom I refer, but I do object to their continuing to sit on the Committee after they have prejudged the question submitted to them. The judgment in such a case ought to be left to the Committee itself. No member of &#39;the Public Accounts Committee who has spoken has told us whether the press reports of the proceedings are correct or not. I desire to congratulate the  Chairman  of the Public Accounts Committee <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fowler)</inline> on the manner in which he has submitted his proposal to the House, and his actions generally in connexion with this investigation ; but he, in plain language, told us that before the Government put the matter into their hands the Committee had started to inquire into the whole sugar question. </para>

              <para>- If the honorable member for Robertson blames the Government for not sending the matter to a Select Committee, he ought to resign his position on the Public Accounts Committee. Personally, I think it is wrong for the press to criticise or comment on the actions of any Committee while an investigation is proceeding. It is true that this inquiry is an open one, but it would have .been better for members of the Committee to refrain from comments until a definite report had been presented on the question of price, to which they were asked to give special attention. </para>

The whole position reminds me of Dooley, who, when he had a man before him on trial, described the accused as the greatest criminal on earth and sentenced him to imprisonment for life, and then said that the next thing was to try him. The members of the Committee, however, are not trying the Government, but are trying every honorable member of this Chamber who, like myself, gave an impartial vote. </para>

            <para>, - We have witnessed a most remarkable spectacle, one almost as remarkable  a9  that presented during the debate on the sugar question the other day. We then saw Ministers almost crying with anxiety and rage, and now, while the question is being considered by a Committee - which was not asked for by the House, but was forced upon it against the deliberate request of the party in this Corner - the Prime Minister endeavours to interfere with the Committee doing its duty. He suggests that two members of the Com- mittee, out of a total of nine or eleven, have prejudged the case, and that the result must be biased. This the Prime Minister does in spite of the fact, as the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> has pointed out, that the Government already have a majority on the Committee. What are the facts ? This is only a device to delay, to further hoodwink the public, and to gag and smother up the whole evidence in the matter. </para>

              <para>- I desire to withdraw unreservedly anything which is offensive to this House. Did I ask for this matter to be referred to the Public Accounts Committee? My desire was for a judicial Committee, and the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.</inline> Prowse) moved for a Select Committee, no member of which would have spoken on the matter in the House. The Public Accounts Committee was forced on us against our will by the deliberate action of the Government, and I do not see why the Government, now they find they have made a mistake, should seek to retrace their steps and do something to burke inquiry for a slightly longer time. I do not think that the public of Australia would be satisfied with the judgment of a packed Committee. The Government apparently desire to remove certain members of the Public Accounts Committee who may be able to probe more deeply than others into the matter. What is wrong with finding out the truth? All the evidence given is on oath; and can any honorable member point to one question or one statement by a member of the Committee, as published in the press, which at all shows bias or prejudice? If the newspapers care to make comment, that has nothing to do with members of the Committee, and I do not see why they should be held responsible in that regard. If the House is going to indulge the Prime Minister&#39;s fancy, then it seems to me that public life in this country has become debased to a degree that the people will not tolerate any longer. We do not suggest that the Ministry is in fault; wo suggest that there may have been big losses which can be traced, and we contend that it is the proper duty of this Chamber to find out who is responsible. If the Ministry has nothing to fear; if its hands are absolutely free, why should it. lend colour to suspicion by taking action such as has been taken this morning by the Prime Minister? </para>

              <para>- The Public Accounts Committee was created by the House, and any Committee of members of this House must necessarily be to some degree of aparilsan character. It is absurd to think it possible to get a Committee of this House that is not partisan. I hope the House will see that its honour is not dragged in the dust by the removal from the Committee of two members who have done nothing that is dishonorable. The honorable members in question merely did their duty in putting before the House the case as they saw it, and if the House lends itself to the attempt of the Prime Minister to bludgeon it into removing from the Committee the honorable member for Swan and the honorable member forRobertson then the sooner it comes to an end the better. </para>

            <para>.- It is remarkable that the Government, who have complained again and again about the delay in getting on with business, should have raised this question this morning just as &#39;the road was cleared for them, and so have&#39; created other obstacles. On Wednesday last very serious statements were made in this House by members of the Country party, and those statements were backed up by certain documents which suggested something very remarkable in connexionwith the sugar control. It is only fair, however, to state that the Country party did not ask that the charges which they made should be referred to the Public Accounts Committee. They asked that they should be separated from the general question of sugar, and should be made the subject of a judicial inquiry. The Government, however, absolutely turned down that proposal. </para>

              <para>- Unfortunately, the Country party  never  votes solidly upon any question. That fact, however, has no bearing on the point immediately at issue. The Government refused to separate from the general question to be referred to the Accounts Committee the serious statements, involving certain charges, which had been made by members of the Country party. I would remind the Prime Minister that those statements were made on Wednesday last, and that he then offered no reply to them. Why did he fail to do so? I agree that those who make or suggest certain charges should not properly be appointed to deal with them, but I want to know why the Prime Minister did not object when these statements were made on Wednesday last.  Why has he allowed two days to elapse before taking action? Why has he taken action only now that evidence which does not suit the Government has been given before the Committee. It seems to me that the right honorable gentleman has intervened at this stage because facts are being brought out by the Committee that the Government desire to have smothered up. That is whythe Government object now. to the constitution of the Court. The Prime Minister says that the Court is biased because of statements made by certain of its members in this Chamber on Wednesday last. The right honorable gentleman ought to be the last to object to prejudiced tribunals. I well remember how, when men were standing ; on trial for their lives he went all over the country prejudicing their case. Even the worst criminal in the land is entitled to have his case heard without prejudice, but on that memorable occasion the Prime Minister overlooked that all-important principle. </para>

          <para class="block"> It seemsto me that the Prime Minister to-day has not only made a tactical blunder, but has exposed himself to the severest criticismof this country. In the midst of an inquiry - at a time when it is evident that the evidence being adduced does not suit the Government - he wants to change the constitution of the Court or Committee. He objects to it because things are notbeing smothered up by it. The right honorable gentleman made a great blunder in allowing the Public Accounts Committee to dealwith this question. He should have referred it to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Mark</inline> Sheldon, who could have held a secret inquiry in the Solomon Islands. That would have suited the Government.

              <para>- I see the point too clearly to suit the purpose of honorable members opposite. These speeches were made last Wednesday, yet the Prime Minister allowed the matter to go to the Committee. The position is that since last Wednesday something more has happened. Since then there has been brought to light evidence which does not suit the Government. Hence what the Prime Minister did not do last Wednesday he seeks to do to-day. That is the point. He has talked about pre-judging the case. As a matter of fact, he is pre-judging the verdict of the Committee. He is trying to prejudice the Committee in the eyes of the country ; he .is (suggesting to the people that the Committee cannot, and will not, bring in .an -unbiased report. He sees the writing, on the wall. Already, he sees -that the report is going to be against the Government. I repeat that the only sort of investigation that would suit, honorable members opposite, and the Prime Minister in particular, so far as the sugar question is concerned, is another <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Mark</inline> Sheldon inquiry, like &#39;that which took place in regard to the shipbuilding contract. </para>

            <para>.- A great deal df unnecessary heat has been imported into this debate. I understand that the motion now before the Chair is that permission be given to the Committee, so far as members of this House are concerned, to meet while the Parliament is sitting. I suggest to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> that, having ventilated the matter of the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the Committee, he should be satisfied. From my point of view, the position is very simple. The whole question of the sugar .control has been relegated to the Public Accounts Committee, whose duty it is to inquire into all the transactions and to bring up its report to the House. Honorable members seem to forget that it is only a report that the Committee is called upon to make. The Committee will not give a verdict on any question. It will not &#91;pronounce judgment on any .matter. It will simply bring up a report presenting its views, on the evidence. I am not- aware.&#39;of the&#39; <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the Committee, but I am quite satisfied to leave the matter in its hands. The members of the Committee, I understand,* belong to different parties in the House, and even if any member of it has .expressed an opinion with regard to the sugar transactions, I believe that he will honestly do his best to get at the facts and to pronounce an honest opinion on the facts as found.  Lt  is to be regretted that two members of the Committee should have expressed themselves as strongly &#39;as the &#39;honorable member for Swan. ;(Mr. <inline font-style="italic">Prowse) and</inline> the honorable member for Robertson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fleming)</inline> did regarding the subject-matter of the inquiry. I think, however, that they are honorable men, and that their presence on the Committee having been challenged, they would refuse to act on the inquiry if they felt that in view of all the facts they were unable to do their duty straightforwardly and honestly. If they are willing still to remain members of the Committee .and -to inquire into the sugar transactions, I believe that they will honestly do their  work. The honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fowler)</inline> is  chairman  of the Committee, and I am sure that, having a clear view of his duty - which .is to make a searching inquiry and to see that everything that  can be brought to light is brought &#39;to light - he will &#39;take good care that that is done. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I would also remind the House, -and more particularly the Prime Minister, that when the investigation has been completed and the report of the Committee is submitted for our consideration, we shall have before us, not only the report itself, but the evidence on which it is founded. Thus every honorable member will be in a position to judge the value of the report. If it is. prejudiced, if it is not a well-balanced judgment, that fact will become apparent to those who make a careful examination of the evidence. The more prejudiced the report of the Committee, the easier it will be, on the evidence, to make plain that fact. I therefore think that this matter having been discussed and ventilated, nothing more need be done. I am confident that the Government have nothing whatever to hide. If a member of the Committee is prejudiced and believes that there is something which the Government wish to hide, he will be all the keener in his desire that every scrap of available evidence shall be brought before the Committee and duly considered. This matter having been ventilated, the Committee should go on with its work and send&#39; in its report at the earliest possible moment. </para>

            <para>. - I propose to add only a few words to this debate. I suggest that the trouble in this case has arisen entirely from the fault of the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse)</inline> and the honorable member for Robertson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fleming).</inline> The position is that the Public Accounts Committee  had commenced its inquiry before Wednesday last, when those honorable members spoke. It had set. out on its deliberations. </para>

              <para>- There were to be two parts to the inquiry. The first portion related to the price of sugar. It is a matter of pure arithmetic. There is no mystery about it. Once the figures are put before the Committee they could say &#34;aye&#34; or &#34;nay&#34; to them. But there was to be another portion to the inquiry, and from my point of view it waa the more important. It was to be an investigation of the transactions of the Government in regard to sugar, and it was upon that particular part of the proposed inquiry that expressions of opinion were made on the floor of the House and by the honorable members for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse)</inline> and Robertson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fleming).</inline> Their remarks, although not expressed in actual terms, nevertheless bore all the inference that there was corruption in these transactions. </para>

              <para>- It seems to me that having entered upon such an investigation, it was not a correct thing for any member of the Public Accounts Committee to express an opinion on the floor of the House and still remain a member of that Committee. I have no objection to honorable members expressing whatever views they please, which they have a perfect right to do; but from the stand-point of the amenities of public life I do not think it is the right thing for any honorable member who is a member of a judicial board of inquiry - for such in reality, if not technically, the Public Accounts Committee is - to express opinions on the floor of the House in regard to a matter of such moment to the honour, not only of the Government, but also of the Public Service, and still remain a member of that Committee. However, it is a matter for the individual consciences of the two honorable members in question. If they feel that they can justify to themselves and to the public acting in the dual capacity of accuser and judge they must make out their own justification. </para>

To explain this matter was my real purpose in rising to speak. There is probably no man in Australia at the present time who knows as much about the details of all these transactions as I do, and I thought it very likely that the Committee would desire to call me as a witness. </para>

              <para>- Consequently I approached the  chairman  of the Committee, and said - I do not know whether it was the proper thing for me to do - that if it was desired to call me as a witness I would like to have from him some indications of the lines upon which the Committee would like to examine me so that I might be able to give the fullest information after having refreshed my memory from the files in the possession of the Department of Trade and Customs. I think I am not revealing any confidence when I say these things, .because across the floor of the chamber the  chairman  of the Committee nodded to me as much as to say that he -wished me to answer the question raised &#39; by the honorable member for Robertson. The  chairman,  when I approached him, told me that it was not the practice of the Public Accounts Committee to .summon Ministers to give evidence, but that he would let me know the Committee&#39;s decision. I got word yesterday that I was not to be called as a witness. </para>

I shall be only too pleased to give all the information at my disposal, because I can throw light upon some aspects of the question upon which apparently the Committee have not yet been able to get evidence. All that I need say further is that I hope the Committee will endeavour to inform its mind in regard to all the details. The Government have nothing to hide, good, bad, or indifferent.

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline>BRENNAN  (Batman)  1,12.38&#93;.-  We may cheerfully accept the assurance of the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> that he knows more about not only the sugar question, . but also all other matters than does any other honorable member. I will not presume to disturb that self-satisfaction he has manifested on this and other matters. I notice this, however, that the Government in this discussion appeared as prosecutors, but I think they will before its conclusion assume the <inline font-style="italic">r&#244;le</inline> of defendants. Indeed, the very mild-mannered utterance of the Minister for Defence is a plain indication that they have already departed from that truculent attitude which the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> took up when he first mooted the matter this morning. Ho informed honorable members then that he would not submit to having certain honorable members on the Public Accounts Committee dealing with the sugar question, and that he would not tolerate that they should be at once the accusers and the judges. Now, however, the Minister for Defence, in a mild, gracious, and almost generous manner, says that it is entirely a matter for the honorable members themselves as to whether they should continue to sit on this inquiry or not. He says that it is, in effect, although not technically, a judicial inquiry. My answer to that is that, neither technically nor in fact, is any inquiry conducted by the Public Accounts Committee on the sugar question to be regarded as being of &#38; judicial character. It is the essence of the matter that it is not, and to say that, since it is a judicial inquiry, certain things would be improper, is begging the question and missing the point. The members of the Public Accounts Committee have a roving commission to inquire into the sugar position and report to this House. They are essentially collectors of information, and in the very terms of their appointment, their partisan  character is recognised. Why are members chosen from the Labour party, from the Government .side, and from the Country party if it is not thought that, in dealing with questions referred to the Public Accounts Committee, they are likely to be influenced by their political preconceptions and views. That tendency is recognised when they sit as a Committee. It is suggested that it would be indecent for the honorable members for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse)</inline> and Robertson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fleming)</inline> to continue sitting as members of that Committee after having exercised their right, as it was their duty to do, to discuss in this House the matter referred to tha Committee. It was open to the Prime Minister, if he thought fit, to prevent the matter coming up for discussion in the House. If he controls the Housealthough he has done it of late with infinite difficulty, misgiving, and anxiety - it was within his power to prevent this question being discussed here while it was the subject of investigation by the Public Accounts Committee. Because, when any matter comes forward for discussion in the Chamber, despite what we may say to the contrary, it is considered largely upon party lines, for the simple reason that honorable members view all political questions on the lines of policy for which they have been elected, and in which it must be&#34; presumed -they believe. Yet we are expected to accept the view that honorable- members are to hold their tongues because their opinions  are unpalatable to the Government. &#34;So faT from the attitude of the honorable members referred to being an act of indecency, it is an act of gross political indecency on the part of the Prime Minister, when evidence is given which is unpalatable to him, to challenge the right of certain honorable members to sit upon the inquiry. I say it is an act of grave political indecency, because of what will happen in the near future when we go before our masters. In the event of the report of the Committee on the question of sugar being favorable to the Government, the Prime. Minister will say, &#34; It has gone to the Committee of Public Accounts, a body created by this Parliament, and eminently fitted to deal with the subject, and they have found so-and-so. There is no cavilling at their decision. </para>
          <para class="block">
            <inline font-style="italic">We</inline>must &#39;accept it. It is an extraparliamentary Committee, and has given an unbiased and well-informed decision.&#34; But if the report on the evidence is unfavorable and by inference condemnatory of the Government, the right honorable gentleman and his Ministers will, on every platform, use the contention that we heard this morning, namely, that the Committee was biased and improperly constituted. The right honorable gentleman is feeling his way carefully. He looks ahead and &#39;sees what is likely to happen when this matter is agitated throughout the country, as it will be; and he asks, &#34;How may I safeguard myself and the Government in the event of the evidence and the report of the Committee being unfavorable to us? Let me proceed to discredit the members of the Committee early, so that, later, I may say to the people, &#39; I told you that this Committee was prejudiced and .biased :and utterly unfit to discharge their duties.&#39; &#34; The honorable .member for Fawkner &#39;(Mr. Maxwell) has said that, now that he has ventilated the matter, &#39;the Prime Minister ought to be satisfied. I suggest that since he has ventilated it, land has Sheard the comments of honorable members, &#39;the right honorable gentleman ought to &#39;be very far from &#39;satisfied. &#39;Has &#39;object and iris policy stand exposed. :Possibly, &#39;the Government .&#39;are not without hope &#39;that this indecent criticism of a Committee engaged in the delicate inquiry which has been submitted &#60;to &#39;it, that this attack upon certain .of its members, will have a steadying influence on its report. I do not see eye to &#34;eye &#39;politically  with the honorable member for .Swan <inline font-weight="bold">,(Mr. Prowse)</inline> or the honorable member .for Robertson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fleming);</inline> but I have sufficient respect for them as members, and personally, to believe that they will not be steadied, or swayed, or. modified, or mollified in the slightest degree by the attitude of the Government. &#39;The Prime Minister has made out no case. He has shown himself to be very much perturbed. He has indicated that the Government are seriously anxious about the results of the inquiry. Sugar has been a very painful subject. It will prove to be a very dangerous one upon which to face the elections; and the Government see no other solace but to take advantage of their position to attack the Public Accounts Committee. </para>

            <para>. -  Looking at the whole matter from a practical stand-point, I think that no one cam fail to come to the decision that the Government had considerable courage, at all events, in referring the sugar inquiry to the Accounts Committee. It cannot be suggested that the Committee, constituted as it is, is one which would be biased in favour of the Government. Its members are undoubtedly honorable men ; no one suggests the contrary. But we cannot shut our eyes to the fact that they do not belong to one party, and that the majority of its members cannot be accused of being supporters of the Government. However, the Government said-, &#34; We have nothing to fear. We will refer the. sugar investigation to a Committee the political views of which, so far as the majority are concerned, are not. favorable to ourselves.&#34; Members of the Committee. I repeat, are honorable men; but, at the same time, we cannot ignore the fact that the honorable member for Robertson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fleming)</inline> and the honorable member for Swan (Mr.Prowse) have strongly expressed themselves in this Chamber uponthe subject-matter which, as members of the Accounts Committee, they are to investigate, and upon which they are to record a finding. </para>

              <para>- Of course, I did; but I am not a member of the Accounts Committee. The fact cannot be ignored that the Leader of the Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> brought up certain phases of the question, and supported them with documentary matter; and that he made a very strong and bitter speech.  His  general objective appeared to me to be to surround the Government dealings with suspicion; and to cast innuendoes of corruption, so far as the transactions of the Government were concerned. That, I say, was the atmosphere which he sought to create. The honorable member for Swan supported his leader, and did his part in expanding the atmosphere of suspicion. He had known that the Committee which was to be given- the task of investigating the sugar business would be the Public Accounts. Committee, of which he was a member. I speak with some experience when I say that the practice of members of Committees is to refrain from addressing Parliament on the subject-matter under reference while that matter is actually being investigated. They rightly prefer to have a completely open mind; they are careful not to commit themselves. </para>

              <para>- It is a Committee which has been asked to make various specific investigations, and whether it be a Select Committee or otherwise, the same principle applies. It is all very well to say that the Committee is only an investigatory body. Does any one doubt that, when once a Committee has conducted its inquiries and has arrived at a conclusion, its findings do not largely, if not completely, regulate the whole position? </para>

              <para>- Whether it is a unanimous or a majority finding, I say that the whole position becomes largely prejudiced by that finding. When members of a Committee have to come to a decision as to certain doubtful matters presented to it, and where it is a question of interpretation, that interpretation may be influenced by the unconscious operation of the mind, and, particularly, members will be influenced by views to which they have committed themselves. And;  if  an atmosphere of suspicion has been engendered, that unconscious working of the mind may have been seriously affected. I was pleased when the Governmentsub mi t ted the sugar business to a body such as the Accounts Committee. &#39;So far as&#39; the honorable members for Robertson and Swan are concerned, I have sufficient confidence in them to believe that what, they do will be conscientiously performed. They must guard themselves, however, against unconscious prejudice. I think, that matters should now be permitted to proceed, remembering, however, that  it cannot be said of the Government that they referred the investigation to a body which has a majority favoring them. </para>

            <para>.- There are just one or two points to which I feel called upon to reply. There has been a complete misunderstanding regarding the position which I have adopted in the matter of calling upon Ministers to give evidence before the Accounts Committee. Hitherto, the practice has been not to call Ministers, for the obvious reason that the Committee is not supposed or intended to sit in judgment on matters of Ministerial policy. But, where the Committee necessarily requires the presence of a Minister in order to carry out its work, there is no reason why a Minister should not be called upon to give evidence. So where and when the Committee considers it necessary, Ministers will be notified. I should add that if, at any time, a Minister desired to give evidence there is no reason why he should not be permitted to do so. (With respect to the attacks made upon  Colonel Oldershaw,  I know of nothing which has been said or done in the Committee that can be construed in that direction. It has been made to appear that attacks have been made on that gentleman. It has been my duty, however, as  chairman,  to see that our work is carried on fairly and properly; and, where a question -has been put occasionally which might appear to be a reflection-- </para>

          <para class="block">This measure has already been mentioned in this House on several occasions, and I think honorable members are well, acquainted with the reason for its introduction and what is sought to be achieved by it. It is a great pity that long before this the Commonwealth did not make provision, such as has been made by almost every other civilized country in the world, for the granting of retiring allowances to members of the Naval and, Military Forces who, through one cause or another, retire from the service. The conditions in both those services are somewhat different from those which obtain in every other walk of life. Members of the Naval and Military Forces, if they have not risen to a certain rank after a certain period of service, automatically pass out of the service. For instance, when a lieutenant in the Army reaches the age of forty-eight he automatically passes from the active <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> the retired list. Similarly, a captain, when he reaches a slightly greater age, automatically passes out of the service, and so on through the various ranks of the Army. The same conditions apply to officers in the Navy; if they have not obtained a certain rank at the prescribed age, they automatically leave the service. In that respect, the conditions are different from those in any other calling. It is true that the civil servants are automatically retired at the age of sixty-five years, and there is a pro&#39;posal in the Government programme to bring down a Bill to provide for pensions for civil servants, and members of the Naval and Military Forces. But that scheme will be on a contributory basis. Every other civilized nation with any considerable Naval or Military Forces, has made provision for a retiring allowance to its officers. All that the Commonwealth has done in the past, when certain members of the permanent Defence Forces have reached the retiring age, has been to place a sum of money upon the Estimates, and ask Parliament to vote it as compensation to the retired officers. This Bill, however, is designed to deal with a very large number of officers, and men of the Army, and a smaller number of the Navy, who are being compulsorily retired owing to a reduction in the Defence Forces. As has been said on more than one occasion, the results of the Washington Conference have enabled the Government to bring about that reduction. Many of the men who have been retired have given to the country long and faithful service in peace and war, and there is no doubt that compulsory retirement has inflicted upon them very considerable hardship. They had before them, they thought, an assured connexion  with the Defence Forces up to the maximum retirement age. Others had given a good many years of service to their country, and there remained for them comparatively few years of further service, if they continued on the same rank. Nevertheless, it was quite possible that during that period of unexpired service, perhaps three or four years, they would have secured promotion which would have entitled them to a new lease of life in the Forces. Those two considerations must be borne in mind by honorable members when, dealing with, this measure. It is not merely that compulsory retirement has out short the length of .service for the rank these officers held at the time of retirement; many officers had prospects of a rise in rank which would have entitled them to a further period of service. </para>

I desire to give to the House particulars of the compensation that has been given to officers recently retired from the Indian Army.

            <para>- I shall deal with the regular provision in a moment; I am now dealing with a case somewhat analogous to our own, where the authorities, retire men in India for whom, at that particular period, there is no superannuation allowance. These are men who belong to the Indian Army as opposed to the British Army; it is to those men that these rates are granted, and they are very much more generous than the: rates we are suggesting in the Bill. </para>

              <para>- It depends entirely on circumstances. I asked my officers if they could give me the actual details in cash, and they said it was not practicable unless we knew all the surrounding &#34;circumstances, of which they could not inform us. I wish to make it quite clear that in the British Army, in every case where there is service beyond a certain period, both officers and men are entitled to a pension for life. </para>

          <para>I have mentioned these facts to show how it is realized that the occupation of a soldier or of a sailor in the Navy is one which necessarily involves his being deprived of his employment suddenly at a period of life when very often he is unable to take up any other occupation. Consequently it has been laid down by other countries that he is entitled to a pension. A further point I wish to stress is that a man who is deprived of his occupation in the ordinary ranks of life can go to another employer and seek employment. A soldier or a man in the Navy is not at all in that position. </para>

              <para>- I am not speaking from that point of view at present; my point is that the profession of such a man is the profession of arms, and his only employer is the State. He cannot leave the State and offer his services to somebody else in the profession to which he is accustomed, and that is a great handicap. I am not saying for one moment that many of these men who come under the&#39; Bill will not be able to accommodate themselves to the altered conditions, and find a niche in life where they can be usefully employed, but I do say that to suddenly cut these men off.- </para>

              <para>- I do not think so. That is the reason why the Government have differentiated between clerical employees and Military and Naval Forces properly so called. We felt that while the soldier had no other employer to whom to go seeking employment in the profession to which he had been accustomed all his life, others whohad been engaged in a civil capacity were not placed at the same disadvantage, and, consequently, were not entitled to the same amount of compensation. </para>

              <para>- It is suggested that the Government are differentiating in this Bill between the officers and the men. The reason for this is quite simple. Whereas an officer, once he has accepted his commission, is there for life, the rankandfile man is engaged for a period of five years only, but is entitled to re-enlist from time to time for periods of three years, subject to the proviso that if he does not rise in the ranks during the time of his engagement, he automatically passes out of the Forces. Consequently, the position of the two classes of men is entirely different when we come to consider the amount of compensation that ought to be paid to them for sudden termination of their engagements. In the one case, we have a man who is there practically for the whole of his life, with the opportunity of rising to the highest ranks and of obtaining the emoluments attaching thereto. In the other case, we have men joining the Forces for quite short periods without the opportunity for advancement which the officers have, and engaged for short periods only. They are entitled to remain in the Forces for short periods only, consequently the loss of employment does not affect them as it does those in the higher ranks. </para>

              <para>- Ordinarily, they have no such right. It is a matter absolutely at the discretion of the authorities. The usual procedure is that if a gunner does not qualify for his stripe within the five years&#39; period, he goes out, but if he gets his first stripe he is re-engaged for three years more. If in that extended period he does not qualify for a further stripe, out he goes. </para>

          <para>Prior to the authorization of dual furlough payments it has in recent years been usual for the Commonwealth Parliament to vote as compensation to military officers who have been retired after serving their full time an amount equal to twelve months&#39; salary, although in some cases an amount equal totwo years&#39; salary or more has been given ; and when we were considering the provisions of this Bill we took the procedure on which the House had acted previously as a basis. We stipulated that a man should receive a month&#39;s salary for each year of service, but provided that if one month&#39;s salary for each year of service should exceed the amount an officer would draw if he had remained in the Service to the automatic date of retirement at the rank then held by him, the amount of compensation to which he would be entitled should be what he would have drawn plus an amount equal to twelve months&#39; salary. </para>

A member may have thirty-six years&#39; service, and six months to go, before he automatically passes out of the Service. Under the first part of clause 5, if it stood alone, he would be entitled to three years&#39; pay, but under the proviso, he would be entitled to only one year&#39;s pay plus six months&#39; pay. </para>

              <para>- I do not think it is. I shall make quite clear what is intended, so that when we are in  Committee we may determine whether or not the Bill gives expression to that intention. What we wanted to provide against was that a man with a comparatively short time to remain in the Service should get the same amount, by way of compensation, as a man of the same rank who had still a considerable period to run, and yet had a longer service. There are cases of the kind, owing to the age at which some men entered the Service. We wanted to provide against men who had a comparatively short time to go getting as much, by way of compensation, as a man who had a comparatively long time to go. That is what we have tried to do. I do not know that I can usefully discuss the Bill further on the second reading. </para>

I am not yet quite certain of the number involved in the Navy, but it will not be large, because we are reducing in the Navy by reverting men to the Imperial Navy. Men are reverted to the Imperial Navy, and if they are entitled to a pension they obtain it from that source. We think we shall be able to carry out this scheme for about &#163;300,000. </para>

              <para>- I think so. None of it can be spent, of course, until the Parliament passes this Bill. I ought, perhaps, to tell honorable members what, no doubt, they have read for themselves in the press, and that is that the Government, after it had announced these retirements, notified the Forces of its intention to bring down this Bill, and gave the officers and men concerned an intimation of its proposals. We told them quite frankly that we could not guarantee the amount of compensation that it was proposed to give, but that we intended to submit this Bill to Parliament. We invited all who desired to send in their resignations voluntarily to do so, telling them that, if the Bill passed and the resignations were accepted, those who retired voluntarily would be entitled to the same amount of compensation as those who, later on, were compulsorily retired. A large number of officers and men voluntarily retired in the hope that they would get this compensation. </para>

              <para>- But we told them, at the time of their voluntary retirement, that their pay would cease on 30th June, and we told those who went out compulsorily that their pay would cease on 31st July. We had to get in the voluntary retirements before determining the list of compulsory retirements. The Government took the view that if there were in the Forces men who were prepared, on these conditions, to go out voluntarily, it was far better that they should do so than that we should throw out a large number of men who did not want to leave the service, and continue in it men who were prepared to go out. I think that this helped materially withthe whole scheme of retrenchment. It enabled the Government to retain in the Forces men who otherwise, in all probability, would have been compulsorily retired, and it  helped  us particularly in regard to a number of Duntroon &#39;cadets whose services we were most anxious to retain. It opened up avenues in advance which enabled us to make certain promotions and to keep in the Forces quite a number of Duntroon cadets who, otherwise, would have had to go out. </para>

          <para>I want now to refer to the employees in the various factories for whom it is said we have not provided under this compensation scheme. The claim that they should receive compensation is not tenable. They are employees, in the same sense as are those employed in ordinary walks of life. The employees in the industrial concerns of the Department are not subject to the same conditions of service as are the permanent officers and men. They are not required to undergo the competitive educational and practical tests of efficiency, and to pass the necessary medical standard laid down for permanent officers. Moreover, they are engaged under the specific conditions laid down in Factory Regulation 88, as follows : - </para>
          <para>All employees shall be temporarily engaged by the day, and their engagements shall be terminable without notice on either side, provided that any employee engaged under agreement shall bc subject to the terms of such agreement. Employment, as a temporary hand, shall not establish any claim to permanent employment on any grounds whatever. </para>
          <para class="block">That is one of the definite conditions under which they are engaged. They are employed only as temporary hands, and are liable to dismissal without notice. Their position is exactly the same as that of men in the ordinary walks of life, and they hare a trade to which they oan go. </para>
          <para class="block">They are not in the same position as members of the Military Forces or permanent employees of the Department, and I do not think that any claim by them for compensation is tenable. I ask the House to give this measure its earnest consideration, and to pass it as early as possible. It is of great importance that the men concerned should know, - without delay, what their position is to be, and that they should not have to fritter away the compensation which is given them to enable them to make a new start in life, by having to wait a long time for it. It is not the fault of the Government that the Bill has not been brought down earlier. We have been ready and anxious to go on with it, but the House has been occupied with other work. I ask the House to pass the Bill into law as early as possible, so that these men may receive the compensation which they so richly deserve. </para>

            <para>.- Honorable members will have gathered from the speech made by the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> that special attention has been given to those who hold high rank in the Military Forces of the Commonwealth rather than to the interests of the men of the lower ratings. What strikes one most forcibly is the keen desire of the Minister to make ample provision for the officers of higher ranks, while very little consideration appears to have been given to subalterns, &#34; non-coms,&#34; and men of the rank and file. Clerical workers in the Defence Department are in an even less satisfactory position than ordinary soldiers. Full and generous compensation for the men higher up has been made the first consideration; and it has only been in order that it should not be said that the rank and file were not altogether slighted that some small provision has been made for them. There has been no thought of arriving at an equitably graduated system of compensation. Obviously, the measure was drawn up originally by the Defence authorities - those people who had so much of their own way during the war, for which the country had to pay thousands upon thousands of pounds more than should have been required. Officers of high rank have continued to hold posts since the war for which they have not been fitted, and thus the country has had to pay still more wasteful millions. Now these favoured ones are to be retired with consideration out of all proportion to their services or to the justice of their claims. As for the unfortunates who have lost employment through the closing down of Government factories, there is no question of compensation for them. They may have been persuaded to take up work in the Government&#39;s military factories as a measure of war service, leaving good permanent jobs in private employ. Thousands of them have now been turned away without compensation. It matters not to the Government what becomes of them and their wives and families. The Government have economised, after their own fashion, and nothing else matters. The high military officials, however, must be specially safeguarded. That is the purpose of this Bill; but we do not know to what enormous expenditure the measure, if it is passed as it has been drafted, may lead the country. I have come to the conclusion, after careful perusal,.&#39; that the Bill has been cunningly prepared so as to provide for the Government giving to retired senior officers practically anything they may want. </para>

I call attention to the following in the definition clause :  - &#34; Pay for the unexpired period of the service of the member &#34; moans the total of the pay which, in the opinion of the Naval Board of Administration, the Military Board of Administration, the Air Board or the Secretary to the Department of Defence, as the case may be, the member would probably have received had he continued, until the age prescribed bylaw for retirement or discharge therefrom, to occupy the office or hold the rank occupied or held by him at the time of his retirement or discharge under this Act; </para>
          <para>Could any language be clearer? </para>

          <para>The Minister referred to clause 12, which provides for voluntary retirements. He held that the provision contained therein had already worked well, and had assisted the Government. From that point of view, no doubt, the provision is good. The clause provides that any man who voluntarily retires before the 30th June, 1923, will receive compensation according to the terms of this Bill. If the opportunity is largely availed of, what will be the cost to the Government? </para>
          <para class="block">These retirements are proposed for the sake of economy. But if certain officers no longer desire to continue in the Service, although the Minister may wish to retain their services, they may, because it suits them to get as much as they can from the Commonwealth, retire and get compensation. </para>

              <para>- The Bill should be so drafted as to leave no doubt as to the Government&#39;s power to retire these men if necessary, and it should not be optional for the individual officer to retire or remain in the Service.I gathered from the Minister&#39;s speech that men could retire it they wished to do so before 30th June, 1923, and that that was the purpose of the clause. </para>

          <para>Another objection to the Bill is the differentiation between different classes of beneficiaries. Throughout the Bill there is discrimination.The Ministerhas said that many of the officers who have lost their employment will be unfitted for other occupations. That may be. true, but it is equally true of all other classes. There may be clerical officers who have spent years in the Department, and who are unqualified for work in any other service. I mentioned recently the circum-  stances of a man whose services had been dispensed with after a long connexion with the Department, and who could not get employment. As a rule, clerical work is much the same in all employments. But it is quite possible that, owing to the overcrowded market; retired clerks will not be able to find new employment, and they are not to receive the same consideration as the soldier, whilst the soldier is not to receive the same consideration as the officer. If the compensation is to. be on the basis of length of service it should be applied on a uniform principle to all classes of men who may be retired. If the officer is to receive two months&#39; pay for each year of service, the clerk and the rank and file also should receive two months&#39; pay for each year of service. But the Bill differentiates between the three. </para>

              <para>- There is no analogy between the two measures. The war pensions were not based upon length of service, but upon incapacity and rank. I am urging that this compensation should not be according to the salary a man had been earning, but according to the length of his service, and that all ranks should get allowance for each year of service on a uniform basis. </para>

              <para>- No. If an officer has served ten years, and a soldier ten years, and a clerk ten years, and if the officer is to be given two months&#39; pay for each of those years, why should not the soldier and the clerk also receive two months&#39; pay? He would hot receive the same amount of money as the officer received, but his compensation would be upon the same basis. The drafting of the Bill is very unsatisfactory, and I shall be very careful in dealing with it. It is largely a measure for consideration in Committee, and I hope that the many amendments which will be proposed will be considered by the House on their merits. Most of the officers who have enjoyed high salaries are in a better position to retire than are the poorer men who have to depend on their earnings for their daily bread. I trust that the House will thoroughly sift these provisions in Committee and rectify the anomaly. I also ask the Minister to make sure as to the exact meaning of some of the phraseology. The Minister may have intended one thing, whereas the Bill provides something entirely different. I still contend that the meaning of this Bill is that an officer shall get compensation not only for the expired period of his service, but also for the unexpired period </para>

It is a characteristic of the governing power in Great Britain that the rank and file should be treated very poorly and the officers very well. The charge cannot be laid against me that, in connexion with war pensions, I agreed to differentiation, because the honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Maloney)</inline> and I contended that all ranks should receive the same pension. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member for Melbourne and I took that stand upon the floor of the House; whether or not other honorable members supported us I cannot recollect. The Australian people will not agree that the commissioned officer should receive so much compensation, and the noncommissioned officer and private so little. I cannot see why we should treat one section of the community more favorably than the other. No doubt we shall have to accept the differentiation for certain reasons, but the Government and the heads of the Defence Department have not played the game fairly. For instance, a notification was issued to men in the Service that those who desired to avail themselves of the opportunity of retirement could do so, and receive compensation. </para>

              <para>- That was not the position at all. It was decided, because of action taken by the House, that certain men in the Department had to go, and the authorities naturally looked round for some means of making it as easy as possible for them. What I complain of is the discrimination shown, some men being retired with compensation, while others, who were in a precisely similar position, received nothing. I, myself, put some cases before the Government showing how unfairly men have been treated. One or two of them met me at the House here, and, at first, I must say that I scarcely believed what they told me; but, of course, I was convinced when they put the facts in writing and attached their names. I have received the following letter from two men concerned : - </para>

              <inline font-style="italic">Re my</inline>conversation with you relating to the discharge from the Australian Instructional Corps (Permanent Military Forces) of four Warrant Officers without compensation, in connexion with the reduction of the Defence Forces, I am setting forth the full case, which is as follows: - </para>
            <para>On 13th June, 1922, all Warrant Officers of the 3rd Division received from Divisional Headquarters a circular extract from Defence Memo. No. 17546, of 10th June, 1922, setting forth particulars of retirement,and proposed scale of compensation to those willing to resign, or those compulsorily retired from the Forces. </para>
            <para>Warrant Officer Downing and myself replied on the same day (13th June, 1922) that we were willing to resign under the conditions set out. </para>
            <para>On 14th June, 1922, instructions were received from Head-quarters that we would be discharged on 30th June, 1922 (the date laid down for discharge in the circular). </para>
            <para>On 27th June, 1922, we received correspondence stating that as instructions had already been issued for our discharge, consideration would not be given to our applications dated 13th June, 1922, to resign under the conditions of Defence Memo. No. 17546. </para>
            <para>In answer to this we replied to Headquarters, a copy of which is attached. </para>
            <para>As there are a number of other Warrant Officers in the Division (who like ourselves are non-returned soldiers), and who have been notified that they will be discharged with com- . pensation, there is evidently some misjustice in connexion with our cases. </para>
            <para>The other two Warrant Officers concerned are stationed in country districts, and will not be in Melbourne till Friday, 30th inst., therefore on their behalf we are connecting their names to this correspondence. </para>
            <para>On 27th June, 1922, Downing and myself paraded before our Divisional Instructional Group Commander and asked if there were any reasons such as inefficiency or bad conduct, &#38;c, for our being discharged without any consideration, and we were told that such was not the case. </para>
            <para>The four Warrant Officers concerned have all over six years&#39; service in the Permanent Forces, have good records, and Downing and myself have volunteered for active service. I myself have served in the Australian Imperial Force for six months, being discharged on 21st March, 1915, medically unfit, not due to misconduct (Discharge No. V.B.28543). </para>
            <para>The following Warrant Officers who are being discharged, and who will receive compensation subject to it being approved, and who, like ourselves, are not returned soldiers, are: - </para>

          <para class="block">I submit that it is not fair to discriminate in a matter of this kind. Men who did not go to the Front are being compensated, but men who offered to go, as these two men did, but through no fault of their own were not allowed to go, receive nothing. It is evident from the correspondence that I have read that there was no inefficiency or misconduct on their part, and there would appear to be no reason why they should not have been treated exactly as others were. There seems to be something very peculiar about these cases, and the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Massy Greene)</inline> would only be doing common justice if he made inquiries as to why there was this differentiation. For some time prior to the decision to pay compensation, men were being retired compulsorily, without compensation, on reaching the age limit, and they were placed in a very unfortunate position, because others, whose services were retained longer than they should have been, were able to avail themselves of the conditions offered in the memorandum. </para>

The House may be perfectly willing that all should receive compensation; but, of course, honorable members are not aware of the peculiar circumstances under which some men are retired, and the equally peculiar circumstances under which the services of other men are retained. In the Army and Navy humanity is just the same as it is outside, and &#34; friends at Court &#34; can do a great deal. I am not now alluding to political friends, but to official friends. If it is fair for those who have friends at court to get compensation it is equally fair that others should be placed in the same position. I ask the Minister to inquire why a discrimination has been made in these cases. </para>

            <para>. - I shall have inquiries made into the matter referred to by the honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. West).</inline> In regard to the appointment of the seventh director ofthe Wireless Amalgamated Limited, I was in Sydney the other day, and had an opportunity of discussing the matter with the three directors representing the Commonwealth Government and one director representing the old company. It is because the matter is so simple that it is so baffling. We have three men on each side who, of course, take an entirely impartial and non-partisan view, such as that which the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anstey)</inline> said this morning, has been the fashion of mankind from the beginning; but unfortunately their views conflict, and the prospect of arriving at a decision is not at present so hopeful as one could wish. However, I am doing my best in the matter. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>As to the question asked by the honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fen ton),</inline> the answer will appear in due course, and I think the honorable member will get from this remark whatever satisfaction he is entitled to as a taxpayer. </para>
          <para>Question resolved in the affirmative. </para>
          <para>House adjourned at  4.9  p.m. </para>
