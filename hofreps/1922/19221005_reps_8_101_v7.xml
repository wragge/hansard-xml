                        <para>- The Prime Minister has given to the House a list of the measures which the Government desires to have passed before the prorogation of Parliament. We hope to be able to conclude the business of the session by to-morrow week. I do not suppose that honorable members wish to remain here, sitting morning, noon, and night, longer than is absolutely necessary, and therefore we ask their co-operation in dealing with the legislation that it is necessary to pass before we can rise. It is the intention of the Government to proceed to an election before Christmas, though I do not feel justified in giving any definite date. Honorable members are in as good a position as I am to form an opinion on the subject. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. There is ons qualification that I must add, and it is a qualification which was mentioned by the Prime Minister when speaking on this subject a few days ago. Honorable members know that the situation in the Near East is not altogether satisfactory. Within the last few days we have been very close to a renewal of hostilities. I am glad to be able to say that the position appears easier now, although there are factors which, might bring the Empire again to war, or to the verge of war, &#39;and the Government feels that if the situation so developed after the rising of Parliament that members should be called together immediately to consider it, we should not proceed to an election, but should immediately re-summon Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- It is in consonance with the general policy of the Government. When, in 1914, the Empire became involved in the Great War, this Parliament had been dissolved, and there was no means of re-summoning it. Ministers are most anxious that that position should not arise again. We think that the situation in the Near East will clear up satisfactorily, and we certainly hope so ; but we feel it necessary thus to qualify the &#39;announcement about the election that I have made to the House. Subject to the contingency I have mentioned, it is the intention of the Government to proceed to an election before Christmas, and we ask the co-operation of all sections of the House to enable us to finish the programme that we have announced, or so much of it as is possible, by Friday week, so that honorable members may then be free to leave for their electorates. </para>

                        <para>- In the unavoidable absence of the Prime Minister through ill health, I ask - the Acting Leader of the Government whether, as so many landlords insult true religion and Australian natives by debarring Australian children from shelter, in refusing ito accept their parents as tenants, will he bring under the notice of the Government the need for introducing a Bill to licence landlords. If that cannot be done during the lifetime of this Parliament, will the Prime Minister, if returned at the forthcoming election with a majority, bring in a Landlords Licensing Bill next session ? </para>

                    <para class="block">I shall get into touch, at the earliest moment, with the Administrator of New Guinea, and ascertain the position. Naturally, in a large Public Service, such as that at Rabaul t we have had disappointments; but the men who have not suited have been sent back, and others have taken their places. The utmost care is taken at this end to see. that proper men are sent to Rabaul. I paid only one visit to Chinatown, and was surprised at the cleanliness and good order that prevailed. The new buildings put up by the Chinese there are equal to anything erected in the provincial towns of the Commonwealth. The question of water supply and sewerage is receiving the attention of the Administrator, but we have not had for some time any report in regard to it. I can assure the honorable member, however, that we shall get into touch with the Administrator and ascertain exactly what is being done. </para>

I think we might very well spend a few pounds on the printing of it, so that honorable members may be able to fully inform themselves of the proposals. </para>

                            <para>At the conclusion of the war, machines surplus to requirements of the Royal Air Force were handed over by the Air Ministry to the Aircraft Disposal Company. It is believed that all machines handed over in this way were constructed prior to 1919, many some years before. These machines were not in cases, and the company did not have adequate facilities for storing, consequently a considerable deterioration took place. As a result the Air Ministry decided not to give certificates of airworthiness for these machines for civil aviation purposes until they were overhauled. </para>

                            <para>In 1919 India received a certain number of gift machines from the Imperial Government. These machines were surplus to the requirements of the Royal Air Force in India, and were presented to individuals and companies. Those machines which were used were mostly employed in joy-riding. Recently certain other of these machines which were suitable for Air Force work were handed over by the Indian Government to the Royal Air Force in India. So &#39;far as is known, no machines received by Canada as a gift from the Imperial Government were handed over to individuals or companies, but some of the machines were used for civil purposes, such as forest patrols, &#38;c., by the Canadian Government itself - not by private companies. So far as South Africa is concerned, it is believed that the whole of the machines and gift equipment have been devoted to the uses of the South African Air Force. </para>

They are well packed in cases, and when unpacked for use are given the normal overhaul; they have invariably been found to be in very good condition. One of the objects hoped to be achieved by the establishment of aerial mail services was the introduction of the latest type of commercial aeroplane. Some applications have already been received from successful tenderers for the loan of military type of machine, but so far it has not been considered advisable under the circumstances to accede to these requests. </para>

                    <para>.- My objection to the proposed amendment is not in respect of the extension of time, but is due to the fact that it does not seek to make any alteration in the provision that, if an officer who has been charged does not make reply within the period mentioned, he shall be deemed to have admitted the truth of the charge. The general principle in matters of plea is that, where a person does not plead, or where his plea is equivocal or of doubtful meaning, he is given&#39; the benefit of the doubt, and is taken to have pleaded not guilty. </para>

                        <para>- There may be reasons, such as accident or carelessness, why a reply has not been furnished. We are enacting severe legislation, however, when we provide that, because an officer&#39;s plea has not come to hand within a specific time, he is to be taken, without question by the Board, to have admitted the truth of the charge against him. The officer concerned, when the matter comes up for final consideration, may wish to explain why his plea or explanation has not been furnished; but the officials dealing with his case would be precluded from accepting the excuse, on the ground that they were bound by the Statute to hold that he had admitted the facts. No person should be declared, by Act of Parliament, to have admitted an offence merely because, through some oversight or omission, or from any cause, he  ha3  not complied with the condition that he must furnish a reply. The proposal of the Attorney-General to extend the time limit, of course, offers some measure of relief; but that mere extension does not affect the principle. I suggest that the person concerned should be required to reply ; or that, if he has not replied, it would be quite competent for the Government to frame a regulation setting out the procedure by which his case should be considered. One of the readiest means would be to proceed to try him upon the charge, and to test the facts. At all events, I do not desire that any person should be adjudged guilty by an Act of Parliament owing to a mere accident or oversight. If the Minister will not agree to consider the re-drafting of this paragraph, I shall move for the omission of the objectionable words. </para>

                    <para>. - A man charged with a misdemeanour is asked to admit his guilt or otherwise within seven days. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom),</inline> as a lawyer, knows that in many cases a man may hastily plead guilty when on investigation he would have been acquitted, while, on the other hand, a man who pleads not guilty may thereby increase his punishment. Under such circumstances a layman scarcely knows what to do, and, naturally, consults a lawyer, who, quite as naturally, does not give his advice straightway, for the simple reason that if he did his emoluments would not be so great. It seems hard that a man who does not reply within a period of seven days should be deemed guilty of the charge against him. </para>

                        <para>- Here is a man in public employ who is charged with an offence, and fails or neglects to furnish a reply to that charge. Under such circumstances the natural inference is that there must be some grounds for the charge, and, in view of his failure to reply, he is deemed to have admitted it. We must not forget that before the charge is made the Chief Officer must have reports and other data before him. Of course, if a definite time is mentioned in an Act there is no power to extend it; and, admitting the possibility of hardship arising from some special cause, such as illness, I am quite prepared to add the words, &#34; or such extended time as the Chief Officer allows.&#34; </para>

                    <para>. - I ask the honorable member not to press the amendment. The clause provides that the tribunal shall consist of a permanent  chairman,  an officer appointed by the Chief Officer of the Department to which the appellant belongs; and an elected representative of the division to which the appellant belongs. There can be no doubt as to the impartiality of the Board that will hear the appeal. I do not think it would be wise to ask the Board of Commissioners to appoint some one to represent the Department or branch of the Service in which the appellant is working. In any case, if it were obliged to do so, the Board would necessarily accept the recommendation of the Chief Officer of the Department. Nor would it be wise to expect the Board of Commissioners to attend to all these details. It must not be forgotten that the Chief Officer, although he would make the charge against the subordinate, would not be in the position of a complainant. </para>

Then, too, the machinery for elections provided by the amendment will be simpler. In these days, when the Public Service is - very properly, I think - highly organized, there is always available an appropriate organization which is the guardian of the interests of its members, or of any one of them. At present we do not know who are to compose these divisions, but we know that they must of necessity include persons whose interests may not be in common, and who will not all be members of any particular organization. The object of the sub-clause is to enable the person charged with an offence to have upon the Board that tries his case one who understands the class of work upon which he is engaged, and from the nature of his employment is able to appreciate his point of view; but effect will not be given to that intention by the words as they stand. As the divisions will be composed of men whose interests will be identical, and of classes of persons whose employments are by no means similar, it is safe to say that the person chosen to represent any division may not be satisfactory to the members of an organization having interests in common. Where the person charged is not a member of an organization, or where there is no appropriate organization, I would be prepared to fall back on the arbitrary arrangement by virtue of which we rely upon the word &#34;Division.&#34; There are sound reasons why the amendment should be accepted. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. The desire is to get a fair tribunal, and we propose to do that by appointing a  chairman,  the representative of the Permanent Head or Chief Officer of the Department to which the man belongs, and the divisional representative. If we accepted the amendment, instead of there being, as there is now, a representative elected for each State, who is continually hearing cases and thus acquires a knowledge of procedure, there would be a representative for every organization to which public servants might belong, and there might be thirteen or fourteen of these in a division. The honorable member says that it is not known who will be in the divisions provided for, but we know what the component parts of the divisions will be. At present we have the General, Professional, Clerical, and Administration Divisions, but when the Bill becomes law these divisions will be known as the first, second, third, and fourth. The Fourth will be similar to the present General Division. Our only desire is to get a fair judicial tribunal for the trying of offences. </para>

                <para class="block">I suggest to the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> that that &#34; provision defeats the whole principle of the Appeal Board. The Board is to consist of a police magistrate as  chairman,  an officer of the Department to which the appellant belongs, and the elected representative of the division of which he is a member. If, however, any two members of the Board may act, an investigation may take place, and a decision may be arrived at in the absence of the representative of the appellant, or, it may be, in the absence of the representative of the Department. The whole principle of the Appeal Board is thus defeated. I can see no reason for this provision. If the  chairman  and the officer of the Department were present, awd the elected representative of the division to which the appellant .belonged were unable owing to illness to attend, it would be an easy matter for the men in the division to provide a substitute. If there is anything in the principle laid down in the clause that all sections shall be represented, then we should take care that in respect of every investigation and decision tl at principle shall be observed. With only two members of the Board present, an investigation would not be as full and impartial as it ought to be. I ask the Attorney-General to agree to the omission of these words. </para>

                    <para>.- The proposed new sub-clause which the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> has read will not meet my objection. It is designed merely to permit of the filling of a vacancy caused by the illness, absence, or suspension of an officer who is the elected representative of the division to which the appellant belongs. It does not meet my contention that if the words to which I have referred are permitted to remain in sub-clause 5, any two members of an Appeal Board may hear and determine an appeal. That is a very serious blemish. If it is agreed to, then the Appeal Board system will go by the board. </para>

Having provided for such contingencies we should not empower, the Board to proceed with the hearing of an appeal when there are only two members present. The intention of the Bill is that both sides shall be represented on the Appeal Board, and that there shall be an impartial  Chairman.  If the words to which I object are allowed to stand, however, there will be nothing to prevent the  Chairman  and the officer of the Department to which the appellant belongs investigating and deciding a case in the absence of the representative of the division to which the appellant belongs. The new sub-clause will not meet any deliberate attempt to exclude the representative of the men. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable mem.mer for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mcwilliams)</inline> suggests tha.t if these words are allowed to remain they will give rise to discontent in the Service. A similar . provision has been in operation for twenty years, and has not caused any discontent. Let me explain very briefly the object that we have in view. If, during a lengthy and costly investigation, one of the members of the Board fell ill, why should it not bo possible for the remaining two members, if they are agreed, to give the finding of the Board ? This is only to meet emergency conditions. An investigation might have extended over thirty days and one of the members might fall ill. Without such provision as this it would not be possible for the other two members of the Board to conclude the inquiry and record a decision. </para>

We are expressly providing, however, that the Board shall always be constituted of three members. If the words to which the honorable member objects were omitted the jurisdiction might fail.

                    <para>.- As it would be unfair, if a case were left to two members of the Board both to investigate and decide upon, I suggest that all reference to &#34; decision &#34; be deleted. An appellant would be scarcely likely to object to his case being investigated by two members of the Board, so long as he was safeguarded by the provision that any decision must be that of the full Board. I was once  Chairman  of a State Tramways Commission, and the terms of our commission required that every member thereof must be present at its meetings in order to form a quorum. Just as has been suggested as a possibility in this instance, one of our members became ill. and our investigations had to be delayed for a fortnight. Ultimately, however, after his return1, we were able to conclude and bring our labours to a successful issue. My objection to the verbiage of sub-clause 5 would be removed if it provided that two members of the Board could proceed to investigate, but that a decision could only be given by the full Board. The Attorney-General has pointed out that the provisions of the sub-clause are in the interests of the appellant himself.. I do not wish to impute unworthy motives to the Government. I am sure that they have no desire to injure &#39;a public servant. For that reason, my suggestion should be acceptable. </para>

                    <para>.- If sub-clause 5 is not amended much dissatisfaction will be created in the Service. Although the Attorney-General has said that there has not been any marked dissatisfaction with this phase of the present law, the very fact of its having been challenged in Parliament, and of the Government insisting upon the acceptance of the sub-clause as framed, will be apt to create suspicion. The object of composing the Board as it is to be composed is to satisfy the various classes in the Service that their point of view shall be understood by their peer on the Appeal Board - their associate in the particular class of work concerned. Possibly, in the case of two members of a Board investigating a charge and coming to a virtual decision, the absent member might be the representative of the very class of which the accused officer is also a member. Clearly, even though such a case may not yet have arisen, if it did arise it would create grave dissatisfaction. The Attorney-General has emphasized his view that the clause may be in the interests of the appellant himself. My answer to that is that, if the Minister is unable to accept the amendment of the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin),</inline> he should be agreeable to the inclusion in sub-clause 5 of the words &#34; By consent of the parties concerned.&#34; Such an amendment would get over all difficulties if, in order to save expense, delay, and anxiety, the parties themselves wished to go on with their case in the presence of two members. </para>

                        <para>-When we on this side suggest any amendment in the Bill we are told that the particular clause has been in operation for years, and has caused no trouble. I think I may now, by way of retort, say that we have been able to get along hitherto without any such provision as this, and that there is no necessity for our adopting one now. This, to me, appears to be the beginning of a policy of repression in regard to the workers of this country. Instead of providing tribunals to give justice to the workers, there seems to be a movement to restrict the liberties of the men. I believe in. the peaceful settlement of industrial disputes by means of tribunals, but there does come a time when men must exercise their rights, and refuse to accept certain conditions. If that right is attacked, then the principle of enforced labour is affirmed. We see signs of re  pression at the present time already in the States, and, probably, the Commonwealth Government are determined to get into line. But the Government will not gain by this kind of provision. If things reach such a pass that a strike takes place in the Public Service, the men will give assistance surreptitiously, if not openly. All that this clause does is to create a new offence, and I shall vote against it. </para>

                    <para>The experience of the United States Postal Administration has been to a considerable extent duplicated during the past six years in the administration of the postal service of Australia, and much that has been said in the report from which quotations have been made might readily have been written of the Commonwealth Public Service. It is essential in the public interest that limitations should be imposed on the activities of associations, while granting full consideration to representations submitted in a reasonable manner by these bodies. In framing amending Public Service legislation it is requisite, in my view, that specific provision be made for the treatment of strikes amongst public servants, whether members of officially recognised associations or otherwise, as illegal actions against the peace and good order of the Commonwealth - </para>

                        <para>- The carrying on of these public services and utilities is in the interests of the whole of the citizens of the nation; it is not in the interest of any financial corporation, of any particular industry or private person, but in the interests of the whole of the citizens to whom the services are impartially rendered. A strike which interferes with the carrying on of these activities is a. very serious matter indeed. There is no justification for the public servants taking part in a strike against the Commonwealth, or against the carrying on of public utilities. In the first place, they have the protection of the people&#39;s representatives in Parliament, and, further, moat elaborate precautions are taken to provide them with reasonable conditions of employment, and with tribunals before which they can take their complaints. I always feel that if the right to strike is taken away employees should have some means provided for redressing their grievances. The whole tendency, and the proper tendency, of modern life is to define economic duties, and mete out economic justice as between man and man. </para>

Of course, there may be a strike outside the Service equally effectual in preventing the carrying on of public utilities, but with such a strike this Bill does not deal. If, however, there are officers in the Department who take part in a strike which interferes with or prevents the carrying on of governmental activities, they must be held responsible. </para>

                    <para>.- This is a new departure in our legislation. Up to the present no clause of this kind has been inserted in any Bill dealing? with the Public Service. I know of nothing which justifies the Government in passing legislation to meet a contingency that may never arise. It is well known that the members of the Public Service all endeavour to do their best, not only in the interests of the particular Departments to which they are attached, but in the interests of the community generally. I can see no reason why at this stage there should be introduced legislation of this kind - it is beyond my comprehension. This proposal is really an insult to an intelligent body of public servants, who have given the best that is in them for the welfare of their country. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> has -urged that there is no justification for public servants taking part in a strike. The obvious answer to that is that they have never .done so; and there would, to my mind, have to be very strong grounds if they took a step of that kind. The Government are not dealing fairly with the public servants. It may be, though I do not know that it is so, that they realize that their action in taking away from all public servants in receipt of over &#163;310 per annum the right to go to the Arbitration Court may lead to something in the matter of a strike. The Government are by no means clear as to their object in submitting this clause. Rights which the public servants achieved only comparatively recently, after a good deal of contention, are to be taken away. </para>

                        <para>- It is. After a short experience of twelve months or so, the Government are deliberately depriving public servants of the right of appeal to the Arbitration Court, and now this Bill proposes fresh legislation for public servants. It is idle to say that this clause does not affect a public servant if he happens in any way to aid a strike, because there is no doubt that a public servant who gives a donation to any body of men who may be regarded as being on strike will come within its operation. I am sure that no exception can bc taken to that interpretation. Why should we deprive public servants of the right to aid women and children who are practically starving, because their breadwinners are engaged in a struggle with their employers, or, it may. be, the victims of a lock-out? Why should a public servant, because, under such circumstances, he contributes a <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> note, be deemed as aiding and fomenting a strike? The Attorney-General may say that the provision is not intended to apply in the way I have indicated, but the clause is so drafted that it will apply in that way. The decision is left to the Board, and the officer is given no right of appeal. A mistake on the part of the Board would be very unjust and disastrous to the officer charged. Suppose that, as a result of a dispute in one Department, the officers stopped work. Under this clause the head of. another Department not directly concerned in the dispute could say to some of his officers, &#34; For the time being you must leave your present work and do that of the men who are on strike. &#39; &#39; If they refuse to obey that instruction they will be guilty of aiding and abetting a strike. Clearly that is what is intended. Is it fair to put the public servants in that position ? In the last big railway trouble in New South Wales a large number of men continued at their work and had, up to a certain stage, taken no part in the strike; but a day came when they were told to leave their own occupation and to fill the positions of the men who had ceased work. Any person with a spark of manhood in him will resent such an instruction and will say, &#34; Whilst I am prepared to do my own regular work, I am not prepared to do the work of those others who are on strike.&#34; Many men in the New South Wales railway service refused to take the positions vacated by the strikers and were dismissed. </para>

                        <para>- That is what it amounts to. Parliament should set a good example to private employers in regard to these matters, but we are asked to do the reverse. I do not know what has happened to the Government recently, but they seem to be resolved to take away the rights of the public servants without offering any legitimate reason for so doing. We should be proud of the Commonwealth Public Service. It has done excellent work, and we have no room for complaint. Yet the Government are introducing a clause which is practically an insult to every Commonwealth employee. As a rule, men in the Public Service do not think of going on strike, and they do not expect to be locked out. That, in itself, is a reason why no clause of this kind should be agreed to. The Government are backed by all the laws of the land when trouble does occur, and there is no need for this special provision. </para>

                        <para>- This provision is intended for the purpose of  overaweing  men in the Department in the hope that at no time will they have sufficient manliness to assert their rights. If such a condition were brought about in the Service it would not be in the best interests of the country. We should make our employees feel that they are men and women, and that in matters vitally affecting their welfare they can assert their claims and get reasonable consideration. Nothing has happened in connexion with the public servants to warrant the introduction of this clause, and the Attorney-General would be well advised to agree to its elimination. The Government are not likely to have trouble with the public servants unless they provoke them by coercive legislation of this character. The coercive legislation that was passed in certain States in years gone by never benefited the community in any way, but it caused resentment in the breasts of men against &#39; whom it was directed. The same result will occur in the Commonwealth Public Service if we attempt coercion. We have always had discipline in the Service, and there is already means of dealing with insubordination should it arise. This is a punitive clause, unqualified by any right of appeal. If circumstances should arise which led to the officers in certain branches refusing to carry out their duties would it be fair to instruct employees in other parts of the Service to step into the breach on pain of dismissal, and the loss of superannuation, and all other accrued rights? </para>

                        <para>- Of course. The Committee will make much more rapid progress with the Bill if the Attorney-General will agree to the elimination of this clause. We are anxious to expedite business,- but a provision of this kind must be resisted to the limit of our capacity. In connexion with the New South Wales railway trouble, men who had taken no part in creating the strike, but were drawn into it through heads of Departments instructing them to take up the positions of the men who refused duty, were dismissed. They had no right nf appeal; but there was an agitation for two or three years to get justice for them, and recently a few were restored to their positions, because they were proved to have done no wrong. But they had suffered through being out of their regular employment for some years. It is a very serious penalty to dismiss a man who has been in the Public Service for fifteen or twenty years. Once a man has specialized in a certain class of work for a number of years he becomes unfit to hold his own in other employments. This provision will leave the public servants entirely at the mercy of the Board. That men may be dismissed because they will not take the positions of men who are on strike is bad enough, but it is infinitely worse to punish them for giving a donation in connexion with any trouble outside the Service. The giving of donations to strikers and their families has been considered by the Arbitration Court many times. Thousands of people who, perhaps, are not in sympathy with the demands of strikers are yet unwilling to allow women and children to feel the pinch of necessity, and in that regard no section of the community is more generous-hearted than is the Public Service. </para>

                        <para>- That has happened many times. Decent men will not allow women and children to starve, because of a difference between the breadwinners and their employers. I do not wish to delay the passage of this Bill, but this clause must be eliminated. The words &#34; aiding, fomenting, or taking part in any strike&#34; make it clear that no matter where trouble occurs in connexion with public utilities, if any members of the Service do not obey the instructions to do the work of the men who are on strike they will be liable to be dismissed. This is going to extremes. In the past coercive legislation of this type has caused more controversy in the States than has anything else. In New South Wales the Wade Government suffered defeat on this account. The public will not stand for this class of legislation, nor for any party that seeks to enact it. This provision is intended to coerce a. large body of men. </para>

                        <para>- No, because they could not find any one who would be in favour of a clause which is such an insult to the Service. Our officers have always been loyal. During the war period they did extra work without asking for extra consideration for it. There is no necessity for applying legislation of this kind to a body of men who would rise to the occasion as our public servants did in the country&#39;s hour of need. I can assure the Minister that if this clause is not eliminated very little progress will be made with the Bill. How can honorable members face their constituents and tell them that they allowed this kind of thing to go through without proper discussion? I am afraid that those who have inserted this provision in the Bill do not grasp its full significance. Many Ministers have never been in close touch with the workers, and, therefore, they cannot understand the principle which lies behind the clause, or realize that it levels an attack against their own employees in the Public Service. If the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> were present, we would not have had any trouble about the matter. He knows that there is a good deal in the contention raised by honorable members, as any one who has had experience in industrial circles would know. Clerical workers who formerly were opposed to arbitration have realized quite recently that it is only by this means that they are able to improve their position. Yet, just when the members of our Public Service have found it necessary to make use of the Arbitration Court, the Government have seen fit to deprive them of the opportunity of approaching that tribunal, and have followed up this prohibition by providing in this clause that if any trouble arises owing to the fact that the Commonwealth employees have no tribunal to which they can appeal, they must either submit to the conditions imposed upon them or go about their business. If they happen to cease work they are dismissed, and if any officer is called in to do the work of those who are dismissed, he also will have to go if he declines to do that work. The whole thing is against the first principles laid down in British jurisprudence. It will certainly not lead to contentment in the Service. Since Federation we have not had the slightest trouble in our Service. Everything has worked smoothly, and now, at this juncture and without any justification whatever, the Government introduce legislation of this kind. </para>

                    <para>. - Now that the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> is here, I suggest that he should postpone this clause and reconsider it. because I am sure it goes a great deal further than he intended. The sidenote to the clause reads &#34; Officers taking part in strikes against Government &#34; ; and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan&#39;s</inline> recommendation was confined to the matter of officers in the Government Service striking against their own Government. I would agree with the provision if it were confined to officers striking against their own Government. The Government are entitled to do exactly what any private employer would do to his own employees. Put there is something else in the clause which I am sure the Minister did not intend, and to which I believe the Committee will not agree. Power is given to the Board to dismiss a man summarily, even without giving him notice. </para>

                        <para>- It is scarcely worth one&#39;s while to discuss the clause unless the nature of the amendment is intimated to the Committee; but I warn  the Government. against extreme legislation of this kind. It will do infinitely more harm than anything else could possibly do. No State in the Union suffers through strikes more than Tasmania does. If the lock-out, or whatever it is called, which exists in New South Wales at the present time is continued for any length of time, the State will find itself once more isolated. For that reason I am opposed to any legislation which is calculated to create the very thing we are attempting to prevent. I am sure that this clause goes infinitely further than the Minister intended - even further than <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan</inline> has recommended. We must always bear in mind that a Statute is interpreted by the words as they appear in cold black type, and not in accordance with the intention expressed by any Minister. This clause places in the hands of the Board of Commissioners a power which I do not think any Parliament should give to such a body, and I hope that the Minister will postpone it for further consideration. </para>

                    <para>.- I am totally opposed to direct action, and therefore do not advocate the elimination of this clause, but I have already asked the Minister to amend it. With the honorable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blundell),</inline> I interviewed the honorable gentleman on the subject, and he readily promised to consider our representations. I would ask him again now to consent to some amendment which would make it impossible to construe the clause to mean that if men contribute to a fund in aid of starving women whose husbands are on strike, they shall be deemed to be aiding and abetting that strike. I am sure that the Minister in framing the clause did not intend to punish such action as that. Members of the Labour party have very short memories. I do not wish to enlarge on the past, but I ask them to carry their minds back to something that took place when the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Frazer</inline> was Postmaster-General.

                    <para>It is to bc noted that this clause as printed allows of no appeal against the finding of the Board of Commissioners that an officer has been guilty of taking part in a strike. It is quite possible that an officer may be summarily dismissed on wrong information that he has aided, &#38;c, a strike against the Government. The clause -provides no opportunity for an officer to question any statement submitted to the Board. Surely an officer should have the right of  denying  allegations made against him. This is the only provision made in the Bill for summary dismissal, and in a time of high feeling it is felt that an innocent officer may be disposed of on entirely inaccurate reports to the Board. On the main point it is urged that there is quite sufficient power in the Bill to enable an officer who has actually committed an offence of the nature stated to be tried before the Board of Appeal and punished with the severity demanded by his offence. </para>

                    <para>.- To my mind, the amendment which the Minister proposes to make will not improve the clause, under which not only a man who is aiding a strike, but even a man who is a member of a political organization, may be punished by summary dismissal if that organization is charged by the Government of the day with being actively engaged in fomenting disturbances throughout the Commonwealth. This charge is at the present time being made against certain political organizations. The honorable member for Denison <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Laird Smith)</inline> and other members of his party will, no doubt, soon be telling their constituents that certain political organizations to which they are opposed are actively engaged in fomenting disturbances. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member may have convinced himself of the truth of his accusations; he may not think that he is abusing any one. Certainly,  the mouthpieces of his party have accused the members of the Labour party and of other political organizations of actively fomenting industrial trouble; indeed, they have gone further, and have said that we are the paid agents of others who wish to have trouble stirred up. TI a member of the Public Service were a member of an organization so charged, the clause would afford a convenient way of getting him out of the Service. Honorable members know that during the war not only were persons of so-called enemy origin, that is, persons of German or Austrian parentage, interned, but others as well were put behind barbed wire on the whispering of interested persons. Those who were arrested and interned during the war were not told why they were interned, beyond being informed that allegations had been made against them, the names of those who were said to have made the allegations being withheld. The Government is certainly acting consistently with that policy in proposing this clause. No doubt, its secret service agents, or those who operate its Intelligence Department - I do not know why that name is given to them - will make investigations, and persons who, for other than the ostensible reasons it is desired to remove from the Public Service, will be charged with having expressed opinions in favour of men who are out on strike. Under the clause, the Board of Commissioners may become a very good imitation of the Inquisition, and its members can, if they so desire, make the life of an officer unbearable. Although the clause pretends to punish the aiding of strikes, and is said to have been framed for the purpose of preventing them, my opinion is that it will be productive of strikes. Any body of men of spirit would resent being called on by a Board to explain why a donation had been given to some other body of men who were striking for better conditions, or had found themselves locked out, as the miners of the southern collieries of New South Wales are at the present time. The honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mcwilliams)</inline> suggests that it is not improper that the Government should exercise all its powers in dealing with people who are striking against a Government activity. There is no force in that argument. We know very well that when the friends of the </para>

Take the recent strike of miners at Broken Hill. For nearly two years the men put up a tremendous strike, and people in all walks of life contributed to their support, and that of their dependants. Would any supporter of the Government say that a public servant should have been dismissed, or that his action should have even been questioned, when he supported the miners at Broken Hill, who were struggling . against adverse conditions? No honorable member opposite would say anything of the kind, yet we find them proposing to vote for this clause. They are prepared to vote that a public servant, against whom an information under this clause is lodged, shall be summarily dismissed. </para>

                        <para>- The Government, as it is, have complete control, and this clause is wholly unnecessary. Why have they not included in the Bill a clause providing that if a public servant is found  in a gambling house, or some other objectionable place, he shall be summarily dismissed? Conduct of that kind, in the eyes of the Ministry, is, apparently, harmless. Obviously they have not in mind the punishment of public servants for breaches of the law; if they had they would incorporate in this Bill full power to deal with all breaches of the law on the part of members of the Service. Their object, in so far as this clause is concerned, is not to deal with a breach of the law, but to cut off supplies furnished by one section of the working classes to another section that is engaged in a strike. They think they have the power to intimidate the Public Service in. this way. From my point of view it is good business for the Ministry to pursue this policy. We have in the Public Service public-spirited individuals who will refuse to allow their manhood to be taken from them in this way. </para>

                <para>The Government would have the public believe that their object in inserting this provision in the Bill is, by cutting off the source of supply, to make it more difficult for strikes to be maintained. The experience of Australia is that that cannot be done. Such attempts tend merely to create more strikes, and that will be the effect of this clause. If I were a public servant I should consider that in joining the Public Service I had not forfeited any of my citizen rights. If I thought that a body of men were putting up a fight for decent living conditions, not only would <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> assist them financially, but I should object to being muzzled. I would give expression to my feelings of sympathy with the men. Why should a man be muzzled and prevented from exercising the ordinary rights of citizenship because he chances to be a public servant? </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member is not unaware of what happens even in this Empire, of which he is, at times, so inordinately proud. Does he forget Amritzar; he forgets perhaps the seventy odd people who were suffocated in a train? They were not given much chance. Any public servant with spirit would resent this provision. It is utterly stupid to suggest that its effect will be to prevent strikes. I hold that it is directly calculated to cause more disputes. Public servants are in no respect different from any other body of workers. If one of their number is singled out for punishment under this clause, do honorable members think that industrial peace will be preserved? The chief cause of industrial trouble is the victimization of individuals; the making of &#34;marked&#34; men and the making of horrible examples in the industrial life of the community. How is this clause to conduce to an efficient Public Service? The Attorney-General knows full well that it cannot possibly have that effect. If it is to be operative, it will be productive of trouble. If it is not to be operative, then the only explanation for its presence in the Bill is that it is part of a political mozaic for electioneering purposes - it is to harmonize with the Prime Minister&#39;s attack on the Red objective. If that is so, we can understand the position taken up by the Government. If the Attorney-General would tell us that this is , a purely electioneering matter for the benefit of his friends outside, and that the Government have no intention of operating the clause, we should save a lot of time. It is certain that if the Government are so foolish as to try to enforce the clause, they will bring a great deal of trouble on themselves. If that is their intention, I wish them every success. </para>

                    <para>.- The amendment does not go far enough. The whole clause is objectionable ; the Bill would be only the better for its omission. When a person joins the Public Service he does not abrogate his rights of citizen  ship. So long as ho gives the full amount of time required of him to his duties, and undertakes them to the satisfaction of those in charge, the Government have no right to look for more. They have no right to seek to control his actions in his own time, or to say what he shall do with the money he has earned. There are dozens of ways in which, under cover of this clause, a public servant might find himself implicated in a strike if the head of his Department had a grudge against him. I, as the father of a family, might be out on strike in connexion with the trade in which I am engaged. My son might be in the Public Service; but, if he were to contribute anything towards the upkeep of myself and my family, he might be dismissed. </para>

                <para>When the great maritime strike occurred in Victoria the then Chief Justice, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higinbotham, walked up to the Trades Hall every week and contributed &#163;50 in the interests of the men who were striking for justice. A man who is not prepared nowadays to organize, and, if necessary, fight for his rights, gets nowhere. The Public Service has become highly organized, and, as a result, the rank and file are enjoying rights which they could never have won for themselves acting individually. A measure was passed some years ago through the New South Wales Legislature which is known as the Wade Coercion Act. It sought to prevent railway men from taking part in any dispute inside or outside of the railway service; and it contained the threat that if railway servants broke the law they would be deprived of their superannuation benefits. However, in the great strike which occurred in New South Wales a few years ago, the whole of the railway service left work. Those public servants were not to be intimidated by an Act of Parliament. If the Commonwealth Government import all sorts of penalties into this measure the Public </para>
                <para class="block">Service will still stand up for its rights. Individual officers will still find means of contributing to strike funds, if they consider that the strikers are in the right There are many ways in which an Act can be circumvented. In this instance, what could prevent a public servant from making his contributions through a private individual? In the circumstances, why should not the clause be omitted ? Nowadays, a provision of this character is like showing a red rag to a bull. Men will not be told that they shall not strike or show their sympathy for strikers. Nobody wants to strike, but sometimes there is no other way of securing justice. The Public Service will resent this clause; it will prove responsible for trouble, at any rate unless it is redrafted to provide that the Board shall have no power of control outside the hours of a public servant&#39;s duties. </para>

                        <para>- Practically any strike may do that. A shipping strike, or a tramway, or railway, or printers&#39; strike would interfere with the conduct of the Public Service. I cannot recall that there have been any strikes in the Commonwealth Public Service; and I do not remember that public servants, as a body, have participated in any strike. But they are more aggressive than they used to be. The Service has become more thoroughly organized, and, for that reason, obviously, this National Government have come along with the threat embodied in the clause under review. </para>

What would be the position if, in case of a strike anywhere, the executive of the various unions and&#39; guilds with which the captains, officers, engineers, seamen, firemen, and stewards on the Commonwealth boats are connected decided to make a levy of &#163;1 per head?

                        <para>- But our experience is that almost any strike interferes with the carrying on of the public services and utilities of the Commonwealth. If, unfortunately, the strike in New South Wales continues, Tasmania will be isolated, for all shipping communication with the mainland must cease. Similar results would follow a strike  of  wharf labourers, ships&#39; stewards or engineers; there is scarcely a strike that can take place on the mainland which would not interfere with the public utilities of Tasmania. Unfortunately, as an island State dependent wholly on water carriage, Tasmania, when a strike occurs &#34; gets it just where the chicken did - right in the neck.&#34; I have not the slightest sympathy with strikers when there are arbitration and conciliation tribunals available, but we ought to know just exactly how far this clause operates. If strikes are to continue, it is about time we dispensed with our conciliation and arbitration legislation. </para>

                        <para>- It is our duty, when penalizing legislation which affects the whole Public Service is before us, to ascertain its exact meaning. The explanation given by the Acting Leader of the House <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> is, in my view, quite different, or largely different, from that given by the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom).</inline> I gathered from the explanation of the latter that all the men I have mentioned would, under the circumstances I have suggested, come under this clause; but if the Acting Leader of the House is correct - and I accept his statement - I hope we will have words inserted to remove any ambiguity. I submit that the consideration of the clause should be postponed, in order that a fresh clause may be drafted by the Attorney-General and his advisers, setting forth the position plainly There ought to be no ambiguity, which can only lead to serious confusion and difficulty in the future. In a considerable percentage of cases, industrial troubles arise from misunderstandings; and I have advocated industrial peace legislation in preference to arbitration, because in the case of the former the parties concerned can meet around the table, and there is every chance of having misunderstandings removed. It would be a pity to pass legislation which does not state in plain language exactly what it means. I think that if my suggestion to postpone the clause were accepted it would result in a speedier passing of this measure. </para>

This Government, constituted as it is, might be expected to do something in the direction of this legislation - so much is looked for by the Conservative section of the community which keeps them in power.

The means of reaching the Arbitration Court are being whittled away both inside and outside the Public Service. Public servants, like the rest of mankind, have their difficulties and disadvantages. The word &#34; aiding &#39;&#39; is to be removed, but the words &#34; taking part in &#34; are just as objectionable. </para>

                        <para>- Does not the honorable gentleman think that he might do better by hanging the leaders of strikes, or subjecting them to the effects of boiling oil or molten lead? There are many reasons why wage-earners go on strike, but when they do make that final protest against the conditions under which they labour, they are told, as they have been told for centuries, that they ought to go and find work elsewhere. However, we have now arrived at a stage of development when men refuse to go elsewhere, and when they determine to better the conditions where they are. Public servants have been told by governmental heads in Australia that they must accept and suffer whatever is &#34; coming to them,&#34; and they must do this without demur. That was the tone of the Victorian Government when the public servants of that State attempted to improve their conditions. We all know that if the organizations of the public servants called them out on strike, the public servants would have to come out or forever be branded. I have been told by men who &#34; ratted &#34; in the great railway strike in Australia over twenty years ago that they would never have done so had they known what the consequences would be, for they had since found their life a hell. The Minister might draw up a clause to deal with the leaders of strikes as the leaders of the Australian Workers Union were dealt with. That was a rational way of acting; but we should not say to some unfortunate in the Service, working under circumstances that he cannot control, that he must not resent his conditions. &#34; Fomenting&#34; is an ugly word, and is very comprehensive. Will the Minister admit that the public servants have a right to differ from the views of those who control them? </para>

                        <para>- Half-a-dozen public servants may be discussing the conditions under which they are working, when some senior officer or &#34;spotter&#34; overhears them, lays a charge against them of fomenting a strike, and so brings about their dismissal. If the clause imposed punishment for taking part in a strike, it would be bad enough, but surely it is unnecessary to retain a word like &#34;fomenting,&#34; which may be construed to mean anything. The clause will give certain officers power to summarily dismiss subordinates without a trial. Men are not to be allowed to try to better their conditions. We heard a great deal of enthusiastic appreciation of the soldiers who left Australia to fight in the big war. A good deal of the stubbornness and tenacity for which the Australian soldier was noted was acquired in Australia, where he lived in an atmosphere of determined resistance of unfairness. But whilst an Australian is lauded for stubbornness and persistence in one sphere, if he displays the same qualities in struggling for his rights in another sphere, he may be summarily dismissed, perhaps on the unsupported testimony of some officer. </para>

                        <para>-I admit that; but neither should the Department. The Government are depriving certain officers of the right to appeal to the Arbitration Court, and now they are forbidding them from even sympathizing with a strike. One would almost think that the public servants were not ordinary human beings. There is a good deal of talk about discipline, and there seems to be an endeavour to Germanize the Public Service. Germans will meet together at a club and drill and discipline each other because they like that sort of thing; but a Britisher, and especially an Australian, does not like to be disciplined unnecessarily. Our people claim the right to assert themselves when unfairness is imposed upon them. With my colleagues on this side of the chamber, I intend to resist this clause strenuously. </para>

                    <para>.- This clause is preposterous from beginning to end. I should like to know whether the genius of the Attorney-General was responsible for the drafting of it. A few nights ago he urged the Committee to adopt something because it had been in operation in the British Service for 100 years. This clause is not to be found in any Public Service law of any country in the world; it was not to be found even in Russia under the Czar. By this provision, the Government will be able to dismiss any man at their own sweet will upon any pretext. The framing of a clause of this character is an absolute disgrace, and the services of the person who concocted it should be dispensed with. What right has any employer to interfere with the liberty of an employee outside of working hours? The only authority which any employer, whether Government or private, has over employees is in regard to their employment. They have no right to interfere with him in any other respect. When a man leaves his work, having done all that for which he is paid, he has a right to speak for, or vote for, or aid anything that appeals to him, and there is no more justification for interfering with him because he supports a strike than there is for interfering with him because he is an opponent of a strike. The Government propose to penalize one shade of opinion. No public servant may sympathize with a strike. It is not proposed to penalize a man who simply plays the part of a &#34; scab,&#34; or is hostile to the strikers. I suggest to the Minister that, in order that the clause might be made appropriately comprehensive, it should be framed in this way - </para>

                <para class="block">The clause, as amended at the instance of the Minister, does not give an employee the right of appeal in respect of this particular class of offence. Any scallawag, or &#34; spotter,&#34; or spy in the Service may lay a charge against a man, and the Board may make use of this clause to dismiss him. In order to make the clause perfect the Minister might add- </para>

                <para class="block">Whoever concocted this clause, whether he was the Attorney-General or the head of his Department, is simply an agent of the employing class ; he is anti-labour, and hostile to the workers. He is building up a system of spies and fizgigs within the Service. He is laying it down that an accused man shall have no means of confronting the persons who lay the information against him, or of hearing any evidence; there is to be no Court or trial of any kind. If at any time the Government wish to dismiss a man, all they have to do is to arrange for an allegation to be made under this clause, and then dismiss him on the ground that he is suspected of having an opinion in favour of, or being in sympathy with, or actively fomenting, some strike in some part of the Commonwealth. There can be no strike in any part of Australia, not even a coal strike, that does not in some way affect the Public Service and the utilities of the Commonwealth, and any man in the Service in any part of the Commonwealth sympathizing with the strikers may be dismissed without the right of appeal. This is the most tyrannical provision to be found in any Public Service Act in the world. The Attorney-General has told us that we ought to adopt certain procedure because it was in force in England 100 years ago. </para>

                        <para>- But if the Commissioners are satisfied that a man has been guilty of aiding in a strike they will dismiss him summarily. The provision is not to apply to a man who &#34; scabs,&#34; or is hostile to a strike, or acts as a strike breaker. Why should not the punishment apply both ways? If it be a crime to assist in a strike it should also be a crime to oppose a strike - in fact, it should be a crime to participate in a strike either way. The creation of a distinction between one offence and another can only be justified on partisan grounds, and in order that this distinction shall not be made, and that the offenders against this provision in the Bill may have the right of appeal, I suggest that the provision should read - </para>

                        <para>- Admitting that that is so, the words in the clause to which I have drawn attention must be superfluous. Evidently the purpose of their inclusion is to deprive an officer of a right which applies in the case of every other offence. For every other offence an officer may be suspended until his case is tried; but in. this case, after consideration by the Board, the officer accused may be summarily dismissed without resort to the remedy that he would have if he were charged with any other offence. </para>

                    <para>.- I hope that the Minister will withdraw the clause. It is too late in the history of this country to hope to pass legislation of this kind. Surely employees, whether they be the employees of the State or of a private person, have the right to decline to carry on their work under conditions of which they disapprove. If the public servants think that the conditions sought to be imposed on them are unjust, why should they not protest in the only way left to them, by declining to continue at work until those conditions are remedied? I hope that the Minister will not insist in depriving the public servants of a right which is possessed by the ordinary citizen. This Government proposes to amend the Arbitration (Public Service) Act by taking from certain public servants the  right to bring their grievances to arbitration, and it tells the same public servants that they are also to be deprived of the right to refuse to work when their conditions are unsatisfactory. The Government cannot have it both ways. If the public servants are not to strike, let them have arbitration. To take from them the right to submit their claims to arbitration, and at the same time to say that they shall not strike, is to deliver a deadly blow at their freedom and liberty. The Government knows that the public servants have realized that they belong to the working class and to the Australian Labour movement, just as do mechanics and tradesmen outside the service. Ministers know that the public servants have realized that they must join hands with the trade unionists. Now, the Government says to these men, &#34; If you link up with trade unionism, if you dare to connect yourselves with the Labour movement, or associate yourselves in any way with a strike or a stoppage of work, you will be immediately dismissed, without right of appeal, and will lose all your privileges.&#34; It is too late to make such a threat. The public servants are alive to their interests. They realize that they are as much members of the working class as are boilermakers, engineers, carpenters, or other trade unionists, and that their salvation lies in linking up with trade unionism and with the Labour movement. When they have done that, and feel that they have a grievance in the conditions of their employment, they will be able to call to their aid the trade unionists throughout Australia. This is why the Minister tells them that if they assist those who are out on strike they will be dismissed. It is well to unmask this proposal, so that the public servants may know what the object of the Minister is. I hope that when they have the opportunity, they will vote for the party that will give them the same liberty as trade unionists possess. I protest against this clause as a relic of the old, dark, barbarous ages, and I hope that, if the Minister persists with it, he will not long persist as a Minister. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to record my protest against the clause which the honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mahony)</inline> has just spoken against. It seems to me that the Government is out to rob the public servants of their liberty. It is preposterous to introduce in a Bill like this, for the government of a large body of persons like the Public Service of the Commonwealth, objectionable limitations to their liberties. I am aware, of course, that one could talk from now till Doomsday without making an impression on the minds of those who are governing the country at this juncture. No matter what arguments may be used, when the party whip is cracked the Bill must go through, right or wrong. Although the Minister is supposed to have given careful consideration to the drafting of this measure, we have had circulated a list of over 100 amendments that he intends to move. The circulation of this list of amendments reflects on his sense, capacity and capability. If he is unable, after having had time for reflection and calm consideration, to frame a Bill which does not need amending by him, he cannot be trusted to frame any Bill. </para>

                        <para>- Then I shall confine myself strictly to the question. The clause absolutely takes away the liberties of the public servants of Australia, and makes it unsafe for them to utter their thoughts. The present Ministers are the Government of the country to-day, but they will not be in office to-morrow, because they are filling positions which the people of Australia do not wish them to occupy. I remind them that those who filch the liberties of the people go down. It is an insult to me and to my countrymen, for a foreigner, leading a Government here to-day, to bring forward Bills in an Australian Parliament - </para>

                        <para>- I claim that, by means of this clause, my liberty as an Australian is being taken from me. That is the point up to which I have been working. You, sir, may call upon me to keep within the ordinary rules of parliamentary procedure, but, despite what the Standing Orders may provide, you cannot crush my sentiments.What I desire to say will be said, if not here, at all events, outside. The clause follows the lines of the degenerate Imperialistic Conservative policy which has been enunciated by the Government in connexion with, not only this Bill, but many other measures they have passed. This clause takes away the liberty of the subject. I shall never stand for such retrograde measures. I shall never support the passing of any Bill that will take away the liberty of my fellow countrymen. </para>

                        <para>-With all due respect to the honorable member, I hold that the Committee has no authority to place restrictions upon the liberty of the people. This Parliament has no warrant to do such a thing, and as surely as the sun shines at midday, it will pass out for its transgressions against the liberty of the people of the Commonwealth. This clause is an insult and a slander upon the people. Evidently the war, which originated in 1914 and terminated in 1918, has been responsible for the introduction of a militaristic spirit into the House of Representatives. Incidentally, it has foisted on the Parliament quite a number of what we call &#34; brass hats,&#34; or, in other words, military gentlemen. I have nothing against them. </para>

                    <para>-  I desire some explanation by the Minister for Defence for the unusual course which he is adopting. The Committee was in the midst of the Bill which had been given first place on the notice-paper; suddenly, after the closure had been applied, progress was reported. Then, when I sought to learn what business was to come before the House - when I asked what measure could be so important as to warrant this extraordinary procedure, I was given to understand that no fresh business was to be introduced, but that the House would revert, in Committee, to the consideration of the same measure. I give timely warning that if the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> pursues this course upon which he has entered, the Government will have to continue to do the same throughout the next week or two. I shall not stand for this conduct, and the party behind me will have none of it. We intend to fight every inch of the way from this moment onwards, election or no election in December. </para>

                        <para>- Order! I have already informed the honorable member that he may not debate his proposed motion of dissent. He must comply with the forms of the House. I have no objection to his moving that the House dissent from my ruling, but the honorable member must proceed in the proper way. It would not be seemly, in keeping with the dignity of the House, or consonant with the Standing Orders, if the Chair became involved in argument. If the honorable member feels himself aggrieved by anything which the Chair may have done, I have already apprised him of the manner in which he may proceed to remedy his grievance. If he is not prepared to follow the proper procedure, the incident must close, and I shall proceed with the business before the House. </para>

I stated quite plainly that the question was that the Committee have leave to sit at a later hour this day. I stated the question more than once, and surely the honorable member had opportunities to know on what he was voting? There was no other question before the House. </para>

                    <para>-In response to the appeal made by the Acting Leader of the House <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene),</inline> I wish to say that a statement that honorable members on this side were obstructing the business is quite unwarranted. The principle involved in the clause that was before us is a very important one with our party. This is the first time since I have been a member that a clause of the kind has been incorporated in a Bill, and it is sought to apply it to the public servants, who have always been loyal to this country. There has been nothing in the nature of obstruction, but we feel it our duty to express our views, and, in doing so, we were not going beyond reasonable limits. We were just about to take a division on that clause; and as to the remaining clauses, there is no intention of holding up the Bill, beyond the time necessary to introduce some reasonable amendments. Our object was to get through this Bill to-day; and as to the unpleasantness that has occurred, the Minister, by attempting to apply the guillotine, has only himself to thank for the. interruption. I understand now that the Leader of the House is prepared to go no further in that direction if we will give reasonable despatch to business, and get the Bill through. I think that every man on this side will agree that it was our desire to get the measure through to-night, and the feeling aroused has been engendered by the action of the Minister himself. I can only say that if the honorable gentleman adopts another course, and is prepared to allow reasonable discussion, he will probably find himself in a much better position at the end of next week than he otherwise would. </para>

Honorable members can see that if that sort of thing is permitted, it will be impossible to carry on public business. Particularly I ask honorable members to remember that when an honorable member is requested to resume his seat he should do so immediately ; for him to remain standing is to reduce the proceedings to a. state of disorder. If it is desired to take exception to anything that is said or done, there are forms of the House by which action can be taken. So far as I am concerned, there will always be opportunity to ventilate matters in a proper way. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not think this clause is quite as fair to the public servants as it might be. I suggest that the Minister substitute the words, &#34;upon report from the Board of Appeal.&#34; My object is to give the public servants the right of appeal, and the words the Minister proposes to insert have not that effect. I urge this, because the officer will have the right to go to the Board for leave to appeal. It should not be left to the Board to say that he is inefficient and the matter end there. The man may have been a considerable time in the service of the country, and he would suffer a hardship if he were put out in the way I have indicated. </para>

A man might be inefficient or unfit to discharge his duties on account of ill-health, but action will be taken only after full inquiry. I am amending the clause to provide that nothing shall be done without full investigation. </para>

A man may have reached the age of fifty-seven or fifty-eight, and because of that be no longer efficient for the work he has hitherto performed; he is, therefore, appointed to another position at a lower salary. Because of that he suffers on his retirement. The amendment I suggest would insure that, for the purposes of superannuation or any other privileges, he should retire at the salary he was receiving prior to being declared inefficient. </para>

                    <para>. -  The proposal is not reasonable. A man&#39;s salary has been reduced on account of inefficiency, but he remains in the Service for another ten years. On his retirement he is entitled to six months&#39; or twelve months&#39; furlough, as the case may be, or its equivalent in salary. Theamendment means that he would be able to draw pay in lieu of furlough on the basis of the salary he had drawn prior to being reduced. I remind the honorable member that furlough is not compensation to a man because he has been reduced. </para>

                    <para>. - I cannot agree to the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition. Surely the sub-clause goes far enough in allowing the representative of the organization to be absent from his ordinary duties in order that he may prepare a case for the benefit of himself and his fellow members. All witnesses who are called to give evidence before the Arbitrator, however, will receive their  pay. </para>

                    <para>. - This clause provides, among other things, that any officer retired from the Commonwealth Public Service after the 30th November, 1919, is entitled to the furlough provided for in the Bill, but, on the second reading, I pointed out that a considerable number of officers had retired after serving upwards of forty years, and in some cases even fifty years, and had not taken the double furlough to which they were entitled. At the end of their term of service, to their great surprise, they were only granted single furlough, or six months&#39; pay in lieu of dual furlough. The law in regard to their rights has been somewhat nebulous. One Commonwealth Attorney-General has given the opinion that these men were entitled to double furlough at the end of their second term of twenty years, provided that they had. not taken any furlough during their period of forty years&#39; service, but another Attorney-General has given a different opinion. The distinct spirit of the law is that a man who serves a double term of twenty years without taking his furlough is entitled at the end of that period to double furlough. It is laid down that if a man at the end of his first period of service takes his furlough of six months he is entitled, after a second term of twenty years&#39; service, to another period of furlough, but there have been many cases where officers, at the request of the heads of their Department, and in the interest of the Public Service, have remained at work for the full period of forty years without taking furlough, with the result, under the interpretation of the law as laid down by the Attorney-General, that they found, to their great surprise, they were only entitled to single furlough. That is manifestly unjust. If they had chosen to take their first furlough at the end of the first period of twenty years, they would have been entitled to a second furlough at the end of their second twenty years, but, because, in the interest of the Public Service, and having regard to their responsibilities in the offices they held, they continued at work without taking furlough till the end of forty years, they found themselves entitled only to six months&#39; furlough, although the spirit of the law is that an officer in the Commonwealth Service is entitled to six months&#39; furlough for every twenty years of service. On the second reading I made the suggestion to the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene),</inline> who was in charge of the House at the time, that those retired officers of the Commonwealth Service who are still alive, and have forty years&#39; service to their credit, should at least be entitled to compensation in lieu of the second period of furlough which they did not receive. I understood from the Minister that the matter was to receive the attention of the Government. Strictly speaking, following on the principle laid down in this Bill, I had contended that even where men had retired with only thirty-five or thirty-six years&#39; service they were entitled to a proportion of the second period of furlough, but, as I was told, that proposal could not be entertained. I then suggested that all those who were still alive, and who had forty years&#39; service to their credit, should be entitled to their second furlough or six months&#39; pay in lieu thereof. The date fixed in the clause, namely, the 30th November, 1919, is an arbitrary one, and I suggest that it should be omitted, and that those who are qualified in the way I have indicated should be entitled to their second furlough. </para>

                        <para>- In one or two instances men have &#39;been granted twelve months&#39; furlough at the conclusion of forty years of service, but, unfortunately, the Government have not regarded those cases as establishing a precedent, and have not granted the same privilege to others who have served for the same or a longer period. I have in mind the case of a man who, having served for forty-seven years, was retired on the 2nd November, 1919, only twenty-eight days before the arbitrary date fixed in the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. It seems to me that there can be very few men alive today who could take advantage of the concession for which I ask, if it were granted. I should like the Minister, if he can do so, to give the Committee some information on the point, so that we may arrive at some conclusion as to the probable cost to the country of abolishing the date that has been arbitrarily fixed, and giving the concession to all who have served for forty years and upwards, without regard to the date of their retirement. </para>

                    <para>. The Bill has been made retrospective so far as we could justly make it so. Its operation will go back to practically the date when it was promised that it should have effect. The honorable member has asked how much it would cost to give the concession which he advocates. I have had the matter investigated, and I am informed that there are no fewer than 144 men who have served for forty years and upwards, and to grant this concession to them would cost the country &#163;22,867. Those who have retired after a service of from twenty-five to thirty-nine years number 126, and if the concession were given to them it would cost &#163;7,959; or, for the whole number of 270 persons, the cost would be &#163;30,826. A limited number of these persons are drawing pensions. </para>

                    <para>.- It seems to me that it would be advisable to make mandatory the provision in subclause 8 that any person temporarily employed for a continuous period extending beyond twelve months &#34; may &#34; be granted leave of absence for recreation or on account of illness. I suggest that the word &#34;shall&#34; be substituted for the word &#34;may&#34;. If a man has served twelve months continuously he should be entitled to a holiday as a matter of right. The sub-clause as it stands leaves it to the Chief Officer to determine whether or not he shall be granted leave. </para>

                    <para>That the following proviso be added to the clause: - &#34;Provided that any returned soldier who has been employed continuously for a period of not less than two years may be permanently appointed without examination if the Chief Officer certifies that the duties of such returned soldier have been performed in a satisfactory manner, and that such duties are of a non-clerical character.&#34; </para>

                <para class="block">I submit this amendment for the reason that a number of returned soldiers who have to their credit long periods of employment in the Service, and are discharging to the entire satisfaction of their superior officers duties calling for no special clerical knowledge or ability cannot be placed on the permanent list because, while they are thoroughly competent to discharge the duties allotted to them, they are unable to pass the prescribed examination. Honorable members will realize that a man of forty years or upwards whose education has been limited, and who has been struggling for years to maintain his wife and family, may find it very difficult to pass the prescribed examination. There are quite a number of people occupying good positions outside the Service who might find it very difficult to pass some of the Public Service examinations. Men of forty years and upwards, in the circumstances I have named, could scarcely be expected to comply with such a condition. The services allotted to these men do not call for special knowledge. Many of them are drivers, office cleaners, assistants in the mail branch of the Postal Department, and letter carriers. I am not asking that this provision shall apply to those who have only been temporarily employed in the Service for a short period. I confine  my proposal to returned soldiers who have not less than two years&#39; service to their credit, and are declared by the heads of their Departments to have carried out their duties in an entirely satisfactory manner. I make the further proviso that the work shall be of a non-clerical character. It may be said that this would be unfair to returned men outside the Service who are waiting to get in, but  Mich  men could only obtain employment on the discharge of returned soldiers already in the Department. The passing of this provision will not prevent men outside the Service from entering it. Some of the men to whom my amendment would apply have been temporarily employed for seven or eight years, and in ordinary circumstances may continue in the Service for another ten or twelve years. The trouble is, however,  that  they are liable  at  any moment to be discharged. No objection to this provision can reasonably be offered by men already in the Service, because it will apply only to returned soldiers who have been temporarily employed for at least two years. We have already agreed to clause  38,  which declares that a man who has served in the Navy, and has a satisfactory record, may be appointed without examination to any office in the Fourth Division in the Department of Trade and Customs. We have made that provision for men who have served in the Navy, and there is no reason why we should not place in the same position men who have served in the Australian Imperial Force. We ought not to make distinctions between the two classes of service. Some of these men were temporarily employed in the Public Service when the war broke out. They are still on the temporary list, and can be discharged at a moment&#39;s notice. </para>

I would draw the attention of the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> to the fact that, while these men are described as temporary employees, and have been employed in the Service two years and upwards, the work they are performing is not of a temporary character They are doing the ordinary work of the various Departments, and it is simply the tenure of their position that can be regarded as temporary. They are liable, as the&#34; honorable member has said, to be dismissed at any time. It seems to me that these returned soldiers deserve consideration, and the fact that for two years and upwards they have been doing the ordinary regular work of the Departments in a manner that commends itself to their departmental heads should be a sufficient guarantee that they would make efficient officers of the permanent Service. </para>

                    <para>.- I support the amendment. There are many returned men in the Public Service working as  temporary employees who have been incapacitated as a result of their war services. They do not receive sufficient by way of pension to enable them to provide for themselves and their families, and they do not desire to be a burden upon the community. I may cite the typical case of a man who lost a .leg. Before the war he had been a labourer. After his discharge from a military hospital he obtained employment in the  Postal Department, and worked in a mail room. In the course of several years&#39; service as a temporary hand he has given every satisfaction. But periodically he is informed that, his temporary term having ended, his services will be no longer required. On more than one occasion I have had to go to the Postmaster-General and ask that this man be employed for a further period. It is not fair, seeing that the incapacitated man has given every satisfaction, that his position should be taken&#39; from him, even though it is to be filled by another exsoldier. </para>

                    <para>. -  The amendment has raised a problem of so difficult and involved a character that I cannot accept  it. If the Government were to be consistent and give the same concession to clerical workers as to non-clerical employees, about 400 former soldiers who have passed a competitive examination, and have made themselves eligible for employment in the Commonwealth Service, would be affected merely because certain other returned men had had the good fortune to get in ahead of them and secured temporary employment. All returned men should be put upon an equal footing. The Act specially provides for that. If returned men occupying temporary positions are made permanent employees, the Government will be setting up a special class of ex-soldiers to the exclusion of all other former soldiers. When temporary positions are about to be made permanent, the canons of fair play demand&#39; that these posts shall be thrown open <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> all returned soldiers who have rendered themselves eligible for permanent employment in the Public Service. </para>

Why should not returned men who have satisfactorily worked in temporary positions be permitted to retain them permanently ? Why should they be called upon to give way to other returned soldiers who happen to have qualified by passing an examination ? My sympathies are certainly with those other returned soldiers who have fitted themselves to enter the Service, and are waiting; but, surely several years of satisfactory work on the part of those returned soldiers who are temporary employees must be taken as an adequate offset to passing an examination! </para>

                    <para>.  - Last night we had a long discussion on the subject of promotions and transfers. The Committee was of opinion that all promotions and transfers should be made by the  Board of Commissioners instead of by the heads of Departments; and also that promotion should not be within watertight compartments as under the existing Act., but should extend over the whole Service. A new clause has been drafted which substitutes the Board for the Permanent Head of the Department, and enacts that the Board, in making promotions, shall pay first regard to relative efficiency. A promotion will he only provisional, and &#39; all officers who are affected may appeal against the decision of the Board. Instead of the cumbersome and costly method of appeal under the present Act, the new clause provides for a personal conference so that the case may he heard and disposed of quickly. When an appeal is disallowed, the provisional appointment will be confirmed.I move - </para>

There was a great deal of confusion, at the time, and a number of interjections, and I am inclined now to think that I was in error in assuming, when the Minister rose to move another motion, that he rose to reply to the de- bate, and that is the reason I regarded the debate as closed. I make this explanation to the House, and express my regret if I was in error in supposing that the Minister had spoken in reply. </para>

                        <para>. - I wish to bring under the notice of the House an incident which has occurred in connexion with the administration of the Anti-Dumping Act, and to suggest that it is time some different methods were adopted by the Department concerned. Late this afternoon a special messenger from the Customs Department informed the importers of an Italian motor car chassis that they must not go on with the assembling of the car, just landed and released by the Customs on payment of duty, because the Minister had decided to apply to the chassis the provisions of the Anti-Dumping Act, and would advise them in due course of the penalty to be inflicted. There are upwards of ten business houses in Melbourne, and a number of firms in the other State capitals, seriously affected by this decision. The action taken in this case apparently indicates the course which the Minister for Trade and Customs intends to follow in the future. </para>

                            <para>- No, and as the importers are not able to determine what duty will be charged upon chassis, it is impossible for them to quote prices for cars. They have endeavoured to bring the matter before the Tariff Board for some time past, and when this action was taken to-day, as the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> was out of Melbourne, and the Tariff Board was in Western Australia, they could get no satisfaction. Since many of them were committed to orders before this action was taken and even before the Bill was passed the other day, they find themselves in a very difficult position. It is certain that many men employed in the motor car body-building trade in Australia will be thrown cut of work. </para>

One section of the Act is designed to protect the preferential incidence of the Tariff in favour of Great Britain, and it is distinctly laid down therein that if after inquiry and rV port by the Tariff Board, it is shown that goods are being imported into Australia from countries under depreciated rates of exchange at a price which is unfair to the British manufacturer, the Minister as impose dumping duties. </para>

                            <para>- I know nothing about that. I am. merely indicating what I believe to be the law on the matter. The honorable member took some exception to the suddenness of the action of the Customs Department, but all such actions of that Department must be taken suddenly. When the Department has decided to impose a duty, it must come down with the axe at the psychological moment, and that is generally after 4 o&#39;clock in the afternoon of the particular day on which action is taken, which fact would probably account for the hour at which the firms were notified to-day that the new rates of duty had become operative. </para>

But I promise the honorable member that I will bring the matter under the notice of the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> as soon as he returns to Melbourne, and see what the position is. </para>
