                        <para>- I understand that the old-age and invalid pensions law allows aged or invalid miners and others who receive relief from certain funds to enjoy, nevertheless, the full old-age and invalid pension. As the Victoria Racing Club has established a fund for the relief of aged and infirm trainers and jockeys, will the Treasurer, when considering the rectification of the anomalies in our pensions legislation, provide for the granting of full, pensions to aged or infirm trainers and jockeys who are getting relief from that fund? </para>

                        <para>.- For the past few months, we have had the spectacle of the Prime Minister (Mir. Hughes) running up and down throughout the length and breadth of Australia urging the people to "Produce, produce, produce." That has been the cry everywhere. Now the Government have come down to this House with a statement in which there is some attempt at production, but it is merely the production of Boards and Commissions. As far as I can see from the Governor-General's Speech, the chief thing which we are to produce is further expenses. I was glad to see in to-day's notice-paper that this question is also agitating other minds. Question No. 7 asks - </para>

                        <para>Will the Prime Minister have a return furnished showing the names of members of all Boards, Commissions, and Committees appointed by the Government since January, 1920, with particulars as to cost of each to date? </para>

                    <para class="block">If, and when, that return is furnished, it should be a very interesting document. It seems to me that we have arrived at a stage when we have government by one man, who appoints Commissions and Boards to do everything which he cannot do himself. This practice has certainly meant a piling up of expenses, and the adding of additional burdens to the taxpayers. I want to try to point out where this increased taxation is leading us, and how those people who have been responsible for the maintenance of the stability of Australia are groaning under it. Up to the end of the financial year 1909-10, the Commonwealth had restricted taxation to Customs and Excise. In 1910, an Act was passed which gave the Commonwealth power to raise a land tax. In 1914-15, the 'scale of the land tax was increased, and in the following year the income tax was levied. Since then, the only development in the income tax has been an increase in its rate. During the last ten years, taxation within the Commonwealth has almost trebled. </para>

                            <para>- The Governor-General's Speech proposes to go on increasing the burden of taxation, even now the war is over. No one complains of the increase of taxation in so far as it arises out of the war, but what we find fault with is. the needless piling up of taxation to meet wasteful expenditure. The Speech is only leading us further in that direction. The programme put before this House provides for the creation of more Boards and Commissions - six in all, I think - and these will be further avenues for expenditure. Not only is the expenditure of every Department in creased, but we are going to open up new avenues for spending. </para>

                            <para>- It is so nearly " every Department " that the difference does not matter. Since the Minister has challenged my statement, I had better produce the proof and consider the matter in detail. If the Minister will look through the statement brought down by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> a few days ago, he will find that, in almost every instance, there is an increase in the cost of the Departments. I did not think it was necessary for me, at the present juncture, to analyze that statement; but, if it is desired that I should place it on record, perhaps I had better do so. I shall deal only with the total ordinary votes of Departments. </para>

                            <para>- The reasons are quite insufficient, considering the size of the burdens that have been placed upon the people. It is very easy for the Minister to talk about reasons, but how are those reasons going to meet the taxes the people are called upon to pay? In some cases, to my knowledge, and I think to the knowledge of other members of this House, people are having to borrow money to pay their taxes. Surely we are not going to continue to govern under those conditions. Where people are taxed to such an extent that their income will not provide the money to meet their taxes, even when they have cut down their expenditure to the utmost, and when they find themselves forced to go to the banks to borrow money to meet the ordinary current taxation of the year, something is wrong. Such a state of affairs has no right to exist. It is an unfair burden on the primary producing interests of this country, and not merely upon them, but upon all producing industries. </para>

                    <para>The <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Tear-Booh</inline> for 1921, in dealing with revenue, states " The great increase in recent years is due to the large expansion in direct taxation." The Government appeared to think that this was a slight, so they have increased the indirect taxation, so as to make it as large as the direct taxation. Thus they have further burdened the people who are producing the wealth of the community. The position of the toilers in the cities is now worse than in the beginning. </para>

                            <para>- I say that this Tariff, which we were told was going to do away with unemployment, has not saved the situation at all. It has not helped to maintain the industries at Newcastle; but has destroyed their prospects, and also the general development in country districts. The Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom),</inline> who represents a country constituency, knows as well as I do that to-day improvements are not being made on numerous holdings for the simple reason that materials are too expensive. All over Australia there are important and necessary works which should be, and which would be, carried out if it were not for the excessively high prices which producers and 1 others are compelled to pay for their materials, and there are thousands of men who could be employed to their own advantage, and to the benefit of the men who employ them, if supplies were available at a reasonable price. When a grazier hears his calves bellowing in the night because they are being pulled down by dingoes ; when he sees ewes and lambs dead in, his paddocks; when the wheat-grower sees his crop a failure because  artificial manure cannot be obtained at a fair price, he has reason to complain ; when a fruit-grower goes to his orchard and finds that his trees are being destroyed by pests, he can blame the Government who passed such a high Tariff that materials and commodities which he requires have been made so high in price that they are beyond his means. In almost every instance such a position has been brought about by the Tariff. Before the imposition of high protective rates the men on the laud could purchase wire netting and barbed wire for their holdings at a reasonable price, and before the Tariff and the Nauru Island agreement was entered into they could buy superphosphates at. a lower rate for their wheat-fields. To-day it is difficult for them to buy absolute necessities, and, in addition to these handicaps, the Government go on increasing taxation and dragging more income tax from them at every opportunity. The Government are making it impossible for many of them to carry on. The Assistant Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Granville Ryrie),</inline> who is interested in this direction, knows, as well as I do, that, in the western district of New South Wales, there are deserted homes. </para>

                            <para>- Direct taxation and the Tariff are largely responsible. Landholders cannot improve their properties, and construct vermin-proof fences to keep the dogs back. A man growing hay, either a small dairy farmer or a grazier working on a larger scale, is called upon to pay taxation on that hay as income. He also raises a few hundred calves, or, perhaps, only a small number, and he also pays income on the calves or lambs, or whatever else he may be raising. But a drought comes along with its withering blast and he feeds the hay to the starving stock. In those,, circumstances the hay cannot be regarded as income, because it is fed to the stock, and frequently after feeding his cattle they die; but he still has to pay income tax on the stock, as well as on the hay, and in the end does not realize on either. </para>

                            <para>- Not until he realizes on them. The real difficulty is that he does not know what his income is, and I have endeavoured to explain the point to this Parliament and to the State Parliament of New South Wales for the past twenty years. It is time the people realized that this is what is killing industry, and that men cannot carry on under conditions such as those which they have been experiencing for some years. Considering the drift of the people, it is unreasonable to impose unnecessarily high protective duties on many of the requirements of rural settlers. What is the position in Australia to-day? The drift to the cities is most alarming, and the census figures taken last year show only too plainly what is happening. In New South Wales, which every one admits is one of the best States in the Commonwealth, there are only three districts which have been able to hold their natural increase in population. One is the county of Cumberland, which embraces the city of Sydney ; another is the district of Hunter, which includes Newcastle; and the third is the Riverina, where there are extensive irrigation works, to which point there is a continual drift from Victoria. No other district in the whole of the State has been able to hold its natural increase, and in many districts there has been a decrease in population. If that is allowed to continue, it can only lead to ruin and disaster, and the drift must be stopped. The only way in which this can be done is by reducing the expenditure of the people on the land, thus giving them an opportunity to live. The district which I represent comprises one of the finest pieces of country in Australia, and as I have been in every State in the Commonwealth, I can speak with some authority. There is not the slightest doubt that the Upper Hunter <inline font-style="italic">U</inline> one of the finest portions of Australia. </para>

                            <para>- Because the burdens in the form of taxation are too heavy, and people have been driven off the land and forced into the cities. Leaving the shire of the Upper Hunter and crossing the river, there will be seen what has been one of the most successful meatworks established in Australia. I have known it for about twenty-five years, and it has always been looked upon as one of the most successfully conducted meatworks in any country district in the Commonwealth. Some years ago a fellmongery was started in connexion with these works, and the New South Wales Railways Commissioners fixed differential rates on fellmongered wool and ordinary skins, which led to the closing of the fellmongery. That is not a matter for which this Parliament is responsible, but it is a circumstance which should not be overlooked when we are considering the burdens imposed on the man on the land. By the closing of this fellmongery, scores of men were thrown out of employment, and the thousands of pounds put into it were practically thrown away. At the same meatworks it was decided later to start a bacon factory. Again, the Railways Commissioners fixed differential rates between bacon and pickled pork, in the belief that that would put an end to the bacon factory. As a matter of fact, it did not do bo, because those concerned found a way of overcoming the difficulty. My point is that these are really burdens which have to be borne by the man on the land, and should bc considered by this Parliament when imposing taxation which he is called upon to pay. We should not treat him as the State Parliaments have done, but we are treating him as badly, and in some cases in a worse way. When we find the man on the land suffering from State taxation, the least we can do is to try to relieve him of some of the taxation imposed by this Parliament. Instead of that we go on piling up further taxation for him. We increase the income tax, the land tax, and by our Tariff the cost of everything used by the man on the land. The Federal Government cannot excuse themselves by saying that the State Governments treat the man on the land badly, because that is an additional reason why we should try to come to his relief. </para>

                    </continue><para>The position in connexion ' with production in Australia to-day is becoming exceedingly serious. The amount of primary production is decreasing, and the number to-day engaged in it is less by thousands than the number so engaged ten years ago. It is only because of the increased value of primary products that people are deluded into the belief that all is well with the producer. If we get back to the prices existing before the war, and already that has occurred in the beef industry, it will not be possible for the primary producers of Australia to continue to carry on under the burdens imposed upon them by the Federal and State Parliaments. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- Whilst there are fewer people engaged in primary production to-day than there were ten years ago, the primary producer has in almost every instance increased the yield from his industry. When I was a boy, 4 lbs. or 5 lbs. of wool wore obtained from a sheep, and to-day the producers of wool obtain 8 lbs. or 10 lbs. from each sheep. A dairy cow used to produce, say, 200 lbs. of butter per annum, and now produces 250 lbs. I do not say that these figures are quite accurate, but approximately they represent the increase in yield. The wheat-grower to-day produces more per acre than was previously obtained, but in spite of this increase of yield from land and animals, the total volume of production is to-day less than it waS ten years ago, whilst the man on the land is called upon continually to carry a heavier burden. He ha3 been putting up a magnificent fight in the effort to do so. It may be possible to grow a little more wool on a sheep, though I think that is very doubtful; there may be some further increase in the yield from dairy cows, and in the average yield per acre of wheat, but the proportion of increase can never be as great in the future as it has been in the last ten years. The primary producer has been goaded to produce as much as he can. That, of. course, has been, in one sense, a good thing, but he has practically reached the limit in that direction, whilst apparently he has not reached the limit in the taxation he is called upon to carry. His position is such now that unless something is done to relieve him, disaster stares this country in the face. </para>

In the attempt to bolster up secondary industries, the present Government have increased the burdens of the men on the land without doing any good to the secondary industries. The conditions in Newcastle are a glaring example of that. The secondary industries having been established, some before the Tariff, and some as the result of it, there are' so many minor regulations, pinpricks, and little difficulties placed in their way that some of those engaged in them are giving up business. </para>

But I have been pointing out, and the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> knows the truth of the statement as well as I do, that the attempt . to increase production in the secondary industries has failed, whilst at the same time it has added further to the burdens of the primary producers who arc carrying Australia along.

So far from this, the honorable member and the party to which he belongs have assisted the Government to increase the burdens upon the primary producers, who are now unable to carry on, and who, in many cases, have been obliged to borrow in order to pay their taxes. It is time both parties reconsidered their position if they seek to be of real value to Australia. </para>

                        <para>.- I desire to deal with a very important question, namely, the trouble in the pastoral industry, created by incompetent Judges, blundering Governments, and bitter vendettas carried on by certain members of the Ministry and outside bodies. The history of the attempt to wreck the Arbitration Court is very interesting, but the time at my disposal is not sufficient to allow me to go into it thoroughly. However, I shall endeavour to set it out as briefly as possible. ' In 1917 the Farmers and Settlers' Associations and the Graziers Associations of Australia commenced a vendetta, first of all, against the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court; and, secondly, against the  President  of that tribunal. Certain supporters of the Government, particularly the honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.</inline></para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">Livingston), apparently instructed by a Graziers Association, submitted certain questions in this House  with  regard to the length of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins' appointment as  President  of the Arbitration Court, and asked whether or not opportunity would be given to the House to discuss the matter of giving  His  Honour a further term of office. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> 'was very sympathetic towards the request that the House should be given the opportunity of discussing the merits of  President  Higgins. For some reason or other, unknown to myself, the Prime Minister has always displayed hostility towards the then  President  of the Arbitration Court. I could  never  get  at  the bottom of the spleen and vindictiveness he has  shown  towards that gentleman. I know perfectly well that the Chamber of Manufactures and the Pastoralists Union - the Prime Minister's masters - were anxious to have <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins removed from the position of  President  of the Arbitration Court, but knowing  the  psychology of the Leader of the Government, I am inclined to think that his extraordinary attacks upon  His  Honour were made, not only because of instructions from outside bodies, but also for personal reasons. At any rate, the result of a four-years' campaign of similar attacks was the passage of the Industrial Peace Act in this Parliament. Apart from fixing a tribunal for the settlement of disputes in the coal industry, the Industrial Peace Act was primarily brought into being in order to make the Arbitration Court a subservient tribunal, and no self-respecting  President  of that Court could, in the circumstances, continue in office. I venture to say that, with the exception, perhaps, of the present  President  of the Court, no other Judge would have accepted the position in the circumstances in which it was rendered vacant. I hold no brief for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins; I have always contended that his Harvester judgment of 1907, fixing the mininum of £2 2s. per week, was based upon wrong premises. Unfortunately, it was continued through the whole of the subsequent awards made by him, and it rested with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Powers, the present occupant of the position, to make a revolutionary change in this regard. Had he utilized the figures supplied by the Commonwealth Basic Wage Commission, in the cases which came before him for consideration, I would have had no fault to find, but  His  Honour has brought into operation an extraordinary system which no one understands, not even himself, as can be proved by a perusal of his last six awards. When the Australian Workers Union went before him recently and asked for an award, the most extraordinary position ever brought about by a judicial body was created. The union assumed that if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Powers did not accept a higher rate than was fixed in the Harvester award he, at least, would not accept a lower rate, but contrary to expectations,  His  Honour after hearing practically all the evidence, intimated to the representatives of the union that it was his intention to make the shearing rate 30s. per hundred. This announcement caused consternation and amazement, not only among the ranks of the workers, but also among the employers, because, after all, the latter have some knowledge of the workings of the Court, and it rested with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Barnes,</inline> the Acting General Secretary  of  the Australian Workers Union,  to point  out that a mistake had been made, so extraordinary that one would almost doubt the possibility  of  a Judge making it.  As  as matter of fact, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Powers admitted that he had made a mistake, and thereupon set out upon a series of blunders, inconceivable, not only to myself, but to many others who are not of my brand of politics or industrialism, and creating a position which is untenable, and can only result in chaos for the pastoral industry. The Acting General Secretary of the Australian Workers Union has commented upon <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Powers' findings as follows: - </para>

                        <para>The first of these dealt with lost time. The Judge accepted 25 per cent 'as a fair allowance on this score. , Also, he accepted 439 as a fair weekly tally of the number of sheep shorn per shearer. Obviously, the result, no matter how worked out, should give a net tally, allowing for lost time, of 329 sheep shorn per week. The learned Judge, however, decided to follow a method of his own. Taking a four weeks' full-time basis, with a consequent aggregate tally of 1,756 sheep, he proceeded to add to the four weeks another week for lost time, and to divide the 1,756 tally by five, in order to arrive' at the average tally per working week. The result is that an accepted 25 per cent, allowance works out, by these means, at only 30 p?r cent. Instead of the obviously correct answer of 329, the Judge, by his roundabout, fallacious method, provides an obviously incorrect answer of 351. Then, having arrived at the erroneous 351 (made into the round figure of 350) instead of the correct 329, the Judge proceeded to perpetrate blunder So. 2. Here it is: - </para>

                        <para>It would, on these figures, be necessary to give to the average shearer about 35s. per 100, if the average number of sheep he shears per week for the time of the expedition is 350, to secure to him £6 12s. 6d., and out of this he has to pay his mess account - about 25s. a week - and 6s. a week for fares. Here the Judge, faced with the problem of multiplying 35s. by three and a half, gets a product of £6 12s. 6d. instead of only £6 2s. 6d. If £6 12s. 6d. was accepted by the Judge as a fair gross return to a shearer shearing 350 sheep per week, his award clearly should have been, not 35s. per 100, but 3Ss. Or, taking the correct data of sheep shorn at 329 and £6 12s. 6d. as a fair gross return to the shearer when working, the rate would work out at 40s., which is the rate the shearers demand. </para>
                    </quote><para class="block">On the figures applied to this particular case, the award should have been 38s. per 100. There has been a mistake made between 35s. and 38s., even on the erroneous figures submitted by  His  Honour. The Court has been in an extraordinary position, created, of course, by the desire of the Government to render it an inefficient body, unable to deal with the many claims coming before it. Honorable members know that, during the last two years, we on this side have repeatedly attempted to get the Government to appoint Judges to deal with the cases which congest the Court, and have congested it for over three years. The Government, at the behest of outside influences, brought about an amendment of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act to provide that there must be three Judges to deal with the question of hours. The Government knew, and the Employers Federation, the Pastoralists Union, and the rest of them, knew perfectly well that once the Act was amended it would be impossible to deal with the question of hours until such time as the necessary Judges had been appointed. The Act was amended; and then came a long wait of nearly twelve months before the Government made the necessary appointments. I was on three deputations to the Government with regard to the appointment of Judges. My own organization and others, and many honorable members on this side of the House, appealed to the Government time after time to make these appointments, but no action was taken. It was not until the Pastoralists Union approached the Prime Ministerthat the Judges were appointed. </para><interjection>

I invite the honorable Minister to check that statement. In this regard the Government do not stand very cleanly in the eyes of the people of Australia, for if ever there were manipulation and a gross subversion of the duties of a Government, it was in this particular matter. The Act was amended for a specific purpose - to keep the Court inactive through having no Judges to administer it. Then, tardily, the Government made the necessary appointments to deal with the hour question, but from the time the Act was amended, and until those appointments were made, nothing could be done by the Court to deal with the hour question. <inline font-style="italic">Yet</inline> honorable members opposite talk about the chaos brought about by the industrial unrest.

They have amputated here and there, and have so interfered with its efficiency that the sooner it goes the better for everybody concerned. Two Judges have been appointed recently. One is fit, so far a« T, can learn, to occupy a seat on any judicial bench in this country. The other is a man seventy years of age. </para>

                            <para>- The Pastoralists Union has, during the last two months, employed a host of solicitors and an army of barristers in the Courts of this country in launching injunctions, rules <inline font-style="italic">nisi,</inline> mandamuses, and all sort of extraordinary instruments at the Australian Workers Union, in addition to directing an injunction against certain of its own members. If the Pastoralists Union exists merely for the edification and profit of the legal profession, it is doing good work, and the money subscribed by its members goes into the proper channel. Before the  President  of the Court delivered his award it had been altered, I think, three times; we had spoken to the minutes several times, and he has invited us to appear before him again. Upon the slightest provocation he sends us a letter inviting us to come along to the Court and have a chat. That is an extraordinary feature, and I invite the Attorney-General to look into the proceedings of the Court in regard to the pastoral industry. The Australian Workers Union is in a peculiar position. It has stuck loyally to arbitration. It has done more than any other organization to assist the Court to do its work and function properly. It has done that at some sacrifice, and in that regard I shall quote the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins. When delivering the main judgment of the High Court in Brisbane recently, when an injunction was granted against myself and certain officials of the Australian Workers Union, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins said: - </para>

                        <para>I confess that I concur in granting this injunction with deep regret. I cannot divorce from my mind what I learnt as President of the Arbitration Court during fourteen yours. This great union, with more than 100,000 members, has, with the aid of this Court of Conciliation, maintained peace in the pastoral industry, and ninny other industries, since the Court was constituted in 1004. It has submitted even to a reduction of rates, as well as to ninny refusals of the Court to grant demands which the union pressed as being just and reasonable. </para>
                    </quote><para class="block">What was said by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins cannot be contradicted. In 1917 we applied to the 'Court for a shearing rate of 30s. per 100. At a later date, because of the increase meanwhile in the cost of living, we made application for a variation of the award. We were entitled to 32s. per 100, but we could not be granted more than the rate claimed in the original application. If we had acted .brutally and callously, and regardless of the interests of anybody but ourselves, as some pastoralists are acting now, we would, during the war, have made the pastoralists pay £4 per 100, and we could have got that rate. At times I have regretted the attitude I have adopted during the four years of my presidency of the Australian Workers Union. I have felt sorry that I was not as brutal and callous as those who to-day attack the union. Nobody can deny the statement I have made; yet injunctions and writs are being issued against the representatives of the union. You may bind me and my colleagues in the Australian Workers Union hand and foot, you may close down our newspapers, and even shut the offices of the union, but those actions will not shear the sheep of this country. What we are asking for is reasonable and just; we have a right to demand it, and it would have been conceded had the Courts of this country been conducted properly. But no; it is thought by the pastoralists and the Government that the time has arrived when the workers may be compelled to submit to drastic reductions of their wage3 and an increase of their working hours. But that will not come about unless a big fight is waged. The members of the organization of which I am  president,  by resolutions passed at many hundreds of meetings throughout the States affected, have shown them- selves to be determined to resist to the  best of their ability the attacks of the pastoralists. I should say here that not the whole of the pastoralists are concerned in the onslaught, and I am borne out by the facts which lie behind certain legal proceedings being conducted in Sydney at present against members of the pastoralists' organization itself. I emphasize that it is not the majority of the pastoralists who are causing the trouble. If matters were left to the pastoralists themselves they would accept and carry on the agreement under which we have been working during the past two years. The industry has gone ahead without trouble since 1907 ; there is no other industry in Australia which has such a record. The shearers made sacrifices right through, while the pastoralists were on a rising market. They made money all the time, but the workers were trying to catch up with the cost of living and never succeeded. "While it may be said that the Australian Workers Union is breaking the laws of the country, and while the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> may interject that we have our means of redress, honorable members should understand what that would entail. Does the Minister himself understand? I doubt if he does. What does redress mean? There is only one way by which we can approach the Court, that is by making application for the variation of the award. We could not possibly place that variation before October or November next. Because of the phraseology of the Act, which honorable members opposite have been asked repeatedly to assist us in amending, we are called upon to serve about 6,000 persons throughout Australia with notices. This entails travelling, in many individual instances, over 300 to 500 miles on push "bikes" or motors. We may serve some of the graziers' organizations; but, in order to secure a variation of the award which will cover any number of pastoralists, there is entailed, on the part of my organization, up to four months' hard work in merely serving our demand. When people speak of the Australian Workers Union seeking a variation of the award they either do not know what they are talking about, and do not appreciate the consequences which might follow upon the acceptance of their utterances, or they do actually realize that if we .were to take such steps we could not hope to secure relief until after the shearing season is over. And, because of the fact that the Court is congested, our organization would probably not be able to make itself heard before February, March, or April of next year. </para><para>An interesting case came before one of the Sydney Courts only a few days ago, when action was taken by J. W. Allen, General Secretary of the Graziers Association of New South Wales, against Messrs. E. H. Mears and Pearson, members of that association, and joint owners of  Quantambone  station. These gentlemen possess about 100,000 sheep. They desire to conserve their wealth, to avoid possible losses through the attacks of flies, and through breaks  in the  staple; and they apparently decided that they would grant fair and reasonable compensation to the men who took the wool off their sheep. The Graziers Association, however, between their legal bolts fired at the Australian Workers Union, shot one in the direction of their own people. This action fairly indicates the position in which the Graziers Association finds itself. It has to drag its own members into Court in order to force them to abide by a decision made by the Graziers' Council. The whole business, of course, is much to the gratification and profit of the legal profession in Sydney. </para><para>A fine campaign is being carried on by the Graziers Association at present. I have here a few cuttings from country newspapers. These are headed, " Shearing Dispute," and " Shearing Award," and the like. They are all the same, however.

These figures show that the pastoral industry can very well afford to pay the very moderate demands that are being made by the shearers and shed hands. I have no more to say at this particular juncture. Whether the pastoralists, with their army of lawyers or barristers, succeed in fining me and my colleagues, closing up our newspapers, and placing prohibitive costs upon the Australian Workers Union - whether they go to the extreme course of placing those who are holding official positions in the union in gaol will make no difference whatever to the point at issue. If they want their pound of flesh they will, perhaps, put my colleagues and myself in gaol, and they may do so. Perhaps three months in gaol would give me time to get up some of my back work. Any action which the pastoralists may take will make no difference in the attitude of members of the Australian Workers Union in this matter. They are determined to refuse to shear under an award which is inequitable, unjust, and, to say the least, is an absurdity. </para></speech>

That there is a difference of opinion between members of the Federal Country party and the Queensland Country party is borne out by the proceedings at a meeting of the Executive 'Council held in Queensland recently, when a special vote of thanks was passed to the Federal Government for the assistance that had been  rendered to the primary producers of Australia. </para>

Critics of the National Government might well take into consideration the valuable constructive legislation that has been passed during the last five years. There has been no "go-slow" about the Federal Parliament during that time, no less than 218 measures having been dealt with. In addition to the necessary war emergency legislation, Acts have been passed dealing with repatriation, industrial matters, finance, commerce, and the national problems affecting the lives and interests of every person in the community. The record of the present Government will bear favorable comparison with that of any previous Federal Administration. </para>

                    <para>I offer my congratulations to the Prime Minister for having visited every State of the. Commonwealth this 'year.  His  visit to the coastal districts of North Queensland was especially welcome, for there he had an opportunity of seeing something of its splendid tracts of agricultural land, and he is now in a position to form some opinion concerning the great possibilities of development in that region. He has seen for himself something of the class of men, women, and children who live there, and I have no doubt has come to the conclusion that of all the industries in the north, sugar is king. The Prime Minister has been accused of sitting on a rail, because, he has not declared himself definitely for or against the renewal of the sugar agreement. Possibly his critics forget that his first duty, as Prime Minister,' is to consult his colleagues in the Cabinet and his supporters before announcing the Government's policy on this very important matter, but I have not the slightest doubt that he made up his mind, and, at the proper time,  will announce his decision. Personally, I am of opinion that much of the opposition to a renewal of the sugar agreement is due to a misunderstanding of the facts. In the southern States it is popular to speak of the sugar-growers as wealthy sugar kings, and on quite a number of occasions they have been described as making immense fortunes out of the industry. The facts, however, tell a different story. At present, out of about 4,000 growers engaged in the industry, only about 2 per cent, pay income taxation. The majority of the growers are farming small areas of from 10 to 50 acres, and the principal drawback of the industry is the great uncertainty of the seasons. Recently I took advantage of an opportunity to visit the north of my State in order to look closely into the merits of the sugar problem. I find that four distinct interests are involved, namely, labour, the grower, the miller, and the refiner. And Labour, with its extensive organization, is lord over all. The miller and refiner, being engaged in business concerns, necessarily have to clear expenses and show a profit on their working. It seems to me that the grower is the victim of all three. That being the position, I do not think that protection through the Customs alone is likely to give the grower any assistance. I therefore favour a renewal of the agreement, with a general overhaul of all the facts in connexion with the industry, as from the producer right to the consumer. The result, I think, would be that we should be able to purchase sugar here at about 4£d. per lb. It has been said that farmers are not made by Act of Parliament. My experience is that farmers are generally made by a process of adverse circumstances, coupled with a spirit of optimism, they are enabled to " stick it out " - they never acknowledge defeat. Recently, in the north of Queensland, I met one such man, who told me that in 1914 he bought an area of land on easy terms, which, with the assistance of his two sons, he cleared and planted. The year 1915, however, proved a dry one, and he got no return. In 1916, he had to do the work all over again on an extended area; but one of those periodical strikes which afflict this country occurred, and he was unable to market any crop. The year 1917 proved a good year, and he marketed 1,200 tons of cane, the proceeds of which enabled him to purchase fertilizers and new implements. The future looked bright, but in 1918 the-long-to-be-remembered cyclone struck his extended area, swept away his buildings, and destroyed the whole of his crop, so that, quite penniless, he had to leave his farm. I am inclined to think that the fact that the Queensland growers supplied the consumers of Australia with the cheapest sugar in the world during the war period is conveniently forgotten by many critics at the present time. It is forgotten that when the outside price was ls. 3d., the consumer in Australia was being supplied at 3d. per lb. Quite a number of critics talk about the world's parity, but are they prepared to average the world's price to the Queensland grower since 1914? Do those critics forget that when, in 1914, an application was made to the Inter-State Commission for consideration, the growers were informed that they could have the Australian market to themselves? But almost immediately price control was enforced, with the result that sugar was still sold at 3d., and it was not until the first agreement was made between Queensland and the Federal Government that any relief was afforded. That was in 1915, which was a dry year, and' the severe drought gave the industry a set-back, lt should be remembered that the Australian sugar industry is the only one of the kind in the world which is completely run by white labour from the field to the consumer. Another forgotten fact is that the present low price of outside sugar is only temporary, and that when there is recovery in the world's purchasing power, the price of such sugar will be considerably higher than at the present time. </para>

If a period of five years had been granted, the growers would not at the present time be asking for an extension of the agreement. After making due inquiry into the matter, I think a solution would be found in Federal control of the industry under a tribunal representative of workers, growers, millers, refiners, and consumers.

                    <para>I should now like to say a few words in reference " to the cotton industry, which, during the last two years, has made very extensive progress in Queensland. Last year, between 5.000 and 6,000 acres were under crop, and I believe that something like 1,000,000 lbs. of raw material realized £21,575. The Rockhampton ginnery, this year, treated 823 tons, and something like £53,000 was paid to the growers. It is expected in the coming season that there will be 40,000 acres under crop. The Lands Department of Queensland claims that there is 500,000 acres in the central district suitable for the production of cotton crop. Of this area, there are 168,000 acres of Crown land, at present leased for grazing purposes, and preliminary steps have been taken towards resumption and subdivision, not only for cotton-growers, but for mixed farming. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> the other afternoon said that there are no Crown lands available near railways; but the fact that there is this area I have mentioned is a contradiction of that statement. I understand that the Queensland Government have made a proposal to the Federal Government to settle immigrants on some of these lands ; and I certainly hope that, in the interests of the industry, and in the interests of Queensland, an agreement will be finalized on a satisfactory basis. At the same time, I expect the Government to closely examine the details of the scheme just as was done in the case of the Burnett lands proposition. The latter was discussed here freely yesterday afternoon, and it was. asserted that the Federal Government had broken the promise given to the State Government. In my opinion, the State Premier was simply fooling the people when he asked them to believe any such thing. The £2,000,000 borrowed in America, and now being spent on the construction of certain railway lines, will not nearly finish that work ; indeed, it is quite safe to say that if Commonwealth money had been granted it would simply have been used to find work for the unemployed,, not one penny being made available for the purpose for which it had been asked, namely, the settlement of people from overseas. As a matter of fact, experts disagree as to whether the </para>
                    <para class="block">Burnett lands are suitable for closer settlement; in any case, it is quite certain that a great deal more than £2,000,000 will be required,, not only to finish the railways, but to give settlers money for the purchase of stock and implements. There are thousands of acres of land available on the Queensland railway system at the present time. On the north coast, between Brisbane and Maryborough, freehold land can be bought at reasonable rates; and in the northern part of the State, hundreds of thousands of acres are still held by the ' Grown. </para>
                    <para>Coming to the question of Repatriation I feel that the Government have loyally attempted to carry out the promises made to our soldiers during the war. I do not claim that applicants have always been satisfied, or that the Department has done all that it should have done ; but the fact remains that up to June last no less than 241,000, or 80 per cent., of the men who returned to Australia, had applied " for assistance. There have been something like 690,000 applications, and it would have been a matter for wonderment if in dealing with so great a volume of work mistakes had not been made from time to time. I have had occasion to make representations to the Department, and have always found it ready to rectify any injustice. I would urge mope "liberal treatment of limbless pensioners. In my own electorate there is a returned man who had the misfortune to lose both legs. He was anxious to do something that would maintain his interest in life, and an agricultural society appointed him its secretary. Because he receives about £2 10s. a week for discharging the light duties attaching to that office the Repatriation' Department has  reduced  his pension. There is a general desire on the part of the people that the limbless men should have more generous treatment than they are receiving at present. </para>
                    <para>The time has arrived for a careful review of the whole policy of the Department with respect to War Service Homes. "When these homes were being erected by the Commission the prices of building materials of all kinds were very high, and the result is that those who have acquired WaT Service Homes have a lifelong job if they intend to " stick it out." It seems to me that the Government must be prepared to sacrifice a large amount of money in connexion with War Service Homes, because it is" quite impossible for occupiers to pay the' present high rents, and sooner or later something must be done to afford them relief. It is apparent also that the building policy of the Department has broken down. I have brought under the notice of the responsible Minister the case of an applicant for a War Service Home, who has been informed that at least seven months must elapse before tenders can be called for the erection of the house required by him. Obviously some blundering has taken place. In view of the acquisition of large timber areas and sawmills by the Department there should be no scarcity of timber for this purpose. It would have been better if, instead of sinking so much money in the purchase of timber areas and saw-mills, which are at present idle, the Department had held much of the money so expended for the building of bornes. This is one branch of the Government's activities for which I have no excuse, and which I have not hesitated to condemn on all occasions. </para>
                    <para>I intend to support the scheme for Redistribution of Federal electorates, so far as it affects the State of Queensland. I regret, however, that, the Commissioners have not taken care to bring into agreement .the boundaries of the State and Federal electorates. We have for a long time urged that there should be one set of electoral rolls for State and Federal purposes, but because of the failure to bring the boundaries of the State and Federal electorates into line it seems to me that we shall still need two sets of rolls. </para>

                    <para class="block">It is undeniable that Australia has unrivalled opportunities to provide many of the requirements of the people overseas; but more attention must be given to the improvement of the standards of manufacture. Cheaper production can be obtained by co-operative methods; but the farmer seems to be the most difficult section of the community to organize for this purpose. That is more particularly apparent in connexion with the dairying industry. No trouble is experienced in bringing about district organization, but we find factories in different districts, yet within a few miles of each other, in keen competition. There is no occasion for anything of the kind, and I hope that the primary producers will recognise that, in their own interests, they should become better organized than they are at present. </para>

                    <para>The unification of railway gauge does not appeal to me as a matter of urgency. The cost of material and construction work is so high at the present time that this scheme might well be deferred. I understand that it is proposed to unify the gauges of the main lines connecting the State-capitals, and as the cost of material is likely to drop, whilst the mileage track to be altered cannot increase, no harm would result from a postponement. </para>

Ministerialists have, for a long time, been making it clear that they, as much as the members of any other party, favour economic administration. I urge the Treasurer and the other Ministers to give this matter the closest attention. The Treasurer, of course, is at a disadvantage if he is not supported by his colleagues. There is cast on each Minister the responsibility of running the Public Service as economically as is consistent with the general welfare of the community. </para>

                        <para>.- I should not have spoken on the Address had it not been for the financial statement of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce).</inline> I am glad that he has been appointed to the control of our finances, and I support what my Leader <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> has said on the subject. I recognise that the honorable member for Flinders has so recently taken charge of the Treasury that he cannot be fairly criticised for the present unsatisfactory state of the finances, but from now on he must bear responsibility, and, together with the Minister for Works and Railways <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Richard Foster),</inline> whom I am also pleased to see in the Ministry, will be chiefly to blame if proper economy is not observed in the expenditure of public money. The Treasurer informed us that in the financial year just passed the Government had received about  £3,000,000  more than the estimated revenue for the year, and had mopped up the whole of that surplus and another  £200,000 -  a very serious state of affairs. An item in regard to which I should like some information is the  £800,000  paid into revenue on account of. the army of occupation in Germany. I should like to know why that item figures in the revenue account. It seems to me that it should be in the loan account, if the original expenditure, as in all probability it did, had come out of loan funds. I take a grave view of the financial position of Australia. The private individual, be he ever so honest, popular, or generous, is looked upon as a failure if he makes a mess of his' financial affairs; and I think that the careful handling of public money is an essential factor of good government. But money has been slipping through the hands of our Ministers lake water. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> told us last session that men did not get into Parliament - though perhaps he had specially in mind the members of his own party - unless they had merit, ability, and force of character. No doubt that is so, and, no doubt, the Prime Minister has also risen to his high position by virtue of the great abilities, talents, and force of character which ho possesses. Nevertheless, I find myself differing from the right honorable gentleman more and more every day, in regard to the expenditure of public money. The expenditure of both Commonwealth and State Governments of late years must, if continued, eventually lead to financial and industrial chaos; and the Prime Minister reminds me of a child playing with a snake, all innocent of danger. Like an uneducated Eastern potentate who to-day buys a fleet of motor cars, to-morrow sets up an expensive training stable on an . European model, or maintains a ballet, or otherwise spends his revenues on. costly toys, the Prime Minister bought a fleet of steamers ; a little later he , entered upon a shipbuilding programme; then he authorized the spending of a huge amount on the purchase of timber reserves and saw-mills, a transaction which was disgracefully managed throughout Then we have the incredibly foolish proposal for the unification of the railway gauges. Much money, too, has been spent on immigration, and we have got very little return for the expenditure. </para>

                            <para>- I was saying, before the suspension of 'the sitting, that the Government, which means the Prime Minister, seems to take up with enthusiasm different ventures, such as shipbuilding, the owning of ships, the disgracefully-managed and now idle sawmills in Queensland, and other matters of that sort. There is also the proposal for the unification of the railway gauges, which I consider to be one of incredible folly. I shall oppose it in every form. I might mention, too, the various immigration schemes, on which large amounts of money have already been spent, and from which, up to the present time, we appear to have derived but little result. I may, perhaps, differ from some of my friends of the Country party on this subject; but my own view is that the very first foundation and the first essential of the spending of money on immigration is the absolute elimination of unemployment in our own country. I go further than that, and say that the only immigration agent I believe in is such a condition of prosperity in the country itself as will bring people here of their own accord, Bnc will - cause the successful man who has made good to write to his friends or bring them here to share in the general prosperity. I believe that the borrowing of great sums of loan money, and the spending of them - unfortunately, wastefully in many cases - far from being a preventive of unemployment, is an absolute cause of it. </para>

                    <para>The Primo Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> recently has been in the State, a constituency of which I have the honour to represent, and everybody there was pleased to see him making the trip, and acquainting himself with the various industries .important to the district. There was a certain amount of controversy during his trip regarding the position in the cattle industry. I give the Government credit for realizing that the cattle situation was, and is,  very  unsatisfactory; but I said then, and I say now, that I am absolutely opposed to the subsidy. The Prime Minister proclaimed broadcast, after I had made that statement, that the Country party in general, and I in particular, did not agree that the position was desperate, and that we were not in favour of the Government helping the industry. The Prime Minister the other day said there was nothing so dangerous as a half-truth, and I think there is no -doubt that half the opposite can also be twisted to give a dangerously false impression. Regarding this very definite statement by the Prime Minister - the statement that I, as a member of the Country party, said the industry waa not in <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> bad condition, and that I did not believe in the Government helping it - I wish.' if I may, to refresh my memory by quoting the following report of what I said, which <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> a very good one except for one small misprint : - </para>

                    <para class="block">I said quite plainly that I was against the subsidy, because I considered it at best to be ah unsound economic principle, and was only equivalent to robbing Peter to pay Paul.

                        <para>The Commonwealth Government, I am afraid, completely overlooks the real cause of the difficulties confronting the primary producers. It is not subsidies that are wanted, but a considerable reduction in the cost of, and expenditure by, State and Commonwealth Governments. I estimate that the State and Commonwealth Governments all over Australia are taking from the people from £12,000,000 to £15,000,000 a year more than is economically sound. A great deal of this money is spent unnecessarily, and in only too many cases actually wasted. ' </para>
                        <para>I say, again, it is not our wages that will ruin us; it is our high land taxes (State and Federal!, our high income taxes (State and Federal), the increased rents under the Repudiation Act; the high railway freights; and the greatly-increased Customs Tariff. </para>

                    <para class="block">Far from saying that I did not wish the Government to help the industry, I pointed out very clearly the way in which the industry should, and could, be helped. I did not say to the Prime Minister that he should not get on the horse, but I said  that he should not get on facing its tail.  I- am myself a  cattleman.  I was bora on a cattle station, and I have been working cattle all my life, except at such times as when I happened to be soldiering or in politics. I think I know the actual cattle side of the pastoral industry fairly well, and .1 have interests in various cattle  pro-parties.  I should be an absolute fool to express the opinions that the Prime Minister has tried to put into my mouth. I saw in a newspaper a little while ago a letter from a correspondent who, writing from the West, Bald - " The other day a thousand cows were sold here for £1. This is a crushing retort to the Country party-members who say the industry is not m a bad way." That letter shows that that false impression, to a certain extent, did get abroad. I am glad to say that here in this ' House neither the Prime Minister nor. anybody else can put words into my mouth. The Government can help the cattle industry by relieving taxation. At present the industry, as well as most of us in Australia, is being ground between the upper and nether millstones of State and Commonwealth taxation. Does not the cattle owner in Queensland find himself in .a ridiculous position t The State Government there went into a huge cattle-raising venture, gave wild prices, and within a few years, at a fair estimate, has lost £1,000,000. It then turned around and raised the cattle-owners' rents. The- Commonwealth Government proposed a subsidy of <inline font-style="italic">id.</inline> per lb. on meat, and the same week the cattlemen received requests for payments of Federal land tax on leasehold territory. I do not know whether the Government are going to pay the proposed subsidy on the frozen meat which the Queensland Government export from ' their cattle stations, but if they do, it will be an extremely comical state of affairs. </para>

                            <para>- I believe that I speak for most of my colleagues when I say that we do not believe that the position can be solved by reducing wages; the parrot-cry of lower wages is not the solution of all our difficulties. There are two ways in which I think the position can be met, one of which is to reduce extravagant Federal and State Government expenditure, and the other is for the workmen to disregard the poisonous doctrine that the employer is their natural enemy, and is anxious to pay them as little as possible. I do not believe that an increased number of working hours is necessary, and in industries where it is practicable a forty-four hour week should be adequate. The whole question depends,' however, on the employee giving keen and loyal service for the wages he receives. </para>

                            <para>- I said where it is practicable. I do not join with the Prime Minister in his howl  concerning the calamitous condition of the industry, as it is one in which I, as also my fellow cattlemen, have great faith. The present situation has been, to a great extent, brought about by our own fault, because some years ago the various works iu Queensland entered into an arrangement under which each establishment should operate only in . its own district. That placed the cattle-raisers absolutely in their hands, and the extraordinary position -has now arisen that there is not a single meat-handling establishment in Queensland conducted on a co-operative basis. The cattlemen of Queensland have had more extensive resources than the dairy farmers, but the latter have their own factories in Queensland, and although their scheme may not be complete 'they are, to a great extent, handling their produce in their own factories and transporting it to England, thus eliminating the. profits of middlemen. The first thing for the cattlemen of Australia to do, particularly those in Queensland, is to acquire or construct co-operative works of their own and do  their  best to send meat to Great Britain in a chilled form.  We could offer a reward - the Government could assist us if they cared to do so- for means to enable us to send meat in a chilled instead of a frozen form, because the consumer in Great Britain is evidently now demanding chilled and not frozen meat. . If such a reward' were offered, the engineering staffs on the boats carrying the meat should participate. Improvements- in the present methods' can be made in  several directions, and, in addition, we should insist on having a  Government which will not commandeer our meat when it is bringing a fair price and also one which does not favour fixation of prices. It would be better if the cattlemen, moved in their own interests instead of crying to the Government for <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> subsidy; all such assistance will not tend to produce the virile and independent Australians of whom the Prime Minister speaks. We should endeavour to help ourselves, and, as far as the cattle industry is concerned, use our own, efforts to get our products direct to the consumers in England through our own channels instead of depending upon the assistance of others. </para>

Still it contains so much that it would require a longer time than is permitted under the Standing Orders to deal with it as one would wish. It, perhaps, establishes a record in the number of Boards, Commissions, and such like bodies, which the Government propose to -appoint. In the light of. past experience, - one can. only conclude that, these Boards and Commissions are to be appointed merely for the purpose of enabling the Government to shirk responsibility which they should be called upon to shoulder.

                            <para>- The contract was to build two wooden ships for the Government. The contractors were months and months at work on them, and without going into a great deal of matter which may be referred to later, the contractors tried to sell them, but were unable to do so, because they could not get Lloyd's certificate for the ships. They then came to the Government, and said, " We want to be relieved of our contract. If you will, hand this matter over to the Public Works Committee, we will abide, by its decision." </para>

We signed an agreement to turn  out the ships according to certain plans and specifications, but cannot do so." They turned the job in, and came to the Government asking to be relieved of their contract. The Government had paid them over .£100,000, and they could not honestly do what waa asked. The contractors requested that the matter should be loft to the decision of the Public Works Committee,  belieiving  that there was no member of the Committee who knew a great deal about shipbuilding. I quite admit that there were <inline font-style="italic">nob</inline> many members of the Public Works Committee who knew very much about shipbuilding, but the matter having been handed over to us, we had to do the beet we could.

                            <para>- The Minister repeats that statement now, and in view of the fact that he has gone right into the whole matter, the charge I make here to-day is all the more serious. The Minister says that these people should be in gaol, and yet, as I have said before, and now repeat, the Government have appointed a last Commission as a white-washing Commission, and for no other purpose. The members of. the Public Works Committee found that the ships wens not built in accordance with the plans and specifications. The expert took us down to the boats, and we went into them with ships' knives. The expert marked what should be the edge <inline font-style="italic">bolte,</inline> or through bolts of the ships, and he showed us where they had been left out. He explained that there was nothing more essential to the stability of the ships than that every one of the edge bolts should be put in. He further said that 60 per cent. of them were left out of the ship. In those oases there were no through bolts put in at all, and in view of the price of steel at the time, we can imagine what the contractors must have saved by leaving them out. To make a long story short, the last word the expert said when asked what would become of the ships if they were taken outside the Beads, waa that they would be found at the bottom of the ocean. They were unseaworthy, and in our report we said that they were unseaworthy and that the contractors should not be relieved of their contract. I was particularly anxious to know whether the terms of the reference to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Mark</inline> Sheldon were identical with those of the reference to the Public Works Committee. According to the paper laid on the table this morning, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Mark</inline> Sheldon was asked to ascertain - </para>

On the face of it, from what we know at present, the whole thing has a very fishy odour about it. I leave the matter now until we know the findings of the Commission, but no matter what they may be, nothing can justify the action of the Government in appointing three sets of Commissioners, because, according to the honorable member for Robertson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fleming),</inline> even before the Public Works Committee took the matter in hand, the Public Accounts Committee had instituted an inquiry into the matter. </para>

We were invited to pass knives between the timbers in order to see whether the bolts did go right through or not, and in  60  per cent, of the cases we found that they did not. With such evidence before us there should be nothing more to say about the matter, and I quite agree with the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton),</inline> who was Minister in control of shipping at the time, that these people should have 'been put in gaol. I am not exaggerating when I say that if they had been supporters of honorable members on this side of the .Chamber they would have  found  themselves where they ought to be, that is, in gaol. </para>

                            <para>- The people responsible were those who signed the agreement to turn out these vessels in accordance with the plans and specifications. I shall have something more to say on this matter, and I hope that the House and the country will have something to say upon it, when we have before us the findings of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Mark</inline> Sheldon. But whatever they may be, I repeat that the Government were not justified in appointing a Commission to do work  which the country had already paid a Committee to do. However, it seems useless to point out anything to the House. During the last few days two censure amendments have been debated, but no matter how serious the statements made by honorable members might be, it seemed possible for the Prime Minister to use any amount of camouflage, talk about a thousand irrelevant matters, and cause his supporters to laugh at his so-called jokes, and in that way cover up important questions such as that to which I have just drawn attention.  </para>

                            <para>- And I hope that when the House is told, the facts will be given also. All that I have used in my remarks to-day upon this matter has been taken from the paper laid on the table of the House this morning, and from the evidence reduced by the Public Works Committee from witnesses. That Committee found that the two vessels had not been built in accordance with the plans and specifications, and that the contractoi'3 should not be relieved of their contract. Yet a Commission was appointed to go over the same ground. Why should there be a secret and hurried Commission of inquiry by a man who had already booked his passage across the seas? </para>

The Leader of the Opposition referred to the deficit of £1,312,000. It is fifteen months since that deficit was known, and as sugar has been 6d. per lb. ever since, the extra  1½d.  included in that price would have represented over £4,000,000. </para><interjection>

Every person who had left the Labour movement . in recent years was either in the House cr in the gallery waiting expectantly to hear what was to be said by the honorable member for Cook. The charges had been very well rehearsed, and inspired statements had appeared in the press for days ahead, to the effect that we were seeking means to deprive the honorable member of the opportunity of making his speech. There was not an honorable member on this side who took the slightest notice of the honorable member; we knew exactly what his statements were worth. It \3annot be said that we did not give him every opportunity to make his statement. We made not one interjection while he was speaking, and after he had discharged his " dud " - and it is no exaggeration to say that it was a " dud," having regard to the fact that many honorable members opposite had expected to hear the most sensational statements - I heard a dozen honorable members  on the Ministerial side say, after the reply by the honorable member for West Sydney, that the honorable member for Cook should not have been allowed to say such dirty things in Parliament under cover of privilege. After his statement proved to be a " dud," all the unhappy faces were on the Ministerial side. To every charge made by the honorable member for Cook, a complete answer was given by the honorable member for West Sydney, and in such a way as to cause honorable members opposite to look exceedingly glum. The <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> newspaper, which has never said a kind word of the Labour party, endeavoured to be fair in its comments this morning upon yesterday's debate, and says that "the honorable member for Cook will learn from hie experience in the House of Representatives yesterday that it is far easier to make these slanderous statements than to prove them." </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member successfully manages to lead a number of people outside to believe that his party is in some way different from the Government party. Unless he could do that, I presume, a Ministerial supporter would, occupy his seat. But that contention cannot be proved by mere speeches and statements; the one evidence that will prove the relationship of the Country party to the Nationalist party is the record of the votes in this House. Let me examine a little more closely the statement of the honorable member. He, and, I think, all the. other members of the Country party, attended a conference . of primary producers in Adelaide recently. They were invited to do. so, presumably because the  convenors  thought that they were a party separate and distinct from the National party. The honorable member for Robertson, who is  Deputy  Leader of the Country party, on that occasion referred to taxation, and the fact that a large number of landholders were destroying their stock rather than pay taxation on it. </para>

                            <para>- Last session an opportunity was afforded the honorable member to grant relief to those persons for whom he pretended so much concern. The honorable member for Gwydir <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Cunningham),</inline> on behalf of the Labour party, moved an amendment to the Taxation Bill to relieve the primary producer of taxation on the natural increase in his stock. <inline font-style="italic">(Hansard,</inline> page 14159). The amendment was carried on the voices, in error. The Prime Minister finding that the amendment would involve a loss of a certain amount of revenue, decided to recommit the Bill. I know of a man who had 5,000 cows, and every calf from, these cows died after he had paid taxation on them. The amendment moved by the honorable member for Gwydir would have relieved the stockraiser of that impost; but every member of the National party and every member of the Country party present, with one exception, voted against it. The Leader of the Country party, after speaking strongly in favour of the amendment, did not vote at all, but the honorable member for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Robert Cook),</inline> the honorable member  for Echuca <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hill),</inline> the honorable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hay),</inline> the honorable member for Maranoa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hunter),</inline> the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse),</inline> and the honorable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wienholt),</inline> voted with the Government for the simple reason that the Prime Minister had cracked the whip. Yet those honorable members went to a conference in Adelaide and held up their hands in holy horror of a state of affairs which compelled the primary producers to shoot their cattle rather than pay taxation upon them. When they had an opportunity to remove that injustice they either ran away or voted with the Government against the primary producer. I say emphatically that it is about time that honorable members of the Country party discontinued the farce in which they are engaged. They go about the country declaring that they are different from the Nationalists, but every vote shows that, they are really a wing of the National party. And that is not all. If honorable members will look up the records of the votes cast in this chamber during last session there will be revelations. I have before me a list of divisions associated with various subjects of interest to primary producers. Those votes reveal that upon every occasion when the Government took the stand that the opposition being shown them was in the nature of a censure motion, or was deemed to be of a vital character, honorable members in the corner consistently went to their aid in order to keep them in power. Votes count; their records remain. Spoken words, either inside or outside this House, count for nothing. Every primary producer will know at the next election just how members of the Country party voted upon these essentially and vitally country questions. </para>

                    </continue><para>I wish to deal now with the reference in the Speech to the proposals of the Government for raising a loan to cope with postal, telephonic, and mail service arrears. This announcement may be said to be analogous to a death-bed confession. At any rate, it has not been made until the eleventh hour, after two and a half years in which the country has been starved of postal, telegraphic, and telephonic facilities. During the closing hours of last session a proposition was placed before the Government, from this side of the House, which involved the raising of a loan to meet urgent requirements of the Postmaster-General's Department. The then Postmaster-General, the honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wise),</inline> had been saying over and over again that the money was not forthcoming to cope with arrears and meet the demands upon his departmental interests. The Opposition urged that if the Postmaster-General did the right thing he would secure the flotation of a loan. However, a deaf ear was turned to the suggestion. During the recess, however, the Government have evidently been deliberating over the proposal, and now, at the last moment, they announce their intention, in order to catch up with postal arrears, to do something following exactly on the lines propounded by the Opposition. It is safe to say that over £10,000,000 worth of work in respect of the services of the Postmaster-General's Department is waiting in country districts all over Australia, and if this amount were spent in the way I suggest, it would prove a sound investment, as a sure profit would accrue. When the Leader of the Opposition, the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton),</inline> referred to this subject a couple of days ago the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> endeavoured to camouflage the issue. The right honorable gentleman said, " The Fisher Labour Government did not do as much as this Government have done in the direction of providing telephonie,  telegraphic, and mail services for the country." And the Prime Minister added, " Look at the record of the Labour Government." I have done so. and it is obvious that the right honorable gentleman could not have done so. The practice, before the advent of a Labour Government,  had been that, whenever it was proposed to provide a mail service or install telegraph or telephone connexion ' in, a country district, an inspector would be sent out to secure an estimate- And the people who were to be benefited by the new facility would be called upon to make up the whole of the deficiency upon that particular service. It was a Labour Government which first decided to relieve country residents of half the amount of deficiency. That was a generous concession, which had never even been hinted at by any previous Administration. I repeat that I have accepted the invitation of the Prime Minister to look at the record of the Labour Government; and I have found, and demonstrated, that it towers head and shoulders above the record of any other Government in the same direction. The Government have now made their belated announcement regarding the flotation of a loan for the services of the Postmaster-General's Department. As long ago as upon 26th August, 1920, an amendment was moved upon a motion then under discussion in this House to the effect that the Postmaster-General be requested to provide increased postal and telephonic facilities- for country districts. I have heard honorable members of the Country party urge greater activity along these  lines; but when a vote was taken in respect of that amendment only five of their number voted for it; eight voted against it. The charge which I level against members of the Country party is that country people have been denied urgent facilities because those who claim to directly represent them in this Parliament have made it impossible for the services to be granted. They have kept the Government in power, and, therefore, they must share the responsibility for many serious misdeeds of the Government. </para><interjection>

It will be most enlightening, I am sure, especially as other mon are similarly situated. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McClintock</inline> stated that he had spent £500 in buying 63 acres of land at Nathalia, and sent 380 cases of peaches and apricots to Melbourne for a gross return of £48 5s. 9d. He sent for 500 cases to get his grapes away, and found it cost him £25 to land the cases on his farm. </para>

But let me continue with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> McClintock's  story. He said that of his last 70 cases, the account sales showed that 40 cases had been consigned to the tip as unsaleable - he declared they were excellent in quality - and that his return for the balance of 30 cases was £3 2s. 6d., from which' had to be deducted the agent's commission, leaving him the handsome sum of lis.

As a matter of fact, he ought to be standing up in this House denouncing the Government for such a state of affairs as this, because he knows that the present wasteful system of distribution, which allows the middleman to come in between the producer and the consumer and reap undue profits, is accountable for this state of affairs to a large extent. </para>

The Prime Minister spoke of what he calls the corruption in the Labour movement, and mentioned the fact that we are not free agents.

                            <para>- Yes. The honorable member for Kooyong, I believe, suggested that the Prime Minister acted the part of a despot and a tyrant, and was bringing the country to ruin. Of course, I do not know what was said upstairs, but it is generally understood that the Prime Minister told the honorable member for Kooyong, most emphatically, that if he wanted to indulge in criticism of the Leader of the Government, he must do it upstairs - not outside. Since then the honorable member for Kooyong, as well, as the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Maxwell),</inline> who also had something to say about the Prime Minister prior to the meeting of the House, have been very silent. As a matter of fact, the honorable member for Kooyong has not ventured to open his .mouth this session. </para>

                            <para>- Of course, there must be a certain amount of imagination about what I am saying, because one can only go by what one hears as to what happened upstairs. I was not privileged to attend that meeting, and a report of the proceedings has not yet appeared in the press; but looking at the honorable member for Kooyong as he sits in this chamber, and also the honorable member for Fawkner, one can draw certain deductions. I think the honorable member for Fawkner accused somebody of being a humbug, and I understand a section of the Melbourne press intimated to him that criticism of that nature would not lead him anywhere. </para>

                            <para>- I saw a statement in the press this morning - I do not know whether it is true - that the honorable member had condemned the Government in regard to certain matters in this House last week; but I believe he said that while he criticised the Government he was not prepared to vote to put the Government out of office. What is the good of that kind of criticism? It would be just as well if the honorable member followed the example of the honorable member for Kooyong - sat down and said nothing. </para>

                            <para>- Why is so much credence given to statements made her© under cover of parliamentary privilege? That statement against the Prime Minister was made by a newspaper outside, and the writer drew his own deductions, and said that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Owen</inline> Cox was the treasurer of the committee which raised a fund of £25,000 for presentation to the Prime Minister. This was a definite statement), and one, as I have said, not made under cover of parliamentary privilege. If the statement is an incorrect one, the Prime Minister has an opportunity to add to his £25,000, theugh the trouble is that if he does take action he may lose some of it. Otherwise, I presume, the Prime Minister would take action in defence of his own good name. </para>

                            <para>- It, was a statement. I refer to the matter merely for the purpose of showing how lightly Government supporters brush aside such allegations against their own leaders, and with what interest they listen to statements made against the Labour party under cover of parliamentary privilege. No statement made here, even under cover of privilege, could be more serious than a statement of that kind made outside the House. I say this in order that when such statements are made against the Government, the Prime Minister will not camouflage them by the introduction of totally irrelevant matters, and, when he talks of corruption on this side, !he will remember that "people who live in glass houses should not throw stones." Let the Prime Minister look into the political life of himself and his party, and he will find enough to occupy his time without endeavouring to turn public attention to wrong-doings elsewhere. </para>

I hope that after we have further information in regard to the finding of the Commission the country will be informed exactly as to the kind of thing that is tolerated only because of a servile majority on the Government side, which is prepared to back the Prime Minister in any action he chooses to take. </para></speech>

                    <para>The Government served Messrs. Kidman and Mayoh with a notice terminating the contract, and claimed from them something like £114,000, moneys paid on behalf of the Commonwealth for which no consideration had been received. The firm then issued a writ against the Commonwealth. Why should we be blamed for that? We have no power to prevent any subject from seeking by law to enforce any claim which he thinks he is entitled to make. The honorable member for Hume knew that that writ was issued by the contractors, but he did not mention it. At the outset of his speech he said, "I am going to tell the House all the facts in connexion with this matter," but he did not mention the material fact that one of the parties to the contract had issued this writ. He suppressed that fact, although it was stated in the very document from which he quoted. He read from the document only such passages as suited his purpose. </para>
                    <para>After notice had been given cancelling the contract, Messrs.

All this is set out in the document from which the honorable member quoted when he said he was giving the House all the facts. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member has a strange idea of how a controversy should be carried on. He claims, apparently, that he is entitled to give the facts which suit him and to suppress those which tell against his argument. That is what he did in this instance, and in doing so he considered that he was taking up a strictly impartial attitude. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member has not heard what I have said. The honorable member for Hume knew when he was speaking that a writ had been issued against the Commonwealth by Messrs. Kidman and Mayoh, and the House now knows that he was aware of that fact. The termination of the contract was in accordance with the finding of the Committee, that "It is doubtful, even with the expenditure of an unwarrantable sum of money, that the ships could be made seaworthy." The contract was cancelled, and a claim made on behalf of the Commonwealth on the firm. Messrs. Kidman and Mayoh then issued a writ for £88,000 against the Commonwealth Government, who have counterclaimed for something over £100,000, money paid. In ordinary circumstances the case would have gone on for trial before the High Court, and would have involved a lengthy judicial investigation of matters into which the Public Works Committee had to some extent already inquired. To avoid this the Commonwealth agreed that the matter should be referred to an arbitrator. </para>

                            <para>- In this case it would seem that the tongue is mightier than the fist. I listened to the honorable member, without interjecting, while he was making misrepresentations, and in fairness he should allow me to reply without interruption. Had the case gone before the High Court it would have involved a long and costly investigation of the facts into which the Public Works Committee had already inquired. We believed that it would be better to appoint an arbitrator to settle the whole matter in accordance with the ordinary principles of arbitration. The honorable member for Hume finds fault with one of the conditions of the reference to the arbitrator which is to the effect that " the arbitrator shall have power to admit such evidence as he deems fit without having regard to the rules of evidence." That very provision to which the honorable member objects made it possible to put before the arbitrator the report of the Public Works Committee and the evidence taken by it. But for that clause it would not have been possible to do so. The result was that the arbitrator was able to deal in a few days with a case which in ordinary circumstances would have involved long and costly litigation. The contract itself provided for arbitration in certain circumstances. Does the honorable member blame us for going to arbitration after the issue of the writ ? </para>

                            <para>- .Surely the Government are in no sense blameworthy for any action on the part of the contractors. I would remind the honorable member once more, however, that the . finding of the Public Works Committee was simply that the request of the contractors to be relieved of the contract should not be complied with. That finding did not settle the whole of the issues involved. </para>

                            <para>- When parties come before an arbitrator, each, of course, has the right to submit evidence in support of his case, and the Government cannot be blamed because in this case some of the witnesses were called who had been previously examined by the Public Works Committee. The honorable member for Hume has objected to the clause which made it possible to put before the arbitrator the evidence taken before the Public Works  Committee,  and its findings thereupon. The Government have been forced into the position complained about by the action of the contractors in issuing the writ. The Committee dealt with the question : Should the contractors be relieved of their contract? But the Government had also, of course, to enforce its own legal rights. </para>

                            <para>- Had we gone to Court, and entered upon expensive litigation, we should have been condemned for not having adopted the cheap, inexpensive method of arbitration. We should have been blamed whatever we might have done. But we have done what we thought right, and have taken the course that will commend itself to the good sense of the community as the proper one. It is unfortunate that the honorable member for Hume, who knew the facts, should have tried to create a wrong impression in the minds of members and of the country generally. With reference to the statement as to the laying up of the Commonwealth ships, it is a cowardly thing for a public man to pick up scandalous, damaging reports that are abroad, and repeat them here, without taking any responsibility for them. A public man has no right to come here and say, " Such and such a thing is said. I do not know whether it is true or false," and from his place in Parliament give it additional publicity, and thus increase the damage that a wrong report may do. A man should have the pluck to stand up to any charges that he repeats. </para>

My reply to him is that I had no intention of covering up anything, and the proof of that is that I referred to the paper that was placed on the table of the House this morning. I offered that paper to the Minister. When I made my speech I dealt with everything in it that had any relevancy to the question on which I spoke. As you, sir, rule that I cannot go further, I shall have to wait for another opportunity to reply to the Minister. To show that I did not wish to cover up anything, I remind honorable members that I held the paper in my hand, and offered it to the Minister. </para>

                <para class="block">I am not quite satisfied with this answer. Many complaints have been heard about the way things are done in the Northern Territory. It seems strange that the Government, which relies on tendering, and which always claims to accept the lowest tender, accepted, in this particular case, the highest tender, and gave for so. doing the reasons which I have just read. Whether it rejected the lowest tender because one of the papers happened to be regarded as a Labour organ, I know not. The Northern Territory is a sink for the expenditure of money, and it seems strange that the Government should be willing to pay more for this work than is necessary. If a firm was prepared to tender for the publication of the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> at a lower price than another firm, its tender should have been accepted, and if afterwards it did not give satisfaction, other steps could be taken. It was on the assumption that they would not give satisfaction, although their tender was a <inline font-style="italic">bona fide</inline> one, that it was rejected and a tender at the highest rate accepted. The Government ought to give this matter some further consideration. </para>

Of course, the obligation resting upon the Government in accepting tenders for contracts for doing any work is not merely to see that the lowest tender is accepted, but also to be reasonably assured that they shall get good service for their money. In this particular case, after making careful inquiries, they ascertained that the actual tender price was very much below the cost of the work that was to be done. The ordinary business man would say, " I am quite prepared to accept it, provided I can be reasonably assured that the work will be carried through." To this end bondsmen are necessary, and inquiries have to be made as to their standing. If the bondsmen are good, men who can be relied upon, notwithstanding the failure of the contractor to carry the undertaking through, it is good policy to accept the lowest tender; but if, on the other hand, the bondsmen cannot be relied upon, and it is considered that in all the circumstances the price quoted by the tenderer is below the cost at which he can do the work, and that he is likely to fail to do it, the only possible course is to take the next tender, if it appears to bc a reasonable one. Though the second tender was below the price at which the Government Printer was prepared to do the work, we felt that this tenderer would be able to carry the work through satisfactorily. We had doubts about the ability of the other tenderer to complete the work, and the financial position of the bondsmen submitted was not such as to inspire confidence. </para>

                        <para>- It is the usual practice in most cases. Where the Government deems it desirable they always ask for bondsmen. In this particular case, the Government asked for them, and those that were forthcoming were not satisfactory. For that reason the other contract was accepted. </para>
