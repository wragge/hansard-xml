                    <quote>
                        <para>There have been some dismissals of men from Cockatoo Island recently; the circumstances are as follow: - </para>
                        <para>The Boilermakers Society in Sydney some little time ago instructed its members that they must not use on " repair " work such tools as pneumatic ri vetting hammers, pneumatic drills, pneumatic chipping and caulking tools, and acetylene cutting and burning lamps. This meant a reversion to. the old "hand" methods, which ate practically obsolete, take longer, and are much more costly. It may be observed that the tools referred to have been in use on all classes of work in Sydney for years. </para>
                        <para>At the time this decision was given, the construction of ship No. 47 (one of the 12,800 ton vessels) was proceeding without interruption, as the embargo on pneumatic tools, &amp;e., did not apply to new construction work. </para>
                        <para>H.M.A.S. <inline font-style="italic">Platypus</inline> was drydocked at Cockatoo Island, on 8th September, for the purpose of having repairs effected to a damaged bottom. The boilermakers who were put on the job were proceeding to work in the customary way with pneumatic tools, but were prevented by the union delegates. The manager of the Dockyard pointed out to the delegates that the Platypus was a war vessel, but this made no difference, and the boilermakers did not make a start on the work. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>Boilermakers were then transferred from ship No 47 to the <inline font-style="italic">Platypus</inline> and instructed to proceed with the repair work on this vessel, and on their refusing to use the pneumatic tools, &amp;c., were paid off from the Dockyard. The <inline font-style="italic">Platypus</inline> has since left the dock without the repairs being effected. </para>
                    <para>The <inline font-style="italic">Platypus</inline> is the third vessel requiring repairs that has been laid up at Cockatoo Dockyard owing to the action of the Boilermakers Union in preventing its members from using pneumatic tools, and as it is important that the Dockyard should at all times be free to carry out any repairs required by Naval and Commonwealth Line vessels, the Shipbuilding Board of Control, after very careful consideration, decided, in the interests of the Dockyard, and also, it is considered, in the interests of the majority of the workmen, that this unreasonable and harassing restriction should be restricted. The trouble had been continuing for some weeks, and the Board of Control thought it time it was brought to a head. </para>
                    <para>The construction of the 12,800-ton vessels has not been stopped. It has been interfered with, as stated above, but the situation has been exaggerated. As a matter of fact, the assertion that all boilermakers have been paid off is incorrect, as the following statement will demonstrate: - </para>

                    </para>
                    <para>The Board of Control is quite as anxious as any member of the executive of the Boilermakers Union that the work on the two 12,800- ton vessels should proceed in full swing, and as soon as the union rescinds its resolution, that portion of the work which has been affected will be proceeded with. Consideration has to be given, not only to the construction of these vessels, but also to the other work of the Dockyard, and to the effect that the restriction regarding the use of tools has on the discipline and proper carrying on of the business generally. </para>

                        <para>- On the 14th September the honorable member for Herbert <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bamford)</inline> asked whether I had made myself acquainted with the details of a report by the Director of Navigation (Captain Davis) upon the recently established radio station in the Willis Island group, and, if so, was I prepared to say whether the Government intended to give effect to the recommendations regarding the future maintenance of the station. In reply I would state that, as already intimated, the question whether the station should be established upon a permanent basis will be determined in the light of the experience gained during the coining cyclone season, when observations are again to be taken at the islands. In the meantime finality cannot be reached in regard to the whole of Captain Davis' recommendations. The Treasurer has, however, been asked to provide the funds necessary to enable an immediate commencement to be made with certain works, including the erection of a concrete building to surround the present wooden structure, which have been recommended by Captain Davis for the protection of the lives of the observing and operating staff. </para>

In this connexion it is pointed out that newcomers who have not had previous experience in farm work require to gain their experience with Australian farmers, who have willingly agreed to teach them rural practices, and thus fit them to qualify "as farmers on their own account.

                        <para>- I have not received any application from the Government of New South Wales for financial assistance for the purpose mentioned. I did, however, discuss with the Minister for Lands the position of land-holders in rabbit-infested areas, but the conversation related more to the creation of a rabbit skin pool than to wire netting. A suggestion was made that a price should be guaranteed for twelve months that would keep the trappers at work, all the year round. </para>

It was suggested that if a uniform price were guaranteed trapping operations would continue all the year round. Wire netting was mentioned, but the decision of the Government to place that item on the Tariff free list satisfied <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wearne.</inline></para>

                            <para>- I would include everything that needs investigation by honest men, because the charges that are so frequently made in connexion with the selection and election of candidates for State and Commonwealth parliamentary honours, as it used to be called, are such as (to tempt the average citizen to hold his nose with disgust whenever politics or politicians are mentioned. The remarkable feature of the charges made by the honorable member for Cook is the fact that, although the honorable member has informed the House on several occasions that this corrupt gang of Tammany politicians, as he  describes them, has been operating, and these cases of corruption and bribery and everything that is vile, with which the honorable member himself was associated for so many years, have been going on, according to his own utterances and published statements, from at least 1915, year after year from that date, which the honorable member mentions as being the time when this corruptness became organized in the State of New South Wales, he has been the campaign director for the Labour party for every election campaign initiated by the so-called " Tammany Hall gang." </para>

As to the point of order raised, I have looked carefully into the notice which I received of the intention to move  the adjournment of the House, and I was inclined to believe that it revived a question that was "decided by the House last night. However, on looking into the matter more closely, I see that the present motion covers a different point from that raised by the honorable member for Cook last night. The present motion has to do with a public investigation, whereas the amendment of the honorable member for Cook dealt with the failure of the Government to make provision in the Bill for governmental control. These are two different matters, and the honorable member for the Harrier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Considine)</inline> is, therefore, in order. </para>

                        <para>- I have to thank honorable members of the various political parties for not allowing their political prejudices to prevent fair play. What I was trying to point out when I was interrupted was that, just as in the Courts learned Judges have delivered the dictum that parties who make charges should do so with clean hands, so it should be the case here. If the charges of the honorable member for Cook had been made by anybody else, the damage would have been incalculable to the Labour party in New South Wales. But all these political accusations should be properly investigated, not only in respect of the Australian Labour party, but also so far as concerns the Nationalist party, and the Country party, and the Industrial Labour party, with which I am connected. We, at any rate, have nothing to hide, and, therefore, would welcome' any inquiry. It is within- the knowledge of honorable members generally, although it was not mentioned by the honorable member for Cook, that . certain  individuals axe at present undergoing trial, fort an alleged political offence in Queensland. They are not connected with the Australian Labour party, or with the Industrial Labour party. The charges are that they attempted to bribe a certain member of Parliament. The whole matter of corruption and bribery and criminal practices generally in connexion with the selection and election of candidates for Parliament warrants investigation by some public tribunal. &lt;- 1 do not wish that any investigation should be undertaken <inline font-style="italic">in camera.</inline> I desire an inquiry at which the .public may learn all the facts in connexion with the organization and ramifications of the various political machines, their financing,, and their general operations: </para>

                        <para>- I did, and I did not have <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Berry</inline> making any charges about my selection. I repeat that I have been the victim of corruption, of criminal conspiracy. I was the victim of a breach of the law on an occasion when my name was forged. I have asked for justice in this House, and have been refused again and again. . I asked the late Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wise)</inline> and the present Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> ; and I now ask the Prime Minister whether the Government will table all the papers associated , with the inquiry instituted by the Postmaster-General's Department into the forgery of my name to a telegram, during March, 1920, in the Haymarket post-office, Sydney. What is the use of honorable members' opposite talking of their desire for an- investigation when the Government which they support have been " covering up." the people who forged my name? The Government will not table the papers for which I have inquired. There is no political machinery behind me. to fight my case. When I sought to force the production of. the: papers honorable members assured me that I could do so by in troducing  a motion in. this House. I did so move, on the day after the forgery had occurred; and I brought it up again on the 17th November, 1920, when the facts, which are now in the possession of the Postmaster-General's Department, were made available to me - for perusal, however, and not for use. Again I <inline font-style="italic">moved on the</inline> 26th November, shortly before the close of the  session  in 1920, that all the intervening business on the notice-paper should be postponed to permit of the consideration of my notice of motion (No. 18). But I could not even gain the assistance of the honorable member for Cook, although he was campaign director of the Labour party in New South Wales when my name was forged to the telegram in question. I could not even secure a seconder to my motion. Yet honorable members opposite say they want to expose- criminal practices. They talk like that when the honorable member for Cook is attacking tha Labour party; but when the honorable member for Barrier simply seeks common justice, that, be may expose forgers, they turn him down. The Government prefer to protect those whom I would prosecute if the evidence were placed in my hands. No doubt, the underlying motive is that one good turn deserves another. In the whirligig of politics one party arises, in its strength, and supplants the reigning party, and awkward, revelations axe- apt to be made if some understanding is not arrived at. Hence, the individual and his  claims  are to be crushed in the interests of. party machines. In such circumstances, the individual must employ what few wits he may possess in order to fight his own battiest in the best way he can. Placing on one side the question of Courts, and of individuals, I hold that the remedy proposed by the honorable member for Cook foc corruption in connexion with the selection of candidates would be ineffectual. To have the Government supervise the selection of candidates would be a condition more to be deplored than the present malpractices. The effect would be merely to place all political matters at the mercy of the Government of the day. I ask honorable members to imagine the present Government supervising selection ballots in connexion with the Nationalist party. There is no doubt that they would be " properly conducted,"  and that their outcome would give eminent satisfaction to the Government. And, if the Government were to be given the right of supervision over selection ballots in connexion with other political parties, the result in every instance would be, if not satisfactory to those parties, very happy for the Government. </para>

                        <para>.- I desire to say a few words, not so much upon the direct subject of the debate as respecting that which arises from it. A week or so ago the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> intimated to the Government that he would do all he could, speaking  on behalf of his party, to facilitate the business of the House. Yesterday, when my Leader became indisposed, he remarked to me that there were a number of Bills to come before the attention of members, but that they embraced nothing of very great importance; and he reminded me that, in pursuance of his undertaking, it would be the business of the Opposition to facilitate the passage of those measures. Yesterday the Government displayed anxiety to get on with business. And the way in which they did so was by applying the "gag" repeatedly while honorable members were discussing the Electoral Bill. </para>

                            <para>- I prefer to lead up to my argument by means of illustrations. This debate has arisen in consequence of the proceedings of last evening, when Ministers professed themselves extremely anxious to get on with business, and, on that ground, continually applied the " gag " for the immediate decision of questions of importance. When the Leader of the Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> wished to make an important statement regarding the Electoral Bill, the Minister in charge of the measure replied with what was practically a personal attack on the honorable member. But when the third reading of the Bill was moved, and the honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. J. H. Catts)</inline> rose to open up questions wholly unconnected with the Bill and, whether his statements were true or not, of no concern to the House, there was a change of attitude on the part of the Government. The Minister in charge of the business of the House showed himself no longer anxious to make progress; he sat quietly, with a sanctimonious smirk on his features, listening for two hours to dirty and filthy utterances upon every subject under the sun except the Electoral Bill. I have nothing to say about the matters dealt with by the honorable member for Cook. He has the right to choose his own party, and to take his own course. If he thought that he did himself good by the 'speech he made last night, that does not concern me. But what he had to say had nothing to do with this House. I can understand a man separating himself from his party if he has been associated with a body of criminals, and feels it imperative for his future safety that he shall henceforth be as virtuous as in the past he has been vicious. A man may be impelled to sever old associations in order to avoid punishment or in the hope of reward. Such a man may turn round and abuse those in whose crimes and offences he was a partner. He may be prompted by remorse, or his exposure of his former associates may be due to a hope of escaping punishment for his own misdeeds. The honorable member for Cook, however, went beyond the denunciation of the criminals with whom he said he had been associated, and endeavoured to besmirch an entire section of the community. He was not content with singling out those whom he said had committed certain offences ; he directed his attacks on a body of men who have had no connexion with the misdoing that he spoke of, if, indeed, it existed. None "of the members of this party have been associated with those undesirable persons with whom he showed his own connexion to have been so intimate. There I leave the honorable member. I have not another word to say about any statement he may choose to make. If his remarks were true, they " concern only the public of one State; they have no concern for nine-tenths of the population of Australia, or for five-sixths of the States of the Union. <inline font-weight="bold">His</inline> charges did not reflect upon the Labour party, and the matter of his speech was not a thing upon which this Chamber should have been allowed to spend its time last night. I can understand that the Ministers and their supporters were pleased 'to hear the honorable member's utterances, hoping to build their fortunes on our misfortunes. They were satisfied to allow the honorable member to endeavour to besmirch us as he did. Although the Government had professed such anxiety to transact public business of vital importance, Ministers allowed the House to listen for two hours to utterances which, even if true, were so disgusting in their obscenities 'that no' Chamber should have been permitted to listen to them. It may be said that a member of the Labour party could have moved for the application of the " gag " to the speech of the honorable member for Cook; but had any of us done that, we should have been accused of trying to cover up charges that were being levelled at us. No such objection, however, could have been taken to the Government's interference in the interests of decency. When, the members of this House of all parties are regardless of their obligations to themselves, and of what is due to the dignity of this assembly; when some of them, because of the circumstances in which they are placed, must remain silent, and others refrain from interfering because of the hope that their opponents may be besmirched with filth which should not be thrown on them, it is still the duty of one man to preserve the honour of the Chamber.. You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> are the custodian of the dignity and decorum of this assembly, and the Standing Orders give you powers to its preservation. I remind you that the honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. J. H. Catts)</inline> did not make a speech; he gave a recitation. </para>

                            <para>- I am speaking of what occurred yesterday; there may or may not have been other offenders. Certainly the bulk of honorable members are not permitted to violate Standing Orders as they were violated by the honorable member for Cook, who was permitted to read practically every line of his speech. Still, honorable members are not allowed to criticise the occupant of the cb air. If you, sir, were satisfied that the dignity and  decorum  of this Chamber, were safe in your hands last night, I have no further comment to make. </para>

                            <para>- I am not making an attack upon you, sir, and shall leave things where they stand. If it be the desire of Parliament to authorize an investigation on which no one can place a limit, well and good. We, on this side, have nothing to hide. An inquiry, if properly conducted, and if those in charge of it were armed with the necessary powers, would not stop with an investigation of the accusations of the honorable member for Cook. It would not deal with the affairs of one party only ; it would inquire how all parties get their funds, and manage their organizations ; what are the powers behind them, and whether wealth pulls their strings. It should be made known by what means <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Shannon</inline> was deprived of his seat in South Australia, and how it is that men who were known by their poverty for long years showed a sudden change of fortune, and became wealthy, on changing their party. We should know the source of this wealth. We should be told, also, what power it is that can suddenly remove a man from the place in which he has been appointed to carry the banner of his party, and take him to another State. The investigation that is required would shed a light on the corruption inspired by ambition and greed. It would have no regard to the brand of a man's politics or to his creed ; its concern would be wholly .the interests of the country. I would welcome such an investigation. If in the Labour movement there is anything discreditable, exposure would do us no harm ; on the contrary, it would purify the party, and make it stronger and better. But were au investigation to bring to light facts besmirching the so-called Nationalists, that party would be swept out of existence, because the power behind it is that of a few rich magnates; it is a corroding power. Those are my comments on the proceedings of last night. If. a division is called for, I shall vote for. the inquiry that is desired. </para>

                        <para>- I think I should not allow certain remarks made by the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anstey)</inline> concerning myself to pass without some notice. It is not in order to cast reflections on the Chair in the course of debates; the conduct of the  Speaker  can only be challenged on a substantive motion. But inferentially the honorable Me member for Bourke reflected on the Chair in respect of two matters. Apparently feeling aggrieved that the House itself took no action to curtail a debate which took- place last evening, he considered that the  Speaker,  in. the interests of the decorum of the House, should have intervened in some way. Regarding the matter of decorum, I think it will be generally admitted that I am frequently intervening in debates in the interest of decorum, but so long as an honorable member conforms to the Standing Orders and observes the rules of debate within the limits of the question before the Chair, it is not the province of the  Speaker  to be the censor of the subject-matter of the honorable member's speech. All the  Speaker  is concerned with is to see that the rules of debate are not transgressed, or the Standing Orders infringed. I had occasion, as it happened, to intervene on several occasions when unparliamentary expressions were employed during the debate. The honorable member for Bourke also referred to non-intervention by the Chair to prevent the honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. J. H. Catts)</inline> from reading his speech. I can only say in regard to that matter that if the honorable member for Bourke had called my attention to the fact at the time, as it was within his province to do on a point of order, I would then have been in a position to take official cognisance of the matter, and would have directed the honorable member for Cook that he must not read his speech. It is not always possible for me to say with certainty whether an honorable member is reading his speech or merely referring to notes, and it is easily conceivable that, whilst I might suspect him of reading and direct him not to do so, I might find I had unwarrantably intervened through an erroneous assumption. -I will, however, now take the opportunity, since the matter has been raised, of pointing out that it is a breach of the Standing Orders for any honorable member to read his speech. I strongly resent the implied reflection by the honorable member for Bourke on my impartiality. </para>

                            <para>The nominal amount of subscriptions to this loan was £10,086,940, but, as the price of issue was £96 per cent., the gross proceeds totalled only £9,683,462.After -deducting the expenses of borrowing, the net proceeds were £9,626,998. The Commonwealth thus received £95 8s. l0d. for each £100 of loan raised, and as the nominal rate of interest was' 6 per cent., and the currency about nine and a half years,  the  interest cost to  the  Commonwealth was £6 13s. 3d. per cent.  peT  annum. The Diggers' Loan carried conversion privileges to subscribers who were holders of 4½ per cent, and 5 per cent, bonds; £6,190,790 of  4½  per cent, and 5 per cent, bonds were converted into 6 per cent. bonds. The additional interest . payable as the result of these conversions was equivalent to l1s. l0d. per cent, per annum on the total of the Diggers' Loan. The total interest cost to the Commonwealth was thus £7 5s.1d. per cent, per annum. Whilst the State Governments are charged £7 5s. per cent, per annum on advances made out 'of the proceeds of this loan, they . receive fr.om the Commonwealth, during the first five years after each advance is made, a rebate of interest at the rate of  24 per  cent. per annum. </para>

                        <para>.- This short measure deals with . only one matter, and that is the removal of the surcharge on the land tax. That surcharge was imposed ' with several other taxes to defray expenditure arising out of the recent war, and I believe that its remission will involve a loss of approximately £400,000 of revenue. </para>

                            <para>- It would. It appears strange that when we are still feeling the financial burdens imposed upon us by the Great War the Government should be proposing remission of taxation in several directions on the very eve of an election. This reduction of the burden of taxation waa not considered necessary until an election became imminent. Now, of course, these sops must be handed out for the very obvious purpose of catching votes. </para>

                            <para>- If that be not the purpose, how is it that in order to make these remissions the Treasurer has to take £3,200,000 from the accumulated surplus Trust Funds? One would expect that a Treasurer proposing such remissions would be able to show that they were warranted by the present financial position of the Commonwealth, but I submit that the financial statement shows the position to be just the reverse. We are not in a position to remit as much taxation as the Treasurer proposes without having to impose additional burdens in some other direction. The Trust Fund on which he is operating this year can only meet the withdrawals for another year, after which additional taxation will need to be imposed. Furthermore, the Treasurer is remitting land taxation at a time when it is needed. Although the actual cost of the war itself may be a diminishing feature in our expenditure, the interest bill on the money borrowed during the war appears to be an ever-increasing item. Many loans will be falling due shortly, and if the money market remains as it is to-day, it is quite probable that some of the 4^ per cent, stock will have to be converted into 5 per cent, stock. </para>

                            <para>- I could understand the Treasurer remitting this taxation if sufficient revenue were coming in from other directions to balance accounts; but, as a 'matter of fact, just when our income is less than our expenditure the Treasurer chooses to remit taxation. It is urged that the tax now sought to be remitted was only imposed for the purpose of meeting war costs. As a matter of fact, the costs to meet which the tax was imposed are not decreasing. It would be quite a different matter if this had been the only additional burden imposed for the purpose. It was not. We also imposed an entertainments tax, portion of which is being remitted, and we increased the postage, telephonic, and telegraphic rates, which are still to stand. In other fields, also, taxation was increased. </para>

                            <para>- The income tax was imposed for war purposes, and, although the Treasurer proposes to remit portion of that particular burden, he does not intend to go to the full extent we would like in that direction. I could understand some concession being made in the land tax if it were intended to benefit poorer settlers in distress owing to unforeseen circumstances overtaking them,, but it is a very wrong principle to make the remission apply to all the big land-holders of Australia, who probably reaped the greatest benefit out of the recent war, and should be asked to pay something to help in discharging the. war debt incurred by the Commonwealth. The fact that too much land is held by too few people prevents closer settlement. The only means by which we can bring about closer settlement is to impose an effective land tax, and make the large land-holders work their land or dispose of it. But instead of doing that the Treasurer proposes to relieve them of taxation. There are many other directions where one could understand relief from taxation being given before any thought is given to relieving the big land monopolists of the country of the land tax they have been justly called upon to pay. </para>

                            <para>- I know that very well. The super tax was imposed during the war. In fact, all of the taxes the Treasurer seeks to remit were imposed primarily for the purpose of getting in sufficient revenue to meet the cost of the war. But is it fair to remit the whole of the additional taxation paid by the wealthy portion of the community when the burden which the taxes were imposed to meet is still with us? I want to retain the super tax on the big landholders. I would not mind giving some concession to the small men; but I maintain that the large landholder should be called upon to contribute something substantial towards the cost of the recent war. </para>

Remission of taxation in this direction will not assist in the settlement of the country or aid the Government in their immigration policy. It is useless to talk of bringing people to settle in Australia if the land is not available for them. And when we are talking about a policy of ' immigration, our. first proposal should not be to repeal a tax that certainly does have the effect of breaking up large estates.

                        <para>. -  A super land tax was only imposed after due consideration, because such taxation is only levied when there is urgent necessity for it. I cannot see* any reason why 'it should be wiped out now. We cannot say that at the present time our financial position is better than it was when this tax was imposed. As  a  matter of fact, there is more necessity to-day for the collection of revenue than there was at that time. My honorable friends in the Country party can support this amendment. He would be a rather big " poor " farmer who held freehold land worth £20,000. The members of the Country party know that it is most essential to break up large estates in the interests of the farming community; it is one of the economic points they are urging in season and out of season; but as there are among them several who represent very large interests, they may not care about fixing the limit at £20,000. I am now addressing myself to real farmers, and not to merely those who "farm farmers"; and I admit that there are some honorable members in the Corner who do farm land. In Victoria the sons and daughters and daughters' husbands of farmers have not much hope of acquiring land at moderate prices ; and if our efforts were really in the interests of farmers we should so provide that in the future land would be available to such people. However, amongst those who claim to represent country interests there are men who really do not do so, and, Indeed, do not further country interests. In justification of that statement, may I point to the castigation which yesterday was administered to certain members of this House by a representative body because of the stand they had taken in regard to the disposition of the Commonwealth Line of Steamers ? At last, those who return such members are realizing that they are not properly represented here. </para>

                            <para>- I had intended to merely refer to it by way of illustration, but the honorable member 'for Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett)</inline> drew me off the track. I agree with my Leader <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> that the absentee has no . right to any consideration at . all. That, , to somewhere, may sound an astounding statement, but it is one in the truth of which I thoroughly believe. When I speak of 'absentees, I do not mean those 'who, like the honorable member for Grampians, pay a visit to the Old Country; I mean people who draw their money from Australia, and spend it elsewhere, and who, I repeat, deserve no consideration at all, and certainly not to the extent of being relieved from the super tax. If the Government are overloaded with revenue, and have money to give away, may I suggest that the large land-holders should not be the objects of their liberality. If the desire be to spend any surplus money to the best advantage, we ought to liberalize the old-age and invalid pensions. I do not charge the Government with having no feeling or sympathy for these old and stricken people, but there is about £6,500,000 . at the disposal of the Treasury, and this ought not to be used either to placate those who returned the Government to power, or to induce others to vote for them in the future. This £400,000 might well  bo  spent in liberalizing the old-age and  invalid  pensions. Let me give some striking illustrations. In my constituency there are several elderly women, whose husbands have taken a " moonlight flit " to other States, and though those women, by age, are eligible for old-age pensions, they are refused any relief, because they are not legally separated from their husbands, and are unable to pursue the latter. The Treasurer himself will admit that that is a very wrong position for women to be placed an, and that it was never  intended  when the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act was passed that people  so  circumstanced should be denied relief. And this  Teli'ef  is denied purely <inline font-style="italic">sea</inline> an  act of administration under the 'regulations; no blame attaches in this connexion to the officials of the Department. I may not be successful in obtaining proper recognition of the rights of these women, but I shall keep their cases before Parliament until something is done on their behalf. Then I have another case, typical of hundreds in the community. It is a case of an old couple, the husband over sixty-five and the wife over sixty. The husband, in consequence of 'his age, is unfit to work, and is given a pension, but because his wife is able to do a certain amount  of  work, the amount of money she earns is deducted from  the  pension of her husband. Surely if there is money to give  away,  or largesse to  be  scattered abroad, some of it might be allocated to such old people as those? But, perhaps, the worst  case  of all is one which comes under that part of the Act which provides for invalid pensions. I know . a man whose two sons suffer from tuberculosis, and though they never have worked,  and  never will be able to earn any money, they  are  refused the invalid pension. The father earns £4  a  week, . and he . and the . mother are 'impoverishing themselves in order to provide  the  commodities necessary for their invalid sons. </para>

                        constituents have, had opportunities to* consider' my attitude in this regard. But that is&gt; a principle to which. I hold. Andi I say again that land taxation should be left to be imposed  by local: authorities. As to. big estates it is my opinion that owners who continue to retain them after they have placed themselves; with respect to their neighbours-, in&gt; the- position - so to to speak - of a potato in a gooseberry  pie are-  acting, very foolishly. The Government have a perfect right to- resume- any land they- may require, whether for railway purposes, for' defence interests-, or for agricultural1 settlement, provided, that is, that they pay fair and honest value for- the land.
                    </para>
                    <para>Another point which the Leader of the Opposition probably overlooked in connexion with fixing an arbitrary sum,, such as ?20.000, as a maximum up to which relief should be given, in land taxation, relates to stud  breeding. My people,, if I may be permitted to make a personal allusion, were interested, from, the middle of last century, in a property upon which Clydesdale stallions were bred. Horses were imparted from England and Scotland for many years, and', eventually young- Clydesdales were being sent in- considerable numbers- to various parts of- Queensland as well as to other- States. With- the advance of closer settlement, the property was subdivided;, and the ordinary progress of civilization has now- turned that area- into wheat farms' and the like; and quite rightly so. The other day, however, I was amused to note.- that a deputation of farmers had asked the Queensland Government that Clydesdale stallions should be provided by the State for use among farmers' stock. My point is that estates devoted to stud breeding, and of sheep particularly, are very necessary, and that we should be careful not to overlook that fact. I have consistently stressed the need for reduction of taxation. I am bound to bear in mind, however, that when the last Budget was introduced the Country party fought very hard for a. reduction in the Estimates sufficient to square the ledger. The honorable member for Darwin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bell)</inline> supported our efforts. We said we would not countenance a Budget which revealed a deficit of £2,800,000. But we are faced with very much the same situation to-day, and I must point out that I am not inconsistent in my present attitude. I said last year that, rather than that there should be a deficit, I would vote for the imposition of extra taxation, provided, of course, that I was assured - which I have not been - that the Government were exercising care over every peony of expenditure. There is cause for alarm in the prospect of having to support any proposition which may contribute to a loss on the operations of the financial year amounting to nearly three millions sterling. During the present Parliament the Commonwealth has increased its total debt by something like £96,000,000. That is a very serious position. I do not believe in criticising the Parliament of one's own State from a Beat in this House; but my anxiety is particularly acute because Queensland also shows a tremendous increase in her debt and in the volume of her deficits. </para>
                    <para>As the Leader of the Opposition pointed out, considerable renewals of loans must shortly be met, both by the States and the Commonwealth. I do not think the Treasurer quite grasped my meaning when I interjected, while the Leader of the Opposition was speaking, that the 4£ per cent, loans were immune from taxation. I meant, not that I would expect the Government to continue the policy of granting immunity from income taxation, but that even if certain 4£ per cent, loans had to be renewed at higher rates, the Commonwealth might still be the gainer, owing to the fact that those renewed loans not in future being immune. I do not see how the Commonwealth can afford to carry on what may be described as a deliberate policy of maintaining a deficit' of nearly £3,000,000. For that would be a policy of " sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof," and of " after me, the deluge." It is not fair, of course, to accuse the Treasurer of having introduced the measure before the Chair for vote-catching purposes, though the people concerned would naturally very generally support the policy of the Government. For the Government to draw upon the accumulated surplus - which, after all, was in existence last year also, when the Country party endeavoured to square the ledger - is equivalent to eating one's emergency ration; a ration, too, which will stand only two bites. The Treasurer, no doubt, is counting - I will not say gambling - on a factor which he indicated plainly at the close of his Budget speech. That is to say, he is of opinion that a policy of 'remission of taxation will cause such a renewal and expansion of confidence among the people generally, that the resultant growth of prosperity will return to the Treasury considerably more than the total of loss involved in remissions. But when the Treasurer proposes to use up practically half his surplus - and despite the fact that he ie a sound mid excellent business man - there is one factor which he must surely overlook. I refer to the possibility of severe droughts. In Queensland, I have seen two-thirds of the whole of the sheep wiped out by a series of bad years, and half the cattle in the State also. </para>

                        <para>.- At this juncture, I welcome all measures for the remission of taxation, of whatever character. I hold that it is the duty of every Government to do with as little money as may be possible, and to take as little as possible from the pockets of the taxpayers in order, to a corresponding extent, to liberate money for -the development of the country. Private enterprise can do very much better with its money in the direction of a country's development, and along the lines of creating employment, than can any Government. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> has moved an amendment. The incidence of that amendment is to suggest  that there should be no remission of taxation of the richer members of the community. Many loose statements are made with reference, to public and private wealth. I regard profits as being very necessary. After all, profits are the storehouses for taxation; and, without profits, a country cannot raise revenue. Honorable members, upon reflection and examination of Commonwealth and State taxation, will see that income taxes, both Federal and State, amount to as much as lis. and 12s. in the pound. That is to say, more than half of one's income is taken away in taxation. And then, when a person dies, nearly another half is taken away, in probate duties. If that is not confiscation of wealth, I ask, what is? I am heartily in favour of the proposal of the Government, because I think that the incidence of the land tax is most unjust in many cases. I came across 'an illustration of this injustice only the other week. I have not got the actual figures with me now, but they could be produced. A large estate is asking for the remission of taxation because of its losses owing to bad seasons, and that remission has been refused, notwithstanding that section 66 of the Act provides for these circumstances being taken into consideration. </para>

                            <para>- It has made no profits. Because of the unfair incidence of taxation on accretions of stock and there being no allowance for losses by drought, the land taxation, plus income taxation, Federal and State, plus local government taxation, and other taxes,' amounts in the case of this estate to more than the value of the wool shorn from the sheep which it carries. The land taxation of the .company owning the estate was nearly £7,000 for the year 1919-20 and about £6,500 for the year 1920-21, but the losses on the working of the estate for those two years amounted to £20,000. This company is staggering under a bank overdraft of £40,000, which will have to be increased to £50,000 if the Commissioner insists on the land tax being paid. It seems to be an illusion to think that the big companies and the so-called rich people who are interested in land can be hit" up much further. They are being hit up now almost to the verge of bankruptcy. </para>

                            <para>- In New South Wales. It may be thought that the Government can settle people on the land to better advantage than private individuals, but I have it on the authority of the auditor of the Peel River Estate that that company cut up some of its land in New South Wales and settled men on it, and that every one of those settlers has paid off the instalments due on the land, because of the perfection of the company's organization and its sympathetic treatment of the settlers. Yet when the Government resumed part of the company's estate, and subdivided it for closer settlement, the majority of the settlers who were put on the land by the Government asked for extended payments, and are in a chronic state of impecuniosity. The panacea for our troubles is not Government interference, but rather abstention of Governments from interfering. The proposed remission of taxation will cost the Treasury £400,000, and next year the Treasurer will have to cut his coat more in accordance with his cloth. </para>

                        <para>.- I shall support the amendment, and if -it is not carried I shall vote against the Bill. In my opinion, as during a given period we have accumulated a surplus of over £6,000,000, and during the same period have -increased our national debt by over £400,000,000, it is wrong for the Govern" ment to use the 'accumulated surplus to try to. influence electors on the eve of an election. The proper business procedure would be to use the spare money we have in reducing our debts. The last  speaker  said that Government and private finance was conducted on opposite principles. I do not think that the Treasurer, in the conduct of his private affairs, if he had a bank overdraft and had also in hand accumulated profits, would give these back to his customers; he would be more likely to use his profits to reduce his overdraft. What the honorable gentleman now proposes; to Parliament,, however,, is that instead of reducing: our national debt we shall remit taxation . While- listening to the honorable gentleman' s Budget speech, I was reminded of the story in the Old Book of Jacob and Esau. When Isaac's sight had become: dim. by reason of age, andi his. life could not. last much longer; he, according, to custom, determined to give his blessing to his eldest son. He, therefore, called Esau to him, and sent him out hunting to obtain venison to make savoury meat, which was to. be brought to him,, when he would bestow his blessing on the hunter. But the old man evidently had two wives, and the younger wife, overhearing. the instruction to Esau,, told her son Jacob to take a kid of the flock and bring, it to her to be dressed. This he did. He was then told by his mother- to take the savoury meat to his father., his mother adding,, " I. will put the skin of the animal round your wrists so that you may be taken for your brother, who is a hairy, man." Jacob, thus disguised, went to his father, who being suspicious, asked, " Art thou my very son Esau? Jacob replied, "I am." But the old man's doubts had not been entirely removed,, because, he added, " The voice is the voice of : Jacob, but . the hand' is the hand of Esau." When I heard the Budget proposals I could not help- applying that saying of Isaac. It seemed- to me that the voice, was " Stanley's" voice, but that the hand was the hand of ''Billy." The Treasurer is one of the smartest business men in this House,, and his Budget statement was presented with a systematic clearness- that was creditable,  to   him ; but I do not believe: the. honorable member to be so steeped; in political cunning, and so forgetful of his business training that: he has of his. own initiative proposed to use the surplus that has been accumulated during a period, of years, by spending it to catch votes in this direction, and in that. </para>

                            <para>- I am glad to have the honorable member's indorsement, and I wish I could say the same of him. Any honorable member who says that it would be wise on our part to reduce the national debt rather than to try to purchase votes at election time by reducing taxation is talking common sense. There are some persons who  do not care how great the national debt is. I am not one of those. I heard the honorable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wienholt)</inline> say that if he held the same views as the honorable member for Barrier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Considine)</inline> he would appreciate the Treasurer doing as he now proposes, but that if we did not do something to limit the national debt Ave  would gradually approach a condition in which chaos would reign and Bolshevism would be possible. I have heard some men amongst the rank and file of my own party say, " Why should the working class worry about the national debt? It does not affect us." But, as a representative of the workers, I say that any man who thinks that the increase of the national debt does not have its effect upon the lower-paid producers is blind to facts and the lessons of experience. I have given my first reason for opposition to this Bill. To my mind it is . unbusinesslike to use the accumulated surplus for vote-catching when we have a large national debt hanging over us. I have looked through the different proposals for the remission of taxation, and I say, without hesitation, that there are only two that I would countenance in any way or vote for. I would have been prepared to vote to increase the income tax exemption to £200, because I regard that concession as proper, in view of the decreased purchasing power of the sovereign. I would have voted also for the reduction of the duty on wire, wire-netting, and other articles required by the primary producers, but I would not have, voted for any of the other proposals indicated by the Treasurer, not even the reduction of the entertainment tax. I look upon entertainments as a luxury, and in. our present financial position I am . not prepared to support any reduction of the tax upon them. These attempts at vote catching </para>

                            <para>- We. should call a -spade a spade. Even the sparrows on the housetops are chirping about the Treasurer's viote-catching expedients. In conversation with some of the Liberal members of the Victorian Parliament at breakfast 'this morning they admitted the vote-catching purpose of the Budget. Looking through the proposed remissions in detail, I find that the increase of the income tax exemption to £200 is estimated to mean a loss of £600,000 in revenue. That loss can be put down as a benefit to the . needy. In regard to the 10 per cent, reduction in income taxation, I allot £150,000 of that as a grant to the needy, but £1,150,000 will go to those who are comparatively wealthy. The reduction of 3d . in the £1 on the flat rate of income tax on companies is decidedly a gift of £200,000 to the wealthy. The abolition of the . surcharge on the land tax on estates of over £5,000 unimproved value is certainly another grant of £400,000 to the wealthy. The entertainments tax is a grant of £100,000 to the needy. The reduction of Customs duties on galvanized iron, wire, and wire netting means a gift of £250,000 to those who are needy and £100,000 <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> those who are. wealthy. The greater advantage of that concession will go to the struggling farmers, but some percentage will certainly go to the wealthy squatters. The bounty to local manufacturers of those goods, estimated to amount to £250,000, is a grant to the wealthy. </para>

                            <para>- That is not so. In anticipation of some such charge being made against me during election time, I have looked through my votes on the Tariff, and I find that on thirty-one different occasions I voted with the Country party against heavy duties, being practically the only Labour member to do so. In fact, I have been accused by some honorable members of my own party of trying to " crayfish " away from the Labour party, with the object of joining the Country party, because I voted with the Country party so often on the Tariff. Summarizing the vote-buying grants, a total of £1,100,000 will go to the needy, and £2,100,000 . will go to the wealthy people of the community. Even if the whole of the remissions were to go to . the needy, I would still question the wisdom of this policy when we have , such a large national debt, but when two- thirds of the surrendered revenue is to . revert to the wealthy people, a bad example of class legislation is . being set by those who axe always urging that the Labour (party exists to legislate for one class only. </para>

                    <para>I come now to my second reason for opposing the Bill. In his second-reading -speech last night the Treasurer said that the surcharge on the land tax had not ;been imposed for the purpose of breaking up large estates, but for war purposes. I believe in large estates being taxed for that very purpose. The party to which I belong has on its platform a plank for land taxation on unimproved values, with a £5,000 exemption. That is not a bad lump, because I can safely say that £5,000 unimproved value is at least equal to £8,000 actual value. </para>

                            <para>- If a man had land worth -even £100,000, but it was mortgaged to the extent of, say, £40,000, he should not pay taxation on £100,000 but on £60,000. The Labour party'3 exemption of £5,000 unimproved value, which is equal to, at least, £8,000 actual value, allows a man to hold free of taxation sufficient land on which to make a Hiving, and as much as he can reasonably -work. We desire that those men who want land on which to settle shall be -able to obtain it. As far as is practicable, no man should hold more land than he can profitably utilize, and if a man has larger areas than he can profitably work, it is quite right to try, by means of a graduated land tax, to break up his estate so that others may use it, and obtain the fulness thereof. I remind the Country party that, after all, the break-  ing up of big estates is in the best  interests  of country people. I know of what has occurred in country towns in my own electorate. Not long ago I was in the very pretty town of Nairn, and heard a complaint that the land was gradually getting back into the hands of a few big holders. That is regrettable retrogression. Behind the town of Angaston is the magnificent tract of land owned by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Angas,</inline> some of the finest land in South Australia. </para>

The railway, which comes to a dead-end there, has recently had its services limited; but if the land behind the town were cut up it would serve to make the line profitable, so that the service could  be  more frequent, and thus, as well as by population increase, the interests of the business people in the town would be considerably benefited. Recently when I was cycling past that very fine mansion occupied by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Angas,</inline> I saw a beautiful flock of deer in front of the edifice. But I would rather have seen the land in the hands of many families, and dear little children, instead of deer, playing about. I am certain that the breaking up of big estates would benefit the country people themselves, and I sometimes wonder why the Country party seem to be opposed to that process. </para>

One man I have in my mind has taken it into his head that he will go on the land, and that is the course he has pursued. </para>

                            <para>- It does not show anything of the kind. But if this man holds his land a little longer, and increases his area a little more, when the Labour party is returned to power, and imposes a stiffer graduated tax on estates of over £5,000 unimproved value, unless he chooses' to work his property it will be unprofitable, and will revert to the hands of the smaller man, who will make full use of it. </para>

                            <para>- I am fighting the battle of the small men. I have ridden across the Murray flats towards Blanchetown for nearly 20 miles, and mile after mile have passed deserted farm houses where people have lived and been starved out. There are times in the dry periods when the settlers on the eastern side of the Lofty Ranges have hard times, and have been starved off. It was not that they were not game. I remember one man telling me that for two months he had to live on rabbits and pollard in order to hold on to land where many others would not have gone. </para>

Some considerable time ago I noticed in the daily press that the honorable member for Corangamite <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gibson)</inline> had waited upon him and asked for a reduction of this- taxation because it was oppressive to some' of the big landholders of Victoria.

                            <para>- Yes, and as the Labour party's proposal for breaking- up big estates comes more fully into operation it will be more closely populated still. I could give the names- of the holders of these fifteen estates of over 20,000 acres. One estate contains 52.879 acres. Why should the Labour party dare to ask a- man owning 52.879 acres of fertile Victorian land to pay a heavy land tax ? When men were asked to go to Europe to fight we were repeatedly told, that they were going abroad to protect Australia. What objection can this man, who owns 52,879 acres: raise when he is asked to help to&gt; bear some- of the burden of the war which lies behind us? Because no one can- say that the main burden of the war is past. Financially it is not past. As a matter of fact -we are now carrying a heavier burden of national debt than when the war was actually in progress, and- if it was found necessary during the days of the war' to- call upon the propertyoHnera by this sur-tam to pay some thing for the protection of their property, it is equally justifiable to do so to-day. The Treasurer in an inters iection. when the Leader- of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> was speaking, said that the incidence of the tax on land was unfair, inasmuch as land was the only property carrying this impost, the inference being that- if it was fair that the owner of land property should pay for its protection, the owner' of property of all- kinds should, also pay for their protection. If the Treasurer is game enough to bring down any proposal to call upon all property in Australia, whether my bit be included or not, to pay for- its, protection, I shall help him, as I think others should be prepared to do. This- is  not electioneering tactics on my part; it is not vote-buying stuff, that I am talking now. It does not gain votes to say that taxation is. necessary; but it is a sound and business-like proposal. Property protected during the war should pay for its protection, whether in the shape of land or anything else. If the Treasurer is prepared to bring down any proposal to make property in every form pay for its protection I am ready to help him. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister's interjection when the Leader of the Opposition: was speaking was that it was unfair, that property in the shape of land should have to pay this direct taxation while other property was  not expected to do so. The Leader of the Opposition, formed the impression, that the Treasurer believed that all property- should pay its share, but as the Treasurer immediately contradicted him, I am not trying to say that he has declared that all property should pay for its share of protection. In fact, I would not expect such a statement from the Minister or from any member of his party, but still j.t would be a business-like and proper proposal. I remember the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> saying only recently that, for every block of land there are hundreds of applicants. Quite so; and if we make it easier for people to hold big, areas of land,, we shall still have hundreds of applicants. This Bill is a. step- in- the wrong direction, in that it; lightens the burdens on those who hold property over the £5,000 unimproved vaJue mark. I notice- that the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> raises the figure to £20,000 so far as relief from the sur-tax is  concerned. Evidently that honorable gentleman thinks that the tax is,, perhaps, a. burden on some of those whom- I shall not call small landlords; but, rather, the middle landlords. I shall support the amendment, but, personally, I would prefer to see the Bill nejected. As ito the attitude of some members of 'the Country party- </para>

                            <para>- I do not mind what name £hat party takes to itself, because, after all, while a name may count a little in politics, it does not count for much otherwise. I do not wish to be thought hostile to the Country party, for such has never been my attitude towards it. I do not share the feelings of some of my fellow members in this regard, because mine, I admit, are . friendly. At the same time, I do not think there is any need for a Country party, becausetheLabour party has looked after, and will still look after, the interest of, at any rate, the smaller men -on the land. Our difficulty at the present time, owing to the camouflage and " poison gas " of "the capitalistic press, is to persuade the smaller man that it does not matter whether he works in the factory or in the field, he is exploited, and that it is to his interest, in either case, to combine against those who exploit him. if some of the rural population think they ought to have a Country party, I do not quarrel with them on that account. Personally, I should like to see the Labour party and the Country party representing . those sections of the people that are exploited, together endeavouring to overcome the "intereststhatexploit them. </para>

                    <para>Looking at this measure, I wonder why honorable members opposite are so " keen on it." I am afraid that the honorable member if orGrampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett)</inline> will regard what I am going to say as uncharitable. All the members of the Country party are not 'farmers in the ordinary sense of the word ; they do not all  belong to what may 'be called the farming class. The 'honorable member forGrampians himself is one . -of the largest landholders in Australia; and 1 can quite understand that his natural sympathy with the large landholding class makes him willing to support this proposed reduction of taxation. Then there is the honorable anemiber 'for 2few Englamd <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hay).</inline> In the Melbourne Herald of yesterday I noticed the photograph of the honorable gentleman,whowas described as one of the "Beef Barons," which means that he is the holder of a good deal of land. Hie -sympathies, too, are with the big land-holders, and;therefore, he is naturally in favour of the Government's measure. I listened . attentively to the speech of the honorable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wienholt),</inline> iaud what I gathered is . that 3ie is not altogether in favour of the proposal as 'introduced. If that be so, I am pleased ito -know that he can . rise above <inline font-weight="bold">Ms Burrouoiddngs.</inline> . and, perhaps, above his personal . interests. But he, ttoo, is a large land-holder. As to the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse),</inline> I do not know how true it maybe, but I have heard that his returns from wheat alone last year Tan into several thousands of pounds. I am glad the honorable member makes such good use of his land, and if all land-holders did the same, we 'should have a much more kindly feeling towards them. Now I come to the  Deputy  Leader of the Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fleming),</inline> whom I have heard speak with a good deal of knowledge regarding cattle and so forth, conveying the impression that he also ow.ns a fair lump of land, and is not a farmer in the ordinary sense of the word. "Some members of the Country party have interests which naturally make them 'regard with favour this proposal of the 'Government. I remind honorable members again 'that a farmer who has a number of sons, and a farm only big enough to keep himself, -desires !laud for those sons. The Old Book has said that . no man can serve two masters; and -we cannot serve both the squatter and the : small farmer -at any : rate, in the settled areas. If honorable members have to choose in the future between serving -the squatter and serving the farmer, I hope they will turn their attention 'to the small -farmer, 'because the one in need is the one -who needs the friend. If the farmers do -not vote 'for the party on this side, then 'they look to the members of the 'Country party, and it is for the Country party to do its duty by them. If incomes to a -.clash between the interests of . the squatter and the interests of the farmer - if it means an increased tax on estates over £5,000 unimproved value, . for the purpose of smashing the big estates wp in order to provide land for farmers' sons - we should, look after the interests . of the small man, for the big man can well look afterhimself. </para>

                        <para>T5.30]. - The Government cannot accept :the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton).</inline> I am surprised at the form that the amendment has taken, for I believe that the "Leader of the Opposition, at all events, has a real sense of justice. Holding that view, I cannot understand how the party which he leads can be iu favour of retaining this tax in its present form. I can understand and sympathize, even if I do not agree, with the views of honorable members opposite in connexion with heavy land taxation designed to break up estates and promote the establishment of small holdings throughout Australia. But the tax in its present form is not designed, and was never intended, to do that ; it was designed, so far as the surcharge is concerned, as a revenue measure pure and simple. That being the position, it seems very unjust to use the tax for a purpose for which it was never intended, and without giving to what is probably the most difficult question we can be faced with, the consideration to which it is entitled. If we are going to tax land progressively in order to break up estates, the matter is one to which we must give the greatest consideration, and, in order to get results, what we do must be done scientifically. Whatever may be said for such taxation, the taxation with which we are now dealing was intended, as I have said, purely and simply to be a revenue measure. For that reason, at the earliest possible moment, the Government have taken steps to remove it, and place the land tax in the position it occupied before this extra revenue charge was imposed. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>With the question of the land tax as it is, I do not propose to deal at the present moment. I may say that, personally, I have always believed that this tax is one more suitable for the activities of the States; and it will undoubtedly have to be considered in the future, whether it cannot be left for the States to handle and control. At this moment, however, the financial position is such that the Commonwealth cannot contemplate any action being taken other than to adjust this one inequity, which is thrown on one particular class of property, as against property of every other sort. </para>
                    <para>The point has been raised as to whether this is the time, and whether we are yet in a position to remit this tax. I listened very carefully to what the hon.orable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wienholt)</inline> said, and I see clearly his point of view. The facts on their face are as he stated - that when the Government remits this taxation the revenue we shall collect during the current year will not equal the expenditure. That is the way in which the honorable member presented the matter, and I quite agree that is the position. The idea, almost the principle - in fact, it is a principle - that the revenue has to balance the expenditure is one of the soundest, and one which it is necessary we should follow in regard to the whole of the finances of the Commonwealth. We have followed that principle. The revenue for the present year, which we would have been entitled to collect if a measure of taxation relief had not been decided upon, would have been sufficient to cover all the expenditure contemplated, and to leave us with a margin of some £500,000. That was the basis on which the Budget was framed. ' Now we are faced with the possession of an accumulated surplus. In the Budget statement I made clear that there were three things which we could do with that surplus. First, we could retain it as a sort of safety fund against future possibilities. Such a procedure must be ruled out, however. It  appears to have become somewhat of a current practice in Australian finances to hold surpluses indefinitely, to protect the Governments concerned against emergencies. I emphasize the fact that that is an unsound principle. Governments are entitled to take only so much money as they require, and to retain only so much money as they need to carry on public services. The second method of employing the surplus would have been to redeem public debt. It would be sound finance to do so. It would prove, probably, the best way in which we could direct the amount of surplus at this stage. But there are other considerations which must be weighed. Provided that something else can be done with the surplus, which is also sound and proper, I hold that the Government are entitled to consider which course may confer the greatest benefit upon the country as a whole. To have employed the surplus in the reduction of loans would have  benefited the Commonwealth only very slightly. The surplus is so small that it could have afforded but little ease in respect of our interest bill and sinking fund. I repeat, therefore, that while it would have been a sound and useful policy to place the £6,000,000 of surplus in reduction of our debt, such a policy would have been quixotic. I say that, in the light of the fact that the Government are taking steps to place our whole policy of debt redemption on a proper basis, and to bring about the redemption within a -reasonable period; and that, in considering the sinking fund, every care has been taken concerning the extent of the burden which should be borne by the present generation of taxpayers, and by those to follow. The first alternative - of holding the surplus indefinitely as a species of security fund - could, and would, have been very properly challenged; and the second, while it would have been proper, would, I repeat, have been only slightly beneficial. There is nothing so calculated to retard progress, particularly in a young country which does not possess great accumulated wealth, as is burdensome taxation. The Government are wide awake to the fact that, if we can only reduce the burden, we shall be doing something to benefit every class in the community. We shall be stimulating trade development ; we shall be giving inspiration to every class of venture likely to advance our ' country. After the fullest consideration, therefore, the Government have come to the conclusion that the very best results would flow to the Commonwealth, as a whole, if a beginning were made in the reduction of taxation. Such a course, I emphasize, would have the immediate effect of promoting and stimulating industry. It would have a still greater influence in the direction of restoring confidence, and in encouraging the view throughout the world that Australian finances are tending - towards lighter taxation. I mention that factor because it would be bound to attract the best type of settlement to our shores. We would certainly invest some of the money of the world which, to-day, is crying out for investment. </para>
                    <para> We have heard a lot about the Budget being merely an electioneering announcement. Such criticism is inevitable, and, one might almost say, necessary. The political opponents of the Government of the day have always a duty to perform. Their task is to demonstrate that anything and everything which a Government may do is wrong. I make no complaint, therefore. I do assert, however, that the remissions which the Government are proposing are all based on sound economic principles. When the House is dealing with the Budget I shall take every such proposal and state the reasons which have influenced the Government and the principles underlying our policy. Whatever may be in the minds of those who say that the Budget is a purely electioneering business, honorable members may accept the assurance that no such consideration was in my mind. The Treasurer of a country must always recognise that whatever is proposed or undertaken by the Government is bound to materially affect the outlook and welfare of the people, and he must frame his Budget proposals without any consideration other than that of national advantage. A Minister of the Crown would need to possess courage, indeed, if he sought to do things which he believed to be wrong merely in order to gain political advantages. </para>
                    <para>I do not wish to labour the matter, but rather reckless accusations have been made, and they have come from quarters which have surprised me. I have indicated why the Government decided to grant certain remissions of taxation, and would now point out that, having come to such a decision, they had to decide upon some definite amount of remission. It would be futile to remit taxation to-day if it must be reimposed during the next financial year. The Government have had no such thought in mind as to grant merely temporary relief. A definite amount was decided upon only after the closest investigation concerning .what we believed we could do in the future, and only because we felt sure that such remissions as we might make to-day would not have to be reimposed later. There is nothing in the suggestion, therefore, of " one more <inline font-style="italic">encore,</inline> :and what will happen?" The honorable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wienholt)</inline> said he believed that what I had in mind as the main factor in making it unnecessary &gt;to reimpose these taxes next year was that the remissions would so stimulate trade and enterprise that there would be an increase of revenue. I agree that such may and should 'be the outcome. I am mot relying upon that, however, finch a -consideration is not the only one which has presented itself &gt;to me. The principal factor is that I believe the Government will be able to reduce 'expenditure. There are limits to the pruning capabilities of a Treasurer. It is absurd to argue that things may be 'done which cannot be done. Nothing has yet been advanced to seriously challenge my assertion that I have done all I could. No one has indicated a direction in which I might have done -more. Inevitably, my opportunities for seeing what may be done to bring about savings are greater than 'those of any other member of this House. I have taken good care to examine every suggestion for economy without causing complete disorganization and dislocation of the public services. I believe that very substantial reductions can be made in expenditure during the present year; and, in the Budget, the Government have made a notable beginning. The expenditure out of revenue foi: the current year is estimated at £62,000,000, as against £65,000,000 'last year. Certain persons quarrelled with that announcement when I first made it. I admit that the whole of the reductions which have been effected were not due to action solely on the part of the Government. I have never made any such pretence. Certain savings 'have been made because our war obligations 'have been rendered lighter. Our pensions bill has been decreased, for example. But in the Departments .themselves, and in respect of new works, very material reductions have been effected-fdr a 'beginning. There is Opportunity, however, for 'Considerable -further economies. These 'can be brought about gradually, steadily, and systematically. Honorable members who persist in -saying that I should get to 'work 'and chop things about with an axe, without consideration for results, are merely talking loosely. I do not propose to be driven into 'any stupid action. I shall 'try ito 'bring 'a!boTit 'reductions -which I  believe may be practicable. That is the main consideration underlying nhc conclusion -of the Government 'that the remission of taxation under review can be 'safely brought about, and may be regarded as permanent. We believe that we shall be able to balance our accounts for the coming financial year, mainly because of definite reductions which can be secured. I repeat that, to some extent, we will be able to rely upon increased revenue. </para>
                    <para>Another very natural criticism which iiii-ay 'be levelled against the Government is that we have an .amount &gt;of nearly £7,000,000 in hand by way of surplus, and are dealing -with it in -two ways. It might be said, " You .are holding some of it, and are spending the balance on the remission of taxation. You should follow some definite principle." I frankly admit .that the Government is not following the principle that I have enunciated ; it is retaining part of the surplus. We think that until there is more certainty as to the future, that until we are convinced that our expenditure cannot be brought lower, and know that we shall have a fixed revenue, we must retain some of the surplus. The honorable member , for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wieriholt)</inline> said that we were -eating our 'emergency -ra- , tion. That- is not so. We <inline font-style="italic">-time</inline> holding some of the surplus until -we have more certainty regarding the -futusne.. We (do not propose "to use the whole of it for "the reduction of taxation, because we cannot yet know that if we spend &gt;the' whole of the surplus in that way we may not have to reimpose some of 'the taxation &gt; remitted. We have proposed to -remit .as much taxation -as we think it safe -to remit, and intend to hold the balance of our -surplus. That, however, is not .the practice we wish to follow- in the future. For the moment we can .justify it, but so soon as we can foresee the future more clearly we should balance our Budget each year, and take from the people only the amount necessary for the services of the country. I have .gone a little into matters properly pertaining to a Budget debate, but I have done so because of the anxiety in the minds of some honorable 'members, particularly the honorable member for Moreton. It is -only fair, when we are 'bringing in 'one of the measures to give effect to  Mie  Budget proposals, that I should indicate 'the ' point of view of the Government. I must not be taken to have dealt in any sense with Budget 'criticisms; 'the stage -a't which I propose to do that is when the Budget debate is resumed. I have merely given honorable members this- afternoon information, which may assist them, in dealing, with this measure. We. cannot: accept, the amendment, and I urge the House not. to entertain the proposal of the Leader of the Opposition, which would partly remit the surcharge on land and leave it a burden, on other land-holders. This surcharge is either a. revenue charge, running through the whole scale of landholding, or it is something entirely different. We know that when it was proposed in 1918 it was made as clear as it is possible to make anything that it was neither more nor less than a revenue charge. </para>

                        <para>.- I have listened with interest to the speech of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce),</inline> and I received pleasure from his clear explanations and his apparent frankness1. He has told us that the surcharge which he proposes. to&gt; remit was imposed to get revenue, for war expenditure, and that it is not fair to continue to levy it.. I should, like to know why. Has the scene changed in a manner justifying the remission of land taxation.* to the amount of £400,0.0.0? If it has, the honorable gentleman would, have made out. his case. This surcharge was imposed in 19.18, towards, the; end of the war, because, our finances required the money that it would, bring in. Do our finances not require that money now <inline font-style="italic">t</inline> Was there ever, a time in our history when we were more urgently in need of money? The public debt of Australia has increased, by millions since this surcharge was imposed, and is getting higher every year. The Treasurer laid it down as a principle that revenue should balance expenditure. With that I entirely agree. He said that the Government had provided for such a balancing; but that is not so.. In the Budget the honorable gentleman estimated for 1922-23 an expenditure of £62,000,000 and a revenue of £59,000,000, allowing- for the remission of the taxes that it is proposed to remit. These taxes produce about £3,200,000, and' if that sum is deducted from his estimate of revenue for the current year it is brought down to £59,318,000. </para>

He proceeded to say that we have to deal with an accumulated surplus, and he examined three methods of dealing with it.

                            <para>- It is extraordinary that business men when they have entered public life should repudiate their own methods. Business men who hold  themselves up- as models to the politicians repudiate, as soon as they come to handle- the people.'s money, the business' principles which they say are sound in private finance.' The Treasurer said that the second manner in which the surplus could be dealt, with was to use it to redeem part of our loans,, and he rightly remarked that that would be the soundest business proposition. The people, therefore, will naturally ask. why he has not proposed that course, and why,, in. the circumstances, we are chided because we think that the action the Government -are taking is influenced by the, near approach of the elections. The Treasurer says it would be quixotic to use a 'surplus of £6,000,000 in reducing, our indebtedness, because the reduction would be so small. Within the. next three years, something over £200,000,000 of loans fall due in Australia, taking together the Federal and State indebtedness. Next year about £70,000,000 of Federal loans fall due. The Treasurer, could go into the market and buy war bonds, which would return over 6 per cent. on the investment. Yet it has been given, as a reason why the Government should not hold a surplus that the money would be lying idle. </para>

                            <para>- That is the effect of what the honorable member said  in  his Budget speech. He spoke of it as a large unemployed surplus. If the £6,000,000 surplus were used to buy back 4½ per cent, stock, which, quite wrongly, was issued free of income tax, there would be a return of 6 to 6¼ per cent., say, £400,000 per annum, on the investment, and the Government would be able to tax the income which it had replaced. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, in reducing the rate of interest for future loans, and in steadying the money market. From a business point of view, it would be better if the Government, instead of remitting taxation here and there in order to placate various sections of the community, used its surplus to reduce its indebtedness. It has been said that, by lifting the burdens from the shoulders of commerce, we shall stimulate industry. Every one knows that that is the effect of remitting taxation; but this surcharge on land taxation which it is proposed to remit on the ground that it was a war charge, is not the only war charge. There is a war charge on postage, and that it is not proposed to remit, though if you cheapen postage you do more to stimulate commerce than you do by remitting land taxation. This Government has done something that I did not think any Government would do. When the Fisher Government introduced the Australian Notes Act in 1910 it provided that the profits from the investment of the moneys received from the issue of notes should never be used for revenue purposes, but that a Trust Fund should be created for the redemption of the notes when necessary, and for the reduction of the national debt. The issue of paper money for the purpose of making profits for revenue has always been held, to be one of the . most unsound propositions that any Government could undertake, and the Fisher Government, when establishing the Australian Notes Fund, rightly and deliberately laid down a provision that none of the profits from the note issue should be utilized to relieve a needy Treasurer, or to enable him to build up a surplus. And never until the present Government put their hand on it was that Trust Fund touched. From 1910 the fund was regarded as sacred, until 1920, when the Government laid hands upon it, taking in that year, £394,016; and during the last financial year, £1,261,482 ; during the current financial year they estimate to take another £1,150,000. The accumulated profits of the Notes Fund up till December, 1920, were £7,780,524, and that money had been used solely for the redemption of Government Inscribed Stock, but in December, 1920, without warning, the principle underlying the Australian Notes Fund was tampered with. No financial authority in the world will say that it is sound finance to take money from Trust Funds into revenue, and claim by that means to balance the ledger. </para>

                            <para>- And rightly so. The Treasurer says that he is balancing the ledger during the current financial year. Is he balancing the ledger when he budgets for an estimated expenditure from revenue of £62,000,000, and a revenue of only £59,000,000, making a fictitious balance, by taking money from the accumulated surplus and the pensions Trust Fund. No business man would say that he was balancing his yearly account if he was drawing upon his bank balance in order to make the revenue equal expenditure. What will happen when this accumulated surplus is exhausted? What form of taxation will be re-imposed ? The Treasurer sought to anticipate that question, because he said that if the remission of taxation were not to be permanent, it would be foolish and wrong to undertake it. Before the Government proposed to remit taxation, they should have indicated to the people how they propose to reduce expenditure in order to allow the remission to be permanent. They have not done that, but the Treasurer said that the remitted tax will certainly not be re-imposed. Where is the certainty? Where in the Budget is there any indication that the taxation will not be re-imposed ? He quoted the honorable member for Balaclava, who said, "One <inline font-style="italic">encore</inline> of this, and what then?" I repeat the question - one <inline font-style="italic">encore</inline> of this remission of taxation, and what will hap  pen afterwards? Half of the £6,000,000 surplus has been taken this year in order to build up a balance. What will the Government do next year? Probably, they will take the remainder; and then? Of course, by that time the elections will be over. Is there any indication that this remission will be permanent? The Treasurer says that he relies upon a reduction of expenditure, but he has not given us any inkling as to where expenditure is to be reduced. One would be somewhat hopeful that there was some project in the mind of this very careful Treasurer if he had said no more, but he continued, "As proof that there will be a reduction of expenditure in the future, we have already effected substantial reductions in the expenditure for the current year." He said that the expenditure out of revenue had been decreased. That is perfectly true, but the reduction has been made up by increasing the expenditure out of loan funds on items that ought not to 'be paid for out of loan money. Quite a number of items appear in the Loan Bill which this House passed recently that no sound financier would say should be paid for out of loan funds. Amongst them are amounts for relief works for the unemployed, and for rabbit destruction, and £200,000 for assisted passages to immigrants. These items are surely not expenditure that should be paid out of loan.- Although the Government have decreased expenditure out of revenue, they have increased the expenditure from loan so much above the figures for the previous year that the combine/! expenditure from revenue and loan shows a net increase of £1,344,188 over the expenditure for last year. </para>

                            <para>- The expenditure was incurred by the present Government, and the Treasurer must share the responsibility. Although I was not- in Parliament last year, I followed the proceedings very closely, and I never heard of a more determined attempt by Parliament to take control of the Treasury than that which was witnessed in this House during last session. The Budget debate bristled with crises, and this House, by deliberate and determined votes, instructed the Government to cut down the proposed expenditure by £500,000. In spite of that, the Government spent £1,000,000 more than they were authorized to spend. </para>

                    <para>In the Bill now before us, it is proposed to remit £400.,000 from estates of over £5,000 unimproved value. There is this to be said for the proposal submitted by the Leader of the Opposition : The 20 per cent, tax was a fiat rate imposed alike upon the comparatively small land-holder and: the large land-holder, quite inconsistently with the system of graduated taxation which has been the policy of this Parliament for twelve years. And so we shall get nearer to some form of graduation if we provide, as the Leader of the Opposition suggests, that estates of over, £20,000 in value shall not get the benefit of the proposed remission. The honorable member for Angas made a very fine speech this afternoon in regard to the breaking up of large estates. </para>

                            <para>- In any case, South Australia is not the Commonwealth. I am not very familiar with that State, but if there is one State of the Commonwealth in which there should be no large estates and no land monopoly, but where there should be close settlement and intense cultivation, it is Victoria, the smallest State of the mainland. Yet in that State, which is well served with railways, we have instances of land monopoly. According to the latest statistics, there were in Victoria fifteen estates of over 20,000 acres each, . some of them extending to 50,000 and 60,000 acres. Honorable members talk about an immigration policy and the settlement of people upon the land, but nobody can justify estates of 20,000 to 60,000 acres in a* State like Victoria. They may be justified for many years to come in the north-west of Western Australia or in the Northern Territory, but not in a compact State like Victoria with a good system of roads and railways.

I know the State of Victoria well, and I visited the Wi'mioera. during the last three months. I made inquiries at Warracknabeal, Murtoa, and Horsham regarding a number of friends I had met there fourteen years ago. They were all gone. I asked what had. become of their properties. They are not lying idle. Those men who had 600-acre holdings sold out to neighbours, who also had 600 acres, and to-day the latter are cultivating 1,200 acres of wheat country, and doing very well. They have improved the methods of cultivation, working the bigger areas, with bigger teams, and we have this paradoxical result that the richer the farmers! become the fewer they become. There is no such person as a poor mail' in the' wheat belt; scarcely one- farmer is without a motor car, and I was assured by a keen- financier in Warracknabeal that there was no longer any need for farmers to go to Melbourne to get loans from the banks and financial institutions. There is so- much money now available in the Wimmerai that any person who wishes to borrow for the purpose of commencing' or extending operations need not go outside of the district to get it. </para>

                    <para class="block">I have already pointed out that the effect of the operation of the land tax in its first years was to cut up large estates to the value of £22000,000. The Commissioner's report shows that even in anticipation of the imposition of the tax many large estates were cut up, and I know that this was true as regards, the electorate I was representing at that time. In the. meantime, however, the price, of wool has mounted, up, and. the increased, prosperity which has come to the wool, people and meat producers has. enabled them to pay the land tax as we did not anticipate they would be able to do.j and the fact that there is an aggregation of large estates despite the existence of the tax is only proof that the rate of the tax is not sufficiently high. As a matter of fact, the rate is high, but its incidence must be applied in a stiffer direction. Instead of the gradual curve upwards, the high rate should be levied on the whole of the higher valued estates, and . not only on a small portion of the value with a gradually reducing rate for the major portion of the value. If that were done, more large estates would be broken up. Unless land where there is a good rainfall' and railway communication is available is pub into cultivation this country of ours will never be what it ought to be. The proposal put forward by the Government to-day is to1 remit a tax on- wealthy landholders, not only in the country, but also in the city ; but whenever we ask- the Government to- increase the old-age- pensions to- £1 they meet us with the- argument that there is no money available, and that it would cost £1,500,000' to do what we suggest. They, could increase the rate of the pension by 2s. 6d. per week by utilizing for the purpose the taxation they now propose to remit to the large land-holders. Whenever we go to the Department of Repatriation to get something like generous or sympathetic treatment, for returned soldiers-, we find technicalities raised, probably as a result of instructions from the Government that the Department must economize. Cases have been cited here to-day, and I could multiply therm. I mention the case of a man who was taken into one of the camps of Victoria, and has developed acute rheumatism to such an extent that a surgeon has- advised the amputation of. his toes. Every joint is swollen as a. result of the night duty he performed in the camp, but, because two years before he had entered the camp he had suffered for a fortnight from rheumatism, the Department hold that his trouble is not due to war-like operations, but has been caused by a preexisting ailment. </para>

SCULLLN.-I thank the honor able member;but I . have ho i desire ito prolong the -debate, tin the face of the financial position ..of this country, as disclosed by theBudget - 'that . -there 'will be a, deficit of nearly .  £3,000,000 on this . year is operations, taking revenue against -expenditure.; . that the loan indebtedness of the Commonwealth is being piled . up -by issue after issue; that the loan issues -for the coming year . will -be £3, -000., 0.00 more than was 'raised last year, and that the interest bill 'on our indebtediness is becoming a 'burden to the  people - surely this is "not 'a "time for "remitting taxation "unless it 'is "to "be squared by a reduction : in expenditure. And this the . Treasurer has not shown. He has told us that -substantial 'reductions in expenditure ha.ve 'been made for the "coming year, 'but - -the figures . -are against him, because there is an actual increase of £1,344,000. Furthermore, this Government and its Treasurer have done something which no other Federal Government has attempted, something which violates every principle of sound . finance - they . have laid hands  07i  the fund accumulated from the interest 'earned on the notes issue. I was in this Parliament when the Australian Notes Act was passed, and I listened to the able criticism of the 'present Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene),</inline> when -he predicted the calamity that would follow if a needy Treasurer should get 'his hands on to the accumulated fund.

Not one penny received -from the issue of the notes was to be put into revenue; mor were any of the profits derived from the investment of the fund to be available for ordinary revenue purposes. In fact, this policy was almost accepted as an article of faith by every honorable member. No one insisted -on it more than did 'the present Minister for Defence . But, lo! we find' that sums have been. 'taken from this fund. I have been nine years out of public life, but I have followed Budgets closely. I confess, however, that I did 'not discover that these funds were being clipped into for general revenue purposes "until I heard the honorable member for Balaclava criticising the last Budget. I had been busy attending to 'other matters, but when I heard the 'honorable member, I examined the Financial Statement, and found that from December, 1920, the Government had started to dip into the Australian Notes Fund, which I consider should be regarded as sacred so far as expenditure from, revenue . is concerned.

                            <para>- The remission of entertainments taxation was a very small matter, amounting to about only £100,000, and it affects only the small-priced tickets, such as those the children buy for the weekly matinees. However, the Treasurer is doing his work so well for the wealthy classes that those people who made huge profits out of the war, and the great land monopolists, are being relieved of taxation to the extent of £2,500,000. On the other hand, the relief afforded to the workers and the poorer classes amounts to only £700,000. This relief of £2,500,000 given to the . wealthy classes is at the expense of the surplus Trust Fund, which was set aside for the purpose of paying invalid and old-age pensions; and this fund is being robbed by the measure before us to the extent of £400,000 in order to relieve the large land-holders of their share of the cost of the Great War. </para>

                    <para>The Treasurer has told us that this taxation, which it is now proposed to remove, was imposed merely for the. purpose of meeting war costs - as a war measure. But I ask honorable members whether the great burden of the war expenditure has yet been taken off the shoulders of the people of this country. Why is it that people who own vast, estates are relieved from paying their share of the cost of the war? The war was fought just as much to protect the land monopolists as to protect anybody else. We have no right to relieve such people of their just debts. </para>
                    <para>I should like to give a few figures to show how the revenue derived from land taxation has been a diminishing quantity since the war years. These figures are from the Treasurer's own figures as published in the Budget-papers. In the year 1910-11 the revenue received from the Federal land tax was £1,525,129. I shall not go through the whole of the years, but "take 1910-11 only as the starting point. Going now to 1914-15, we find that the revenue in that year was £2,238,647; in 1915-16 it was £2,128,910; in 1916-17 it was £2,052,832- note the decrease; in 1917-18 it was £1,971,437. Now we come to the year when this particular impost which it is now sought to remit was sanctioned for the purpose of making the wealthy land-holders bear their fair share of the burden of the war. In 1918-19 the revenue received from the land tax was £2,229,595; in 1919-20 it was £2,241,061; in 1920-21 it was £1,867,005; and for the last financial year, 1921-22, it was £1,658,910. It will be seen that the amount collected in the last financial year was only a little over £100,000 more than the revenue received in 1910-11. </para>

                            <para>- Has there been any cutting up of large estates, say, from the year 1920 to the present year? The revenue derived from the land tax in round figures has fallen £500,000 in those two years. What is really happening is that the holders of huge estates are dividing them amongst the members of their families. The holders of these large estates are simply " farming " the land out, and thus avoiding their just dues to the country. Instead of relieving the. large holders we ought to increase the taxation, because if there is one thing from which Australia suffers more than another it is the locking up of the lands. I am surprised at members of the Country party supporting the Treasurer in this measure, seeing that they are supposed to represent the small man on the land. As a matter of fact the members of the Country party ought to be steadfastly opposing this measure. </para>

                            <para>- Honorable members will agree that the great problem in Australia is the land problem, and if it is not solved we can never progress. All this talk by the Treasurer and the Government of settling immigrants on the land is so much useless twaddle. The first thing to be done is to break up the large estates. Right throughout New South Wales, where there is some of the finest land that God ever created, we find beautiful country towns land-locked and stagnant because the octopus of land monopoly prevails. All this must be changed if. we are to make Australia a nation worthy of the name. I hope that those gentlemen in the corner who pose as the representatives of the small man on the land, and as the champions of the farmer, will do something practical to make land available for farmers and for the sons of farmers. On the one hand, there is the offer of the Treasurer to relieve the great landed monopolists of the burden of taxation, and on the other there is the insinuation - in fact, a threat - behind the announcement of the Treasurer that it will not be necessary for the Government to reimpose similar taxation next year. The Government, he says, will go in for a policy of judicious reductions, in regard to which, however, the time is not now ripe for their introduction. Of course not! The present moment is on the wrong side of  a  general election. Nevertheless, the warning has been issued. Public servants and the workers generally have been given a hint concerning the method by which the Government propose to make up the £400,000 of which the wealthy landowners  are  to be relieved. The Treasurer, in his Budget speech, said that owing to the necessity for a reduction, both inside and. outside the Public Service, he proposed to do so-and-so. I stress those ominous words. They contain the threat of which I speak : ' ' Owing to the necessity for a reduction, both inside and outside the Public Service. . . . " There is the source from which the Government are going to draw this lost money. The people who should bear the burden of taxation are those who can best afford to pay taxes- the wealthy classes, the landed monopolists, the company promoters - all those people who exploited the wives and children of our soldiers while they were away fighting for us. They are the people who should be called upon to bear more of the burden of taxation, than ever. They alone can afford to do so. Instead of being given relief, more and more should be heaped upon them. Their huge estates should be forcibly broken up by the weight of taxation, and from the additional revenue so  derived old-age and soldiers' pensions should be increased. But there is nomoney,we are told, to enable the Government to increase pensions. Here, however, isa dole of £400,000 for the land monopolists. The Treasurer is doing the 'work of his masters thoroughly well. Hie is the best and most worthy servant whom the wealthy monopolists have ever had in this . Parliament. il congratulate fhimupon  the thoroughness of his performances in their interests. I can . only express the hope that when Labour has again come into power we shall find  la  Treasurer as well able do the work of the poor and downtrodden as the present Treasurer is doing that. of ; his rich masters. </para>

                        <para>.- I shall be unable to follow the footsteps of the honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mahony).</inline> I desire to congratulate the 'Treasurer(Mr. Bruce). 1 wish to give the Treasurer a little encouragement.. My congratulations are in respect of this small measure of taxation relief.We must 'have taxation. The people paid it cheerfully throughout the Titanic struggle from which the nations have only recently emerged. But an adjustment of our taxation burden has now become necessary, and this particular adjustment is based upon principles of sound common sense. I shall give some particulars concerning an estate with which I am familiar, and i'f the honorable member for Dalley will say that the circumstances are not such that the owner should receive sympathetic consideration, he must indeed be hard-hearted. In 1919- 20 the taxes paid on the estate in question amounted to £5,000, and in 1920- 21 , to £4,300. The loss during the two years aggregated £1,300. The overdraft on the estate is £25,000. Is not some measure of relief deserved? 'There are millions of acres available for settlement in the various . 'States. I . have travelled over great areas which may . be taken up at . moderate cost. I [know of . a particular area which is being sold to ex-Imperial . service men at £20 per acre. I claim to be somewhat of a judge of land values, and I say . that, in my honest opinion, this land is worth upwards of £40 per acre. There are many hundreds of thousands of acres available in the various States to . those who are hungering for land; and they . can get . good . country practically at a gift. </para>

I am pleased that  the  Treasurer has 'introduced . this small, but welcome, concession. TheCommon wealth has borrowed locally more than £250,000.000 for war and other purposes. While it is probably a wise principle that we should finance ourselves, the fact remains that, along lines of private enterprise, we could be spending this . money which we have borrowed from ourselves to the great advantage of the . country at large. While we are pouring money into Government ventures' we are bound to be saddled with a heavy weight of taxation. I trust that the Government will follow . up their concessions. The Government are doing far more to develop the Commonwealth by introducing measures for the reduction of duties upon fencing wire, galvanized iron, and traction engines, . and for the remission of taxation imposts than by fostering artificial city industries. </para>

We are being assured by the mouth-pieces of the Ministry that there is pressing need for economy, for tightening up the purse strings, and for practising economy in re"gard to all avenues of governmental activities, and that there is no money to burn, but, as has been pointed out by honorable members on this side who have preceded me, although there are no funds available to increase the pensions to the aged and the invalid - =- </para>

I took the precaution of asking you a question, and I merely draw the attention of my constituents and the public to my question and your answer. It is well for the people outside to know that whatever else may be out of order it is quite in order to present.£400,000 to wealthy landholders. Although a considerable number of citizens, whose services were required during the last war- and probably will be asked for again in the near future, are unable to obtain employment, and there is no money for developmental works which would provide them with useful occupations, an amount of £400,000 per annum which formerly was obtained from the land-holders, who became wealthy during the war, is to be allowed to remain in their pockets, whilst those who made it possible for the land-holders to make their wealth may enjoy the benefit of sleeping in the open air, and using a pick and shovel on the Ocean -road. </para>

                        <para>.-If the Government desire that legislation shall be undertaken without the making of speeches, honorable members on; this side will agree to that course. So far, however, the "gag" has been, applied solely and distinctly to one party only. If that is to be- the settled policy of the Government,, we shall be quite agreeable. But, if honorable members on this side may not speak without it being subjected to indiscriminate suppression by the " gag," the Government will gain nothing. Any honorable member who endeavours to speak, either from the Treasury bench or behind it, will be subjected to the " gag " from this side. Now, following the excellent example which I set last night, I presume that it will be competent for me, upon the motion for the third reading of the Bill- </para>

                        <para>.- I shall not speak at length on the measure, because I agree generally with its provisions, and think that, on the whole, it will be acceptable to the public servants. They, unlike us, must be pleased that an election is at hand, 'because otherwise this long-promised measure would probably have remained in the background. I would point out, however, that 66 per cent, of the employees of the Commonwealth receive only about £4 a week, and that it will be difficult for many of them to pay the premiums required by the Bill, because their income is now barely sufficient to provide necessaries for their homes. For each unit of pension of £26 a contribution of so much a fortnight must be paid, and this contribution must be continued until the contributor retires on reaching the age of sixty-five years. A man who is receiving a salary of £200 a year will not be permitted to contribute for more than three units of pension, and on retirement will get only £78 per annum. </para>

                            <para>- That is so; but most of our public servants will live their full life, and those of them who are now at the age of twenty years or thereabouts will have contributed a large sum to the Pensions Fund by the time they have reached the age of sixty-five years. It is not to be assumed that those who are not receiving more than £200 , a year are getting this small salary because of any incapacity; thousands of men, chiefly in the Postmaster-General's Department, cannot rise to higher positions than they now occupy. At present a man on reaching the age of sixty-five years is entitled to an old-age pension of £39 a year, and his wife on reaching the age of sixty years is also entitled to a pension of £39 per year. Therefore a married couple may draw a pension of £78 a year without having contributed anything to a fund, whereas the public servant who is entitled to three units of pension will get only £78 a year, and in many cases will have made a very large contribution to the Pensions Fund before becoming eligible for that pension. From this point of view a man in the Service will be worse off than one outside. Generally speaking, our public servants are not getting remuneration commensurate with the work they do. Those in the Postmaster-General's Department did excellently during the war, and got practically nothing for the extra work they had then to perform. To get an efficient Public Service you must provide pay and conditions under which the public servants will be contented, and evidence that our public servants are not contented is shown by the fact that many resign each year to take up better positions outside the Service. In 1918-19, there were 936 voluntary retirements; in 1919-20, 1,367; and in 1920-21, 1,062. Those figures show that persons having special knowledge and capacity can do better for themselves outside the Service. </para>

                            <para>- I have not -that information. We have been told by the Government that it is intended to take away from public servants receiving a salary of £310 per annum or over the right to go to the Arbitration Court, and this may put such men in a worse position than they occupy now, because, after the election, they may find, as the public servants of New South Wales found, despite the promise to the contrary which was made to them, that their salaries have been decreased, and they will have no right to appeal to a Court for justice. The Bill is to be administered by a Board of three members, the  chairman,  a* qualified actuary, and a person nominated by the public servants. It is pleasing to note that the public servants are to have representation on this Board. That 'is an arrangement in keeping with the Whitley scheme. The Labour party has been condemned because it has urged the representation of workers on Boards of this kind, but now the Government has adopted our policy in this matter, and I hope that they will do the same in the Public 'Service Bill which is to come before us. Those who, since the 31st December, 1920, retired from the Service on reaching the age of sixty-five years, are to be given a pension of £104 per year. I do not complain of that, but I think that some consideration should be shown also to those who retired at the age of sixty years, after giving, perhaps, forty or forty-five of the best years of their life to the Public Service. The Minister could afford to be more generous. The public servants have been promised this measure for a long time, and a similar measure is in force in most of the States. Although I deem one or two amendments necessary, I take no exception to the Bill in the main, and I shall support the motion for its second reading. </para>

                    <para class="block">That remark makes one feel that a proposal such as this demands very close and. earnest consideration, but although it is, complicated, we seem slightly inclined to push the matter through too hastily. Reports have been made on various kinds of schemes that have been suggested, and I shall quote from one made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. DC.</inline> McLachlan, who was an excellent; man at this kind of work,, and one of the most trusted men in the Service. In his findings he said - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>That the funds necessary apart from any expense of management, should be obtained by contributions on a basis of one-fifth to be provided by the Government and four-fifths by the officers by deduction from salary. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">It is noteworthy that in this Bill the contributions by the Government are to be on a £l-for-£l basis. That arrangement may be quite justifiable, but when a public servant of high standing, like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan,</inline> suggests that the Government should contribute one-fifth and the employees four-fifths, one becomes doubtful of the soundness of this proposal. Has the Attorney-General considered that report, and, if so, why has he found it desirable to depart from the finding of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan,</inline> which was arrived at after a very searching inquiry? I ask that question particularly because I have been furnished with figures by certain actuaries, who state that this proposal is much more serious than it may appear to be on the surface. I do not wish to say or do anything that will interfere with the proper and due rights of the public servants, because I recognise as fully as anybody that in the past the Government Service has not been too attractive-. Most men. with initiative and more than average ability wish they had never entered the Service, because the opportunities for promotion, and the salaries attainable, are not such as to be worth while to the best men. Men get into the Service and find it difficult to get out, and there are many who would have done better if. they had never entered the Service. "While the salaries are so limited, and inducements in the way of pensions are lacking, a number of able young men think it desirable to keep out of the Service. But whilst that is so we should pause before we saddle the community with what may prove to be a very burdensome scheme. </para>

There the Government made no, provision to meet the payments when they fell due, and the result was that the Railway Superannuation Scheme, contribution, to which by the Government was limited to 1½ per cent. of the salaries or wages of the employees', after running for forty years was estimated by a well-known actuary in New South Wales, on the 30th June, 1921, to have an accumulated liability of over £30,000,000, which the State Government should face if they were to do their duty, because they had neglected to make proper provision for the liability in the first place. </para>

                    <para>In general, the Country party believes in a superannuation fund liberal enough to attract good men to the Public Service and hold them there, and give them at their retirement some reasonable reward for the service they have rendered to the community. What we fear more than anything else is that, at the rate at which the Service has been growing during the past few years, the Commonwealth will be overloaded by this scheme. We do not wish to injure in any way the prospects of .those who are in the Service ; in fact, we wish to make them better, so that the best men may be attracted to the Service - as happens in the Mother Country.; but we do not desire a scheme drafted, as this seems -to be, in a hurried manner., and which may land the community in considerably greater cost than can be foreseen at the present .time. We believe that this Bill .should be merely a first instalment of a general scheme of national insurance for all classes of the community. During the very early stages of this Parliament, .speaking from the back Ministerial bench, I outlined what, I conceived to be a more or less satisfactory scheme for dealing with the whole subject of national -insurance. I hope that the Government, in introducing this measure, are actuated by a desire to so safeguard its provisions that it will not involve the -community in a 'burden too great for it to carry, and that, at a 'later date, it may be extended  ;so  that it -will not only make safe the positions and prospects of the public servants, but also will be capable of embodying the old-age tensions 'scheme, and all those other schemes which the Commonwealth has now to support, in one great scheme of national insurance. </para>

                            <para>- That is satisfactory. I would like to see some provision made to guarantee a minimum pension to the lower paid servants, gradually increasing after certain amounts have been paid into the fund. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> that the lower paid workers will be getting but a slight advantage under this scheme, and I trust that their interests will receive more consideration. There are hundreds of public servants on lower salaries who, after paying into the fund for fifteen  or  twenty years, must retire on very small pensions. I think that the Government should have brought down .the Bill years ago. It is long overdue. It does not go so far as I would like, but still it is better than nothing, and later on opportunity may be offered to improve it </para>

                        <para>. - I congratulate the Attorney-General, not only on the fact that he has introduced this Bill, but also upon the clear way in which he' explained its provisions. Those who listened attentively to him must have realized the great amount of work that he and the experts who were assisting him must have done in drafting the measure. I can speak feelingly in this regard because when I was in the Tasmanian Public Service I was a member of a committee which helped to frame a superannuation scheme. We got no financial assistance from the Tasmanian Government and had to find the money ourselves. We found it an exceedingly difficult task, and, therefore, I can thoroughly appreciate the action of the Commonwealth Government in having come, as they have done, to the assistance of those who are willing to help themselves. This Bill, as the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lambert)</inline> has remarked, is long overdue. I take honorable . members' minds back, to the early days of Australia, when big inducements had to be held out to gentlemen to enter the Public Service. At that time, it was easy for any person to secure work outside, and one of the inducements that had to be offered to keep men in the Service was the fact that .big pensions would be made available to them upon their retirement at the statutory age. I welcome this Bill because I consider that it will induce good men not only to enter the Service of the Commonwealth, but also to remain in it. When I visited Great </para>

                    <para class="block">Britain in 1911, I made it my business to inquire into the work done by members of the British Government, and I found that Ministers there had comparatively easy tasks as compared with those undertaken by Commonwealth Ministers. This was due to the fact that much of the work done by Commonwealth Ministers was deputed to permanent heads of Departments and capable members of the Civil Service. I was told that it waa almost impossible for the ordinary citizen of Great Britain to see a Minister of the Crown, because the Minister dealt only with the most important matters, and could be seen only by plenipotentiaries of other Powers. When I told the person from whom I made my inquiries of the nature of the work undertaken by Commonwealth Ministers, he was astounded.  Bie  could not understand how' the work could be done by a Minister who was compelled to attend to so much detail. It was that statement which caused me to inquire who undertook the responsibility in Great Britain for the work done by Ministers in Australia. My informant replied, " We have our trained men. We make it worth while for capable men to enter our Service, and consequently all the details which you say Commonwealth Ministers undertake are largely done by them, with the result that our system is second to none in the world." There is a big risk to the people of any country if an ambitious politician without very much parliamentary experience is hurriedly rushed into a Ministerial position, and attempts to carry out the promises that he has made outside to do this or that thing, and has not available to him the advice of an experienced head of a Public Department. I have been informed that in one State the consequence would have been disastrous if a certain Minister had remained in office long enough to do what he had stated his intention of doing; but, fortunately for the country, the Ministry of which he was a member went out of office. We all know the services rendered by the officials in the Treasury and in the Customs Departments. They are most valuable, and should be adequately rewarded; the greatest .reward we can give any officer is to make provision for his old age, when he cannot hope to earn a living in competition with men who have been all their lives engaged in employment outside the </para>
                    <para class="block">Public Service. Under the present system a young man has to undergo a severe examination before he can enter our Public Service; but I am not too much impressed with the system, because it may sap the initiative of a man, and prevents us from having in the employment of the Government men who have had practical experience in all walks of life. This Bill does not propose to  give  a pension. Its purpose is to provide superannuation benefits for persons employed by the Commonwealth, and to make provision for their families. For the money it will cost, the Commonwealth will derive considerable benefit. </para>

                            <para>- I am not " stone-walling " it. It interests me more than any other measure so far introduced has done. I speak very seldom, and I always listen most attentively to honorable members opposite. At any rate, I propose to have my say upon the Bill, because I realize that opportunity should be taken to reply to some of the criticism that has been raised, ' The country will get a good return for the money it is spending, and the scheme will not be a burden on the taxpayers. We all know that when a man who has plenty of political influence is retired from the Public Service he can get a retiring allowance, but the man without such influence, as a rule, does not get on so well. This Bill will abolish that sort of thing. As men advance in the Public service great calls are made on their earnings. They have to keep up a certain social position, which proves more costly to them than it does to men outside the Service. When this measure is passed the public servant will not have the horror of being thrown upon the  world  at 'his retiring age in competition with men who have been trained all their lives in outside occupations. It is not lack of ability that may cause him to fail in competition with outside men.  His  trouble is that he has received a particular class of training which does not fit him for competition with outsiders. Private firms have found it to their advantage to make provision for their employees in their old age. It was my privilege in 1911 to visit Lever Brothers' works, where I found that men with great length of faithful service in the employment of the firm had retired on pensions. If private firms can carry out such schemes, why should not the Commonwealth Government, be in the position to do so? I am pleased that the Attorney-General proposes to amend the Bill ,to give lower-paid officers in the Service an opportunity of contributing for more units, and I hope that he will be able to advise me as to the position of transferred Tasmanian officers, who, if they had. remained in the State Service, were to draw upon retiring one month's pay for the first year of service, and one week's pay for every year of service  thereafter. </para>

Clause 57 of this Bill provides for the case of transferred officers whose rights in this respect were covered by State Statutes, but unfortunately there was no such Act in force in Tasmania, and the officers taken over from the Tasmanian Service are likely to suffer in comparison with officers taken over from other State Services. I hope that the Minister will give consideration to the matter, and see that justice is done to these men. </para>

                        <para>.- I should like to echo the congratulations of the last <inline font-weight="bold">speaker (Mr. Laird Smith)</inline> to the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> on the way in which he presented the Bill to the House. It is certainly a most intricate measure, but the honorable gentleman made it perfectly clear to honorable members,  showing that he must have devoted a large amount of hard work to its consideration and completion. The amendment which has been circulated on the part of the Government has really made unnecessary much that I had intended to say. I am  glad that the number of units available for the lower-paid men are to be increased, although even the four units provide only a bare existence as superannuation. With three units these men would have received just as much as would an old-age pensioner and his wife, and that would certainly be no encouragement to contribute to the fund. After all, there is a good deal of " whoop " in what is said about the "generous treatment" of the public servants, but not much can be said from that point of view in regard to the lower-paid men. This Bill, of course, is a very fine thing for the public servants with high salaries, who may draw something like £400 a year as pension, half the cost of which is contributed by the Government. In the case of the lower-paid men, however, even four units does not represent much in advance of what they would get as old-age pensioners. It is true that the provision made in cases where the public servant dies is very fair, but similar provision is made in most of the States for children, and in Victoria this is done, I believe, under what is called the Maintenance of Children Act. A greater advantage, no doubt, is presented in cases of invalidity of a public servant. I was sorry to hear the honorable member for Robertson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fleming)</inline> damn the measure with faint praise, and refer to the expenditure that the country must bear in connexion with this scheme; but, after all, the public servants are largely paying for the benefits they receive. Surely we cannot object to people being paid sufficient to keep body and soul together after they have served the country faithfully and well to the age of sixty-five years. </para>

                            <para>- Warnings are generally framed in derogatory terms when a proposal is made to spend money on the poorer portion of the community. I have figured out what will be contributed by a man who will draw four units as a pen sion. If a man contributes from the age of twenty to the age of sixty-five, a period of forty-five years, he will pay £450. Such a sum, if invested at compound interest at 4 per cent., would represent a total in that period of £1,208. These figures show that a contributor to this fund will not live on charity, but that he will contribute largely to what he receives. </para>

                    <para>The honorable member for Robertson made some remarks in regard to which I find myself in 'complete agreement with him. He expressed the hope that this measure might be the forerunner of a. general policy of national insurance; and it certainly is time for this National Parliament to take up that question seriously, for I am satisfied that there is no greater field of social reform. Such a policy ought to provide against every form of calamity - death, accident, fire, unemployment, and old-age and invalidity. With a national scheme we should be able to give much greater benefits to all concerned than we can to-day, and at considerably less cost to the people. </para>

                            <para>- We are not dealing with the question on sound lines. Any proposal to make national insurance compulsory under existing circumstances would not be sound without insurance against unemployment. If we make insurance compulsory, and make no provision to keep men employed, and thus enable them to keep up their contributions, the scheme cannot succeed. If, however, unemployment is covered I am satisfied that we could, with very much reduced contributions, afford greater benefits than the private insurance companies do now. </para>

                    <para>There is just one other suggestion I should like to make for consideration in Committee. With regard to the proposed payment of contributions of arrears due in consequence of their absence through illness, the present provision in ' this regard is somewhat harsh. When on sick leave some public servants get part payment, and some none at all. A man may be away six months, and if his salary is small, he finds, with the medical expenses and so forth, that it is the most expensive time of his life. When he returns to work the whole of the arrears are to be deducted from his first pay; and the suggestion is made that the payment might be spread over a period  by adding one-third! to each usual contribution. That could be done by regulation or, perhaps, by amendment in Committee, and it is an amendment that would prove a boon to the men with small wages. There are many interesting phases of the measure with which I should like to deal, but the hour is late, and I am anxious to see it become law. It is long overdue, notwithstanding the talk about the cost of it. After all, it provides mere bread and butter to the men and women, who have served their country faithfully to the age of sixty-five years. I commend the Government for introducing the measure. </para>

                        <para>.- As an old public servant, °I desire to express my gratification at the fact that the Government have introduced this measure, and are proceeding with it so promptly. It is a measure that is long overdue, and those who have .been connected, with, the Service know that it has been looked forward to for many years. At the inception of Federation the first classification scheme of the Commissioner put the public servants of the Commonwealth on the best footing of any in Australia. The Commonwealth. Service was superior both in regard to pay and conditions; but that position has not been maintained. The Service drifted for many years until the point waa reached when the officers were receiving less pay than those in similar positions in municipal and State services. Recently an opportunity was taken by Parliament to increase the minimum pay in the Public Service, a measure which was long overdue; but today the Commonwealth public servants are not, in my opinion, receiving remuneration commensurate with their duties. I always sympathize with the men on the bottom rung of the ladder, and we ought to do all we can to enable such men' to rise. The inducement by the way of pay to men in the higher positions is very small, when compared with the pay given to officers in similar positions in other parts of the world. Owing to this fact, the Commonwealth Public Service is constantly losing men, though there is no service that possesses a better class than our own. Of course, the Service has its wasters, like any commercial house or public institution, but the calibre of our men will compare favorably with that of the employees in any part of the world.

                    <para class="block">Great Britain, for many years past, the Government have made the Public Service so attractive that it has become the aspiration of many young men. The entrance examinations are very hard, with the result that the Public Service is obtaining capable recruits from the universities and colleges. Some years ago in Australia applicants for positions to the Public Service were greatly in excess of the number required, and the Departments could pick and choose; but to-day the circumstances are just the reverse. In many of our Departments - the Postal Department particularly - a short supply of boys has been experienced for many years. I know that at the Sydney Post Office, there is an average of forty boys short, and when they are obtained they are snapped up by the commercial men of the city at wages 5s. and 10s. a week over those paid by the Government. An honorable member to-day has given us a list of the men who have retired from the Public Service, and we are continuing to lose men every year. If we wish, to retain the services of capable men, the positions must be made attractive. </para>

                        Unfortunately, we are losing the services of capable young men, who find that they can do better outside. I am sure very few members of this House would willingly place their sons in the Public Service, and from what we hear in trams, trains, and other public places, that sentiment is widespread. How can the services be made attractive to newcomers if we cannot keep the officers employed in the various Departments to-day ? I agree with the honorable member for Robertson
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fleming)</inline>
                        and the honorable member for Yarra

                        and with others who have advocated national insurance. After all, this proposal for the superannuation of the Public Service is only a small matter compared with the question of providing for the welfare of the general body of citizens throughout the Commonwealth. The time is coming when the public health of this country must be the first consideration of government. It would pay the Commonwealth to keep its people well and employed, and to insure them against sickness and unemployment. I trust that this measure will be the means of rendering the Public Service more attractive, so that we may at least retain the officers Who are at present engaged in carrying on the affairs of this country. We must stop the drift which has been so long in operation.

                        <para>. - I am glad that the Government are about to fulfil one of their election pledges by 'bringing down a reasonably fair and equitable measure for the superannuation of Commonwealth public servants. There are two or three points, however, upon which I desire to be enlightened. Recently there appeared in the press certain particulars regarding the growth of the Public Services of the Commonwealth and States during the past twenty years. It was stated that on the eve of Federation the numbers of those in State Government employment all over Australia totalled about 90,000, and that in 1921 those numbers had increased to almost 200,000. Further, there are now superimposed upon those 200,000 more than 50,000 permanent and temporary employees: of the Commonwealth, serving in some way or another. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister's interjection furnishes a partial explanation. I do not wish to say anything further regarding the expansion of the State Services; but the growth of the Commonwealth Public Service has also been very rapid. Putting the two totals together, it would appear that, in 1901, there was one Government employee for every twenty-one of the adult population of Australia; and that in 1921 there was one Government employee for every twelve adults in the country. </para>

                    <para>Honorable members have been furnished with a carefully tabulated statement by actuaries employed by the Government to inform Parliament of what this scheme really means in terms of pounds sterling. I agree with the honorable member for Robertson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fleming)</inline> to some extent, that the recent Superannuation Act in New South Wales failed because it did not provide for obligation's as well as commitments. However, the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> has made a complete statement which shows our total obligations under this scheme year by year, and as the years go on. Positions in the Public Service should carry both prestige and security. We can only obtain security by providing some kind of pension for an officer who has served his country faithfully and well. For that reason, I favour this measure. I believe that undue inflation has occurred in the Commonwealth Services. Inflation of any Public Service reduces its prestige. That brings mie to a point on which I am not clear. I have already quoted from a press article to the effect that there are more than 50,000 Commonwealth public servants to-day. This Bill, according to the actuarial report, provides for 20,666 males, 2,766 females, 877 persons connected with . the Naval Department, 2,784 from the Defence Department, 483 from the Commonwealth Railway Department, and 47 in connexion with parliamentary duties. I cannot reconcile these actuarial figures with the information furnished to me last week in response to a question which I had asked concerning the number of Government employees outside  the ambit of the Public Service Commissioner. In the first place, the total number of public servants to be provided for is, according to the actuarial report, approximately, 25,000. The reply furnished to my question indicated that there were about 9,000 further persons employed in the Commonwealth Government Service. </para>

                            <para>- Under the Bill our obligations will be sufficiently heavy to make it necessary to take care how we inflate the Public 'Service. When the Bill has become law every unnecessary public servant will mean, not only an unnecessary salary, but a pension to follow. I support the Bill because I think it fair that the Commonwealth Public Service should have a superannuation fund, since most of the State public servants are so provided for; and I support it, too, because I am not altogether satisfied that our Public Service is overpaid. There are fine officers holding very responsible positions who are not getting as much from the Government as they would get by the exercise of their abilities outside. </para>

                            <para>- There .are numerous able officers in the Public Service who could get bigger pay outside. I should like to know whether the Bill provides not only for retirements on reaching the age of sixty-five, but also for retirements with full pension benefits on completion of forty years of satisfactory service. I shall raise that question in Committee, and perhaps the Minister will give the matter consideration then. Among my election pledges was a promise to support a Superannuation Bill. I, therefore, shall support this measure. I hope that, in Committee, the Minister will pay special regard to the position of the young men now in the Service. I am glad that he has circulated a notice of amendment which will enable a man on a small salary to subscribe for more units of pension than he would be entitled to in the Bill as it stands. The Bill should not be moulded and shaped in the interests of the present heads who are on the eve of retirement. It should consider, rather, the position of the young men who hope to give many years of faithful service to the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>.- I shall not go into the matter of superannuation very deeply. While I believe in superannuation, I do not believe in class superannuation, and I should like to see a scheme for national insurance. It is hardly fair that my servants and other servants outside the Public Service - for we are all servants .one of another - should have to contribute to a superannuation fund for the benefit of the Commonwealth public servants and have no provision made for themselves. Some of those in the .Commonwealth Public Service may be regarded as comfortably off compared with many outside the Service who will have to contribute to the proposed pensions fund, and will get none of its benefits. The Government, as tax-gatherer, will take from the public at large revenue with which it will subsidize the proposed Public Service Pension Fund. The man whom I employ in producing food for the people is a servant of this country, 'but he, and others like him,  have no guarantee that after forty years of service they will be in a comfortable position. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>On every ground of justice and equity the Government should satisfy themselves conclusively that this scheme will fit in with a national scheme of superannuation or insurance. I do not mind the proposal being precipitate in setting an example so far as pensions for Commonwealth public servants are concerned, but if the Government intend to- stop there I should regard their action as grossly unfair. If the principle of this measure is sound for one section of the community it is equally sound for every other section. That is why I earnestly desire that the Government will frame this measure in such a way that it may be fitted into a national scheme of insurance. The Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> has said that he has copied much of this Bill from the New South Wales Superannuation Act, but I remind him. that that Act has not been working very satisfactorily. The State Government very much underestimated the cost of their scheme, and it may turn out that the estimate of over £11,000,000, which the Government will contribute to the scheme proposed under this Bill, may be greatly exceeded before the scheme is complete. Such a scheme, if it could be made to apply to Australia as a whole, would have some soundness in it. I could show greater necessity for a pension for some people who will not benefit but will have to be contributors to this fund through the Government than can be shown for those who will be beneficiaries under it. The people to whom I refer have less . opportunity of saving than have men in the higher grades of the Commonwealth Public Service. I would have preferred that the Commission, which the Government propose to appoint, should have put the Public Service on a business footing before the introduction of this measure. </para>

                    <para>The introduction of the Bill is precipitate, and we shall have a long time to repent. The State civil servants, and the servants of the country generally, whether in a Civil Service or not, are quite as much servants of the Commonwealth as are the members of the Commonwealth Public Service. I should have greatly preferred the introduction of a comprehensive scheme of insurance for Australia. We recognise certain people as old-age pensioners; but pensioners under this Bill may probably be considered more aristocratic. After they have served the country for a considerable time they will be entitled by their contributions, and the contributions of other people, to retire on a reasonable allowance. That is right, and I have no objection whatever to such a scheme if it could be applied all round. I cannot regard the members of the Commonwealth Public Service with any greater preference than the members of the State Services or my own servants. </para>

I do not speak against the principle of superannuation. It is an excellent principle, and a proper system when its incidence is national covering the whole people, and would do away with the unpleasantness that arises under the old-age pension scheme. I repeat my impression that the Government have introduced the measure hastily, and again remind them that we will have any amount of time for repentance. </para>

                    <para>. - I see by the <inline font-style="italic">Herald,</inline> which has just been handed to me, that I am reported as having made certain remarks at Ballarat. That is not a verbatim report of what I said, but I should like to put on record in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> the purport of my remarks. I was dealing with the position of the Country party in various Australian Parliaments. I pointed out that in some Parliaments they were controlling the Government, in others they were holding the balance of power, and that in this House and in the South Australian Parliament they were not able to do either of those things, but were acting as guardians of country interests. Although they had not been able to do exactly what they wished in regard to the preservation of those interests which it was their special purpose to guard, yet they were able to act as a policeman does on beat, or as a householder does when a burglar is about - switch on the lights to prevent raids upon those interests in the way that certain Governments had done in the past. Whether or not I said it at Ballarat, I would like to say here that the surcharge on the land tax, which was- repealed to-night, is an instance of the inequitable taxation imposed on the primary industries of this country - a burden that would not have been imposed if there had been in the last Parliament a Country party able to make an effective protest on the floor of this Chamber. </para>
