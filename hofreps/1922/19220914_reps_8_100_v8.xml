                        - On behalf of the Opposition I desire to state that, owing to the feeling of uncertainty existing in the public mind as to the holding of an election this year, and this uncertainty having the tendency to unsettle business, if the Prime Minister will make the definite announcement that he intends to submit the proposals to amend the Constitution, as promised in the Governor-General's Speech, and will say what other measures he wishes to be made law, we will place no unreasonable obstacle in the way of dealing with such  legislation. In regard to the constitutional amendments, it would be necessary to deal with them at an early date, so as to comply with the provisions of section 128 of the Constitution, which provides that not less than two months must elapse after the passing of the proposed law by each House of the Parliament before it is submitted to the electors.

                        <para>- I have been in communication with the High Commissioner on the subject. The information we have received so far is not detailed enough to enable me to answer the question fully, but we gather that in the main the statements that were circulated before the Mandates Commission were reprints from <inline font-style="italic">the Age</inline> newspaper published in this city. I shall verify this, and ascertain whether excerpts from other newspapers were similarly circulated. It must be evident that the object of the person responsible for these statements was to injure Australia. It was a pro-German move, and naturally they went to the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper in order to secure circulation and sympathetic treatment. </para>

Of the £450,000 referred to by the honorable member, about £65,000 is for acquisition of lands, maintenance of power, light, water, hospital, afforestation, railway, and other services, some of them revenue-producing. Of the balance, a considerable portion has been either paid or earmarked to meet liabilities under contracts entered into.

                        <para>.- The action of the Government in bringing down this Bill will, I think, meet with the approval of all members in the House. For a considerable time past there has been a great deal of dissatisfaction in the Northern Territory, because, whilst the residents are subject to taxation, they have been given no representation in this Parliament. The legislation which controls the Territory comprises Ordinances issued by the Government and gazetted, and some of them have provoked a good deal of ill-feeling. This was only to be expected, having regard to the fact that the residents prior to the Territory being transferred to the Commonwealth, had representation and a vote in the South Australian State Parliament. We can understand that the residents, as Britishers, resent bitterly, as we would do, being subject to taxation without representation. </para>

                            <para>- They appear to do as they like. That regulation is a serious invasion of the rights of British citizens. If residents in other parts of Australia fail to comply with the law they become subject to certain pains and penalties, but the Government do not deport them from the Commonwealth. The people of the Territory, however, are subject to a harsh regulation in regard to the framing of which they have had no voice. This Bill will confer a certain measure of relief, but it is deficient in as much as whilst conferring representation on the Northern Territory, it does not give the representative the right to vote. Of course, it will be urged that because the people in the Northern Territory are so few they should not have the right to vote. I agree that we should adhere as closely as possible to one vote one value, but the circumstances of the Northern Territory are exceptional, and it is impossible to place its residents in the same category as the people of any of the existing States. This Bill does not go far enough. What satisfaction will the people of the Territory derive from having representation without a vote? Their representative, apparently, is to enjoy all the privileges which other honorable members enjoy except that he may not vote on any question; whenever there is a division, even though it be on a matter concerning the Territory itself, he must leave the chamber. </para>

                            <para>- Or, at any rate, only blank cartridges. The new member is to have the right to express the views of the people he represents, but he may not take any action to give effect to those views. Whilst in ordinary circumstances I would not approve of such a large disproportion in electoral numbers as there would be between the Northern Territory as a constituency and any of the existing electorates, I consider that the Territory is entitled to special consideration. Its people are far removed from the centre of any State. So far the Commonwealth has made very little advance in the development of the Territory, and I am hopeful that if the people there are allowed to elect a representative he will be able to assist the Government and the House in formulating a sound developmental policy. But he should have a vote, and I shall take action in Committee to test the feelings of honorable members in that regard. It would appear that the people in the Territory have been rather prejudiced by certain statements that have been made in this House. The Honorary Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Granville Ryrie),</inline> who is in charge of the Bill, is one of those who have not done justice to the people of the Territory, and I remind honorable members of the following question and answer which appeared in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of 21st April, 1921 : - </para>

                        <para>- Mr. BOWDEN - Has the attention of the Assistant Minister for Defence been called to the statement in the newspapers that the Defence Department has paid £ 700 or more for the removal of two trees from an aeroplane ground at Darwin? Is the statement correct? If not, what work has been done for the money? </para>
                        <para>- Mr. RYRIE - I read the statement in the press, and knowing something of the so-called working men of Darwin, I was surprised that the smallest tree could be removed for the expenditure mentioned. </para>
                        <para> Mr. Mathews - A most indiscreet reply. </para>
                        gov&gt;
                        <para>Mr MOLONEY- It is a slur on the working men of the Northern Territory. </para>
                        <para>Mr. RYRIE - The so-called working men of Darwin are the greatest Bolsheviks in Australia. I have no hesitation in saying that. In any case, they have no votes. </para>

                        <para class="block">Now, the Minister brings forward a Bill which, by giving representation without the right to vote, follows up logically the statement I have just quoted. Are the assertions which have been made in defamation of the Territory justified? I have received many communications in denial of al legations concerning conditions up there, and on various occasions I have brought them before the House. I refer honorable members to the different reports that have been made upon the Territory. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Ewing, as a Royal Commissioner, would not make statements that were unwarranted, and on page 16 of his report he said - </para>

                        <para>Although two out of every three men in Darwin were unemployed on the closing' of the meatworks, there was no rioting or disturbance of any kind. The Territory has been remarkably free from serious crime during the whole year. </para>
                        <para>This law-abiding attitude of the workers was, I believe, largely due to the Prime Minister's pledge that the people of the Northern Territory would he granted representation in the Federal Parliament, after having had the parliamentary franchise taken from them since 1911. </para>
                        <para>I think the taunts that have been hurled at the workers here, by certain misinformed people, that they are variously Bolshevists, Independent Workers of the World, and Anarchists can be refuted by the record they hold that a larger percentage of men voluntarily enlisted for the Front than in any other part of Australia, that they subscribed more <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> to the Red Cross Fund, that they carried the conscription referenda on every occasion, and have erected a magnificent monument in Darwin to their fallen comrades. </para>

                        <para>It is an interesting reflection that while the various States of the Commonwealth during the last forty-six years have been covered with telegraph lines even to the most remote settlements, not one mile of line has been built by the Government in the Territory, and yet it can be said that no Public Service is more valuable and no other agency, for the expenditure incurred, is more stimulating to development. </para>

                    <para class="block">Since we have taken over the Northern Territory nothing has been done to develop it, possibly owing to the absence of representation of the people in Parliament, and all the time we have heard taunts thrown at the people of the Territory, and have seen Ordinances enforced for the purpose of making their conditions practically unbearable.

                    <para class="block">That report, as I have said, covers the 1919-20 period, and we are only now discussing a measure which purposes to give the people of the Northern Territory representation in this Parliament, although the person chosen to represent them is not to have a vote upon any matter affecting either his own people or the Commonwealth.

                            <para>- That may be, but the fundamental principle of British government is, as far as possible, to give representation and a vote - full representation. I do not regard the proposal before us as a satisfactory means of meeting the position, and I hope that in Committee the Minister will agree to amend the Bill in the direction, suggested. It cannot make any difference beyond, as I say, giving the people of the Territory that to which they are entitled. This is a special case, which we have to deal with on its merits. Unfortunately, the population is sparse, and unattached to any other State. When we took over the Territory those people lost their political rights; and we can well understand their dissatisfaction at having no representative in the Federal Parliament. No wonder they complain about being governed from Melbourne, for this is the kind of grievance that has caused wars in various parts of the world. There is great objection to being governed from distant centres where those who govern are ignorant of the conditions prevailing in the governed Territories. How many of us here are in a position to deal with questions concerning the Northern Territory ? Some of us have visited the place, but most of us have not. </para>

                            <para>- Canberra is accessible if wa desire to go there; but, as a matter of fact, members of Parliament are kept so busy that they consider themselves fortunate if they can get a week o* a fortnight's holiday about Christmas time. My own opinion is that we ought to visit every part of the Commonwealth, and also the Mandated Territories; but, for the reason I have stated, that is impossible, much as we may desire to go. If a representative of the Territory is admitted here, he ought to possess the same rights as we do as representatives of the people in other parts of Australia. Such a main should either have a full voting power, or should not be here at all. As I have said, I regard the proposal placed before us as an insult to the people of the Territory. There are reports that they hail with satisfaction the promise of representation; but I am sure that, when they learn that it ia representation without the power of the vote, their indignation will be great. </para>

I understand that a gentleman has been selected as a delegate by the inhabitants of the Territory, and is now on his way here for the purpose of discussing matters . affecting their interests. At regular intervals I get wires and letters complaining of the condition of affairs there; and of the Government Ordinances; and I think I am safe in saying that the people will not be satisfied unless they have full representation with the power of the vote. I offer no opposition to the measure, and am pleased to see it introduced even at this belated hour. At the same time, I shall take the necessary steps to test the opinion of honorable members on the points I have raised when we reach the Committee stage. </para>

                        <para>. - This is just one of those half measures which will do no good. For years I have urged that the whole principle on which we treat the Northern Territory is entirely wrong. We have created huge Government Departments there, and at one time I believe the public servants represented a large percentage of the entire population. The other day I read an interesting article by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cotton,</inline> who has had great experience in the Northern Territory, where, L believe, he owns cattle stations; and the suggestion he makes is, I think, the correct one. It is that we should treat the Northern Territory exactly as we treat the rest of Australia, that is, instead of building up huge Departments with commissioners and inspectors, and a whole array of public servants, there should be a police magistrate, with a few policemen and a clerk, to conduct the public business. I have read the reports of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Ewing, and other Commissioners, and I can see nothing inherent in the Darwin population to call for the elaborate governmental machinery that has prevailed in the past. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Ewing's report shows that he, at any rate, took a great deal of trouble to thoroughly understand the position there, and his opinion is one  that ought to carry some weight here. Why should we not place the Northern Territory in one of the existing State electorates? I know it may be said that we have no power to do this under the Constitution, and though I am not quite prepared to accept that dictum, I shall for the time being take it for granted. Within a few months there will he a general election. What is to prevent the Government submitting a little clause by way of referendum to enable them, by an amendment of the Constitution, to place both Canberra and the Northern Territory in existing State electorates, and thus give the people the perfect representation that is enjoyed by the rest of Australia? </para>

                            <para>- In New Guinea the white population is exceedingly small, and, in any case, that is a " fence we can jump " when we come to it. For the first ten years of Federation the Northern Territory was included in one of the existing State electorates, and there was then none of the trouble we have since experienced. The people there could apply to their own member, and have their claims and grievances brought before the Federal Parliament, and, what is more important still, have their convictions and ideas tested by a vote. To have a Northern Territory representative here to voice the claims of his constituents, and when the time came for a decision of the issue, to declare that he should not exercise a vote seems to me absurd. After all, it is the vote that actually counts, and to ask this man to walk out of the chamber when a decision is being taken on some question in which he and his constituents were vitally interested, would be intolerable. The sooner we get rid of the idea that the Northern Territory is ai foreign country, and has to be treated in some special way, the better. There is an impression that we must send special Commissioners there, armed with drastic powers, but, as I have said, a police magistrate with a few policemen would be sufficient, as has been proved in other parts of Australia just as sparsely populated. In the far north of Queensland, and especially in the far north of Western Australia, where there are fewer people than in tie Territory, the government is good, and there are no complaints. That is simply because the people have their own, State member, and their own Federal member, to voice their claims. The time has come to face the position in regard to the Territory. The last report of the Administrator shows that in his opinion the great grievance is the lack of representation in the Federal Parliament; and I do not think that the so-called representation proposed in this measure will prove satisfactory. The representative of the Territory should have a vote or not be here at all, and for that reason I urge that the Northern Territory, and also Canberra, should be included in State electorates. The misgovernment of the Northern Territory and the excessive expenditure there are things not creditable to this Parliament, and the time has come when we must face the situation. The Bill, however, does not help us to do so. It is not enough to allow the people of the Territory to send a man here to ventilate their grievances and deny him the right <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> vote on any matter in which the Territory may be concerned. I urge the Minister to see if it is -not possible to put the Northern Territory again into the position which it occupied ten years ago, when it was part of a South Australian electorate, and was,  therefore,  represented in this Parliament. I do net think the people of any part of Australia will be satisfied to pay taxes unless they have an effective voice in the making of the laws by which they are governed. My suggestion is a practicable one. Its adoption would satisfy the people of the Territory, and would do away with the need for special representation, which is always to be avoided. I think that under the Constitution we could give effect to my proposal, but should there be any doubt on that point, the Government could, at the next election, obtain from the people the power necessary to place the Federal Territories within Commonwealth electorates. As it stands, the Bill is one of those half measures which is doomed to failure. </para>

                        <para>.- I sincerely regret that the Government have brought in this measure. The last  speaker  and the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> have complained that the residents in the Northern Territory and in the Federal Capital Territory are without representation here; but I ask them to look the facts in the face. There is not a -man on the other side of the Chamber who is not. al ways ready to represent the people of the Federal Capital Territory and to champion their cause when any question affecting their interests crops up here. The people of the Northern Territory are also well represented here. If a representative were sent here from the Northern Territory to voice the opinions of the people there, the would carry no weight, having no vote; and even with the right to vote he would he ineffective. At the present time, whenever a question concerning the Northern Territory arises, members on both sides champion, the cause of the people there in a manner in which no direct representative of the Territory could do. Northern Territory matters have been discussed here at great length, and whenever remedies for abuses have been suggested by the people there they have been adopted. I am entirely of the opinion that there should be no taxation without representation, and I think that if we wished to increase the population of the Territory we should abolish taxation there. In 1920-21, the revenue collected in the Territory from duties on alcoholic liquors was £10, and the revenue from duties on narcotics £47, the explanation being largely that the supplies of alcoholic liquors and narcotics paid duty in the south, whence they were imported. In 1917-18, these duties yielded nearly £14,000. I have taken a few figures from the <inline font-style="italic">Year-Booh,</inline> which show the revenue from the taxation of the Territory to be small, and it would be email <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> if distributed among the whole population, but, as a matter of fact, it is drawn from only a few persons. </para>

                            <para>- I would remit so much of his taxation as was leviable upon land held or income earned within the Territory. In 1920*21, the Customs and Excise revenue of the Northern Territory was £3,995,' the territorial revenue, £18,846; the land and income taxation, £6,445; miscellaneous income, £12,849; lighthouse and light dues, £1,124; and stamp duties, £740 ; making a total of £42,999. I have not been able to obtain the land tax and income tax figures separately. In my opinion, we might well cease to tax necessary commodities in the Territory, though I would continue to impose duties on narcotic and alcoholic beverages. </para>

                            <para>-  The territorial charges, if not wholly remitted, might at least be divided by two. The land and income taxation is collected from a very few individuals, the great bulk of the population of Darwin paying neither land nor income tax. Lighthouse and light dues are small, because few ships visit the Territory. These charges might very well be remitted. Honorable members opposite are doing all they can to attract population to Canberra, but I think that they will be disappointed, because if ever there was a wild-cat scheme introduced into this Parliament, the scheme for the settlement of Canberra is such. The honorable member ' for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mcwilliams)</inline> spoke of having met in Melbourne a gentleman who is largely interested in the Northern Territory, where he has a big property and big herds of cattle. The other day I met that gentleman in the Queen's Hall, and asked him what he thought about the proposal to give representation to the Territory.  His  reply was, "For God's sake, get it off your mind ! We do not want it. It would be_ of no use to us." I pointed out to him that the representation the Territory now enjoys here is much more effective than that proposed by the Minister would be. I hope that the Minister will give consideration to my suggestion. The Bill, as it stands, is useless. We do not know the source from which it emanated, but the Minister, who is big-hearted, has probably responded to some appeal made to him. However, if he thinks the matter over he will be convinced that the Territory would be better off without direct representation than if it had a representative here who could not vote. A man who, after stating his opinions in this chamber, had to go beyond the bar when a division was called, would be in an ignominious position, which neither he nor those whom he represented would consider satisfactory. </para>

                            <para>- While, on the face of the Bill, there is some pretence to do justice to a long-suffering people, when the measure is submitted to examination the benefits likely to accrue to residents of the Northern Territory are found to be illusory. I am under no misapprehension concerning the possibilities of developing the Territory. We have heard a good deal in this Chamber regarding the conversion of our great northern tract into a veritable Garden of Eden. We have heard much about importing into the Territory a population quite out of proportion to the general population of the Commonwealth. I am not one of those who believe that we can set up, in the heart of Northern Australia, a population  contented  and prosperous, and designed to convert that Territory into another Garden of Eden, while, ' in fact, much more accessible parts of th'e Commonwealth are still untilled, and, therefore, unpopulated. We cannot proceed with the development of the Northern Territory in advance of the general development of Australia as a whole. But there is one fundamental matter to which we can and ought to direct our attention. We should secure, as far as legislation can secure, the happiness and comfort of the people who are already in the Terri.ritory. In order to achieve that, out first care should be to safeguard their fundamental rights, that is, to give them the right to state their grievances with the hope of having them redressed before the only tribunal which can adequately deal with them, namely, the Parliament of the Commonwealth. The story of the injustice of imposing taxation without representation is too old to require repetition. Here we have an area which forms a very considerable part of the whole of the Commonwealth Territory; an area which, if .1 remember rightly, comprises not les3 than 335,000,000 acres. We have in that Territory a. very scant population; but if we cannot take practical political measures to increase it, at least we should fight shy of anything calculated to drive out the small numbers already there. The Government have now presented a proposal to give to the Territory representation in this Chamber. When I tell the Honorary Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Granville Ryrie)</inline> that the proposition appears -to be 'in some way part of the Government's electioneering propaganda, he criticises my suggestion as being purely "flapdoodle." These people, having no votes - as the Minister somewhat sarcastically remarked in this' House on one occasion - they cannot possibly influence the policy of the Government! It is true that they have no votes, but it is&gt; true also that the Government are not above telling the electors of the Commonwealth that they have settled the vexed question of the Northern Territory by according, to its residents representation in this Chamber. The Government, having promised representation, intend to make sure that, in the event of a close division in this Chamber upon any matter of Government policy, the balance of power shall not be disturbed by the entrance of a Northern Territory representative. I desire, however, that this representation shall be made effective; and the only means to that end lies in the right of the Territory's representative to exercise the vote. I have always taken what may be regarded as rather an extreme view with reference to those persons upon whom the burdens of taxation and the necessity for obeying laws are imposed while they have not the enjoyment, at the same time, of the right to exercise their votes. I have even gone so far as to say, in connexion with the history of great struggles on the merits of this very principle, that I would not blame any person for committing any act of extravagant conduct, or misconduct, directed against a Government that withheld from that person the right to exercise his or her vote in connexion with the administration of the affairs of the country. In the circumstances, honorable members should embrace the present opportunity to extend voting power to the proposed representative of the Northern Territory. </para>

                            <para>- The Honorary Minister has not informed the House who or what is his authority. He has not argued the matter in any way, and honorable members, therefore, are left to speculate upon the grounds on which such an opinion, bare and barren as it is, has been founded. I need not again quote the terms of the Constitution, which, however, are perfectly clear in that they enable the Commonwealth Parliament to make laws giving a Territory representation, in this Parliament under such terms and conditions - including, I apprehend, the right to vote - as the Parliament may think fit. It appears to me that the framers of the Constitution sufficiently apprehended the justice of having our Territories represented here to influence them in making provision for that representation in the original draft of the Constitution. And they made such provision clear and definite. If there were any difficulty at all, I would have assumed that it would be a difficulty of securing the actual representation in this Chamber rather than in the direction of giving the selected representative a vote. However, there appears to me to be no difficulty whatever; but, if there is, it is "up to" the Honorary Minister to indicate where the difficulty lies. It will not suffice . for him to say that he has been informed that the Government cannot constitutionally grant the right to vote. To take such a stand is, I suggest, to use a much overworked phrase, pure camouflage on the part of the Honorary Minister. </para>

                    <para>I sympathize considerably with the residents of the Northern Territory for the reason that, not only have they had inflicted on them laws in the making of which they have had no voice, but because they have been saddled with laws by persons who are quite out of sympathy with the first principles of democratic government. At present, in the person of the Minister for Home and Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> the people of the Territory are subservient practically to the lightest whim of an absentee militarist. Any one who is familiar with the history of our Crown colonies, with the agitations and quarrels arising from misgovernment, from the lack of government, or due to absentee government, must realize that this kind of thing - government by Ordinances in which the people of the Territory have no say, government by Ordinances which even the members of this Parliament have scarcely an opportunity to read or understand - is a direct invitation to the Territory to rebel, not necessarily by force of arms, but, at all events, by simmering antagonism to the Government. What do honorable members know of local conditions in the Territory? The honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> has well said that it is only on rare occasions that one or two members of Parliament are afforded opportunities to observe conditions firsthand. It is about ten years since I, in company with the Honorary Minister, among others, paid a visit to the Northern Territory; and I am bound to remark that I have a much better opinion of the Honorary Minister as a genial travelling companion than as a capable administrator of the Territory. </para>

                            <para>- He was not deported, nor did he beat a strategic retreat at the critical moment. He came away, if not covered with glory, at any rate having earned the good-will of those among whom he carried on his important duties. In a painstaking manner he has analyzed the position existing in the Territory. He points out that one of the difficulties under which its people labour has to do with the Public Service. Public servants in the Territory are required to live under tropical conditions for many years without the possibility, or the means, of enjoying much-needed furlough in cooler climates. That undermines the health  and stamina and destroys the good-will of the Service. He points out, too, that if some disgruntled person comes to Melbourne, and pours a tale of woe into the ear of the Minister, the probabilities are that the Minister will forthwith issue an Ordinance imposing the will of, perhaps, an eccentric upon the Territory, the Minister himself being totally ignorant of the actual conditions obtaining. When we have in this House a man who is distinctly representative of the Territory, responsible to all classes of people there, and dependent for his position, emoluments, and good name alike, upon every class, we shall not have any more of this one-sided and secret legislation. Legislation by Ordinance is just as objectionable - and that is saying a good deal - as legislation by means of regulations. There is hardly one member of this Parliament but will remember with shame and indignation what was done, especially during the war, by means of what were known as regulations, and although those regulations were required by Act of Parliament to be laid upon the table of the House, no opportunity was ever given to challenge or discuss them. The consequence was that the Hughes Ministry have earned a reputation for oblique government so unsavoury that it will probably take a good many decades to efface it from the minds of the people. The same kind of objection applies to the Ordinances. We are governing "the Territory in a hole-and-corner manner. We are not governing it in a way to win and increase the respect of the people in the Territory, or in such a way as to preserve order and goodwill amongst them. Neither are we making any serious attempt to safeguard the health of the people whom we send there to do the Commonwealth's work. I do not wish to be over-harsh or critical of some of the people who were sent to the north to discharge important duties - reports of Commissions are on record which tell us something about them - but the undignified and humiliating flight of the late Acting Administrator and his chief judicial officer constituted a stigma upon the officers themselves and the Commonwealth as a whole. Such a condition of affairs never could have been reached if the Territory had been properly represented in this Chamber, and had been afforded a constitutional outlet for the pent-up feelings of its people. We shall never be able to deal with the questions of land settlement, and education, or the important matter of guarding the interests of the coloured race, unless we have intelligent representation of the Territory in this Parliament, and I ask the Government not to be constantly in dread of having a vote recorded against them. Give the representative of the Territory a vote. It is true that it is to some extent out of harmony with the views of my party and myself to say that 1,500 or 2,000 white people should have as much representation in this Chamber as is given to 40,000. That certainly is an anomaly, and it appears so to us as a party who believe in the application, as far as possible, of the principle of one vote, one value. But when we are confronted with two evils - on the one hand depriving the people of a fundamental right, and on the other hand creating an inequality, it is infinitely better to create the inequality than to violate a fundamental right. Therefore, I hope that when the Leader of the Opposition moves his projected amendment upon this Bill it will be sympathetically received. We do not stand to lose at all by a little over-generous treatment of the Northern Territory, especially when we remember that we are so deeply indebted to its people. By that I mean that we have done so great and so long-sustained a wrong in depriving them of representation altogether, that even if they should be a little over-represented in the years immediately to come, that will but serve to balance the injustice of the past. I should like to have heard more from the Honorary Minister regarding the constitutional difficulties of which he spoke, and which neither the Leader of the Opposition nor I can at present appreciate. That constitutional difficulty being brushed away as non-existent, I hope that now we have begun to handle this problem - and we welcome this measure in any form as being at all events a basis of discussion upon which we may be able to build an edifice of justice - the House, in its wisdom, will see that full justice is done to those people to whom justice has been so long denied. I do not think that anything less will satisfy the people of the Northern Territory. For instance, they would not be satisfied to be associated, as the honorable member for Franklin suggested, with some other State, even if the very real constitutional obstacles in the way of so doing could be overcome. To make them merely an appendage to any State of the Commonwealth would not satisfy them. They are entitled to be satisfied, and I do not think. that the honorable member's suggestion would prove a wise solution. Nothing less than adequate representation - and I shall not be afraid if it is a little more than adequate - will satisfy the people of the Territory. Therefore, I hope that the Bill, with the essential amendment indicated by the Leader of the Opposition, will be carried. </para>

                        <para>.- In dealing with this question we should look a little further than the mere representation of the Northern Territory; we should frankly and fairly face the broader question of dealing with the government of that Territory as a whole. Not merely so, but I think the time has come when we, having cumbered ourselves with other Territories, cannot make a special case of one; we must outline a policy of representation for all Territories controlled by the Commonwealth. I am no lawyer, but I understand that special cases make bad law. If in this case we allow our generosity to run away with our judgment we may have cause for regret when we come later to deal with the whole question of governing the Northern Territory and Papua and other waste parts of Australia, where, at the present time, there is no settlement worth speaking of. Although I agree with the remarks of the Honorary Minister and previous speakers that the Northern Territory is entitled to representation in this Parliament, in order that its wishes and requirements may be fully ventilated and understood, I do not think that the mere giving of such representation will prove a panacea for all the ills that have cropped up in the Territory. Those ills can, however, be remedied by some alteration of the present system of governing that area. The Honorary Minister has stated that there are constitutional objections to a vote being given to any person who may be elected to represent the Territory, but I do not think we shall get very far if we burke the issue in that way right at the very commencement. I do not think that there are constitutional grounds which prevent a vote being given to any representative of the Territory. My objection to the giving of a vote is based upon other grounds.

                        <para>A territory which has been surrendered to the Commonwealth by a State, or placed under the authority of the Commonwealth by the Queen, or been otherwise acquired by the Commonwealth, may be allowed representation in either House of the Federal Parliament to the extent and on such terms as the Parliament thinks fit. The representation thus accorded is not representation as a State, but territorial representation. It may be allowed not only - as in the case of new States - " to the extent " which the Parliament thinks fit, but also " on the terms which it thinks fit." Apparently, therefore, the Parliament may not only fix the number of representatives for a territory, but determine - at least in some degree - the mode of representation. In the United States, there being no power to allow the territories to send members to Congress, the organized territories are nevertheless allowed to be represented in Congress by delegates who may speak but not' vote. It would seem clear that under this Constitution the Parliament may, if it thinks fit, allow the representation of territories by delegates of the same kind who, although allowed to sit and speak in the Senate or the House of Representatives, would not be members of either House or entitled to vote therein. The Parliament may, however, under this section, allow a territory to be represented by actual members in either House; and in thai case no terms would be imposed inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution as to mode of election, tenure, and light to vote. The number of representatives which a territory may be allowed is, of course, absolutely in the discretion of Parliament. </para>

                    <para class="block">That, I think, completely disposes of the question as to the standing that any such representative may have. That is a matter entirely for determination by this Parliament. The question arises as to whether it would be fair to the other members of this House, or even the Territory itself, for a member representing so few people as are in the Territory at the present time, to be allowed a vote which might make or unmake Ministries, and might easily have a very big effect upon the financial administration of the Commonwealth. In t,his regard it is well worth while seeing what has been the experience in  the  United States of America. We find that the Territories there have been divided into two classes - the organized and the unorganized. The latter are described as Territories governed from Washington, the seat of Government, and the organized are those which have a large degree of self-government.

                        <para>In what we may call the territorial, as distinguished from the colonial, government, we have a combination of self-government with control by the United States. The Legislature of two Houses is chosen by the people for a term of two years, and its sessions are biennial. The Legislature has almost as full power as the Legislatures of the States, subject, of course, to the negative of Congress. Each Territory chooses a delegate, who sits in the House of Representatives, and may speak on Bills affecting the Territory, though he has no vote. The people also elect all Judges, except the very highest, and all local officials. </para>

                            <para>- It is dated 1902. Of as much importance as the choice of a representative for the Northern Territory, and his right to a vote in this House, is the other question as to how the Territory should be governed - whether it is to continue in. its present unorganized condition, or whether it is to be organized. The experience of the British race throughout the ages has been that the best results are obtained when the British people have full local control of their own government; and, contemporaneously with the giving of representation to the Northern Territory, I would like to see the opportunity taken to properly organize the administrative control of the Territory in the hands of a local Council. I would not suggest that tha Council should' be entirely elective. I think that the methods adopted in Australia before responsible government was given in full could readily be applied; that is to say, the Council should be partly nominee and partly elected. Take a Council of twelve. Six of the members of. that Council could be nominated by the Government of the day as representing various interests in the Territory and the other six could be chosen by the people of the Territory as a whole. The Administrator, of course, would be appointed by the Commonwealth Government. The Council should be given control of the revenue of the Territory, and should be told pretty firmly that it would have to carry on with that, and must not look to be spoon-fed, as the Territory has been so far., I am sure that, with this system in force. the development within the next few years would be much greater than we have hitherto had1. </para>

                            <para>- The present land revenue of the Territory is £18,000. It was more five or six years ago, and I am sure it would he more again if more interest were taken in their conditions. The mining revenue is £2,500, although the value of metals has dropped from £80,000 in the previous year to £20,000. There are many other sources of revenue available. Plenty of States have started both here and in America with revenues not very much larger than that which  would be available to the Council I propose to place in control of the Northern Territory, but in any case it would be better for the Commonwealth Parliament to make a special grant such as has been given to Tasmania, and to tell the people of the Northern Territory that a definite limit will be placed upon the granting of such assistance, or allow them to have their own Customs duties for a period as Western Australia had. The condition o£ affairs one finds in the Northern Territory under the present system of administration is very unsatisfactory. There is an absence of coordination. Three different Departments are responsible to three different capitals - one to Melbourne, one to Brisbane, and another to Adelaide. There is a lack of co-ordination between the territorial administration and other Departments which are responsible to outside heads in the various States. The lack of coordination is so great that vacant offices belonging to the territorial administration have not been made available to officers of other Departments desiring to utilize them for official purposes, and it has been found necessary for other buildings to be rented. When one medical officer went to Darwin he had to reside for several months <inline font-style="italic">ixa</inline> a galvanized iron structure although there were eight Government cottages empty at the time. Ultimately, when he got into one of those cottages he was charged £120 per annum as rent, whereas if he had been a Territorial officer his rent would not have exceeded £80 per annum. Although there are only thirty-two vessels in and out of Port Darwin each year, there is a port health officer as well as a Government medical officer to attend to the boats. One man may have practically nothing to do for two or three weeks in each month. Ordinances have been prepared in Melbourne which are totally unsuited for the district. This condition of affairs is of no use to the Commonwealth or to the Territory itself, and the time is ripe, not only for the people of that part of Australia to have representation in this House, but also for a simultaneous organization of this Territory and all other Territories of the Commonwealth, so that we may be able to secure the best possible local self-government and the mobilization of that capacity for public service which is avail able but is now lying in disuse. Seeing that all that is asked for in this Bill is that the representative of the Northern Territory should have a voice in the Commonwealth Parliament, my view is that his voice should be heard, not in the House of Representatives, but in the Senate. </para>

                            <para>- No ; the matter has been clearly explained by the Honorary Minister in charge of the Bill. Unless the Constitution is amended the member representing the people of the Northern Territory cannot exercise a vote in this House. </para>

                    <para>The honorable member for Herbert has quoted figures to show that the taxation collected in the Northern Territory is very small; but his comparison is most unfair, because most of the big pastoral  companies operating in the Territory pay their income tax in Brisbane and Sydney, and a  number  pay it in South Australia. There is a member of the Senate who in the year 1919 paid £8,000 in income tax, upon one pastoral property situated in the Northern Territory, and that amount was not paid into the revenue at Darwin. The same remark applies to the Customs and Excise collections on the commodities consumed by the people of the Northern Territory. Consequently, it is unfair to regard the revenue receipts at Darwin itself as a reflex of the actual amount of taxation derived by the Commonwealth Treasury  from the people of the Territory. </para>

                            <para>- The remission of taxation will not prove a panacea for the ills from which the people of the Territory are suffering. The real point is the policy of development; but that matter is not now under discussion. The Bill may not go as far as I would like, or as far as the people affected would like, but it goes practically all the way. The only method by which these people can get their cause championed at the present time is to write letters to members of this Parliament. By every mail from Darwin I get letters from people asking me to do something to remedy anomalies in the postal service, and so forth. It should be the duty of a member representing the district to look after these matters, and I am pleased to see that one clause of the Bill stipulates that the person elected to represent the Territory must be a resident of the Territory. It seems to me a preposterous proposal to suggest that an area which covers 500,000 square miles should be tacked on to an existing State electorate. I believe that I have spoken to more people who have lived, and who are living, in the Northern Territory than has any other member of this House, and I can say confidently that the provisions of this Bill will be generally acceptable to them. The question of according a vote will come along later, when the representative comes down to the House; but, on the principle that half a loaf is better than no bread, I should imagine that the situation will be met by having a representative, even although he may have no vote. In regard to the proposal that the people in outlying parts should vote by post, seeing that the mails are brought in from some outlying districts not more than once in six weeks, and as it is possible that election returns may not be got in under seven or eight weeks, it may be necessary to extend the time allowed for the reception of postal votes. A remark waa made by the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> about the right to vote possessed by a person who pays taxation. I remind the honorable member that he is not blameless, seeing that he is a member of the party which at one time struck off the statute-book the legislation which gave the right of postal voting. It will be seen, therefore, that there are disabilities that have obtained in the southern populated portions of this country as well as in the Territory. </para>

                        <para>.- I am pleased that this Bill has been introduced, for I regard it as a step in the right' direction. At the same time, it is not a complete measure, inasmuch as it does not give the prospective representative all the rights that are enjoyed by other members of this Parliament. The honorable member for Herbert <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bamford)</inline> seems to be "out of his stride" to-day. He says that we are all prepared to advocate the rights of the people of the Northern Territory and the Federal Territory. This reminds me of the old battle for1 the franchise, when those who possessed votes could not see why those who did not should worry,- because those with votes were able and willing to represent them. I am afraid that the honorable member has been carried back fifty or sixty years, if we may judge by the argument he uses. We are not here representing the Northern Territory, and the people there desire direct representation. They are on the outposts of the Commonwealth, and are doing valuable pioneering work in that part of the country, and under the circumstances they are entitled to every advantage that we can give them. It is to pur interests to induce as many people as possible to make their homes in the distant parts of the Commonwealth, and the best way to attain that end is to give them all full citizen rights and privileges. Some comment has been- made on the small number of people to be represented, but I notice that at the first Federal election a senator for Tasmania was elected with 1,199 votes, and many were returned with 2,000 and 3,000 votes. Tasmania sent six senators, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> the highest on the poll, had 3,700 votes, while the lowest, the one I first quoted, had 1,199 votes. A similar state of affairs prevailed throughout the States. </para>

It will be seen that the same remark as to the smallness of the population to be represented applies equally to Tasmania, Western Australia, and other States. I may say that the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Philip</inline> Fysh, another Tasmanian member, was elected with 1,794 votes. In the Territory there are 1,700 people entitled to vote, and, in the face of the figures I have quoted, they cannot be denied the privilege. </para>

                            <para>- At any rate, the representatives of Tasmania should be quite prepared to give the Northern Territory people the right to a representative. If representation is to be according to population, Tasmania has too many members, not only here, but in the Senate. I do not object to Tasmania having its present number of representatives, but I think the same privilege should be given to the people of the Northern Territory, where there is so much developmental work to be done; and it is our duty to make the people there as contented and happy as possible. We are prepared to allow the proposed representative to come here and, financially and otherwise, receive the same treatment as is given to other members of the House. That being so, it would cost no more to extend to him the right of voting, and thus give him a higher standing amongst those whom he represents. So far as I understand, it will not be possible, according to the Bill, for the representative of the  Northern Territory to be placed on any committee. However, I hope the time is not far distant when the residents of Canberra will- also have the right to representation in this House, and the same applies to New Guinea, and the Pacific Islands which we control. The people in the places I have mentioned pay taxation, and, therefore, are entitled to representation. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think so. We should not be entirely guided by what has been done under the United States of America Constitution; we are, I think, so far as our legislation goes, a little beyond the United States of America, and we ought to give facilities for the widest expression of opinion by the people of Australia. I hope the Bill will be passed as something better than nothing, but, at the same time, I think the Government are losing a golden opportunity to settle this question and satisfy the people of the Territory. </para>

                        <para>. -  I think this Bill is a mistake. It, apparently, satisfies nobody in the House. There are some who think that the Territory is not ripe for1 representation,, while there are others who think it is overripe; but neither party appears to consider the Bill satisfactory. That is chiefly, I take it, because of the extraordinary type of member that it is proposed to create for the first time in Australian history. He is to be here with a large mouth, which he may exercise incessantly within the Standing Orders, but he cannot say " yea " or " nay " to any of the questions which he himself has raised and which are special to the Territory or general to the Commonwealth. He is not to be a constituent of a quorum. He cannot be counted, according to the Bill, by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> or officers of the House, with a view, to determining whether in a given case, the constitutional number is present. He cannot be regarded as a member of an absolute majority of the House, and he cannot be  Speaker  or  Chairman  of Committees. He is to be the first parliamentary eunuch in Australia. I marvel that a man of such powerful physique and. such outstanding qualities of intellect, as the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Granville Ryrie),</inline> should have been given by his colleagues the duty of carrying so deformed an infant into this Chamber as the creature that is to be born of this Bill if it passes - that such a man should be the father, or the proclaimed father, of it. I shall vote for the creation of no representative that has no vote. If we are going to do the tiling at all let us do it properly. </para>

                    <para>I believe that the original intention of the Government to give representation in the Senate to the Territory was a wise one. The mistake was made, I think, when they drafted a Bill which refused a vote to the prospective senator. In my opinion, the Governmentthis session ought to hark back to a proposition to give a fully-fledged senator to the Northern Territory, if they consider it wise; and foa- such a proposal I should vote. I shall not vote to create another member of this House with the full powers of an ordinary member, when his total constituency numbers only 1,700. That would not be one vote, one value, as is so strenuously and frequently recommended by honorable members on the Opposition benches. It is conceivable that a man might enter this House with 850 votes, and determine, not only the fate of measures, but the fate of Governments - determine the death or birth of Administrations and of parties. This constituency, I say, is not sufficiently organized, or sufficiently developed to warrant its participation to that extent in the exercise of the power of the Commonwealth of Australia. If we are to give those people representation, let us give it to them in such a way that it does not carry the power to determine the fate of Governments. It is perfectly true, as the honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> has said, that the American people have builded very wisely in the establishment of two forms of territorial government and representation. There must be a definite development of the Territory, and a definite basis of organization, before it can be admitted, in the first place, to local government; and, in the second place, to territorial representation in the House of Representatives at Congress; and, in the third place, to the status of a State. Right through the years, long before the Louisiana purchase, when the original territories were handed to the care of the primal thirteen States, the regulation for the government of those developing Territories were gradually made. We have almost 150 years of the experience of the great Republic of the West, as to how we should sanction and encourage local government and representation of the sparsely-populated Territories of a community like this; and we should follow the example set. If that were done, this Bill would not provide for representation of the Northern Territory in either House, but for the recognition of Papua, which is a much more highly-developed entity of the Commonwealth, than is the Northern Territory. Papua has an Administrator, and a local Council, with certain legislative as well as administrative functions. </para>

                            <para>- It distributes its own revenue, and occasionally it asks for assistance, either in the form of a subsidy or of a loan to be repaid later to the Central Treasury. This is a Territory that levies tribute on the Commonwealth, and has never yet been asked to live within its income, nor has its ability to do so been tested. In spite of the agitation which has taken place, the Northern Territory, judged by the standard of Papua, is not yet ripe for representation in either House of the Commonwealth Parliament; and I cannot understand why the Government has offered the small number of persons there a kind of hybrid representation because their complaints have been long and loud, and yet has suggested nothing for Papua. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; and the American practice has been that the first form of representation to be granted shall be local. When a Territory has obtained sufficient population, and is sufficiently organized, to warrant the grant of local government, it gets it. Later it may become entitled to claim its second privilege, namely, representation in Congress  without a vote; and, finally, it may obtain full State representation and status. There are huge areas in Australia which, as the "new State movement" for which certain honorable gentlemen here are responsible proclaims, are suffering under disability in more practical form than the sparsely populated Northern Territory. In time to come, the fragments which break off the. larger States may be given the primal status of Territories, and we shall have to devise a system consonant with our Constitution to give them temporary representation while they are developing, and while their population is growing. </para>

The honorable member for Bass <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jackson),</inline> who has visited the Territory recently, tells us that the people there await this measure thinking' that it will help them along the road of development, but net regarding it as particularly useful, or constitutionally defensible. If we pass this measure because a population of 1,700 persons wishes us to do so, we shall be laying down a principle of representation which will be adversely commented on as Australia grows, and cannot be defended. I suggest to the Minister to hold over the Bill, which is in no sense a party measure, and to take consultation with the interests in the House that desire to give fair play to the residents of the Territory and at the same time to preserve the principles of our Constitution. We should see if we cannot evolve a better measure than this. </para>

There, for totally different reasons, from 1903 to 1906 special representation was given to the civil servants and railway servants of Victoria. The representatives of those bodies had the right to vote, but they were, and were expected to be, special advocates, and although both representatives were, I think, peculiarly fitted for the work they undertook, they made night hideous with their cries about service privileges, increments, and salaries, so that the Parliament, at the first opportunity, chopped out the system of separate representation with an axe. </para>

Before the Northern Territory is given representation at the Seat of Government, its population and development must be sufficient to warrant such recognition. It would be best to withdraw the measure, in order to see if a better one could be devised to give fair play to these people. If that course is taken, we shall not have to subsequently destroy the -work that we are now being asked to do. Should a division be taken, I shalL vote against the Bill. </para>

                        <para>. - I have stated before that the Northern Territory will always be a source of trouble to the Commonwealth while we continue to administer it on the lines that we are now following. Pastoral occupation, as it was known in the old days in the bigger States of the Union, is gradually giving way in those States to closer settlement, which is a good thing for Australia. But if we wish to develop the Northern Territory, the most natural way to do so will be to make available there to pastoralists leaseholds of a reasonable area. We should also provide a measure of self-government sufficient to create a feeling of self-respect and citizenship among the people of the Territory. I agree with the last  speaker  that more development is needed there. The appointment of " Pooh-Bah " officials to govern the Territory, its people being taxed without representation, makes for dissatisfaction and retards development. If the Minister does not act on the suggestion of the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt),</inline> and postpone the consideration of the Bill in order that the principle which should govern the representation of the Northern Territory may be further considered, I shall yet- vote for it, because I think that the people of the Northern Territory should be heard in this House. I should like to know at first hand their opinions on matters in which they are concerned. </para>

                            <para>- I would expect that some one of discretion would be chosen to represent the Northern Territory, and that he would not speak except on subjects in which his constituents were interested, because he would have no vote. It would be foolish of the House to decline to receive such first-hand information. Were such a member given the right to vote, there would be a violation of the representative principles of our Constitution, and other segregated sections in Australia might ask for similar treatment. I do not know that it would not be better to postpone the Bill to give the House time to reconsider the whole question of the administration and representation of the Territories. But the development of the Northern Territory can best be advanced by the adoption of the method I have mentioned. The pastoral interests of this country may be relied upon to develop the Territory, and the only officials needed there are a magistrate and a few policemen, the Commonwealth acting as its protector. When the Territory has been sufficiently developed, it will have acquired a status qualifying it to join the Federation of States. </para>

                    <para class="block">Since the Government intend to provide for the representation of the Northern Territory in the House of Representatives, the representative should be given something more than a merely speaking part in our deliberations. It would be absurd to expect that, upon the ringing of the division bells, he should be required to stalk out of the chamber. It would be more than absurd; it would be utterly unsatisfactory to the people of the Territory. They would never be content with such a half measure of representation. No honorable member, were he a resident of our far-northern areas, would " stand for " it. Those people are Britishers, like ourselves; they are probably almost all farmer residents of 0 le various States, who at one time enjoyed full rights of citizenship. They are willing and anxious to do what they can in the direction of developing the Northern Territory. I know that if I were selected to represent them I would refuse to sit  in this Chamber merely with a voice and bereft of a vote. Prior to the taking over of the Territory from South Australia, the people of the far north were given full representation in the South Australian House of Assembly; the members for the Territory had the right to vote, just as had all the other members. The Commonwealth cannot claim to have done much for the Northern Territory so far. We have actually taken from its residents those rights of citizenship which they formerly enjoyed. One cannot wonder at their present dissatisfaction. From time to time the Government issue Ordinances to keep these people in their place. I appeal to honorable members for fair play and for the preservation of British rights of citizenship. We welcome the proposal of the Government as amounting to a step in the right direction. But it is no more than a step; it gets the people of the Territory very little further forward. I believe in according representation upon the basis of numbers, so far as may be possible, and in giving to one vote one value. But, so far as the Territory is concerned, the application of those principles would <inline font-style="italic">be</inline> impossible. The Territory has only a very small number of residents, but they are so far removed from the heart df affairs in the Commonwealth that they should receive special consideration rather than a total lack of it. If we can make them, satisfied with their lot, they will do their best to improve their conditions. They will help enthusiastically in the Territory's development. We cannot hope to populate those far parts if we do not accord their proposed representative in this Chamber complete rights and privileges. </para>

                        <para>. - The Government cannot accept the amendment. In my view, a more grotesque suggestion has never been made in this Chamber. It is absurd to advocate that there should be given a vote in this House to the representative of probably 800 or 900 electors. I mention that approximate number for the reason that there would probably not be more votes cast at an election by the adult population of the Northern Territory. I have been taken to task by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton),</inline> and accused of bias because of certain references which I made to a class of people at Port Darwin. I admit that I have referred to the workmen, or - as I called them - " the so-called workers," of the Northern Territory as Bolsheviks. These are the people who will be concerned in sending a representative into this Chamber. I do not deny that I applied the epithet "Bolsheviks"; but lie Leader of the Opposition further alleged that I had taunted those same people with the fact that they had no vote in the Commonwealth Legislature. If I said that they had not, I did not speak with any serious intent. Emphatically, I had no thought of saying so as a taunt. I have possibly been the victim of a misdirected joke. If I have been recorded in the cold print of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> as having said what the honorable member for Hunter suggests, I must admit that my joking comment would be likely to be taken seriously. I say now that I fearlessly made the statement that the so-called workers of Darwin were Bolsheviks; but I have never said that they were Bolsheviks because they had no vote or voice in this Parliament. I did not say that they should not have votes. I maintain that they are entitled to- the representation which the Government now purpose giving them. With respect to the term " Bolshevik," I do not know that I should not appeal, for the correct definition, to the honorable member who knows everything. I refer to the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan).</inline> I have had in mind that a Bolshevik is one who is an extremist, at all events, in industrial matters. All extremists nowadays are liable to be called Bolsheviks. I desire to show now that I had justification for speaking of certain persons in Darwin as Bolsheviks. I ask honorable members to listen attentively to a quotation which I shall make from the report of the Administrator, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Urquhart,</inline> for the year ended 30th June, 1921. </para>

                        <para>Socially the Darwin community , was as a house divided against itself, and the consequence assigned in Scripture to such a state has not failed to ensue. On the one hand were the extremists, who talked of " Soviets " and kindred nonsense, and on the other (unfortunately in a minority) were the few who struggled and protested bravely against the blatant and shameless tyranny exercised by the extremists in the misused names of " Labour " and" Unionism," while striving to keep the lamp of freedom, as known to the law and the Constitution, still burning. And so the House of Darwin's and the Northern Territory's prosperity fell, and fell upon evil days indeed. Production stopped, industry ceased, shipping disappeared, no capital came into the Territory for investment, and unemployment immediately presented an ugly problem to be dealt iwith. </para>
                        <para>Itwas not easy to discover what actual or tangible grievances could be pleaded by way of justification for the attitude of the extremists. Wages were high, cost of living, though high, was not excessive, conditions as good as the disadvantages of a tropical climate permitted, every concession demanded by the unions seemed to have been readily accorded by employers, while " go slow," " job control," and all things dear to the heart of the extremist were in full and unobstructed operation. </para>

When, with the westward march of the whites, any particular region became sufficiently settled to require a regular Government, its boundaries were set and it was made into a territory. </para>

There are others, however, in the island possessions. The territories send neither senators nor representatives to Congress; neither do they take part in presidential elections. The House of Representatives, however, admits a delegate from each one of them to sit and speak, but not, of course, to vote. </para>

                        <para>.- I did not seek in any pedantic way to find fault with the Honorary Minister for his lack of knowledge of the Constitution. What I did say was that the Minister intrusted with the conduct of this measure had given the House his view of the constitutional position, but had not supported that view with any argument. Any objection he raised was brushed aside by quotations from the Constitution which were open to all, and which were readily and aptly applied by the Leader of the Opposition, who may be presumed to have no more expert knowledge of the Constitution than has the Minister himself.  </para>

                            <para>- It rested with the Minister to make an answer to our interpretation of the plain terms of section 122. The Minister does not claim to have any special knowledge of constitutional law, nor do I; but I presumed that, having made his declaration as to the limitations which the Constitution imposes, he would have backed it by the opinion of the Attorney-General or some other authority. But that he did not do. On the contrary, the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> entered the chamber, and, lolling back in his seat, declared, in the most off-hand way, that there was nothing whatever in the view put forward by the Minister in charge of the Bill, and that this Parliament has power to give to the representative of the Northern Territory a vote as well as a voice in the deliberations of this Chamber. Action of that kind on the part of the Government does invite criticism and condemnation. </para>

                            <para>- Not only that, but Ministers are treating this Committee in a very contemptuous way. The contradictory statements of Ministers satisfy me that the Honorary Minister gave the House his own impression of the Constitution, which he could not support by any authority, and that neither he nor his colleague who interjected had taken the trouble to verify the divergent views they expressed. I was very much interested in the competition in superlatives between the Minister himself and a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Urquhart,</inline> who' went to the Northern Territory, took a casual glance at the conditions there,, and came back and published political propaganda of an exceedingly objectionable and provocative character. </para>

If the honorable gentleman will recollect the anxious face of the Government Whip at times as he runs about the precincts of the chamber counting heads and marshalling his forces, he will admit that my vote is infinitely more effective than my speeches. And that illustrates the point I am making in regard to the Territory. The right to speak may have little or no influence. The really potent thing is the right to record a vote. </para>

                    <para>I rose particularly to reply to an argument advanced- by the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt).</inline> He said it was almost unthinkable, and unquestionably  improper, that a representative of a mere 1,700 people should possibly have the power of making or unmaking Governments in this, the people's, House. I do not know that it would be very shocking, because that representative would not be able to make or unmake the Government ( except when parties were  almost evenly divided. When parties are in that state I cannot think for a moment that the fact of the member for the Northern Territory tipping the balance one -way or the other would be repugnant to democratic forms of Government. The honorable member for Balaclava spoke also of Papua. . We are not here to deny to Papua any rights that may be claimed for the Northern Territory. It may even be practicable to make the representative of the Northern Territory representative of Papua also. At all events, Papua, no doubt, feels that it should be represented in this Parliament, and I agree with that view. The honorable member for Balaclava suggested that with the growth of the new States movement and the possible creation of new States, the whole question of represent tion would require to be reconsidered, and possibly the evolution of new States would take the form of the creation of new Territories. I venture to say that in the development of Australia there never can be circumstances parallel with the existence of the great area called the Northern Territory. The honorable member could hardly have considered she area and extent of this, the first and greatest of Commonwealth Territories, when he suggested that the possible breaking up of existing States into . smaller areas would proceed on a territorial basis. There can be no parallel. This is geographically a tremendous part of the Commonwealth, and it has come into being comparatively early in the history of the Commonwealth. Its facts  and circumstances are unique. They stand alone. For that reason we are in no danger of setting a dangerous precedent for the future. We could safely extend to the representative of the Territory the right to a vote in this Chamber. I agree with the honorable member for Balaclava that possibly the residents of the Territory feel, and I would agree with them, that more important even than their representation here, would be a wise system of local government. They are more concerned possibly with the control of their own affairs in their own Territory than with representation in this Chamber; but my answer to that point is that, while local government is pre-eminently a most important matter, the Territory is, unfortunately, dependent on this Parlia-ment, and upon a Minister who is responsible to this Parliament, and in all the greater and more important matters relating to the Territory their interests are swayed this way and that by Ordinances approved by an absentee Minister, who knows very. little about their local conditions. When the representative of the Territory speaks here, and, .as  I  should hope, votes here, he will be  a  very important means for helping to establish sane local government in the Territory. At all events, he will help to remove the shackles which this Parliament imposes on local government. Of course, local government is in existence there at the present time, but it is hampered largely by the actions of absentee administrators. That is the reason why the representation of the Territory in this Parliament becomes important. It will fashion a useful link between the administration in Melbourne and the - administration in Darwin. There is no reason . why we should limit the rights of the representative here because local government is necessary. Certainly, that matter is of first importance, but, unfortunately, it is rendered largely abortive by the mischievous interference of Ministers in Melbourne, who know very little about conditions in the Territory, and hamper them in every way, creating disaffection and dissatisfaction which, instead of being understood and removed, are merely made the subject of a jesting and ill-considered comment, such as that of which the Honorary Minister has frankly acknowledged himself 'to have been guilty. </para>

                        <para>.- If the Bill goes through, giving the people of the Territory a representative here, who, however., will have no vote in this House, the date fixed for the proclamation of the Act should be the 1st April next. It is an absolute farce to give people  a  representative who will not have the right to vote in Parliament. I cannot imagine anything more undignified than that  a  representative of portion of Australia should speak in this House and yet be continually getting up and leaving the chamber when divisions are taken. The position is very much the same as that of giving . a man a . gun and preventing him from having cartridges. If it be deemed desirable that the Northern Territory should have a representative in this Parliament, he should carry all the weight of any other representative here. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly. I cannot conceive of a question affecting any part of Australia which does not equally concern the people of the Northern Territory. They are interested just as much as are the residents of any other portion of Australia in every measure on the business-paper to-day. Surely we can afford to be generous to the residents of the Northern Territory, and do the decent thing by them. With many other honorable members I believe that if they are given self-adminis-tration their Territory will develop more speedily and with considerable advantage to the pockets of the general taxpayers of Australia. Instead of the incredible folly of a proposal to make the railway gauges uniform, I think it is far better to set out upon a programme of connecting this outlying Territory by railway communication with the larger centres of population. I shall vote for the amendment, with which I am in entire agreement. </para>

Why are the people in the district in which Washington is situated disfranchised <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> The reason was given to me by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Bell,</inline> the inventor of the telephone. He told me that it was because there was such a large proportion of blacks in Washington that they dominated the Legislature and made it corrupt. I can imagine the Honorary Minister saying in regard to the recent trouble at Darwin, " A whiff of grape shot would also settle that trouble." The little corporal who used those famous words was not so great in bulk as is the Honorary Minister in charge of this Bill, but his mental qualities were much greater than those of any honorable member of this Parliament, and he would not have suggested the use of a whiff of grape shot at Darwin. Let me tell the Honorary Minister that if similar trouble had occurred in some of the western States of America, the men administering the affairs of the Territory would have been shot or hanged, and I am not sure that the vote of the people of Australia would not have justified their action, so infamous was the control at Darwin as exercised by the officials there from Judge Bevan down to the least of them. The Honorary Minister has quoted from the report of the present Administrator. I cannot forget that he is an ex-policeman who was fined in a paltry Police Court. Fancy the Governor of "Victoria or the Governor-General of the Commonwealth being fined in a Police Court ! The Colonial Office would recall him at once.

The Minister, as a soldier and as a comrade of that great man, will agree that that was a noble return for a noble act.

                            <para>- The representative may, on matters affecting the Northern Territory, voice the views of his constituents, but he will have no vote. Outside of that he will count for little here. What inducement will there be for a man to come to the Seat of Government, and sit in the House for hour after hour and day after day, waiting for some question affecting the Northern Territory to arise? He will not be expected to take part in the discussion of the ordinary business of the House, having no vote, but, should he do so, I imagine that an occasion will arise when he will be told to mind his own concerns. I hope that the day will come when we shall have an opportunity to reconsider this matter, and that we shall then give to the representative of the Northern Territory the full rights that we ourselves possess. </para>

                        <para>.- This clause enacts that the provisions of the Parliamentary Allowances Act 1920 shall apply in relation to the member representing the Northern Territory, and seems to place him. in a highly favorable position, because later there may be an amendment of that Act. Therefore, I suggested to the Attorney-General that the clause should be amended to read,. " the Parliamentary Allowances Act for the time being." I was informed by the honorable and learned gentleman that there is a Statute in force which declares that, should an Act which is quoted in another Act be amended, the reference to it is to be read as a reference to the amended Act. </para>

                    <para>The measure is one for discussion in Committee rather than at this stage. It amends the original Act, altering the electoral machinery with a view to safeguarding and facilitating the conduct of elections. The first amendment is contained in clause 2, and is an amendment of section 39 of the principal Act. At the present time a person who has resided in a division for one month is entitled to be enrolled for that division, and sometimes his name remains on the divisional roll after he has removed to another division. It is proposed to add a proviso to section 39, providing that an elector whose real place of living is not in the division for which he is enrolled, shall not be entitled to vote for that division if,  since his enrolment, he has at any time before the commencement of the period of twenty-one days before the issue of a writ for an election become entitled to be enrolled for another division. </para>

Of course, a person who is only temporarily absent from his division, and has the fixed intention of returning to live in it, is not affected by this provision. In Australia many men are nomadic, wandering from place to place in earning their livelihood, and so long as a man's permanent home is in the division for which he is enrolled, he is entitled to vote for that division. </para>

To give full effect to this alteration of the law, clause 14 repeals section 115 of the principal Act, and inserts another section in 'its stead. This new section contains the list of questions which the presiding officer shall put to every person claiming to vote. It adds to the questions provided for in the principal Act these questions: - </para>

                    <para>The next important amendment made in the existing law is contained in clause 3, which inserts in the principal Act a new section, 72a, providing that candidates nominated for election to the Senate may claim to have their names grouped in the ballot-papers in the manner prescribed. The object of this amendment is to assist the electors in voting. The number of names on a Senate voting paper is often very large, and the candidates are not so intimately known to the electors as are the candidates for seats in this House. The desire is to inform the electors that certain candidates belong to certain groups. </para>

Australia is a very large country; its electors are widely scattered, and it is very difficult to make legal provision against every contingency. But every elector is entitled to vote at any polling place in respect ef the electorate in which he is enrolled. In the matter of absent voting, however, this substitution of the word "may" for "shall" will prevent an election from being declared invalid in the event of the discovery of a shortage of one or more ballot-papers for absent voters. </para>

It may be that such a power is highly necessary, and that the ends of- justice are frustrated by its absence. It seems strange that in a proceeding which involves the question of the proper conduct of an election, when information is sought which exists only in the rolls and other documents in the custody of public officers, a petitioner is not entitled to the discovery that is here sought.

                        <para>The Australian Act differs very considerably from the English legislation in several respects relevant to this case. Particularly I refer to the duty of the Court in the case of official errors. In England it is enacted that no election shall be declared invalid by reason of noncompliance with the election rule or mistake in the use of the forms, if it appears to the tribunal (1) that the election was conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the body of the Act, and (2) that such noncompliance or mistake did not affect the result of the election. In other words, if the matter is left so that the mistake may have affected the result, the election may be declared invalid. Under our Act it is different. By section 194 it is provided that " no election shall be avoided ... on account of the . . . error of any officer which shall not be proved to have affected the result of the election." The " result " means the return of the particular candidate, and not the number of his majority. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">Honorable members will observe the difference between the two Statutes. The Commonwealth electoral . law provides that no election shall be avoided/ on account of an error which shall not be proved to have affected the result of the election,, whereas the English law provides that no election shall be invalid by reason of any mistake if it appears to the tribunal that- the mistake did not affect the result of the election. Clause 27 proposes to apply the wording of the English law, and do away with the necessity for admitting evidence as to how a  voter intended te vote. The Bill also proposes to continue as a permanent measure that provision in the War-time Electoral Act which prevents the States from taking a referendum on Federal election day. The High Court has established our power to do that in the Queensland appeal case, <inline font-style="italic">Ex parte Daniell.</inline> We are, therefore, inserting this new clause -  218a. On the day appointed as polling day for an election of the Senate or a general election of the House of Representatives or the day fixed for the taking of the votes of electors for the purposes of a referendum held under the provisions of the Referendum (Constitution Alteration) Act 1906-1919, no election or referendum or vote of the electors of any State or part of a State shall, without the authority of the Governor-General, be held or taken under the law of a State. </para>

The reduction in our expenditure from revenue this year is £3,000,000, and one hopes that, in due course, the revenue will follow the same lines as the expenditure has followed in the Estimates for the present year. At any rate, taxation is being remitted this year, and it is hoped that, as the years go by, it will be further remitted. The relief given on the present occasion is, of necessity, limited, and in arriving at its extent consideration has been given to the object of enabling all classes to share in it.

                        <para>- I regret that that suggestion has been made, because it shows a fundamental misconception of that for which the National party and the NationalGovernment stand. We are in the unique and enviable position in this House of representing all classes of the community, and of necessity, in our endeavours to do justice to all, our remissions of taxation have fallen upon all classes. The suggestion that ours is an electioneering Budget is nothing less than an outrage and a gross misconception of the whole position. </para>

                <para>But while we are endeavouring to help every class, we are, in the first place, giving relief so that it may aid and assist in development and production. This, I believe, we are doing in our present proposal, because we realize that the best production is secured when those who are primarily concerned in producing get what I may describe as invigorating relaxation. If the industrial classes, who are those most concerned, have an opportunity for that relaxation which is so necessary if they are going to give us of their best, we should get the maximum of production. The other side of the picture, of course, is that the remission of this taxation will help m providing opportunities for education to those of small means and to the children of this country.. We have had many great scientific developments of recent years, and the removal of the tax upon low-priced tickets should offer more abundant facilities for education to those who are best able to profit by them. The remission of the tax as proposed will benefit those who are least able to bear the charge upon the tickets which they have to purchase for entertainment which may be either relaxation or education to them. </para>

                <para>These, broadly, are the reasons that have actuated the Government in submitting this motion. In my opinion, an entertainments tax' is one of those things in which a Federal Government, with a broad national policy, should not be concerned, and it was nothing but the obligations of the war that brought the Commonwealth Government into  thi3  field of taxation. </para>

                        <para>- I regret that at this moment we cannot get out of it com-pletely. We cannot give more than a certain measure of relief at the present moment, but so far as we have been able to shed this form of taxation we have done so. When opportunity offers, I hope that the Federal Government will leave this particular field entirely to other Administrations. It is not a natural field in which we should gather revenue. </para>

                <para>The measure of relief now to  be  afforded is the fullest that we can give, having regard to the keeping of a fair balance among all the classes entitled to benefit by a relaxation of the taxation burden out of the amount that we have at our disposal. Suggestions have been made that we should have exempted the ls. ticket also, but, as that would involve a loss of revenue to the extent of another £130,000, we could not contemplate a relaxation to that extent at this moment. The relief proposed to be given will  be  of direct benefit to the public, because the entertainments tax has always been paid by the community in addition to the price of admission. A suggestion that this is not so has been raised since I have been speaking, but the facts are that the tax has been added to the price of admission,, so that the relief proposed to  be  given will- go to the community itself, and not to the proprietors of picture shows or promoters df other forms of entertainment. The Government are moving in this direction because they  believe  that it will be conferring a benefit upon the community, and not because, as has been suggested, it will be a sop to a particular class. I have endeavoured to show what a direct bearing this remission will have upon the whole of our national life. I recommend the motion to the Committee in the hope that it will be accepted by all sides, and passed through with little discussion. It is a measure of relief that is almost overdue, and I think that in applying it now we are only doing something that is just and proper, and which will prove to be of considerable benefit to the whole community. </para>

                    <para>.- The Committee will agree that the Government's proposal is a step in- the right direction; but when the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> reminds us that it is not a political sop for electioneering purposes, and claims that any one who says that it is is guilty of an outrage, I take the opportunity of assuring him that it has been brought forward for no other pur-pose. When my late Leader <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> was fighting with the object of securing the reduction now proposed, and even a greater measure of relief, the Government were very obstinate. They stood then for gathering all they possibly could under the entertainments tax, but, as in other cases, they adopt a different attitude now that au election is within easy distance. </para>

                        <para>- I should say that the 9th December would be within easy distance. The Treasurer is at great pains to assure us that this remission of taxation is for the benefit of the people as a whole; but it is well known that it is for the benefit of people who are attending picture-shows and similar entertainments where they are charged up to ls. I think the Treasurer would only be doing justice, in view of his own statement as to this field of taxation being left to the States, if he were to wipe it out altogether; or apply it only to the higher priced seats at theatres. </para>

                        <para>- The Treasurer has told us that this taxation was imposed with the idea of raising additional revenue for financing the war. In 1919 the revenue collected was £355,000, in 1920 it was £551,000, in 1921 it was £641,000, and in 1922 it is estimated to be £675,000. It will be seen that under his present proposals the Treasurer will get considerably more than he did in 1920, when the war was over. </para>

                        <para>- It is always " rot " when we are about to go to the country to tell the people the truth. This remission of taxation is for the purpose of rote catching, and for no other. The Government are remitting the taxation of companies, and of people with large incomes; and then we are told we are talking "rot" if we state the facts of the position. But these facts cannot be hidden from the public; indeed, it is our business to let the public know them. The Treasurer will not admit the accuracy of what I am now saying, but we can all read between the lines of his statement, and he is candid enough not to deny that there is some reason for the impression. Other Ministers, however, do not like the truth to be told, but the truth will out - it cannot be camouflaged. It is well known that a number of measures are being introduced here because the Government are going to the country, and for no other reason. The Treasurer told us that after the election the Government hope to remit more taxation. </para>

                <para>I have no opposition to offer to a measure which will reduce the burden which the poorer classes of the country are carrying at the present time. This taxation, as I say, was imposed to assist in paying the cost of the war, and it should be removed as quickly as possible from the shoulders of those who are least able to bear it. The people who attend picture shows, and pay taxation charges up to ls. admission, can ill afford, generally speaking, such charges, small as they are, out of their scanty earnings. I regret the Bill does not go further, and begin the taxation at admission charges of 3s. </para>

                    <para>. - There was a saying of Pitt, in speaking of taxation, that the  Goat  might be taxed off a man's back so long as he did not know how it was done, because then he was not in a position to place his finger on those who took it. From, what I can gather, that seems to be the method favoured by the Government and the Opposition in the collection of taxation; they prefer indirect means, so thafc those who have to pay do not know how it is done, or whom to blame. This is a direct tax, and because of that, and because it is felt to be onerous, it is to be removed. But in view of the position of the country, how can we remove taxation in this way ? The Government, in carefully graded doses, are removing taxation, and in the case of the entertainments tax are exempting all admission fees up to ls. We are told by the Treasurer that this remission will mean such an increase in " invigorating relaxation," to use his own words, that the production of the country will be enormously increased. The policy and attitude of the Treasurer reminds me  -  I suppose this is the influence of the pictures we have just seen in the Queen's Hall - of the medicine-man of a savage tribe who carefully puts a pinch of this here, and a pinch of that there, in order to work his charm.. That is the method adopted by the Treasurer in his remissions of taxation. However, I think the public will, without difficulty, see through these devices. Disguise it as we may, the position is that, if these remissions of taxation take place, the revenue of the Commonwealth for the ensuing twelve months will be £2,700,000 less than the expenditure. The Treasurer speaks lightheartedly about further remissions, but he cannot see further than another year ahead, from that point of view, unless there is some definite alteration made in regard to the expenditure. Under the circumstances, I cannot be a party to the remission of taxation on what I regard as a luxury, because luxuries should, in my opinion, be utilized in this way to assist in paying our indebtedness incurred by the war. The Treasurer, as I say, draws a beautiful picture of the " invigorating relaxation " that will result from this remission of taxation. If the honorable gentleman were a member of my profession he would know that eye damage may be done to young children who attend too frequently at picture shows, owing, in many cases, to the continuous flickering on the screen. I can scarcely see where the "invigorating relaxation" comes in, except that perhaps afforded by the eating of peanuts during the entertainments. </para>

                        <para>- There are numerous forms of relaxation that cannot be said to be invigorating. In my opinion, this tax on amusements should be retained. I should agree with the Treasurer if he said we were going to leave this field of taxation completely to the States, but, at the present time, the proposal is one made merely to improve the position of the Government in the electorates. No attempt has been made to bring the expenditure within the revenue, and I see no reason why this taxation, which is a tax on luxury, should be remitted under the circumstances. </para>

                    <para>.- I am in accord with the views expressed by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce);</inline> but there is one matter to which I should like to draw his attention, and that is the way in which the tax is collected. When this legislation was introduced some years ago, the proprietors of picture shows and other entertainments were required to provide their own printed matter. Where they were working under bond, they were given tickets by the Department instead of their having to stamp thom, and they had to supply a yearly or half-yearly audited account. I have had some little experience in running picture shows, and I can assure honorable members that the collection of the tax is not a simple matter. There is a large amount of clerical work, and this, with the necessary audit, has all to be paid for by the  entertainment proprietor. 1 suggest that the Treasurer might intimate that the Department is prepared to have this auditing done by Government auditors, who are to be found in each of the States, so that the charge may not fall on the proprietors of the houses of entertainment. Many people think that those proprietors are making " a mint of money," but, as a fact, those who are making the money are those who sell the films. If the Government are looking for extra revenue, they might, as I suggested some time ago, impose on the films an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty instead of the  1½d.  per foot as at present. However, I  trust  that, at any rate, the other suggestions I have made will receive attention. </para>

                        <para>- I am not. The Government are getting ready its election pabulum beforehand. But. as I said recently in ' my few remarks on the Budget, -I do not altogether regard that as unusual. Governments have a tendency to do that sort of thing. However, I should not have risen but for two observations, one by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> and another by the Leader of the On-position <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton).</inline> The Treasurer disclaimed the idea that his ds an election Budget, and that this proposal is a sop to a certain class of voters - he claimed that it arose out of an idea of helping development and production. The Treasurer did it very neatly and humourously, but the manner in which he advanced the argument convinced me that he, like an accomplished Lothario, is throwing the " glad eye " at the elector. He did not give us the serious reason behind the proposal. There is no possible connexion, I take leave to say, between this gift and the increase  of production and development in this country. We would be sinners if we acknowledged the force of the honorable gentleman's contention, and children if we believed it. We know that there is a desire to give back something to the people. Whether that be right or wrong is another matter. The Treasurer told us that the imposition of the tax was a war measure, which, during the six years of its operation, has earned us £2,500,000; and that now it is proposed to ease down the tax in order to give the taxpayers relief. This is the first measure of relief that is the outcome of the Budget proposals. It has been hurried on, whereas we have merely had notice of the land tax and income-tax reductions. This is the drum-major in the advance of taxation relief. </para>

                        <para>- That gift was to still the wicked tongues, of that party, and it has not done so. Those of us who were in the House at the time will remember the introduction of this tax. It was to. aid war finance, and as soon as we can take off taxation which was imposed deliberately to finance the continuous cost of the war, we should do so. I agree, too, that this is a more appropriate form of taxation for the provincial legislatures than for the national legislature to impose. But although the war is over, a- burden of debt of about £400,000,000 rests on us, together with the cost of war pensions and repatriation charges. Although the war is finished, and peace theoretically with us, we must keep a considerable lump of the war taxation in force until our war debt has entirely disappeared. I do not object to the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> arguing as he did, seeing that an election is at hand; because it is the duty of an Opposition to be patriotically indignant about everything that a Government do; but when he searched in the well of truth, and dug up from it a few real gems, he dug up some mud with them. It is not fair to say, either here or in the constituencies, that the cost of the war is still bearing more heavily than it should upon the poorer people in the community. </para>

                        <para>- That is another matter. I have heard members sitting on the same side as the honorable member say that they believed in equality of sacrifice; that you should not put all the burden on riches because they are riches,  but that you should adjust the load to the shoulders of the people as they are able to bear it. In a democratic community that seems the fairest of the many canons of taxations. </para>

                        <para>- That has been a frequent contention; but if the figures are analyzed it will be seen that very few bear the burden of income taxation. Comparing the number of adult wage-earners with the number of persons who pay income tax, the latter appear very few indeed, and the Treasurer proposes to increase the exemption and make them fewer still. Then, if you go further, and see how small a part of the income tax revenue is contributed by the small taxpayers, and how few are the rich who bear the greater part of the burden, you get another disproportion. Broadly speaking, this is the position : that 4 per cent. of the taxpayers contribute 80 per cent. of the income tax revenue. </para>

                    <para>.- In view of the financial position of the country, as shown in the Budget, there is no urgent call for the removal of this tax, and I do not think that the Treasurer should have proposed its repeal. A tax on entertainments is not like a tax on food or clothing or other necessaries. If one visits the picture theatres in the great cities of the Commonwealth, he will find that they are crowded both day and night. Young men and young women frequent these stuffy halls constantly, paying prices ranging from1s.to 3s. and 4s. for admission. So great is the demand for places that often, unless one books seats beforehand, it is difficult to get into a house of entertainment. The rush to places of amusement is inordinate. </para>

                        <para>- I do not wish it to be thought that I do not go to places of amusement. My contention is that excessive indulgence in this pleasure is not conducive to the health or the morals of the people, so far as the greater part of the entertainments is concerned. The pictures which were shown to us in the Queen's Hall to-night were highly informative, but, as a rule, it is not pictures of that type that are shown in the picture theatres. The financial position of the country makes it necessary for us to increase our production and to develop our latent resources, the natural potentialities of our land being beyond question. But why should the Government propose relief to those who are engaged in an unrestrained search for pleasure which is conducive to neither health nor character. This is not a statesmanlike proposal. Those who object to the tax need not pay it unless they like. There is no need for any one to go to the pictures every night in the week, as many do. With some picture <inline font-style="italic">habitués</inline> the practice is beginning to undermine their physique, and it is a very expensive one, having regard to what is paid for admission and in train and tram fares. </para>

                <para class="block">What I am saying may not help me in my constituency, where there are many picture theatres, hut I speak in the interests of the country. We often see a pack of people at the doors of theatres waiting far them to be opened, and they seem willing to pay present prices. The censorship over the picture films is a recognition by the Government of a certain moral danger connected with their exhibition, and in the newspapers we rend accounts of boy desperadoes holding up trains and the like in real American style. The Treasurer would have done better had he made a proposal for the development of the country. The Prime Minister, before ' the last election, stated that what we need is production, and still more production. The farmer was caught in wire-netting entanglements, and last night he was given relief; but this Bill is a sop to the frequenters of picture shows who could really do without it. I shall oppose the measure. I concur in the remarks of the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt),</inline> when he indicated that the collection of taxes from the source under review should be a function of the States, and not of the Commonwealth. However, while the Commonwealth continues to levy this form of taxation I object to the remission 'of any part of it. </para>

                    <para>.- I am glad that some little measure of relief, in respect of the cheaper form of amusement, is to be given. I regret that it was not afforded long ago. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> was not altogether convincing when he said that the proposal before the Committee had nothing to do with the elections; indeed, the manner in which he imparted his information suggested that he himself was far from convinced in that direction. I will go further and say that the Treasurer gave me the impression that he considered that the proposed remissions, from beginning to end, were in the nature of a sop to one class or another of the electors. The proposition under review is one which the Labour party has urged for many months past. My sole criticism is that it does not go far enough. I do not see why there should be a tax collected upon any form of entertainment to which the price of admission is ls., that amount being practically the minimum at which people nowadays can look for amusement. The honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> waxed indignant against the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton),</inline> and charged him with unfairness in asserting that the poor pay more than their fair share of the country's taxes. </para>

                        <para>- It is correct to say so; I repeat what my leader has said." The workers of Australia are compelled to pay taxes upon incomes which are considerably below the' basic wage. Is it right that many wage-earners, whose families are actually living below the bread-line, should be made to contribute large aggregate sums by way of income taxation to the revenue of a country in which many thousands of people are able to indulge in luxurious extravagances, to the extent, indeed, of millions of pounds? I go further than the Leader of the Opposition, and will say that it is the workers who really pay the whole of the taxation of this country. I invite honorable members to examine the balance-sheets of the wealthy companies of this land. Investigation will reveal that, for every  £1  of taxation paid by the well-to-do, another  £1  has been put into their pockets after it has been drawn from those of the working people. Those in receipt of humble incomes should be favoured with even more far-reaching remissions than have been proposed. When the honorable member for Balaclava speaks of  4  per cent, of the taxpayers contributing  SO  per cent, of the total of income taxation, I would remind him that he is merely emphasizing the disparity existing to-day between the workers and the wealthy. If the aggregate of taxation appears to bear heavily upon the rich it is only because they have possessed themselves of an inordinate share of this world's goods. I support the proposed remission, but  I  emphasize that it is not sufficiently far-reaching. I have no time, however, for the "kill- joy" attitude of the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse).</inline> . Apparently, he would not have any one seek any degree of relaxation by way of  entertainment, in picture form or otherwise. The great objection raised against picture shows is that they are a form of amusement in which the poor can afford to indulge. I have never heard the honorable member for Swan and his like make any criticism of the huge aggregate of money spent upon luxuries in Australia. Millions of pounds are annually wasted by people who live in the lap of luxury ; but because the working man takes his wife and children along to a picture show once a week, and so crowds all these forms of entertainment by reason of sheer numbers, the " killjoys " hold up their hands in holy horror that there should be any means of amusement and relaxation open to the toiler after his hours of hard work day by day. " I trust that before another election looms ahead - so providing further opportunity to throw out sops to various classes of electors - the Government will extend these remissions of taxation. </para>

                    <para>.- I would not have risen to speak but for what I may term the dreadful appeal to class hatred which has just been indulged in.. I understand that the proposal before the Committee, which I support, will involve a remission of taxation to the extent of about £100,000 per annum. I fail to see that this proposal affords any reasonable opportunity or excuse for stirring up class hatred. It should not raise the question of the taxation of any one specific class in the community as compared with any other class. There is, in the proposal itself, no suggestion that one class is taxed too heavily while another is taxed too lightly. My own opinion is that all classes in this country are taxed too severely, and that there should be all-round remissions and relaxations. The release from taxation of the admission ticket under ls. for picture shows will afford relief to many of the people who are least able to pay taxes. However, there are other classes of entertainment beside moving pictures. While I am not personally concerned in taxation imposed upon this form of entertainment, there are varieties of relaxation in which I am deeply interested, and which, in my view, are of infinitely greater national importance. I refer to a class of entertainment to which the terms " exhilarating " and " invigorating" can be much more appropriately applied than to picture shows. </para>

                        <para>- It will, perhaps, satisfy the consistent yearning of the honorable member for information if I mention one intellectual relaxation which has never received adequate consideration from this House. I have on other occasions raised my voice in favour of the exemption of all forms of country dancing from the entertainments tax. On the first occasion, when I spoke of this matter, my words fell on rather unsympathetic ears. I can only hope that in the light of wider experience, especially that which I understand some honorable members have had at a place known as Dixieland, where, in my opinion, the Federal Capital should be situated, I shall receive a better measure of support on this occasion. I do not think enough is done in this country to encourage a most enjoyable and social form of relaxation, namely, modern dancing. In my own electorate I have done my best to cultivate and spread the light in regard to this matter, not only by precept, but also, in a humble way, by example. </para>

I have received correspondence from people who have organized country dances, and who have found their efforts in behalf of charity circumscribed by this tax ; some of them have even been out of pocket. In other countries much more is done to encourage that most delightful and sociable form of relaxation - dancing. In America a commencement has been made with community dancing. We have introduced into Australia community singing; I hope we shall soon have community dancing also. In one American city the people enjoy block dancing. The inhabitants within a particular city block apply to the municipality to be allowed to hold a dance. If permission is granted, the municipality provides the band, the police keep all forms of vehicular traffic away from that area, and the people dance on the footpaths and roads for two or three hours in the afternoon or evening. </para>

The Treasurer stated, amongst other things, that the remission of the tax upon tickets on pictures would encourage the education of young Australians. </para>

                        <para>- I think the Treasurer made a general remark that the reduction of the tax on lower-priced tickets would afford some ' encouragement to the education of the children. Some honorable members will recollect that about two years ago a proposal was made for the remission of the entertainments tax on tickets of under 3s. In view of our knowledge of Commonwealth finance since that proposal was made, honorable members will agree that it was well that another place rejected it, because by so doing it enabled the Treasurer and his predecessor to collect a sum of about £500,000 which otherwise would not have been collected, but which the people have paid freely. It would be better for the young people in the Commonwealth if the Government were to exercise a little more rigid control over the films that are shown. We know to our sorrow that our picture entertainments are . practically Americanized. What with American pictures, American books, American methods, and American slang, it is about time that a little more control was exercised by the powers that be. In connexion with this remission of £100,000 of entertainments taxation, I should have liked to see the Treasurer discriminate and differentiate, if possible, between that which is educational and that which is not. Coming to the House tonight I passed a picture show where the <inline font-style="italic">piece de resistance</inline> was entitled. " Is the Lady legally Married?" If the Treasurer thinks that subject is educational, I do not. Of course, it may be educational in regard to the divorce laws, but I would give no sort of encouragement to young Australians to see pictures of that sort. I believe it would have been possible, if careful thought had been given to the proposals now before the Committee, to afford some relief in respect of entertainments that are purely educational. I would have preferred some alternative proposals that would give a little more consideration in respect of tickets up to ls., or ls. 6d. if you like, to entertainments in the form of music, art, or literature. If care and thought had been given to the consideration of how best to remit £100,000 worth of entertainments tax, the Government could have given some stimulus and aid to the betterment of the character of the young community, instead of producing the slapdash proposal that is now before us. This remission of taxation could have been done in a better way. Picture shows as they are run to-day, with exclusively American films, in the interests of an American Combine, are not educational in any way, and I believe that even now the Government could make some regulations whereby the young people of Australia could see with greater freedom, some of the very high-class educations! films that are being produced in England and other parts of Europe. </para>

If, however, thought had been given to the subject, the interests of education could have been furthered by encouraging the exhibition of some of the best industrial, scientific and travel pictures which are being produced in parts of the world other than America.

                    <para>.- I enter my protest against this proposal. I do not desire to attack picture0 shows  or other amusements in any way. If the poor people could be given free entertainments, I would be well pleased. But the huge Budget presented by the Treasurer shows that during the current year the Commonwealth is to incur a heavy loss. Only a few nights ago we passed a Loan Bill for twelve million pounds. If we are in a position to remit taxation to the amount of  £100,000  in this particular sphere, it should be remitted in  respect to items that would be of very much greater benefit to the community as a whole. The Commonwealth has a multiplicity of very serious liabilities. The amount of relief that will be given <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> by this remission is so small as to be not worth while, especially when we take into consideration that the great war for our freedom has placed upon our people a debt of £380,000,090. Having regard to the purpose for which that expenditure was incurred, and the advantage it has conferred upon Australia, people should be prepared to contribute to the funds of the Commonwealth in any such reasonable form as the tax upon entertainments. So far as income, tax is concerned, the Government are proposing to increase the exemption to single men of £104 to £200. That will relieve single men who can well afford to contribute toward the expenditure of the Commonwealth, and it is their bounden duty to so contribute, in view of our enormous war conun.itnien.ts and all that- has been done for Australia. The liabilities of the Australian people include a national debt of approximately £800,000,000, an annual war pensions bill of approximately £7,000,000, and other recurring amounts of £5,000,000 for old-age and invalid pensions, and £700,000 foi- the maternity allowance. Those commitments are very large; and when we take into consideration the small amount of relief that this remission of £100,000 on amusements means to the individual, but how great is the need for revenue in the aggregate, I feel that it would be false economy to do as the Treasurer proposes. On those grounds. I protest against this motion. </para>

                    <para>.- The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> in his Budget originally intended to show a surplus of £500,000, and to that extent I am willing to reduce taxation, because I consider that a reduction of taxation generally is most necessary for the progress of the country, but I cannot support the resolution submitted to-day  or  any other proposal for a reduction  of  taxation without a corresponding reduction in our expenditure, when the Budget actually proposes to show a deficit of something like £2,800,000. That is not my idea of finance. It has been said that the entertainments tax was imposed as a war measure, but we must also remember that since the war stopped we. have added about £140,000,000 to our Commonwealth debt. In any case, the first remission of taxation should. be a reduction of the income tax of the lower grade of taxpayers who have large families. I would vote for such a reduction with pleasure to the extent of £500,000, but I am not in favour of the remissions proposed by the Treasurer to-day without the equally necessary reductions in our expenditure. </para>

                    <para>. - When this matter was discussed last session I was one- of those who gave every assistance I could render to the Government to enable them to retain this tax. On that occasion the Opposition took exactly the same position as they are talking now, namely,' that the tax on amusements should not be levied on the lower-priced tickets. What has. happened since the Government fought so vigorously to retain the tax on the lower-priced tickets? Has the position of the finances improved? My opinion is that it is far better to tax luxuries and amusements than to tax the necessaries  of  life or poverty. If we are prepared to throw away a certain amount of revenue there are other avenues in which it can be done - notably, that which has just been mentioned by the honorable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wienholt).</inline></para>

                        <para>- Any form  of  amusement tax is a tax on luxury as compared with the taxation which presses  so  heavily on men with large families, particularly the Customs Tariff, and the income tax. I often wonder how these men manage to get along as well as they  do  on a small wage. These are the people to whom we should give our first relief if we are to remit any form of taxation. We are commencing at the wrong end by reducing the tax upon amusements. </para>

                <para class="block">Every shilling which is taken from a man with a large family deprives him and his family of some necessary of life, and I trust that when we are dealing, at a later stage, with the income tax proposals of the Government, greater discrimination will be made as between single men and those with large families. But again I repeat: What has happened since this matter was last before us, when the Government fought the Opposition with all the strength they could assemble in order to prevent giving the remission which is now proposed? The Senate refused to reduce the tax, and the Government accepted their verdict gleefully, and, when asked by the Opposition to adhere to their first proposal to remit the tax on lower priced tickets, fought for its retention. I think that the amount of revenue they have secured in that way has helped to keep the national ledger straight. This is not the time for the remission of any taxation on amusements. Any relief we can afford to give should be extended to those with large families who are now burdened by Customs duties upon the necessaries of life and by the income tax. Apart altogether from the question of proposing duties for the protection of Australian industry there are items in the Customs Tariff schedule which do not afford protection to any industry, and yet press very heavily on the class of the community in whose interests I a,m now speaking. If we are to give relief , it should be in the direction where it is most needed, that is to say, on necessaries of life rather than upon amusements. In the circumstances, I cannot support the Government's proposal. </para>

                        <para>.- This is really a machinery Bill, and one chiefly for consideration in Committee. There are, however, two or three matters which, perhaps, , call for some little discussion. Provision is made by the Bill against a vote being recorded in more than tone electorate, for the grouping system, and for the prevention of impersonation. These are the chief objects of the Bill. As to the grouping, I do not know that it will not be an improvement on the existing method. It will permit parties to have their respective candidates grouped, and in this way the voters will be assisted at the polling booth. At any rate, the system may tend to reduce the large number of informal votes that were discovered at the last election. </para>

                            <para>- I am referring to the interjection by the honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mcwilliams)</inline> in regard te the. power of the machine. In electoral matters the party on this side stand in a much worse position than any party in the Chamber, and that fact is responsible, to a large extent, for the poor showing we made in the Senate elections on. the last occasion. Whether candidates be grouped or not, the fact remains that when voters are compelled to vote for up to seven candidates, a' good deal of confusion must arise. Seven candidates must be voted for, and in cases where four candidates are to be elected, as will exist in two States on this occasion, it will mean that nine candidates must be voted for, the Act providing that there must be double the number to be elected, plus one. Inasmuch as we on this side generally run three candidates only, there may. on the other side, be two groups, with, probably, an independent candidate, and a voter who favours the candidates who are against Labour naturally votes so as to leave the Labour candidates out. whether there be grouping or not. That is the disadvantage we on this side suffer under the Act as it was amended previously. The Bill before us may reduce the number of informal votes to an extent, but it will not do justice to us on this side of the House. We run three candidates, but Labour electors are compelled to record seven votes, thus giving four votes to our opponents: and I admit frankly that Labour supporters are very reluctant to vote for those whose principles they do not approve of. On the other side, there may be three Country party candidates and three Nationalist candidates, with an independent, and those opposed to Labour vote for the whole lot. </para>

                            <para>- But there were several other candidates who were not Labour candidates, and the result was that the votes were given to the seven men outside Labour, who did not, in those cases, get a vote. This Bill gives no relief to this side of the House. I cannot see how, even if the electors showed by a majority that they favoured Labour at the next appeal to the country for this House, we can hope to have the decision reflected in another place under this Bill. To me that appears absolutely impossible. Although we may have a majority of the votes in Australia, we cannot get that fact reflected in the elections for the Senate. </para>

                            <para>- Of course it was, and the legislation was intended to be a farce; it was passed for a political purpose. The Labour party has now two members in another place; and, even if we succeed in regard to this House at the forthcoming election, we cannot hope for a majority there. The electors may approve of certain principles of a party - either the Country party or the Labour party - but the fact remains that, while members are returned to give effect to those principles here, there is, because of the electoral law, a majority in another place which can prevent them being given effect to. </para>

                    <para>Mr.CHARLTON. - I do not know that that is so. There may have been some objection to the old system, but, anyhow, it was a case of " first past the post " ; there was, at the least, a decision by the majority of the people, and the party dominant here was also dominant in the Senate. To-day, however, the party dominant in this House find their opponents dealing with their legislation in the Senate; and it is not to the credit of the Government or of Parliament that what was done some few years ago has not been undone. </para>

                            <para>- I doubt that very much. The Bill also deals with the matter of the deposit, to which I have already referred. Personally, I am opposed to the system that requires a deposit at all, and since I have been in this House I have attempted on many occasions to have that provision eliminated from the Act. There should be no impediment in the way of any candidate. If the electors nominate a man he should be entitled to go to the poll without the risk of losing his deposit if he fails to secure a certain number of votes. When the Bill is in Committee it will be necessary to give very careful consideration to clause 14, which provides that certain questions shall be put to a voter. The effect of this provision will, I believe, be to cause serious congestion in polling booths, especially in thickly-populated areas, between 7 and 8 o'clock in the evening, when, as a rule, large numbers of electors are rushing to record their votes. </para>

                            <para>- If only the first two questions, namely, as to whether an elector has voted at the polling-place or elsewhere in the election, or if his place of living is within the division, are put to every person wishing ito record a vote, considerable time must be occupied. It is highly probable that the congestion in the booth before the hour of closing will prevent other electors from gaining admission, and thus they will be prevented from exercising the franchise. It is doubtful whether, in its application, the clause will not do more harm than good. Generally speaking, the provisions dealing with impersonation will be acceptable to honorable members, but it is undesirable to have such a long list of questions. Many people, especially womenfolk, have some diffidence about approaching the polling-booth, because of the nature of certain questions that may be asked them. The provision requiring an elector to indicate the order of his preference up to the seventh candidate is likely to lead to a good deal of informality in the voting. Most of the clauses are, I think, necessary to remedy certain shortcomings that have been disclosed in the working of our election machinery. </para>

It is designed to insure the conduct of elections in the best possible manner, and we ought to be able to put our heads together and make the measure as perfect as possible. We shall have no opportunity of touching the main principle of the Bill. The Government are responsible for that, and will, no doubt, stand to the Bill; but I hope that in other respects they will be prepared to accept whatever amendments may be deemed necessary. </para>

                        <para>.- The Bill raises questions of the most vital importance, and, therefore, it requires full and adequate discussion. I appeal to the Minister; in charge <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom.)</inline> to adjourn the debate. </para>

I have read with the greatest care all that has been said recently in another place in favour of that system, and the reasons given appear to me absolutely inadequate. As a matter of fact, the only explanation of the proposal is that an election is approaching, and a certain party finds itself <inline font-style="italic">in extremis.</inline></para>

                            <para>- It seems impossible for Ministers to refrain from interjecting when a member tries to throw light on the methods by which they propose to conduct public affairs. If they could show any reason whatever why the system of marking the Senate ballot-papers in the ordinary way should be altered; if that system had failed, or had caused confusion, or had brought about an unusual number of invalid papers, there might be some justification for changing it. The implication of the proposal in the Bill is that the electors of Australia are so ignorant that unless the names of Senate candidates are grouped in a fashion that has been adopted in some foreign countries, they cannot mark the ballot-papers intelligently. There is not the slightest warrant for that implication. The experience of the last election proves that where people are reasonably educated, as they are in Australia, they can without the slightest difficulty mark the list of candidates from which they have to choose. The only thing to be said in favour of the grouping system is that it gives to the nominees of the machines of the various parties an enormous advantage over candidates who may not be well known, and who have not curried favour with those running party organizations. The grouping system is not only foreign to' the ideas of the Australian people, but permits the electors to be influenced unfairly by the organizations responsible for the grouping. This leads to the exclusion of men as suitable as, and often much more suitable than, those who have the party support. The matter is one to be discussed more fully in Committee; but as the second -reading stage provides the opportunity for criticising the vital principles of the measure, it is not improper to draw attention now to the exceedingly vicious, unfair, and repressive character of this proposal. One must admit that there is some disadvantage attached to the alphabetical arrangement of the names of candidates on a ballot-paper, but there are other ways of getting over it besides the adoption of the grouping system. </para>

                            <para>- Suppose, for the sake of my argument, that 1,000,000 ballot-papers were to be printed for a. State in which there were ten candidates for the Senate, it would be easy to print 100,000 ballot-papers in alphabetical order, another 100,000 with the second name at the top and the first name at the bottom, and so on until every candidate's name had appeared once on the top and once in every other position in the list. Each would then have the same chance. I do not propose to move an amendment to give effect to that suggestion, because I do not consider that at the present moment the public are sufficiently educated in this matter; but what I propose would provide a solution of the present difficulty. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> has, with great force, indicated the enormous disadvantage of the present electoral law. I think it was interjected by the Assistant Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hector Lamond)</inline> that the present system is not as bad as that which preceded it. There is very little doubt upon that point. The peculiar feature of the present system is that it provides, in a most efficient manner, for the whole of the senators, as far as possible, to be elected by the party that happens to possess a slight numerical majority. If, for instance, one party is supported by 51 per cent, of the electors, and the other party is supported by only 49 per cent., provided the voters are so well organized by the party machine that they will vote as directed, the party with the slight majority returns the whole of the members of the Senate. We have seen this travesty of representative government in the fact that, prior to the death of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Adamson,</inline> there was only one Labour member in the Senate, although the Labour vote at the last election represented about 45 .per cent, of the people. Although this form of election is highly efficient for the purpose for which it was designed, it is fundamentally opposed to the principle of representative government. Seeing that we shall have an opportunity to discuss this matter further when the Bill reaches the Committee stage, I do not now intend to go exhaustively into the question of proportional representation. Our present method of election is almost unknown throughout the world, except as regards our Senate, and it was devised for the purpose of excluding any representation at all of the party not in a minority. There is a better method that could be employed, and one that would only involve an alteration in regard to the system of counting the votes. I refer to proportional representation, which has been in practice for many years in Tasmania, and has since been adopted in New South Wales. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member and those whom he represents may be, but the people of New South Wales have given no evidence of being tired of it. On the other hand, they have returned members in support of proportional representation with a larger majority than they had when that principle was first introduced. Party organizers may be tired of it, because it enables the electors to be represented adequately by the men whom they desire to represent them. The people should have a chance of casting their votes, and of having them counted, under an efficient and enlightened system. This is not possible under the present law, and I regret to notice that the Government are endeavouring, by this Bill, to continue to impose upon the people the present inequitable electoral system. </para>

                        <para>. - I agree with the honorable member for Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett)</inline> as to the principles that should underlie an Electoral Bill. Our present system is obsolete. In 1910, Labour secured eighteen seats, and the opponents of Labour none, in the Senate. In 1919, .the Labour party obtained one seat out of eighteen. Such a system does not secure the representation of the electors proportionately, and we should try to give representation on the basis of the strength of the great sections of the electors. To do what is required would mean defeating the Government and sending the Bill back, and there is little hope of out voting the Ministerial party, so the best course is to try to improve the measure as we have it. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>I have one or two suggestions to offer. The Bill certainly does improve the existing Act, but only in a machinery way. There is a good deal of difficulty in connexion with the postal vote, considering the results we have obtained from. it. I do not see why it is necessary to have, an authorized witness to sign an application. This is not required in the States, and it provides no check. All the check . required would be given if the voter had his ballot-paper signed by an authorized witness. This could be checked by the Returning Officer, with the application form, but to require an authorized witness to sign both papers is putting people to a lot of extra trouble. In a case where there is illness in a family, it means bringing an authorized witness on two occasions to a sick person, and that causes unnecessary worry. I certainly think the postal vote should be safeguarded. It is a dangerous vote, and I have never liked it. I urge the Minster <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> to reconsider the clause, and to have it amended so that the one authorized witness may be sufficient, both in respect of the application form and of the other. </para>
                    <para>I have a more serious objection to raise in connexion with clause 13, which deals with the important principle of absent voting. The proposed substitution of the word "may" for "shall" is likely to have the effect of robbing certain electors who desire to exercise the right of absent voting of their opportunity to do so owing to the withholding of the necessary papers. Absentee voting comprises one of the advantages of our electoral system, but much of the advantage will be withdrawn if the proposed amendment is adopted. The last Ballarat election afforded an experience of the refusal, or inability, of electoral officials to provide electors with voting papers. It was the lack of provision for absent voting at one particular polling place which amongst other things caused the election to be upset. If the amendment indicated in clause 13 is agreed to, the effect will be to allow such an incident to occur again, but without any penalties accruing. No doubt, it was the Ballarat dispute which has occasioned the proposed amendment. Under the existing law any elector may enter any polling booth and cast his vote in respect of the division of which he is an elector. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> may ask how the Electoral Department can be expected to provide in every small polling booth throughout the land against the contingency of hundreds of electors demanding absent voting papers. Ample provision can always be made. No contingency could be so unexpected as to catch a Returning Officer unprepared. I may relate the incident which occurred at the Duverney polling booth, in the Division of Ballarat. A number of men were employed as navvies on the construction of a railway fairly near to the booth. Naturally, upon leaving work, they went to the nearest polling place in order to cast their votes, but a majority of them were unable to secure papers because the Presiding Officer had not made the necessary provision. He should have foreseen, however, that in respect of this railway work, which had been going on for some time, there would be numbers of men who would be likely to call at the booth in order to vote as absentees. The inability of the officer at the Duverney polling place to provide sufficient absent voting papers was one of the causes for the upsetting of the Ballarat election. The intention behind the amendment, I repeat, is to obviate the possibility of such a penalty in future. It is only right that such a cause should be deemed to be sufficient and ample for declaring an election void where the number is sufficient to affect the result. I cannot conceive of any emergency which should catch a Returning Officer unprepared for the attendance of at least a reasonable number of absent voters. </para>

                    <para>I have only a few words to say upon the grouping proposals. I do not see much objection to them while, at the same time, I am not greatly enamoured of them. The grouping system is claimed to be a recognition of parties. Under this measure, however, there will be not so much a recognition of parties as of individual candidates. I shall cite a hypothetical case to illustrate my point. I suggest that three candidates are selected to represent the Labour party. These are to be grouped. Our party nominates them as our group. There is nothing in this measure, however, which will prevent a dozen other candidates from describing themselves also as Labour nominees, and from being included in our group. </para>

                    <para>. - I heard the Minister say that this Bill was a purely formal measure to confirm the resolutions approved of in Committee yesterday. I desire to inquire when the Minister proposes to bring in the Bounty Bill, which will he substituted for these duties, and whether ' there will he any interregnum between the date of the abolition of the duties, as decided upon by this House yesterday, and the payment of the bounties which the Minister has promised in substitution therefor. Obviously, if there is an interregnum or any doubt about what Parliament will do, at least three important industries will be entirely sacrificed. </para>

                    <para>.- The Bounties Bill, I hope, will be submitted to the House on Wednesday next. Provision will he made for the bounties to operate immediately the duties cease. There will be no deprivation of the benefits of Protection, and manufacturers may proceed in the conduct of their businesses with the knowledge that the effects of the remission of the duties will be compensated for by the bounties, and that there will be no interval between the two. </para>
