                        </talk.start>
                    <para>Every pensioner resident in Dunwich or other Benevolent Asylum receives a pension of 2s. per week for his own personal use. In addition, the Commonwealth pays the institution 10s. fid. per week for his maintenance. When a pensioner becomes an inmate of a hospital, his pennon must be suspended in accordance with section 45 of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act. If the pensioner is discharged within twenty-eight days, he is paid the full pension for that period.&#34; If he is an inmate for more than twenty-eight days, he is paid twenty-eight days&#39; pension on discharge. No payment is made for the maintenance of the pensioner during the twenty-eight days in respect of which he receives pension, but thereafter, until he is discharged, the Commonwealth pays 10s. fid. per week towards his maintenance in the hospital. The reason for the difference is that pensioners in benevolent asylums are usually permanent inmates, while those in hospitals stay there for only short periods. It is thought proper that on discharge the latter should receive full pension in respect of twenty-eight days spent in the institution, so that they may have extra comforts during convalescence. </para>

                    <para>- Yesterday the honor  able member for Wilmot asked whether it was the custom of the Taxation Department, when taxpayers inadvertently overstated their income, to allow such persons to pay the full . amount. I see in reports in the newspapers this morning a suggestion that since I became Treasurer an alteration has in some way been made in regard to such cases of overpayment. I wish to correct that impression, and to state to the House that the officers of the Taxation Department have always worked under definite instructions from the Commissioner that their duty is to rectify all errors in taxpayers&#39; returns, whether for or against the revenue. </para>

                    <para>- I desire to make a personal &#39;explanation. Yesterday I recorded a vote in favour of the adjournment of the debate on the sugar question moved  by  one of the Ministers, and my consistency in so doing has been called in question by one of our daily newspapers this morning. On the previous day of sitting I voted for an amendment, moved  by  the . honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton),</inline> that the price of sugar be reduced to  4&#189;d.  per  lb.,  and I did  so as a  protest against the failure of the Government to supply  us  with such figures as would enable us to say whether or not such reduction may  be  made. In regard to  my  vote yesterday for the adjournment of the debate, I desire to say that I gave it on the- assurance of the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> that the figures for which I have been asking would be supplied to-day. It was on that distinct assurance that I supported the motion for the adjournment; otherwise I should have voted against it. </para>
