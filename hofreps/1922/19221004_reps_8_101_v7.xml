                        <para>- We have already discussed that matter two or three times; but I may answer the question as it relates to their powers in connexion with the whole of the Public Service by saying &#34; Yes.&#34; We shall deal with their powers when we come to clause 16, though I may explain shortly now that they have power to make certain recommendations, which are brought first under the notice of the permanent head, and if he does not deal with them, under the notice of the Minister. If the Minister does&#39; not deal with them, they are brought under the notice of Parliament. The reason for that provision is that there must be Ministerial, responsibility for all important work. </para>

                    <para>.- The Minister is proposing to make provision for very good salaries for these officials, and his action merely shows how necessary it was for the Committee to decide in favour of one Commissioner rather than a Board of three members. If the Minister&#39;s proposal is agreed to the Board of Commissioners will cost the country &#163;6,500 per annum, in addition to the cost of the Public Service generally . We know that every Board or Commission that has been created has resulted in. the establishment of separate Departments, though we have been told on every occasion that the appointment of these Boards would result in very little additional expense. We may have a score of clerical workers on the staff of this Board, and the proposal will involve considerable cost to the country. At a time when we&#34; are constantly calling fox economy, almost every piece of legislation that is introduced involves additional expenditure that in many cases is unwarranted. In this case the additional expenditure called for is quite unwarranted. There is no justification for the appointment of a Board of three members. The Royal Commission who inquired into the subject reported that one would be quite sufficient. </para>

                        <para>- That is no reason why I should acquiesce in the payment of &#163;6,500 to the members of the Board when, according to the Royal Commissioner who inquired into the management of the Service, the work which they will be called upon to do could be done by one Commissioner at a salary of &#163;2,500. I do not object to the payment of a good salary to a competent man, but I do protest against the payment of high salaries to three men when one man would be sufficient. It seems to me that the Government are merely creating positions for officials, but they took good care, last night, that the members of the Public Service should not have the right to appoint one of their number to the Board. </para>

                        <para>- That is what I am doing. I say that I am not prepared to pay the members of the Board &#163;6,500&#39; a year when a representative of the Public Service who would, perhaps, be more qualified than any one else for the position is not to be a member of the Board. I object merely because honorable members came to a certain decision last night to saddle the community with additional cost for a Board that is quite unnecessary. It will be staggering to the people outside when they learn that the Minister proposes this morning to pay &#163;6,500 a year to three men as members of this Board. What was the use of appointing a man as a Royal Commissioner to advise us in regard to this matter if we are not guided by his advice? It costs this country a considerable sum to ascertain from a Royal Commissioner whether we should have one, two, or three Commissioners in charge of the Public Service, and yet, after receiving his advice, we discard it, and the Government propose to create positions at big salaries for three men. </para>

                    <para>. -I cannot accept the amendment. Its purpose, is that the three members of the. Board shall receive total salaries not exceeding &#163;2,500 per annum. If that sum- is to be shared among the three, the whole position will become absurd. The amendment does not even suggest that &#163;2,500 shall be the maximum of the three salaries.; it may be less. The Leader of tie Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> is really endeavouring to reverse a previous decision of the Committee. It has been decided that the Board shall consist of. three persons, but the Leader of the Opposition desired&#39; that only one Commissioner shall be appointed. He now essays to fix an amount of annual salary which will be adequate for only one man. Reference has been made to the salaries paid, to the Commissioners in New South Wales&#39;. In that State there are three Commissioners, and they have to do with 16,621 public servants, who are paid annual salaries aggregating &#163;2,375,000. The Commonwealth Commissioners, however, will have under their control - under the Public Service Act alone, and irrespective of exempt officers  -  23,489 individuals whose annual salaries amount to &#163;5,610,000. The Federal body is an enormous one; its salary bill is considerably more than twice the amount of the New South Wales Service. A comparison between the two bodies, therefore, is beside the mark. The amendment should be rejected, because its acceptance would reduce this measure to a farce. </para>

                    <para>. - Inevitable trouble is already fallowing the introduction of this hybrid Bill. Had the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> accepted the suggestion of the Country party that there should be one Commissioner, in complete charge, with a well-paid assistant Commissioner, I am confident that Parliament would readily agree to pay the Commissioner a very big annual salary. But, as it has been decided that the Board shall consist of three persons, I see no reason why the amount to be paid to the Commissioners should be limited as the amendment proposes. If we are to expect good service from the Board, it must be paid for. . If the Commissioners are to. be men of quality and. capacity, we must be prepared&#39; to pay accordingly. The amendment is not worthy of consideration except in the light that, if it were agreed to, it might have the effect of destroying the Bill, whereupon a new and more acceptable measure would&#39; perhaps be introduced. </para>

                    <para>. - The amendment contains the nucleus of a sound principle. We have Inspectors in the various States carrying out their duties at present. A chairman could be appointed from outside the Service, and the two ablest from among the existing Commonwealth ServiceInspectors could be promoted to the Board, either at their existing salaries or with an increase. These, men are doing the work to-day, and know what is required; no better Commissioners could be selected. The amendment, in effect, would permit the Government to appoint an independent chairman at a salary of &#163;2,500, and to transfer two Inspectors to the Board. The Board of three, if selected as the Government propose, will cost the country more than &#163;10,000 a year. I hope the Government proposal will not be accepted. While they propose to pay the salaries set out in, the clause they are also seeking to reduce the salaries of the members of this House from &#163;1,000 to &#163;800 a year on the plea of economy. No one knows yet whether members of the Board will be selected from the Public Service or not. I trust honorable members will look at this from a practical point of view, and accept the amendment. </para>

                    <para>. -  I hope the advocates of this cheap and nasty proposal will not have their way. We have been told that the salaries paid to the Public Service total about &#163;5,500,000 per annum, and yet the honorable member for South Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Riley)</inline> thinks we ought to have cheap men &#39; to control that expenditure. No business man would think of employing a cheap man to supervise and control expenditure of &#34; that magnitude. The honorable member has suggested that the Public: Service Inspectors should be able to do the. wort. Evidently he does not think there is any necessity for this Bill at all. </para>

What we want to do is to stop this cursed &#34;go-slow&#34; business that is ruining the country. The honorable member and his party are mainly responsible for all this &#34; go-slow &#34; trouble. No honorable member with the slightest business knowledge would hesitate to pay the salaries which the Minister has provided for in this clause to those who will be intrusted with the actual work of controlling the Public Service. We want fresh blood. We do not want these Inspectors. let us get a good man as  chairman  and employ good men with plenty of energy to assist him, and let u3 see that we get full value for our money. I hope the motto of the Board will not be to cut down wages at all, but to see that our public servants earn their money. I am opposed to anything cheap and nasty. I believe in good pay for the Public Service, and I believe, also; in efficient supervision. </para>

                        <para>- I withdraw it, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> and apologize; but I repeat that during the war business men who were called in to assist the Government involved this country in the expenditure of millions that should not have been spent. The same thing occurred in Great Britain. I would rather leave the affairs of this country to the officials of the Departments than to any business men. We are always having thrown at our heads the suggestion that we should get business men in to set things right, but we have never had much satisfaction from that policy. The Government propose to pay the  chairman  of the Board a salary of &#163;2,500, and other members &#163;2,000. I take it that they will be drawn from the Public Service. At all events they should be, because they understand <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> Service. But I am afraid that the Ministry will bring in their so-called business men and make a bungle of the whole show. Their only idea would be to run the Service on cheap lines, by paying low wages and making the men work longer hours. That is what the Ministry are after. Why is the information as to the persons to be appointed withheld from honorable members? We are dealing with a measure that, when assented to, will be an Act of Parliament, and yet we get no information at all about the men who are to administer it. </para>

He must know, from his long parliamentary experience, that it is entirely out of order to discuss that portion of the Bill which has already been dealt with, and which may be discussed on another clause. The only question before the Chair is whether the amount of &#163;6,500 shall be paid to the Board of Commissioners or &#163;2,500, which is incorporated in the amendment. The clause does not in any way deal with the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the proposed Board. </para>

                    <para>. - I am very much surprised that the  Chairman  is seeking to limit the discussion to the question of pounds, shillings, and pence, and denying the Committee the opportunity of saying anything about the class of men who should receive the proposed salaries. How can we discuss this question of salaries unless we discuss also the class, calibre, and qualifications of the persons who shall receive them ? The two matters are intimately associated. I agree with the honorable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mathews)</inline> that there is a strong desire on the part of the Government to appoint two of the Commission from outside the Service. We are to have the wonderful, business man paraded in connexion with these positions as he was paraded in Great Britain. It is a well-known fact that some of the business men who were appointed to Government positions in the Old Land utilized them to line their own pockets, whilst others made a holy mess of the work they were appointed to do. In connexion with War Service Homes the Government tried the policy of appointing business men- </para>

                        <para>- I suppose that I would be called to order for tedious repetition if I were merely to repeat over and over again the sums of money mentioned in the clause and the amendment. How can one discuss the amendment if he is not to be allowed to discuss the qualifications which should be held by men appointed to the Board? This is another instance of the hurry-up and hush-up policy adopted by the Government. The Bill deals with the control of nearly 30,000 permanent officers and 15,000 temporary or exempt officers, and is, therefore, one of the most important measures that has been submitted to Parliament for many years. Upon the class of measure we frame depends whether we shall have in future a contented and efficient Service, or a discontented and undisciplined rabble. </para>

                        <para>- The Committee has decided how many Commissioners there shall be, and I am not discussing that matter. The amendment relates to the amounts to be paid to the appointees, and questions of character and qualifications must enter into consideration. The Victorian Railways, which have a revenue of about &#163;11,000,000 per annum, are operated by a Commission, the  Chairman  of which is an imported man receiving a salary of &#163;5,000 per annum. I heartily approve of the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition. I fear that the men who will be appointed to these positions will be of the &#34; cut-down &#34; school, and that they will obediently carry out the behests of the Government. </para>

                <para class="block">I should like to hear the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> as to the necessity for this provision. There are to be three members of the Board, and they are to be well paid. They should be able to do their work without delegating their powers to, subordinates, who would practically have the same powers as themselves. If the members of the Board happened to be dilatory, they could appoint delegates to do certain work that they themselves should be doing. The amendment appears to be a reasonable one, because it seeks to give to the employees&#39; organization the same right of appeal as is accorded to the permanent head or chief officer. If the right of appeal to. the full Board were not granted to that organization, it might be placed in an unfair position, and discontent would result. The Minister would be wise if he accepted this slight amendment, which should have been included in the. draft Bill. It is generally desired that. we. should have a, contented Public Service. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Hindmarsh has moved an amendment to insert the words &#34; or organization,&#34; &#39; but it will be seen that this is not an instance in which the organization is concerned. According to the list submitted there are about fourteen or fifteen organizations, and even if the point, were con- ceded, the difficulty would arise- as to which organization should have the. right. The Board may be dealing with matters which do not concern organizations at all, and, therefore,, the necessity of inserting the words suggested &#39;does not exist. Organizations have their rights, and their position is recognised because  they can approach the Arbitration Court, if registered, and have all matters relating to wages and conditions dealt with. They have a right to appeal in connexion with the classification of officers, and also in the matter of salaries. In this instance, however, the Board will be dealing with the organization of the business side of Departments) and bringing matters under the notice of the chief officers or heads of Departments concerning the method of control in which an organization as such has no concern. </para>

                        <para>- The permanent head or the chief officer is given status, and he may enter a protest concerning the action of a delegate when his recommendation will be submitted to the consideration of the full Board, and I should like to know why the employees, through their organizations, should not have a similar right. Any one who knows anything at all about the working of the Departments realizes that in a technical branch the head of a Department is a veritable czar, and although he will have the right to make suggestions or lodge a protest, the public servants through their organizations have not the same privilege. If they are not affected they are not likely to protest. If the clause is passed in its present form it will probably lead to a good deal of friction, but if the amendment is adopted it will avoid a good deal of irritation and inconvenience, and prevent any interference with the rights and privileges of public servants. If the Board received a communication from an organization in respect to recommendations made by a delegate, it could easily be seen whether the complaint was trivial or not. I cannot see any reason why we should not include organizations, and if the amendment adopted it will, I think, assist in making the Public Service contented.. </para>

                <para>That sub-clause 3 as amended be left out, and the following inserted in lieu thereof : - &#34; Such appeal shall be&#39; forwarded by the Board to the Board of Appeal as hereinafter prescribed.&#34; </para>
                <para>As the sub-clause is printed in the Bill, the officer appealing against a decision of the Board in respect of his classification has merely the right to submit his case for reconsideration by the same Board in consultation with a representative of tha permanent head of the Department and with the appellant or a representative of the organization to which the appellant belongs. In these circumstances, the appeal will be heard by a body of five persons, four of whom have already taken part in coming to a decision upon the case. I do not think that the appeal is therefore likely to get that reconsideration upon it3 merits which might justly be claimed for it. No doubt the body sitting in judgment upon an appeal against a classification will be guided to a great extent by the decision already given. It will certainly be more satisfactory to the officer whose case is under consideration to have his appeal heard by a body quite independent from that . which has already made the classification against which he is appealing. The Public Service Act gives an officer a right of appeal to a special Appeal Board against any action taken under the Act which affects him. It can be urged very strongly that classification is just as important as remuneration, because it vitally affects the future career of an officer. I do not think that the importance of this matter can be overestimated. I hope the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> will be able to see his way to give to officers who may have reason to appeal against their classification a right to appeal to an independent tribunal. </para>

                        <para>- That can be determined later. It should not be of the same <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> as the Board which made the original classification. The procedure which I suggest would give protection and a measure of satisfaction to members of the Service who wish, to appeal. It would make them feel that they were not making an appeal to a body that had already given judgment on their case, and might look at it from a biased standpoint. </para>

                    <para>.- &#39;I ask the Committee to stand by the procedure laid down in the Bill. Honorable members know that at present the classification of the Service is carried out by the Public Service Commissioner. A right of appeal is provided for under section 50 of the Public Service Act, but it is only an appeal to a Board to hear the case, and make a recommendation to the Commissioner. &#39;The section says - </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>The Board shall hear such appeal, and transmit the evidence taken, together with a recommendation thereon, to  the  Commissioner, who shall thereupon determine such appeal. </para>
                <para>The Commissioner is the final authority for appeal, and that system, hitherto, has worked very satisfactorily. The Bill before the Committee provides that the ultimate decision shall rest with the Commissioners. The  Commissioners are intrusted with the task of classifying a Public .Service of 24,000 men. They have to classify the officers and classify  the positions, and .place the men according to .their capacity to held the positions. They will do that according to definite principles. They will have to consider what those principles will be. The matter, in justice to the Public Service, has to be dealt with as an independent  -whole. If we were to have an outside independent tribunal today to deal with one case, and another tribunal to-morrow to deal with another case, and if those tribunals were to be the arbitrators, the scheme of classification would be torn to shreds. &#39;&#34;We would never be able to get uniformity or finality. There would be ever so many Boards all over Australia dealing with details of classification. Is it not obvious that the classification can be made only on definite lines by one controlling authority? It is a peculiarity of the Public Service that the men have mutual rights with respect to one another, and if one man or one class is put ahead of another, injustice may be done.. There must be one controlling authority adjusting the_ equities throughout the Service. Before a classification takes place the Board will have before it all the reports of the inspector, and all the information that can be gathered. Having laid down definite principles, the. Board may delegate to individual members the task of classifying the .Service according to those principles. A provisional classification will be issued, which will stand for a certain time, and if, during that period, an officer is dissatisfied, he can notify the Board that he desires to appeal. The Board will hear his appeal, or it may delegate that duty to one member of lie (Board. The appeal will be heard in conference with the representative of the permanent head of the Department concerned, and the appellant himself, or, if he- so desires, a nominee, who is an officer of the Public Service. His nominee will be allowed to act as an advocate, and put his case completely before the Board. This is practically the same procedure as is now in force, except .that the method will be more direct. It will insure that every man will before his case is determined have the right to be heard. </para>

                    <para>. - I think that the honorable member who has submitted this amendment fails to realize that we are to have a Board of three Commissioners, so that the position will be altogether different from what it was when we had only one. With a Board of three Commissioners there should be no danger of any issue being overlooked. By appointing a separate Appeal Board we shall only load the machine with another cog that may cause friction. I am convinced that the carrying of the amendment would not be to the advantage of public servants. The Board will practically be responsible to the Parliament. It ia provided in the Bill that where they disagree with the Minister they .may come to the Parliament itself, and that means that the Board&#39;s decisions will always be subject to review by Parliament. </para>

We may be sure that it will be most careful in the preparation of its classification scheme, and that the officers will be given every opportunity to put their claims before it. Another point is that- this, will be an independent Board quite free- from departmental interests-. I think it will be so constituted that, unlike the position in the old days, there will be very little cause for appeals on the part of the members of the Service. &#34; The old order changeth, giving place to the new.&#34; </para>

Section 50 gives an officer the right of  resort,  to an Appeal Board against any action affecting him taken tinder the Act. If an officer is aggrieved he may go to another Court. A litigant who is dissatisfied with the decision of a lower Court may appeal to a. higher tribunal, and although the Judge who heard the original suit may be on the Bench, others sit with him, so that the person aggrieved is not appealing from Caesar unto Caesar. </para>

                        <para>- But the final classification as issued will be the decision of all three Commissioners. Under the clause, as it stands, an appeal, by a member of the Service who is dissatisfied with his classification will be heard by the three Commissioners who determined the original classification, plus the: head of the Department concerned. There may be cases where the appellant or his repr :esentative will be able to convince the Commissioners that their original classification was wrong, but they will be very few. The head of the Department, acting with the Commissioners in hearing such appeal&#39;s, will vote with them-. Make the Commissioners as independent as you may, I doubt if they, or any other set of men, especially if chosen from outside the Service, could successfully combat the opinions of heads of Departments. The departmental head knows the working of his Department and the abilities and duties; of his officers so well that the arguments he would be able to submit against changes to which he was opposed would be almost incontrovertible. </para>

                    <para>.- I complain of the power which is to be placed in the hands of the head of a Department to withhold an officer&#39;s increment. By so doing, he not only punishes that officer at the time, but, since the increment has been stopped, the officer is penalized to the extent of the amount withheld for the remainder of his service. </para>

                    <para>. - The inclusion of this clause will have the effect of liberalizing the Act. The particular provision dealing with the right of a permanent head to cause an increment to be withheld has been inserted on the recommendation of the Acting Public Service Commissioner. It will work to the advantage of public servants as a whole. The principle underlying the administration of the Service is that efficiency and ability must be recognised. As a matter of fact, the clause embodies no new departure, because, under present conditions, an officer&#39;s increment may be withheld if he is deemed to have been guilty of misconduct or inefficiency or lack of diligence. I stress the fact that any officer affected by an order for the non-payment of his increment may appeal. The clause actually provides the method of appeal, and of determining it. </para>

In order to illustrate the exact position, I suggest that a postmaster in a distant town has been <inline font-style="italic">reported</inline> by an Inspector for absence from duty without cause, or for inefficient management, or for some other delinquency. The head of the Department in Melbourne has no personal knowledge of the circumstances. He acts upon the Inspector&#39;s report, after having made every possible inquiry, and having taken every circumstance into consideration. In his order he recommends specifically that the officer&#39;s increment be withheld for three months, six months, or twelve months, and at the expiration of that period, the  amount due is paid, and subsequent increments are; bestowed in the. ordinary course. </para>

There must be some such provision as this for the punishment of offenders. The proposal is that, first of all, the offence shall be dealt with by the head of the Department. There is a possibility that tie head of the Department may be too autocratic, or stern, or biased ; therefore, the. officer  is  given the right of appeal, and on that appeal he will be entitled; to submit any evidence he thinks fit. </para>

                <para class="block">This amendment involves the striking out of nearly all the clause as drafted, because it was likely to operate unfairly during the period of classification. The alteration will protect the right of officers to advancement pending classification. The classification may take a long time; supposing it were not completed for two years, it would be unjust to deprive officers of their increments for the whole of that period. The amendment will get over that possibility by enabling a man to be promoted, and even after promotion to get further increments pending the completion of the classification. </para>

                    <para>.! -  I cannot accept this amendment. A good deal of what it seeks to achieve is already conferred by the Bill. &#34; Clause  102  provides for the making of regulations for, <inline font-style="italic">inter alia,</inline> &#34; prescribing the conditions under which officers of a division may be transferred to any specified office or offices in another division, and fixing a maximum age for such transfers.&#34; I think that is sufficient. As to the proposal that half the appointments to the Third Division shall  be  made from successful examinees in the Fourth Division, we shall not attempt to hamper the Board in its administration by fixing a statutory obligation of this kind regardless of the condition of the Service. The Bill already provides that if there are vacancies in the Third Division, men who have passed examinations for transfer from a lower division may be promoted. At the present time a man may pass an examination for a transfer! from the General to the Clerical Division. </para>

                <para class="block">This is the first of a series of similar amendments. This Bill originated in the Senate last year before the Superannuation Bill had been introduced, and it reached us with these provisions in relation to life assurance in it. On the assumption that the Superannuation Bill will be passed, and that there will be no necessity for further compulsory life assurance, I shall move to omit all references to life assurance in this Bill, but a clause will be introduced providing that the existing provisions in regard to life assurance shall continue until a date to be proclaimed, which, of course, will be the date when the Superannuation Act comes into force. </para>

It obviously was not necessary that they should undergo any examination before entering the Service. The clause generally will apply to those officers of the Fourth Division who are now included in the General Division. </para>

                        <para>- But there are other officers in the Fourth Division. Otherwise there would be no sense in providing for an entrance examination. The exemption, however, provides too open a door for the admission to the Public Service of persons who have not passed an entrance examination. Therefore, I suggest the addition of the words which I have just mentioned. </para>

                        <para>- Then he will not apply for the position. Our Public Service legislation has aimed at the abolition of political influence, but of recent years there has been a marked departmental patronage in connexion with the Service which is sometimes much more offensive in character than political patronage ever was. The politician who endeavoured to get his friends into the Public Service could be pilloried if found out, but there is no possibility of treating the head of a, Department in the same way. If we have a suspicion that heads of Departments are exercising patronage there will be no harm whatever in accepting my suggestion, and adding a proviso which would afford some protection to the Board of Commissioners. </para>

                    <para>.- Honorable members perhaps forget the references  to the divisions embodied in the earlier part&#39; of the Bill. In clause 3 they will find the loosest arrangement in this regard which can be found in any Public Service Act, and it will not be possible until the Board does its work of classification to say what  officers  will be included in the Third or Fourth Divisions. The First Division will embrace permanent heads of Departments, and the Second Division officers required to exercise certain executive or professional functions. The Third Division will include - all officers whoso offices the Governor-General, on the recommendation of the Board, directs to be included in that division. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">The Fourth Division will comprise all officers not included in the other three divisions. It will be impossible for the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> to tell the Committee who will be included in the Third and Fourth Divisions. If he could do so, I think we could afford to pass the clause with some such addition as the honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton),</inline> has suggested. But as we do not know who will constitute the Fourth Division, a proposal that the Board shall have power to exempt any specified office in that division from the examination requirement is much too wide. I think the Minister might reconsider it. It is certainly right .that he should ask the Committee to cut out the words relating to life assurance, because they will be an anomaly if the Superannuation Bill passes, but I think that he should safeguard this clause, which gives a side door for entrance to the Public Service, and may cause trouble, injustice, and heartburnings, and dead to the improper use of influence as well as to exercise of wrong judgment in regard to the admission of officers to the Public Service. The proposal made by the honorable member for Maribyrnong would only partly cure the difficulty. I shall be satisfied if the Minister will look into the question, so that, at a later stage, if necessary, he may introduce into the clause the safeguard which- the Committee thinks is required. </para>

                    <para>.- I presume that the Fourth Division will include soldiers in the mail branch of the Postal Department, who are at present temporary employees, but have an excellent record of efficient service running up to seven years. These men have been informed that if they wish ,to become permanent employees, they must pass an examination. I doubt very much if the majority of them could do so. A man who has been carrying mail-bags from the General Post Office to a railway station for the past three or four years, and has given satisfactory service, ought not to be required to pass a clerical examination to become  a  permanent mail driver. He has already passed what I regard as a sufficient qualifying examination. He has fought for his country. However, under present conditions he must remain a temporary employee because he cannot pass  a  clerical examination. I would not advance one argument in support of dispensing with the necessity of holding an examination if the men whose cases I am now mentioning were seeking to fill permanent clerical positions. But they are not anxious to &#39;become permanent officers in clerical positions. They arc merely seeking to continue in the work which they have been performing efficiently for the past seven years. It was not the intention of this Parliament that men who are engaged as mail drivers should pass a clerical examination&#34; before they can move from the temporary staff to the permanent staff. I ask the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> lo look into the cases I have mentioned, and see if they can be met. </para>

                    <para>. -  I will look into the cases that tie honorable member <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blundell)</inline> has brought under notice, but I think he will find that the positions in the Service to which he referred are filled by persons who have come into the Service after passing the examination required for telegraph messengers and so forth. In any case, the regular system of examinations for entrance to the Public Service which has been in force for years past cannot be dispensed with because some persons who have been employed by the Commonwealth in a temporary capacity have done their work satisfactorily, otherwise it would provide  a  means of entering the Public Service which would be exceedingly difficult to administer, and I am afraid would lead to dissatisfaction.

The classification of divisions referred to by the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> was recommended by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan,</inline> who, in giving his reasons for his recommendation, said that the use of the terms &#34; Clerical Division &#34; and &#34; Professional Division &#34; created many difficulties, and that greater elasticity should be given. The clause immediately under review is necessary, but it will be administered only on the lines I have indicated. The certificate which the honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> suggests should be obtained would be useless in cases where, say, a telegraph messenger was required immediately. It would be absurd to call upon the Board to certify that there was no one in the Commonwealth Public Service throughout Australia capable of filling the position of -a telegraph messenger. Without making any definite promise, I shall consider the position, but I again point out that the practical value of the* clause has been demonstrated in the operation of the 1918 Act. </para>

                        <para>- That clause merely gives power to employ returned soldiers, and I believe that now is the time to settle all the questions that have arisen around this problem. The honorable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lister)</inline> and myself are interested in&#39; the case of a soldier in his electorate who has been in the Post Office for a number of years, and has there given general satisfaction, and yet at the end of every six months he is threatened with dismissal. There are many similar cases of the kind among men who are employed delivering the mails and so forth, and who are all doing their work efficiently. It was understood that this Bill would make definite provision for such men by appointing them permanent employees. Surely if they have been found good enough to employ for five or seven years, they ought to be given some security of tenure, and not regarded as temporary hands. It is not satisfactory to a man after ten years&#39; efficient service, to be dismissed. The men in whom I am interested missed their opportunity of getting into the Department by enlisting. It is true that they would not be able to pass a clerical examination, but the work on which they are engaged does not necessitate clerical knowledge. I think this question ought to be settled before we reach clause 83. </para>

                    <para>.- The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> has made it perfectly plain what  verbal amendments he proposes to make, but he has not explained why those amendments are necessary, or what their effect is likely to be. In the first sub-clause of clause 40 there is a minimum age for the appointment to the fourth division, and the appointees may not be less than sixteen or more than fifty. In the next sub-clause, where the appointments are made for special duties, the age <inline font-style="italic">mast</inline> not be more than fifty-five. Then the Minister proposes that the age of fourteen shall stand in sub-clause 3, for such appointees as messengers, telegraph messengers, or any other specified officers. </para>

                        <para>- The apprenticeship question is of first importance, and this practice has not been adopted in the Public Service in  the  past. I hope it is not intended to flood the Departments with apprentices, seeing that there is no law to control their number. The party to which I belong regard the apprentice question as a most serious one. I have known cases in which, through a shortage of work, there have been eight apprentices to one journeyman; and if that takes place in the Public Departments there is sure to be industrial trouble. </para>

                <para>Mr.BLUNDELL (Adelaide.) &#91;3.28&#93;. - I am not against any suggestion, that the Departments shall train young men because, indeed, I recognise that such training is essential. I may say that some- time ago I moved the adjournment of this House in order to bring, under the notice of. honorable members the disabilities of young men who undertake suck terms of, apprenticeship. &#39; They are received into Departments practically, as apprentices, and taught the mechanical side of the work in which they are engaged. On reaching a certain age, however; they find that, in accordance with, the regulations, they must be turned out into the street, because them are no openings for them. All their years of study at the technical schools and otherwise go for nothing, because outside the Service there is no similar employment for them. Nothing is more harmful to the community than young men in such a position. </para>

                <para>Mr.BLUNDELL.- No. A. Department advertises that it is- prepared to take- on boys, and- to train them in certain work. As the result of such an advertisement a number of boys enter, say, the telephone workshops where the instruments are made and repaired. They receive certain technical training, and, in order to improve their knowledge, they attend classes at the School, of Mines. When they reach a certain age, however, they are told that there is: no opening for them in the Department, and out they go. </para>

I have always put up a fight for our returned men, and I am going to do so in connexion with a later clause in this Bill ;, but I do&#62; not. think any Government Department is. entitled to take on. youths on the understanding,  that they are to be taught a trade and then, after they have served a certain period and acquired a certain amount  of  knowledge, to throw them on the scrap heap.

                        <para>- I am referring, not only to telegraph messengers, but to boys who are employed in the telephone and telegraph workshops. I can refer the Attorney-General to the cases of dozens of boys who, after spending several years in these workshops, have been dismissed on reaching the age of eighteen years. They have been thrown out with a trade that is of no use to them outside the Service. It is unfair to take boys into the Service on the understanding that they are to be trained and permanently employed and then, after their training has been carried to a certain stage, to turn them into the street. If a private employer did such a thing honorable members would be up in arms about it. </para>

                    <para>. -  I think that the honorable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blundell)</inline> is under a misapprehension. A certain number of lads&#39; are taken into the employ of the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department as temporary hands to do what is really inferior work, such as the coiling of wire. Those boys are not covered by the clause with which we are dealing. The minimum age fixed for entrance to the Public Service is sixteen years, but telegraph messengers may be taken on at the age of fourteen years. We are now proposing to amend this clause to enable boys under sixteen years of age to be brought into the Service other than as telegraph messengers, because it is desired to make provision for lads who are to be trained as carpenters, locksmiths, painters, &#38;c. A limited number will be taken on for that class  of  work, while others will be brought into the telephone workshops. These lads will be permanent employees of the Service. It is not intended that, after they have received a certain amount of training, they shall be turned adrift. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable member can show me that boys who have been taken into the permanent Service as apprentices have been turned out because there is no room for them, I shall say that he has made out his case. The honorable member made two points. He spoke, first of all, of young fellows who, after being employed temporarily in the Department and partially taught a trade, were turned adrift on reaching a certain age. My reply to that statement is that it relates only to lads who are brought in temporarily to do a certain class of inferior work. They are not apprentices. </para>

                    <para>. - It is most undesirable that boys should enter the Service on the understanding that they are to be taught the engineering or some other trade, and that they should be turned out on reaching a certain age. I know it is difficult to deal with the telegraph messengers and other lads temporarily employed in the Service, but I think action should be taken to avoid the treatment of youths in the way complained of by the honorable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blundell).</inline> Telegraph messengers and others in the Postal Department are employed for a certain time, and then discharged. They enter the Service at, say, thirteen years of age, and, on reaching seventeen years of age, are thrown out, so that three valuable years of their lives are wasted. It is to be regretted that lads should spend so long a period in what I might describe as a dead-end occupation. When the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> mentioned that the clause would apply to a number of apprentices, our suspicions were naturally aroused, but now that the honorable gentleman has assured us that apprentices who are taken on will be brought into the permanent Service, and that when they reach the age of twenty-one years they will come under an award of the Court, I am satisfied. I presume the award specifies that there shall be a certain number of adult workers to every apprentice. </para>

Are young men being apprenticed there, and thoroughly taught their trades? If the Government undertakes the responsibility of teaching apprentices, it should see that they are turned out competent journeymen. I do not believe in a system which turns men adrift after three or four years only half knowing their trade. </para>

                        <para>- The policy of the Labour party and of the trade unions in regard to apprenticeship .has been fairly liberal. In the printing trade we have been sticklers for an apprenticeship of seven years; that applies in the Government Printing Office, as well as outside. Other trades have also insisted that apprentices shall be thoroughly taught their calling. The men who are turned out of Government workshops in which they have been apprenticed should be fit to compete with any workmen in the world. </para>

                    <para>. - I have not joined in the discussion of this Bill, because I enjoy the unique experience of having been a member of the Senate when, during a period of some months, this measure was under discussion there. This clause then evoked a considerable amount of criticism. It was argued that lads who, at the age of fourteen, are engaged as telegraph messengers, and are discharged at the age of eighteen, suffer hardship, losing, perhaps, the most valuable years of their youth. But it was shown by the Minister that the number of telegraph messengers needed by the Department far exceeded the number that could be absorbed if the lads had to be kept on after the age of eighteen years. It seems to me that the amendments of the Minister will, to some extent, meet the difficulties of the case. They will enable the Department to absorb more of these youths than could be done under the Bill as it stands, because they widen the scope of the Commissioners&#39; powers. I would heartily support any proposal for the teaching of  trades to our young men. We are beginning to reap now, and shortly will reap to a fuller degree, the  Jesuit  of the restriction of apprenticeship which has* taken place during the last seven to ten years. We axe being faced with the problem of the unskilled man on whom there is a family dependent, and who is at a dead-end. The Minister&#39;s proposals should help young men to learn trades, and, therefore, I shall support it. </para>

                    <para>.- The question of apprenticeship is one that I have been trying to solve for many years. There are many reasons why lads will not be apprenticed to trades, the lack of apprentices being due not nearly so much to the limitations on apprenticeship as to the disinclination of lads to be apprenticed, and to the objection of some parents to their children becoming tradesmen. In the recent past, especially when Labour was in power, from 1910 to 1913, which &#39; was a time of prosperity, lads could obtain well-paid employment in occupations which, did not soil their clothes, and mothers preferred to see their children in such employment. Many parents think that there is a loss of dignity in being connected with the building trade, or with engineering or any other occupation that soils the clothing. Two years ago, when I was at Newcastle, the Broken Hill Proprietary Company, during a boom period, was taking on boys at <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> a week for a start,, and, of course, it was not possible to get the parents of the lads to whom such an opportunity was open to consent to their apprenticeship to some trade, or calling. The occupations that are sought after are those which enable boys to wear all day the clothes in which they leave home in the morning., and employ them at some specific place, such as a warehouse- </para>

                        <para>- Generally speaking, boys prefer to go into shops and warehouses; they do not &#34; cotton on,&#34; as they would say, to trades. This objection to learning a trade is the more to- be wondered at because the most independent man in the world is the skilful and properly taught tradesman. If a t&#62;oy is going to learn a trade, he had best be put to- it at the age- of fourteen, when, under our public school system&#39;, he has received  a  very fair education. Boys of sixteen or seventeen are often rather far advanced in their tastes and knowledge of the world to take kindly to the learning of a trade or calling, and are less likely than younger lads to become proficient workmen. I  am  glad to say that I learned a trade, and all my life I have been  in  the position of not having to care twopence for any master. While I was a workman, I knew that  my  boss could not give me the sack, because I was worth keeping on; and, if he had done so, there were always others who would be glad of my services. Of course, care must be taken that the Government Departments are not overloaded with apprentices; but, no doubt, the Board of Commissioners, who will be sensible men, will see to that. Some years ago, there was a tendency to fill the workshops with boys, which was all very well while there was plenty of work, but when business . became slack, there were more boys, than workmen. </para>

                    <para>-3.] There  are occasions when the authorities must go outside of the- &#39;Service to obtain certain technically skilled officers. These are already qualified for the work which they are to perform under the Government, and it is only right, of .course, that they should not he required to undergo the usual examination. I understand, however, that in regard to these matters, a certain standard is set in the &#39;Service itself. Too much latitude should not be given ito the Board to appoint persons without examination, while, at the same time, discretion should be permitted. I may cite the selection of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Monash to be the head of the great Morwell electricity scheme. There could have been no better qualified man in Australia, either in respect of experience as an organizer or in the matter of technical equipment. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Monash was the ideal man for the job, and it would have been absurd to require him to undergo an examination upon entering the Victorian Public Service. That is a case foi discretion; and .there are others. There are men who were originally educated to a standard which enabled them to pass an examination ; and, as the years went by, they qualified still more thoroughly in the school of experience. Yet it is possible that .they would not be able to hold their own &#34;in a departmental examination with young men fresh from the schools. Unless the Attorney-General can provide the Committee with satisfactory information upon the point, I shall move to add a proviso to the effect &#34; that such officer has passed an examination of equal standard to that prescribed for entrance to the corresponding Divisions of the Commonwealth Service.&#34; </para>

I wish &#39;to know if the provisions of sub-clause 2, which is now to be deleted, would have applied to officers who have been in the Territorial Service for several years past. The Committee should be careful not to do an injustice to those who have taken the risks and borne the strain of service in tropical climates. If they desire to reenter .the Commonwealth Service,&#39; they should be in no way penalized because of the period which they have spent in the interests of the Commonwealth in the Territories. </para>

The opportunity to enter the Federal Public Service has been open to Territorial officers under the existing Act, and I may add that very little advantage has been taken of it. The opportunity will still remain; to be provided for now, however, in a separate clause. Men who have given years of faithful service in the tropics, where they have helped to carry the heavy burdens of the Commonwealth, are entitled to consideration. The Bill will not grant them any measure of preference ; but they are&#34; to be eligible, as hitherto, for appointment to the Commonwealth Service without undergoing an examination; and, in a new clause  -  48 - which I intend to move, special provision will be made for prior .service to be reckoned as Commonwealth service. </para>

                    <para>.-Certain Tasmanian officers were taken over by the Commonwealth at the inception of the Federation. In. that State, the first Act dealing with the Public Service was passed in 1900, with no retiring age fixed. The Customs and Post Office staffs were taken over in 1901, but the State Act did not receive Royal assent until July, 1901, whereas the officers of these two Departments had been transferred, respectively, on the 1st January and the 1st March of that year. In 1905, another Public Service Act Vas passed, with seventy as the retiring age, and officers who came into the Federal Service after that year did so with their existing and accruing State rights preserved. Thus they are in a somewhat better position than those who entered originally, as I have just described. I have already spoken to the Minister in regard to this matter, and I would be glad if he would explain the position. </para>

He stated the case of a man who was appointed in Tasmania before Federation, and then was transferred to the Commonwealth Service. After his transfer certain State laws were passed giving additional benefits to officers of the State Service. Obviously the transferred officer cannot gain all the  benefits the Commonwealth Service offered when he entered it, and at the same time get the benefits of State Acts passed from time to time subsequent to his transfer.  His  position can only equitably be that all his accrued State rights up to the time of his transfer are preserved to him by the Constitution, and he gets all the subsequent benefits of the Commonwealth Service. He cannot claim any rights conferred on State servants by a State enactment after he left the State Service. </para>

                <para class="block">I took no exception to clause 42, which waives the examination in respect of men already in the Service, but clauses 39, 45, and 46 seem to be departing from one of the finest provisions of the Public Service Act, namely, the competitive qualifying examination. If it were not for the examination for entrance into the Public Service the lives of members of Parliament would be a misery, and the Service itself would not be efficient. In the old days, when political and official patronage ruled in the State Service, inefficiency was rife, and it became a standing joke to advise a man to put a brainless son into the Public Service. I do not say that that stigma upon the Service was always justified. One of the finest features of the existing law is the competitive and qualifying examination. </para>

                        <para>- That can be prevented by careful administration and the taking of due precautions. The laws against burglary do not prevent burglary entirely, but they minimize it. Clauses 45 and 46 provide for the appointment of men without requiring them to pass examinations, and I am proposing that they shall not be admitted to the Service unless they have passed an examination of equal standard to that provided for entrance to a corresponding division of the Service. That is a fair provision. We must be careful to avoid opening the door to political ot official patronage. </para>

It does not seem fair to ask some men to pass a qualifying examination for entrance to the Service and allow the Board, in their discretion, to appoint others without examination, thus preventing the promotion of those who had entered the Service by examination. </para>

                        <para>- That would depend on the standard of such examination, and whether it had been held by approved examiners. It would not do to allow any school to issue a certificate qualifying pupils for admissions to the Service. The persons to whom this clause relates are men who have already retired from salaried positions in the Service of the Commonwealth or the State, and it is natural to assume that a number of them have already passed qualifying, examinations. If those examinations were of equal standard to that now prescribed for entrance to a corresponding division of the Commonwealth Service, it is not necessary for them to be further examined. But if they have not passed such examination, it is not fair to appoint them, and thus prejudice the promotion of others who have passed the prescribed examina&#39;tion. </para>

                    <para>. - I ask the honorable member not to press the amendment. This clause is an exact replica of section 31 of the existing Act, and under it several officers have been appointed, and have rendered most useful service to the Commonwealth. It provides for the appointment, without examination, of persons who have previously been in the permanent Service of the Commonwealth or State, and have had to fulfil all the conditions of entry into such Service. The Board may appoint these men if they are not more than fifty years of age. I think that, under the provision in the existing Act, the Registrar of the High Court, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O&#39;H&#39;alloran,</inline> who had special qualifications, was appointed. Nobody is appointed in this way unless he has some special qualifications. The clause is not altering the law in any way, except as to age of appointment. </para>

It is already to be found in the Public Service Act, and some strong reason must have existed for its inclusion in that measure; that is to say, the experience of the past must have shown that it was necessary to provide that any officer brought back to the Service should not be placed io a position superior to that which he occupied prior to his leaving the Service. It seems hardly fair to those who remain in the Service that one who has retired may be brought back again and given preferment1 over them. Can the Minister inform, me why  the provision was deleted from the Bill in the Senate? </para>

                    <para>. -  This provision was deleted because it was found impracticable in its application. Difficulty arises in comparing classifications. Those of the Commonwealth and those of the States differ, and the trouble is to ascertain which are the higher. The subclause has been omitted on the suggestion of the Acting Public Service Commissioner. Even in our own Service the system of classification will be altered. </para>

Its absence will leave the Service open to the troubles of the past, which must have caused its inclusion in the original Act, and as I fear that grave injustice may be done when a man is brought back to the Service, and placed in a position superior to those filled by men who have been working hard in a Department and looking for some reward in the shape of promotion, I must press my amendment. </para>

                        <para>- Many of these Territories are tropical in character, and that fact should be considered. Many of the men, to my own knowledge, went into the Territorial Service under the impression that when any change was made their seniority in the Commonwealth Service would be preserved - that the two Services were practically interchangeable in regard to their vested rights. The Minister has stressed the fact that many of these Territories are tropical, and, that being so, the men who go there should receive some consideration. These Territories will be continually expanding, and if some provision of the kind I suggest is not made, we shall have great difficulty in inducing men to relinquish their rights in the Commonwealth Service to join the Territorial Service. </para>

                        <para>- That may be; but they also get malaria, amongst other things. Many returned soldiers joined the Territorial Service with the definite understanding and hope that they were not relinquishing their old rights; and they ought to receive the same consideration as is given to men who have come from the Territorial Service to the Commonwealth Service. The number of the men affected cannot be more than fifty, and most of them have seen active service. They passed their examinations, and had a certain standing in the Commonwealth Service; and I repeat that they are entitled to some consideration. </para>

                        <para>- Public servants who are fairly well versed in the drafting of this clause take the view I have expressed. I think that an officer who was temporarily employed, and has by examination become a permanent officer, should have his temporary time counted as service, especially in view of the fact that in the past temporary men who have become permanent officers without examination have had their temporary time thus counted. I should like to know whether I am right in my facts. </para>

                    <para>. - I  invite the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> to consider the position of a woman whose husband is an inmate of a hospital for incurables, and can never again maintain her, as well as that of a woman whose husband is permanently insane. It seems to me that women so situated should be entitled to obtain employment in the Service. The women of Australia have the franchise, and have to conform to the laws of the Commonwealth, and yet we are here enacting that if they are married they shall be debarred from, employment in the Public Service. </para>

                        <para>- A woman who is maintained by her husband should not come into competition with single women or men desiring to enter the Service. i am surprised to find that the clause provides that no married woman shall be eligible for employment either permanently or &#34; temporarily &#34; in the Service. I hope that where there are special circumstances married women with families whose husbands have deserted them will not be debarred from employment. When a husband deserts his wife, and leaves to her the care and expense of bringing up the children:, &#34; special circumstances &#34; are created which I think would bo considered by the Board. But a woman who is being maintained by her husband should not hold a position in the Public Service. In my view, there should be preference to men, in order that they may qualify to marry and maintain the women. </para>

On the other hand, we should not make it possible, when a man and his wife are both in good health, for the wife to remain in the Service, thus allowing two salaries to be drawn for the upkeep of one home, while other persons might be without employment. </para>

                <para class="block">Tho sub-clause which I wish to omit provides that every female officer shall be deemed to have retired from the Service on her marriage. It is all very well to say that some other provision modifies that to which I object; but I. know that last week a lady who .is in the Public Service, and who wishes to get married, was bluntly told that if she marries she must leave. There is no need for a provision such as this, and the only reason the Minister gave for its appearance in the clause is that it has been the custom of the past for women to retire on their marriage. Why should women be penalized? Why should they not be paid as much for their services as is paid to men ? Equal pay for equal work. . They are admitted to the legal and medical professions on equal terms with men, and I fail to see why they should be penalized if they enter the Public Service.  1  refuse to accept the Minister&#39;s assurance that the Board will have power to consider &#39; &#39; special circumstances. &#39; &#39; Those who are humble and poor, and cannot pull strings, will be differently treated from those who can use influence. If the Minister wishes to retain the sub-clause, he should give us good reasons for its retention. A woman who i&#171; giving good service should not be dismissed merely because she is married. </para>

                    <para>.- This is one of the most important clauses in the Bill. It contains innovations which are. likely to create intense dissatisfaction throughout the Service. Power is to he given to the permanent head to fill a vacancy in his Department by the promotion of an officer in his own Department. But if he is of opinion that it is expedient in the public interest to fill a vacancy by the transfer or promotion of an officer from another Department, he must advise the Board; whereupon the Board, after considering the claims of all applicants, may transfer or promote the officer who, in its opinion, is relatively the most efficient. This task of dealing with transfers and promotions has hitherto rested with the Commissioner; it has formed, indeed, the greater part of his responsibilities. Now, the work of the one Commissioner is &#39; to be undertaken by three, but the heavy burden of dealing with transfers and promotions is to practically taken from the Board and handed over to the permanent head3. As the clause reads, the permanent head will have the virtual power to confine promotions within his Department to the officers of his Department. Why should not all officers of the Service be entitled to equal right of selection to fill vacancies? All have passed a general examination, upon entering the Service - no matter to what Department he may have been originally appointed. In the course of the second-reading debate I called attention to certain undesirable  features  of the Bill; for example, in the direction of discrimination as between various classes of officers. This clause provides, &#34; whenever a vacancy occurs in any office other than the First Division. . .&#34; Why should members of the First Division be exempt? </para>

                        <para>- Why should officers of the First Division be removed from the control and oversight of the Board? The post of departmental head is one for which every ambitious man in the Service seeks to qualify himself. Merit should be the factor in deciding promotions. No opportunity should be afforded for political patronage. In recent years there have been certain appointments to higher positions in the Service which could be seriously challenged on. the ground of merit. The Board of Commissioners will have power to enter into the various Departments, will be able to learn the qualifications of officers, and will know, from personal observation, whether or not they are fitted to be promoted  to  the highest places in the Service.

In my opinion the clause requires some amendment. &#39; I am not so much concerned in the amendment moved by the honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Makin)</inline> as I am in the very vital question as to whether we should practically confine promotion in the Public Service in watertight compartments or continue the present system of letting the best qualified man receive the appointment irrespective of where he works. </para>

It is not fair to place promotion in the hands of heads of Departments when all other important functions in connexion with the Service will be dealt with by a Board for which we have voted salaries amounting to &#163;6,500 per annum. I do not think it is equitable to close the door of promotion to everybody outside a particular Department in which the promotion is to be made. Following upon the amendment which has been proposed &#34;by the honorable member for Hindmarsh, another amendment might be made to substitute the Board for the permanent head of the Department. It that amendment were agreed to and consequential alterations were made throughout the Bill a fairer deal would be assured to the whole Public Service. The amendment now before the Committee refers to the First Division only, and, in effect, place.? in the hands of the Board, instead of in the hands of the Government, the appointment of permanent heads of Departments. My vote upon this amendment will be governed by the arguments that can be adduced by the Minister in support of the proposals of the Government, but so far as I can see, the Government are proposing to place promotion within a Department in the hands of the permanent head, to the exclusion of officers of every other Department, and the amendments of which notice has been given by the Attorney-General moke certain my assumption as to the Government&#39;s intentions. For instance, the Minister has given notice that he will move to delete from sub-clause 3 the words &#34; after considering the claims of all applicants for the vacant office.&#34; That amendment, if agreed to, will make more watertight those compartments into which the Bill divides the Service. I shall listen with interest to what the Minister has to say in defence of the clause. </para>

                    <para>Careful consideration has been given by me to the question of transferring the authority for making promotions and transfers from the Public Service Commissioner to the permanent heads and chief officers of Departments&#39;. Responsible heads of Departments who are charged with the duty of internal administration have now a clear conception of the principles that should govern the advancement of officers, and it appears to me that, keeping in view the educative influences of the past sixteen years under the Federal <inline font-style="italic">regime,</inline> the time has arrived when, subject to certain safeguards, the departmental heads may be intrusted with authority as to staff changes. It is imperative that action be taken to obviate the present unseemly delays and to provide moro businesslike methods, insuring at the same time that the claims of every officer are accorded proper consideration. The  transfer  of these functions to permanent heads and chief officers would mean the elimination of action by Inspectors and the Commissioner, as well as reference to the Governor-General. To further expedite action, chief officers should exercise authority in respect to promotions and transfers other than those to the more important positions; this would enable staff changes in the several States to be carried out promptly, and with considerable savings in the present cost of making temporary arrangements due to payment of travelling expenses and relieving allowances. Proper safeguards should, however, be provided against any possibility of outside influence being used in determining promotions. </para>

Promotions and transfers other than in the First Division are to be made by the permanent heads, who must give first consideration to relative efficiency, and, in the event pf equality of efficiency, to relative seniority. In that way the principle of efficiency as the basis of appointments is preserved. </para>

In regard to appointments from amongst officers within his own Department, the permanent head will have full power. All appointments, however, will be provisional, and any person who may be dissatisfied will have the right to appeal. </para>

                    <para>.- The amendment submitted by the honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Makin)</inline> has very much to commend it, and I cannot understand why officers of the First Division should be exempted from being transferred. We have often heard complaints in this House regarding the overstaffing of different Departments. If the clause were amended as desired by the honorable member for Hindmarsh, provision would be made by which an excessive number of officers in one Department could be utilized to make up for a shortage in another. The Minister has not made it clear why officers of the First Division should be exempted from being transferred in this way. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. If the honorable member for Hindmarsh succeeds in having the words &#34; other than in the First Division &#34; left out, ho will subsequently move an amendment to strike out that part of the clause which empowers the permanent heads of Departments to fill vacancies by the promotion or transfer of other officers, and he will provide that all appointments shall bc made by the Board. It will lead to economy if provision is made to transfer oven a limited number of officers of the First Division to other Departments where their services may be utilized, instead of it being necessary to make a fresh appointment should a vacancy occur in any office in the First Division. </para>

                        <para>- We think that the Commissioner has made a slight mistake, and we trust that the amendment will set the matter right. If all appointments are made subject to the Board, it will not only lead to economy, but it will also prevent the exercise of influence. It has often been said that some members of the Public Service have been passed over by others who have &#39;been able to exercise influence. The amendment will obviate all that sort of thing, and will enable the Board itself to deal with all transfers and promotions. If the Minister  give3  the matter fair consideration, he will see that it is a reasonable proposition, which will not only improve the measure, but also do something in the interest of the Public Service. </para>

                <para class="block">This amendment follows on the remarks I previously made, and is moved with the deliberate purpose of taking away from the permanent heads the power to promote their own officers only, at the expense of all the other officers of the Public Service. If this amendment be carried, there necessarily will be consequential amendments, which, I take it, the Minister will make. This amendment is submitted for the purpose of fighting a principle. i believe that the whole of the officers of the Public Service are  entitled  to have their claims considered in respect of any vacancy in any Department, and it seems to ,me on the lines of equity and good conscience, that the Committee should accept the principle of this amendment, for otherwise we shall be making a retrograde step with regard to the <inline font-style="italic">esprit de corps,</inline> prestige and ambition of the services. I do not wish to stress this matter teo much, but I have, with other honorable members, received a communication with regard to the Bill from representatives of the whole of the public servants. They set out arguments, which, no doubt, the Minister has before him, why this clause should nob be passed as presented, and each and every one of the arguments appeals to me as sound, proper, and logical. If the Minister has not before him those arguments, I am quite willing to read them; if he has, I shall not delay the Committee, but will listen  with  some interest to what he has to say against my proposal. I submit the amendment for the reasons I have given, and I hope it will be accepted by the Committee. </para>

                    <para>After a careful analysis of the position, and keeping .in view the necessity for bringing the whole of the Commonwealth services under one general autherity, I am satisfied that full justification exists for relieving the Commissioner and Inspectors of some of the detailed work at present required of them, and in particular that connected with promotions, transfers, and increments to salaries. &#91;Later sections of this report dealing with .the classification of the Service and promotions and transfers of officers, will disclose the burdensome requirements of the present procedure in relation to promotions, transfers, and increments; and from these it will bc evident that if these requirements ave to be still demanded of the Commissioner and Inspectors, they_ can only be met either at the continued sacrifice of other important functions - a sacrifice which would be detrimental to the economical and efficient working of Departments - or else by making provision for an increase to the inspectorial staff to a far greater extent than will be required if the proposed new plan of organization be adopted. lt is mainly in the direction of largely transferring to heads of Departments existing responsibilities of the Commissioner and Inspectors in . relation to promotions, transfers, and increments that the new plan of organization will operate. The responsible officers of Departments have now the advantage of many years of experience of Public Service methods in dealing with staff conditions. They recognise, and are generally in full sympathy with, the basic principle of the Public Service Act, which makes efficiency the first essential of promotion; they realize the importance of careful administration in the matter of trans,fers involving in many cases heavy expenditure in the removal from one station to another of officers and their families; and, under the altered conditions which will be suggested, they will be placed in a position to deal with increments with an essential uniformity of action unattainable if they were vested with such authority under existing conditions. The exercise by departmental heads of these proposed responsibilities should be subject to the right of appeal being extended to officers under conditions to be prescribed, and the Commissioner being the final authority for determination of appeals. Under this re-arrangement the Commissioner and his staff will be relieved from much of the minutiae of detail, and will be free to deal with the wider questions of policy and organization of Departments, and with measures for greater economy of administration. </para>

                    <para>Careful consideration has been given by me to the question of transferring the authority for making promotions and transfers from the Public Service Commissioner to the Permanent Heads and Chief Officers of Departments. Responsible heads of Departments who are charged with the duty of internal administration have now a clear conception of the principles that should govern the advancement of officers, and it appears to me that, keeping in view the educative influences of the past sixteen years under the Federal <inline font-style="italic">regime,</inline> the time has arrived when, subject to certain safeguards, the departmental heads may be intrusted with authority as to staff changes. It is imperative that action be taken to obviate the present unseemly delays, and to provide more businesslike methods, insuring at the same time that the claims of every officer are accorded proper consideration. The transfer of these functions to Permanent Heads and Chief Officers would mean the elimination of action by Inspectors and the Commissioner, as well as reference to the CoovernorGeneral. To further expedite action, Chief Officers should exercise authority in respect to promotions and transfers other than those to the more important positions; this would enable staff changes in the several States to bo carried out promptly, and with considerable savings in the present cost of making temporary arrangements due to payment of travelling expenses and .relieving allowances. Proper safeguards should, however, be provided against any possibility of out- side influence being used in determining .promotions. </para>

                <para>Those safeguards are provided in the Bill. I trust that the honorable member for Parramatta <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pratten)</inline> realizes the seriousness of the action he is taking, foi* it is a serious step indeed to remove the very basis of the recommendations in the ex-Commissioner&#39;s report. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. MoLachlan</inline> gives his reasons for the reform he desires to be made, and the only question we have to ask. ourselves is whether we can, in carrying it out, see that no injustice happens to the officers in regard to promotion. </para>

                        <para>- I am not in a position to say; in any case, that is not the question. What we have to decide is the right course to adopt for the &#39;Commonwealth Public Service on the advice we have received. Is the system proposed in the Bill a fair one? Will it secure what we desire in the Public Service? These are the questions we have to ask ourselves. It is admitted that we should secure efficiency in the Public Service, and to that end, when promotions are made, efficient persons should be chosen. The clause expressly conserves the very  basis of efficiency. In making promotion, consideration must be first given to relative efficiency. </para>

                    <para>.- I cannot see my way clear to follow the advice given us in the eloquent address just delivered by the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom).</inline> This, to my mind, is one of the most important clauses in the Bill. It goes to the very kernel of the Service I voted for the appointment of a Board of three Commissioners in order that the Service should be controlled by men who would be free from departmental influences, and would &#39;be able to give an unbiased judgment on all these great and important questions. The head of a Department is, after all, only human. He may have under him a man who serves him well, a man of ability who will carry out effectively the work intrusted to him, and when a vacancy occurs in his Department he will naturally be prepared to promote such a man. There may be in another Department a man of equal capacity, but what chance will he have against an applicant for the vacancy who is in close touch with the head of the </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">Department in which that vacancy exists? The head of each Department has his office in Melbourne, and cannot keep in touch with every officer in his Department throughout Australia. When filling vacancies in the other States, he will have to rely on the advice of the officers in charge of his State branches. The clause, as it stands, lends itself to the very worst thing that could happen in a public Department. The &#34; Uriah Heep &#34; who will &#34;smoodge&#34; .to the head of his Department - who  will open the door for him when ho enters and close it for him as he leaves - under a provision such as this, will progress in the Service by leaps and bounds, while the man of real ability who does his work quietly and efficiently, but will not &#34;smoodge&#34; to any one, will find promotion most difficult. Wo are practically being asked to return to the &#34; good old days &#34; when the head of a Department was all-important. As a public servant, working overtime with others, I have seen the head of the room look up from the work at which he was busily engaged when the head of the Department has entered, and have heard him say, &#34; Good evening, sir.&#34;- And I have known the head of the Department to carpet that man for failing to rise and salute him as he entered. I have known the head of a room to be told in such circumstances, &#34;If you do not rise and salute me when I enter the office, I shall teach you your duty, and you will soon find yourself somewhere else.&#34; That is the sort of thing that was done in the &#34;good old days&#34; to which we are asked to return. I speak feelingly on this question, because I am convinced that it is not in .the interests of the country, the Service, or the heads of Departments that the responsibility for making promotions should be thrown upon heads of Departments. If promotions are to be made by heads of Departments, what are the three Commissioners to do? We are told that, under this clause, a dissatisfied officer may appeal to the Board, but he would hesitate to take action. He would know that it would be within the power of the head of his Department, under whom he would continue to work, to do him an injury if, in the course of his appeal, he made statements to which his chief took exception. The head of .the Department would not  &#34; deal &#34; with him straight out, but there are a hundred ways of killing a dog besides that of choking him with butter. I know of lots of cases where promotion <inline font-style="italic">has</inline> been denied. I know of a returned soldier who, on resuming his work in the Service, was kept back because, although he was efficient, he was quiet and easygoing and would not push himself. That sort of thing will not occur if promotions are made by the Board of Commissioners. The Board will be free from departmental influences; applications for vacant positions will be gazetted, and the Commissioners will obtain full information as to the merits of all applicants. The work of the Commissioners will occasionally come up for review. What is the Board to do if it is not to deal with important questions of this kind? I have the greatest respect for heads of Departments, and as a member of Parliament have always treated them well, just as I have endeavoured to treat every subordinate officer. But power intoxicates some men. There are men who do not presume on their authority, while there are others of whom it may be said, &#34;God help those who come up against them&#34; as soon as they get into power. Heads of Departments may be either men who ! have climbed every rung of &#39;the; ladder and know every branch, of the work, or men who have come into the Department, perhaps through influence, knowing nothing about the details of its administration. Those of the first kind know what is a fair day&#39;s work for the men under them, while the others generally feel that they must make their position sure by exercising, what they call discipline, which often means the Harsh treatment of subordinates, and the setting of jobs for them which the (head -cannot do himself, and for which he has to fix a time limit without knowing how long should be occupied on it. </para>

                        <para>- The Board will be able <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> arrive at that. When I took charge of the Department of the Navy, the secretary of the Clerks Union was continually complaining because there was no classification. I therefore got an officer, one of the best obtainable - he has since left the Service and is making twice as much by practising law as he got in salary - and made him  chairman  of a Board to which I appointed a man from each  branch, instructing them to draw up a scheme of organization. This they did, basing it largely on the classification scheme of the Public Service. Their classification was satisfactory to the Department generally, and I received a letter to that effect. Some of the men in the Department were, of course, reduced by the classification, but I went into all the complaints that were made, dealing with  them  individually. If you appoint the right man to the right place you soon make your task of administration very easy. . </para>

                        <para>- An inspector may know nothing about telegraph operating, but if he gets hold of an expert, and is instructed as to the cardinal points on which to judge operators, he can easily, after a trial of ten minutes or so, determine which of a number of candidates for promotion is the best operator. The Board of Commissioners, I presume, would be instructed by experts. The head of a Department could not rely on. his own knowledge in the making of promotions. The vacancy to which .the promotion (had to be made might be in the Sydney office, and tha departmental head in Melbourne could not afford the time to go to Sydney to judge of the abilities of the candidates for promotion there. Whatever may be said for this beautiful city, it must not be thought that it is the whole Commonwealth. A departmental head is fully employed in watching over the conduct of his own Department if he is to prevent such deplorable things as were happening in my constituency recently, which made it necessary for me to draw attention to the manner in which mails were being delivered there, a duty which should never have fallen upon ,me. Owing, however, to the promptitude of the Postmaster-General in attending to my representations, the difficulty has been got over, and we have now a much better delivery of mails than we used to have. The proposal to- which I object would give to the heads of Departments enough  work to engage the whole of their attention, to the neglect of all their present work. At the present time the responsibility for promotion does not rest with the head, of a Department, and the inspector, who is responsible probably knows nothing of the man concerned until he inquires into the action that has been taken. I do not say that heads of Departments are worse than other men. I have had men working under me whom I have learned to love for their efficiency, but would it have been right for me to determine, without any check, what promotion those men should have ? I wish to see these matters dealt with by independent Commissioners. For what else are we creating the Board of Commissioners? How could the head of a Department like that of the Postmaster-General say whether- an office boy should be promoted or not? In the Board&#39;s office there would be a man who was constantly dealing with these matters, and who would have all information. I do nob see why all the promotions made in Melbourne should go to the public servants who are living here. Why should not men from other cities, such as Hobart, have a chance? </para>

                        <para>- The Board would get information from the head of the branch in which the promotion was to be made. In. the Department of the  Postmaster  -General  there  is. a &#39; departmental head in Melbourne, and in Hobart the chief officer is called the head of a branch,. if a promotion were to  be  made under the system, proposed, the branch head would get a report from the head of the section concerned. I think it would be better if, instead of the head of the section reporting to the branch head, and- the branch head reporting&#39; to the departmental head  in  Melbourne, the head of the section should report through the head of the branch to the Commissioners&#39; representative in Hobart. I  speak  feelingly on this subject, because.-  I  know that great injustice may be done to the public servants if we agree to the proposals of the &#39; Government-. We do not leave to the Board of Commissioners the promotion of heads of Departments. Why ?&#39; Because, I suppose, we  think  that the heads of the Departments are almost the equals of the Commissioners. I wish to have matters like promotions dealt with by men who will be wholly unbiased and directly responsible to the Commissioners. Where the -matter is an important one, the three Commissioners will look into it. </para>

                        <para>- Should it happen that a man who was not efficient was appointed or promoted by the permanent head of the Department, of what effect would parliamentary criticism be? The departmental head would merely read it and smile, knowing that nothing would happen to him. I have heard bitter criticism of departmental heads uttered in this Chamber, but I have not known any departmental head to be removed from his office. In Tasmania., as in the other States, &#39;in the old days, men who in the first instance had obtained their appointment because they were related to some one of influence, in the State, would, remain in office until they had long outlived their usefulness; that is no,w a thing of the past - let it remain so. I ask honorable members to give the Board of Commissioners something; to do. If the Board does not do its work well,, we can change the Commissioners. What would be the need of a Board if every departmental head could be intrusted wholly with the organization of his Department, the regulating of promotions, and the like? Do honorable members propose to- do without the Board, and get back to the old. State practices ? I would not have voted for a Board of three Commissioners, had I thought that they would be dummies, without responsibilities,, and with not, much to do. Let them have responsibilities,, and let them carry out the work intrusted to. them:. </para>

                    <para>,- The transfer and promotion of officers is one of the most important features of Public Service administration. I heartily support the honorable member for Parramatta <inline font-weight="bold">(&#39;Mr. Pratten).</inline> The Government, however, have apparently set their- face against amendments emanating from private members. Grave injustice will be dome to many excellent officers if this clause is not amended. As it stands, there may be a&#62; first class, man ku&#39; the Trade and Customs&#39; Department who is due for promotion. A vacancy may occur in the Home and Territories Department - one which he could fill with, credit to himself and satisfaction to the Commonwealth. But, because the filling of that vacancy is left in the hands of the permanent head of the Home and Territories Department, the officer in the Trade and Customs Department has . no hope of being selected, no matter how much greater may be his qualifications than those of any officer in the Department where the vacancy has occurred. I hope the clause will be amended to provide that all vacancies shall be gazetted, and the position thrown open to eligible officers throughout the Service; and I trust that all selections will be made on merit alone. By appointing a Board of three, we are instituting a costly form of administration; but if we delegate, one of its most important functions to persons subordinate to the Board there will be discord. I am confident that in practically every instance vacancies will be filled by departmental heads solely from officers within the Departments concerned. </para>

                    <para>.- -What will be the use of the Board if its most important duties are undertaken by the heads of Departments? Hitherto one of the foremost tasks of the Public Service Commissioner lias been the selection of officers in connexion with transfers and promotions. The fact that the Commissioners are not to be given this duty, and&#39; that departmental&#39; heads are ta undertake it, suggests that the Commissioner in the past has not been successful in this direction. i <inline font-style="italic">do</inline> not say that such is the case; but one would naturally be led&#39; te infer it. Where have those officers come from who occupy the important positions at Canberra;?. They are all Victorians.. How have they &#34;picked all the plums.&#34; at the .Federal- Capital? It is because they have had a &#34; pull- &#34; at headquarters, in Melbourne. That fact applies even- to those in. the humbler positions. </para>

                    AUSTIN, (CHAPMAN;. - I db not deny- that they are excellent men merely, because they happen to- be Victorians,, and have had the good fortune to exercise a &#34; pull &#34; at head -quarters-. This system has been bad enough under a Commissioner-, but when the departmental heads are given the right of making promotions there will be a great deal more &#34; pulling &#34; at head-quarters. The favorites of the permanent head - those closely around him - will&#39; get the jobs every time. Promotions and transfers should be decided absolutely on merit. Political and every other kind of &#34; pull &#34; should be ruled out. Honorable members have spoken of the evils of centralization ; this clause will place a premium upon the evil. Until, recently there was at the head of the Pensions Branch in New South Wales a very excellent officer, who incidentally was a Victorian. He was a most thoroughly competent man, and he gave great satisfaction, both to the public at- large and to the pensioners particularly. I understand that this officer recently received notice to report, himself to head-quarters, in Melbourne, and that another officer, from the Central Office, was appointed in his stead. Whether that was an instance of departmental &#34; pull,&#34; or whether the head of the Department had some grievance against the man who was until recently in charge in Sydney, I do not know ; I intend to make it my business to find out. Probably the reason for the transfer was that the permanent head considered that his  deputy  in Sydney was making too much headway.

                        <para>- Exactly. The only concrete reason: which&#39; the Attor-ney-General. has so far advanced in; support of the principle underlying the- clause is that this- system of promotion- has been .  extant in England for the past 100 years. I am proud to be a good Britisher, but these hoary old practices do not commend themselves to me. What control will the Government have over the conduct of heads of Departments who are about to retire? They are independent. They will do as they like, and promote whom they like. As they are about to step out, they will probably take good care to do the last favour at their command to their best friends. I know of one permanent head who will have retired in a short time. What does he care for the Government, or for anybody else? I am told that he is making some of the most audacious alterations in his Department. What do these men care for what Parliament may say? The honorable member for Denison <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Laird Smith)</inline> says that these officers smile at members of Parliament. My experience has been that they sneer at us. Parliament will retain some measure of control over the Board, bub permanent heads can be autocrats. I do not wish to be regarded as attacking all our departmental chiefs. Numbers of our leading officers earn much more than their pay. They are most excellent and enthusiastic men. Their capacity is such that they would be doing far better for themselves if they were out in the open field of competition. Thank God I We have public servants who will &#34;stand up&#34; to members of Parliament. But let us not place the power in their hands to extend the curse of centralization. It has been said that if a man wants a job at the Federal Capital he must be a Victorian. </para>

                        <para>- I, personally, have nothing to complain about, but the provincial atmosphere is becoming more pronounced every day. I do not blame the Victorians for exercising a &#34; pull,&#34; but I support the amendment as a means of taking away all &#34; pull.&#34; It is proposed to appoint highly-paid Commissioners to do certain work, of which promotions and transfers are one of the most important parts. Yet the Minister asks us to delegate the work to men who often in the past have made a failure of it. i have already stated what happened to an officer in New South Wales who has an excellent record, and had given satisfaction to the public and consideration to the pensioners. Why should the head of a Department be allowed in this autocratic way to bring an efficient officer from New South Wales, which contributes practically half of the revenue of the Commonwealth, to Melbourne for no apparent reason, except that honorable members have in this House praised that officer&#39;s administration. </para>

It must have been with such bristling and commanding eloquence as the honorable member has just employed that Moses rose to the supreme command of his distinguished race. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Eden-Monaro is slow and incorrect of speech, but, nevertheless, picturesque and illogical. Moses was at least logical. But let me put a finger upon the gleaming fallacy that ran through the whole argument of the honorable member for Eden-Monaro. He objects to the centralization of authority. The Minister&#39;s proposal, whether it be right or wrong, seeks to destroy centralization, whilst the proposal of the honorable member for Eden-Monaro seeks to concentrate authority at the seat of government, whether Melbourne on Canberra. Surely, if we give to the heads of Departments power over transfers and promotions we diffuse authority over eight or ten men residing in Melbourne, Sydney, Canberra, or elsewhere. If, on the other hand, we&#39; confine that authority to one Board, whose head-quarters must necessarily be at the seat of government, that will surely be concentration reconcentrated.. What has the honorable  member for  Eden-Monaro to say to that? Let us turn away from the outburst of passion which characterized the honorable member&#39;s speech to the restrained atmosphere in which the honorable member for Parramatta <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pratten)</inline> launched his amendment. This is not an easy matter to settle on its merits; it is important, and has been argued from both sides in Public Service quarters for well nigh a generation. It is a problem of whether the efficiency of the Service - and I am considering the efficiency of the Service more than the rewards of individuals in the Service - is test served  by allowing promotions over the whole area of the Service or by putting it into watertight compartments known as Departments. In other words, if a man joins the Customs Department., is he to be able to climb the Customs ladder only all his days or, if he shows peculiar aptitude, will ho be able to climb higher and faster the ladders of other Departments. </para>

                        <para>- That is what the system means in practice. If the heads of Departments have the right to promote, in ninety-nine cases out of 100, particularly where discretion or executive ability is desired, the man trained in the Department in which the vacancy occurs will be given the preference. As a matter of practice that principle is growing, even in those services in which promotion is supposed to extend over the whole area. </para>

                        <para>- It is the practice, although theoretically promotion roams the whole Service. If a vacancy of a certain class in a Department is gazetted nil the men in that class throughout the Service have theoretically a right to apply for the position, and to be appointed to it in preference to an officer in the Department who is junior to them in their class. But in actual practice familiarity with the routine of the Department and tried efficiency in the discharge of its work usually determine the appointment. </para>

                        <para>- The question is whether efficiency in the Service can best bc secured by compartment promotion or by broadcasting promotions throughout the Service. I have known many cases of transfers from Department to Department that proved unexpectedly beneficial. I speak more particularly of the Public Service of the State of Victoria, with  which I  I am more familiar. I know of a man who was taken from the Postal Department to perform most important administrative work at the launching of the income tax branch in that State. Ho performed his task with wonderful efficiency, and later was transferred to other Departments. If he had been confined to the Postal Department he would have had no opportunity to do the important work which later he performed, and would have been deprived of promotion. </para>

                        <para>- I believe it is so in most of the States. This is not a matter upon which honorable members can dogmatize, but those who have had administrative experience have more practical acquaintance with the way in which the Act operates to-day than have those who have not had that experience; and, favorable to the amendment though I am, I say broadly that if the system of broadcast promotion is not pushed too far, but is operated with discretion, we shall -probably get a more contented and more efficient Service than by compartment promotion. I fear a proposition which will confine promotion in a Department to officers within that Department, with the result that when a man gets into one Department he will have no chance to rise beyond its limits, no matter what his abilities may be. That is not the way to attract the best men to the service of the nation. </para>

                        <para>- Of course; but the Board should take the responsibility. In the State of Victoria, the Public Service Commissioner has to make all important promotions and transfers, except of heads of Departments. These are appointed by Ministers, who, of course, are responsible to Parliament. But for all other appointments, from the 1st Class to the 5th Class, the Commissioner is responsible, and he acts on the recommendation of, and in consultation with, the heads of Departments. I think it is best to adhere to that system. Ministers may seek to amend Acts and alter practices, but they should keep their hands off those practices which experience has proved to be beneficial. In spite of small salaries, the Public Services include some of the finest brains in Australia. It has been my privilege,- as a member of Victorian State Governments, to work with officers ranging from the middle to the senior ranks, and frequently I have told men that if they would leave the Public Service and go into business they would earn infinitely more than if they remained in a Government Department. Men are attracted to a kind of service that gives permanence and the possibility of advancement; but the most important thing of all is to open wide the doors of inducement if we want <inline font-style="italic">to attract to the</inline> service of the nation the best brains that young Australia can offer. I suggest to the Minister that he may probably find the opinion of the Committee against him on this amendment, judging by the speeches that have been made. He is malting wondrous progress with this Bill, although he may not know it. It is a measure which, in ordinary circumstances, might well be under consideration in &#34;this Committee for a month. The problems surrounding the Public Service are such that Governments and members of Parliament can with propriety give them the fullest consideration. Yet we are probably expected to put this Bill through in two or three days. I trust that the Minister is not discontented with the careful consideration that honorable members have shown for the Bill, or with their desire to improve it. Therefore, I hope that he will not resist the appeal made by the Committee that he should agree to this alteration. We do not make laws like the laws of the Medes and Persians. If, after establishing this triple Board, it should come back to us saying, &#34; Parliament altered our charter and gave us too many duties, and we desire to place this and that function on the shoulders of heads of Departments,&#34; we should listen, because, the experiment having been tried, a better method will have been suggested by experience. I, therefore, suggest that the Minister should accept the amendment and give to the Board of three Commissioners, which will have  sufficient <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> to devote one man especially to the routine work of transfers and promotions in the Service, a chance of fashioning and functioning in a way which I think will be to the lasting advantage of the Service. </para>

If the matter had been referred to a Board of Commissione&#62;rs I am sure the transfer would not have taken place.

                    <para>In the case of an advertised vacancy two weeks&#39; notice is usually given, and upon receipt of applications the Public Service Inspector confers with the Chief Officer. After conference, the Inspector and Chief Officer submit separate reports to the Commissioner, the Chief Officer forwarding his report through the Permanent Head. Upon these reports the Commissioner makes his recommendation to the Governor-General., such recommendation being transmitted through the Minister of the Department concerned. The Governor-General&#39;s approval is conveyed through the customary channels back to the Department, when the promotion is gazetted. In regard to non-advertised vacancies the procedure is similar, excepting that consideration is not limited to the claims of applicants as in the other case. The time and labour involved in this complicated and circuitous procedure is evident, and, although efforts have been made to shorten the process by delegation of authority in certain classes of &#34;cases to Inspectors and Chief Officers, nothing loss than an amendment of the law will suffice to place the matter on a proper footing. </para>
                    <para>Tho provisions of the law requiring a report from the Permanent Head or Chief Officer, recommendation by the Commissioner, and approval by the Governor-General, were designed no doubt as safeguards against unfair discrimination in the selection of officers for promotion, but in the application of these provisions excessive delays have occurred in filling vacant positions and consequent expense and inconvenience to Departments because of the necessity of making temporary arrangements pending the .permanent promotion of officers. It is not unusual for months to elapse between the notification of a vacancy and the filling of the position, and in cases where the vacant office is in the higher grades of the Service, the consequential changes following upon the initial promotion can only be made long after the occurrence of the original vacancy, with hampering effects upon Departments which call for rectification. The time and attention of Public Service Inspectors, especially in the larger States, are absorbed in dealing with promotions and transfers of officers to such an extent as to militate seriously against their usefulness in other directions, particularly in regard to the general organization of Departments and the disposition of offices and officers to insure efficient and economical management. </para>

                    recommendation was based on his actual experience of . the working of the existing system, to which honorable members desire to revert. If all promotions and transfers are to be effected by the Board, the delay, the inconvenience, the cost, and the harassing conditions which
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan</inline>
                    recommends should be avoided, will continue. Honorable members are apparently willing to go against the recommendation of the ex-Public Service Commissioner simply because they do not wish promotions to be made by heads of Departments. Do they think that there is any likelihood of the head of a Department acting unfairly ? If so, let me point out that at the present time, in substance, promotions are made upon the recommendations of the heads of Department. That must .be so, because the recommendations of the heads of Departments could not be disregarded by the Public Service Commissioner. If the clause  i3  allowed to stand, all the existing machinery requiring the furnishing of reports by inspectors will be done away with, and promotions will actually, and not in substance, as at -present, be made by the heads of Departments, who . will know who are best fitted to fill vacancies. In any case, the decision of the head of the Department is subject to an appeal. Again, the Commissioners, instead of having to deal with all the machinery relating . to every promotion and transfer throughput Australia, and snowing themselves up with unnecessary work, will simply handle appeals and transfers from one Department to another. According to the honorable member for Eden-Monaro
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Austin Chapman),</inline>
                    I am attempting to buttress the method outlined in the clause by an appeal to British precedent. As a matter of fact, I gave the illustration of the system adopted in Great Britain because that country has a first-class Public Service. It is the honorable member himself who is taking the conservative attitude by asking for the perpetuation of a system which stands condemned, and by objecting to a change which. I contend, will lead to greater efficiency.

                        <para>-  Even Moses! <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. BRENNAN.</inline> - Even the introduction of Moses was not essential to enlighten the discussion of the subject; while I may be prepared to grant that our own local and modern Moses is an important accessory to all debates in this Chamber. However, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Chairman,</inline> I shall not strain your toleration by going any further wide of the subject. I cannot understand why it is that the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> opposes this amendment, unless it be that, as it is the duty of the Opposition to oppose, so, apparently, it is conceived to be the duty of a Minister to persistently, and, I would say, even obstinately support a clause when it has been shown by wealth of argument and illustration that, as proposed, it is out of harmony with the purpose of the Bill, and with what justice demands. We. are asking bv this  amendment that the question of the transfer of officers to particular Departments shall not be governed solely by the judgment, or, it may be, the whim of the head of that Department. It  can  be seen at once that the head of a Department may well be the last person likely to part with a valuable officer who suite him admirably, but who may very well be in great demand for some important position outside his particular purview. It is in order that we may have a body capable of taking a wide survey of Public Service requirements that we have created this Board. I was one of those who supported the creation of a Board of three, and I am very glad that, in spite of my advocacy, that policy was adopted. I pause for the laugh I expected to greet that statement; however, honorable members do not seem to see the joke, or worse still, do not regard it as such, and so I shall go on. We did hope that, having established this Board of three - this special jury - for an informed survey of Public Service requirements, we should have the benefit of the Board&#39;s special knowledge and experience In the matter of transfers of the kind contemplated. I cannot understand why the Minister, when this elaborate and somewhat expensive machinery of a Board, with its high salaries, has been created, should not be prepared to make full use of it. I may add that I was one of those who supported the higher pay for the members of the Board, because I believe that men discharging onerous and important public functions like members of Parliament should be adequately paid. I hope that the Minister will give way to argument on this matter, because I promise him that, if he does not give way to argument, he may probably very soon have to give way to weight of numbers, and it is more graceful and pleasant to give way <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> argument than it is to unwillingly give way to numbers. There is no logical answer to the arguments adduced by the mover of the amendment <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pratten)</inline> in his most logical and incisive speech, though I may admit that I did not hear it. Wow that we have this Board, let us make full use of it. I appeal to the Minister not to &#34; stonewall &#34; his own Bill, but to let us get on with it, and, where obvious improvements are suggested,, to accept them in a proper, instead of a carping, spirit. I appeal to the Minister not to persistently bang out against amendments until he has taken the numbers, and then to endeavour to make us believe that he is impressed by argument when he is really impressed by the counting of heads. </para>

                    <para>.- The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> has endeavoured to show that the amount of work to be performed by the members of the Board is so great in connexion with promotion that they will have little time in which to carry out their other duties. I am not at all sure that that view i3 a correct one. I see no reason why the members of the Board should associate themselves with at least 90 per cent, of the promotions in the Public Service, for minor promotions may safely be left in the hands of departmental heads, in the same way as the Minister would leave to them all promotions. In the case of the remainder of the promotions it is, in my opinion, essential that the Board should be in control. It is not unlikely that when a vacancy occurs there is a man in some other Department far better fitted for the position than any in the Department itself. Under the circumstances the Committee would be well advised to support the amendment, as it is my intention to do. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not propose to -address myself further to the merits of the question. I am still satisfied that we shall make a great mistake in not adopting the recommendation of the man who knows more about the subject than any other person in Australia - a man whose judgment we may act on with confidence, and whose high motives in connexion with the Service no one can question. It is obvious that the consensus of opinion is against the clause as it stands, and I shall not press it further. All I can now do is to move that clauses 50, 51, and 52 be postponed in order that I may introduce new provisions to continue the practice which has be on condemned. . </para>

It is rather peculiar that the honorable member <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Makin),</inline> who has been insisting on examinations of all kinds, should now seek to remove the system of examinations at present in existence. The object of the clause is to enable the Board, by regulation, to provide that the transfer or promotion to any specified office shall be dependent on the passing of an examination. This, of course, makes for efficiency and for the improvement of the Public Service generally. The honorable member, however desires to restrict examinations to cases where special or technical knowledge is required. </para>

                        <para>. -  The object of subclause 2 is to retain in the hands of the Governor-General in Council the appointment of permanent heads. That is the law as it exists at the present time. The sub-clause leaves in the hands of the Executive of tha day the serious responsibility of appointing heads of Departments, The Executive will have the right to take the advice of the Board if it thinks fit with respect to the filling of such a position, and  I  think it right and proper that such appointments should be made by the Governor-General in Council. </para>

Why should we appoint a Board of Commissioners if we cannot intrust them with the power to appoint permanent heads of Departments? The Executive has power over all -Boards, and we know exactly what happens when an appointment is made by it. The papers are put before the Governor-General in Council by the responsible Minister, and he signs them as a matter of form. We should not hamstring the Board of Commissioners in this way.

                    <para>. - I support the amendment for the reason that I desire that this Bill shall be as far as possible full and complete in every detail. By practically accepting the amendment that I moved on a previous clause, the Minister has given to the Board a&#39; reserve power in connexion with promotions in the Service, and I believe that reserve power, from a business point of view, will be found df great importance in connexion with the matter under discussion. In a great industrial undertaking, such as that of Vickers, England,&#39; which has various departments - drawing offices, moulding, engineering, shipbuilding, and aeroplane works, &#38;c. - each department is controlled by, say, a manager. But the managing director also has a reserve power in respect of all that goes on, including the appointment of the managers of departments. If the board of directors attempted to interfere with the managing director&#39;s administration in connexion with the working of that big industrial undertaking, he would say at once, &#34; I have control of this undertaking; it is my responsibility to make it a success.&#34; He would not tolerate such interference. </para>

Ambition will be promoted, and, what is very important to us, we shall perhaps rid ourselves in this way of a lot of trouble and work we now have in connexion with the administration of the Service. i </para>

                    <para>.- Having regard to the decision of the Committee on clause 50, I think that if we are to be consistent, we .must support this amendment. There are within the Commonwealth Service men who by reason of their merit have claims for consideration when any permanent head is to be appointed. Sub-clause 2, however, would allow of a party political appointment to be made. In the interests of the efficiency of the Service that is not desirable. If we allow the sub-clause to remain, we shall stifle the ambition of those in the Service who desire to qualify for the higher appointments, but who, having failed to catch the eye of the Government of the day, would not, under the clause as it stands, have an opportunity to secure the more privileged positions in the Service. As one who desires to see equality of opportunity and the adoption of a uniform procedure in making appointments in the Service, I cannot agree to a provision that would allow appointments to the higher positions in the Service to be determined on grounds of political expediency. I hope that the Attorney-General will agree to the omission of sub-clause 2 so that in the making of these appointments merit alone will be considered. </para>

                    <para>. -  I commend the Minister for the unusual brevity and conciseness of his speech. I see no reason why he should not accept the amendment with the graceful acquiescence with which he accepted the last one. It is rarely that the honorable member for Eden Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Austin Chapman)</inline> makes so sensible a speech as he has made on this matter. That alone is a reason why the Minister should give way. The first- part of the clause provides that all appointments to the First Division must be made on the recommendation of the Board. I am satisfied that, whatever that may mean, the Government does not intend to derogate from its unlimited power to make &#39;any appointment to the Public Service that it may think fit to take responsibility for. That power has been with every Government, and has been exercised by every Government with a good deal of freedom. Perhaps the provision to which I have referred was framed merely to quieten criticism. Would any honorable member suggest that it means that the Government is bound in its choice by the recommendation of the Board? If so, why is it not provided that appointments shall be made directly by the Board ? Whatever respectful consideration may be given to a recommendation of the Board, the responsibility for an appointment must, in the last resort, rest with the Government. Then, for some recondite reason, it is provided that, notwithstanding anything in the Act, appointments to any position of permanent head may be made by the Governor-General witheut reference to the Board. I think that the polite concession to the Board in sub-clause 1 might be extended to the cases covered by subclause 2, and I hope, therefore, that the Minister will allow sub-clause 2 to be struck out as redundant and unnecessary. </para>

That seems a reasonable provision. But in sub-clause 12 Ministers say, in effect, &#34; We may desire to make a political appointment.&#34; That is a most unfortunate declaration to put into cold type. The Bill is designed to give confidence to the public servants by making them think that merit is to be the reason for promotion, and that political influence is not to be used. Sub-clause 2, however, is a placard saying that where the Ministry sees fit, it will disregard efficiency and merit in the making of appointments. The members of the Board are to be picked men, appointed for a term of years. Ministries, on the other hand, come &#39;and go; and we have already seen many of them. The adoption of my amendment would bring the clause into accord with preceding clauses. I hope that the Minister will agree to postpone this clause. If he does not, I shall press the amendment to a division. </para>

                        <para>- Does the honorable gentleman not think that this provision is playing to some extent into the hands of the &#34; gimlet brigade &#34; ? I can understand an unfortunate civil servant, residing in a terrace, wedged in between two members of the &#34; gimlet brigade,&#34; who would bore  hole3  in the fence to see whether he was intoxicated when he came home at night, or would listen to discover whether he raised his voice with a view to laying a charge against him of using intoxicating liquors to excess. My opinion is that a man&#39;s wife is sufficiently able to judge whether he has been drinking to excess without the woman next door being allowed to do so. It is my intention to move that the words &#34; use of intoxicating liquors or drugs to excess &#34; be left out with a view to inserting the words &#34; is under the influence of intoxicating liquors or drugs when on duty.&#34; Who is responsible for this drag-net provision? Is it not sufficient &#39; that we should exercise control over a man while he  i3  on duty? I am willing to admit that if a public servant, comes to his duty suffering from an excess of drinking that should be a ground of complaint, but even then it might be difficult to decide whether or not he was suffering merely from a bilious attack. Tinder the clause it will be possible for certain persons to persecute a member of the Public Service. . In. the past it lias been found possible to manage the Public Service without such a far-reaching provision. </para>

                        <para>- The gentleman referred to may be doing quite right. 1 have no wish to go into that aspect of the matter. I have no desire to provoke a controversy in this Chamber between honorable members who use intoxicating liquors and those who do not. I object to the power given under this clause to heads of Departments or of sub-Departments to make inquiries into the consumption of liquors by a public servant in his own home. The thing is preposterous. I doubt whether a civilized community would stand it. We know that in the United States of America <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ford,</inline> the builder of motor cars, has laid it down that the men in his establishment shall not consume intoxicating liquors, and he has closed his works because they said that they would do so if they pleased. Is the Minister not aware of the fact that any attempt to impose unreasonable conditions on men must be attended by failure? If this clause is to pass in its present form we might as well make soldiers of the public servants at once, and tell them at what time they shall go home. The next thing the Government will propose is that they shall be followed up in their flirtations after hours. How would honorable members like their neighbors to report them to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> for alleged excessive consumption of intoxicants in their own homes? &#39;Honorable members may laugh. The provisions of this clause are equally laughable, and no more objectionable than would be the behaviour of one of our neighbours if he came running to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline> I appreciate the point that a public servant should keep himself fit to do his duty during his hours of duty. But why should the Government seek to be the guardian of his morals after hours&#34;? This provision is altogether too &#34; WOW.seristical.&#34;-Do the Government propose that the Public Service shall consist exclusively of teetotallers? Who is to be the judge? May an officer be permitted to enjoy one glass of beer a day ? An anti-liquor extremist would say that even that quantity amounted to excessive drinking. I shall test&#34; the </para>

I have never heard of any objection to this specific provision for the protection of the Service against the inefficient work of officers who may be addicted to liquor or drugs. It is true that neither the original section nor this clause confines itself to the oversight of an officer during his hours of -duty. But let us suppose that a man has contracted the nightly habit of excessive drinking. Can he possibly give his country efficient service during the daytime? Honorable members should not forget that in every circumstance officers are protected by the right of appeal. </para>

                        <para>- Why should there be any difference in procedure? The Minister&#39;s justification for this discrimination is not very convincing. It would -be well for him to explain the merits of the Bill, which he professes to understand. It is unfair for the Government to presume upon their authority oven the Public Service to such an extent as to regard themselves as the custodians of a public servant&#39;s conduct during the time when, he is, not actually engaged in the service of the  Commonwealth.  I have in mind a most unfortunate incident in South Australia, the &#39;case of a man who gave very good service in the South Australian Railway Department, but who, six months after the commission of a certain minor civil offence, was dismissed. There should be no discrimination. If an officer of the Public Service commits any breach of the law by reason of his excesses after office hours, there is the law to deal with him, and he may be punished accordingly. But to add to that punishment dismissal from the Service, because of minor misconduct during his private time, is going beyond the authority that should be enjoyed by any employer over their employees. Whilst I am a strong temperance advocate myself, I cannot sanction this proposed intrusion. </para>

                    <para>.- It is quite true, as the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> says, that this question of discrimination is easily disposed of. The two classes of officers are dealt with under different sections. But that does not touch the important principle which the honorable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mathews)</inline> has raised. I say, seriously, to the Minister, and to the Committee, that it is not the business of the Government to become social reformers in connexion with the administration of the Public Service. If it is the business of the Government to follow an officer of the Service to his home and to note his conduct, when there, in regard to the use of intoxicating liquors, it is equally the duty of a Government to observe his moral conduct in every other aspect of his daily life. There is no logical reason why their observations and study of his habits should be limited to the question of whether or not he is the user to excess of alcoholic beverages or drugs. I commend the honorable member for Melbourne Ports for having the courage to move this amendment, and I commend also the honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Makin)</inline> for having supported him, because, if I may say so, their attitude lays them open to such ill-considered and uncharitable remarks as that made by the Honorary Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Granville Ryrie),</inline> who ought to know better, when he said sneeringly, &#34; Let them get drunk as often as they like.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- I know that the Honorary Minister most uncharitably and  unjustly  suggests that the honorable members on this side, by their support of this amendment, want an inefficient Service; that they are champions, or if not cham pions, at least apologists, for intemperance. Now, I associate myself with the honorable member for Melbourne Ports and the honorable member for Hindmarsh in that so far from being an apologist for intemperance, I have, I am afraid with some truth, more than once been called a &#34; Wowser,&#34; and a more deadly thing than that cannot be said against any man representing the division I have had the honour to represent for so many years. Although myself open to the taunt of having practised temperance with wonderful persistence from my earliest youth - possibly it is one of the few virtues to which I have given sustained devotion - I contend with earnestness that we should not invade the rights of members of the Public Service as is proposed in this clause. Why should we inquire how many drinks ( a man may have had during the evening? Does it not follow that if we are to do this, we should also follow a public servant to the racecourse and see how much . of his hard-earned money he places upon some illusive racehorse? Does it not follow that we should have some sort of committee to keep constant supervision over the manners and morals of members of the Public Service? This proposal has only to be stated in that way to expose the absurdity of the provision in this Bill. The duty of members of the Public Service is to do efficient work for the community which employs them. They are expected to perform their work with sobriety, decorum,\and efficiency, and the Attorney-General knows the futility of his argument that a person who drinks to excess out of office hours cannot give satisfactory service to the Department. The answer to that argument is that, if an officer does not give satisfactory service, . there arts other provisions in the Act for dealing with him. We know that there is very great diversity in the quality of work done by servants of the State. Some practise to perfection the gentle art of &#34; going slow,&#34; others are remarkably diligent and attentive to duty. Those differences are to be found amongst members of the Service, as in every other section of the community. But, so far as it is necessary to supervise the conduct of public servants, the Bill contains adequate provision for insuring that their conduct shall be such as to secure to the Commonwealth an adequate return for the salaries  paid to them. I repeat, therefore, that wo&#39; should not seek to be social reformers by allowing the anomalous provision to remain of which complaint has been made. &#34;We stand for a temperate and honorable service, and we have got it. </para>

                        <para>- I presume that there must be objection to it. For the moment I am not concerned with what the Service thinks, but with the question as to whether this principle is sound. It is for Parliament, and not for the Public Service, to decide this issue. The Minister mentioned, amongst numerous platitudes which he uttered with an appearance of sincerity, that this provision has been in the Public Service Act for some years. That is beside the question. This House is not working twelve hours per diem for the purpose of retaining Acts of Parliament in their present form. We are here to make the laws better than we find them, and the fact that this excrescence hae been on the statute-book for many years is no reply to the logical and considered objection made by the honorable member for Melbourne Ports. I hope that the Minister will gracefully agree that this reproach on the public servants shall be removed, and that they shall be placed in the same category as are other members of the community. </para>

                <para>I know of a public servant who, when going to his Government employment some fourteen or fifteen years ago, was assaulted. Being a man, he retaliated, but got the worst of the fight, and was knocked about to some extent. When ho presented himself at work he was suspended on account of his appearance, and only the intervention of friends saved him from punishment. Are we to permit a law to continue which would prevent a man from resenting a blow lest he might present an unbecoming appearance when he arrived at his work? The Minister has argued in defence of paragraph <inline font-style="italic">d</inline> that the same provision is in the present Act. That is so, and the Public Service objects to its re-enactment. I assure the Committee that the council which met to consider the disabilities which the present Act places upon public servants formulated the amendment I have moved. Have these men no right to take into consideration the way -in which they are treated, even though they are public servants? </para>

It is not sufficient to have the old Conservative argument brought up that a provision such as this has been in force in the past.

                    <para>. -  I have always endeavoured to assist the oppressed, and the laws we pass should be liberal, because nobody will obey tyrannical legislation. The proposal embodied in the clause under consideration will insult the Public Service. It really amounts to saying that members of the Service shall, not take alcoholic drink. Many people who claim to be teetotallers adopt that stand because they have- no will of their own, and cannot take liquor without making beasts of themselves. When I was a youngster, I belonged to the Band of Hope, and one of the pledges the members had to take was that they would not handle or taste strong drink, and would not give it to others. I know some honorable members of this House who have taken trips to London to seek the advice of Harley-street specialists, aud in nearly every instance they have been told that a certain quantity of alcoholic liquor would be beneficial to them. They have carefully followed the advice given, and they are all the better for it. The clause under consideration would give the Board of Commissioners a power that it should not be permitted to exercise. There should be no interference with members of the Service after they have finished duty. I admit that I have taken intoxicating liquor. The clause would permit a departmental official to smell an employee&#39;s breath, and he might then be able to report the employee for having taken intoxicating liquor. I have never known any one who could define the condition of intoxication. Some say that a man is intoxicated when he does not know the door of the house in which he lives. Yet we are asked to give an officer of a Department an opportunity to report a subordinate whose breath may indicate that he has. been drinking intoxicating liquor, although it may be essential to his health for him to take a little stimulating drink, or a little stimulant may enable him to render efficient service. We &#39; ought not to deprive any officer of the opportunity of taking a glass of intoxicating liquor simply because a few fanatics cannot touch drink without making beasts of themselves. I have too much confidence in our public servants to insult them by the insertion of this objectionable provision. My particular objection is to the use of the word &#34; use.&#34; It would certainly be right to punish a public officer who has been drinking to such an extent as to cause him to wobble about all over the place interfering with other people, but the Bill provides other means of doing so.. One very serious objection to the subclause is the possibility of injustice that may be done through spiteful and unfounded charges being laid against officers. </para>

                    <para>. -  I protest against the inclusion of a subclause which is unnecessarily offensive to a large body of men. How would honorable members care to have conditions such as these imposed upon their admission to this House? They would regard them as unnecessarily offensive. The fact that the provision has been the law for some time past does not justify its retention. A sober and efficient Service which we all desire to have can easily be secured by the application of the other sub-clauses, which provide that officers must not become incompetent from any cause due to their own actions. Thus inefficiency or incompetency brought about by excessive drinking is quite sufficiently covered without this objectionable sub-clause, which would provide opportunity to mischievous busybodies to declare that an officer of the Public Service was drunk on a certain day on which he was off duty, and so cause the officer to be discharged or severely punished. The honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. West)</inline> has had some hard things to say about men who do not touch drink, among whom I am to be included. My main objection to- the subclause is that it assumes that when a man is paid for his services he is bought body and soul, and that we are entitled to pry into his private life. In agreements relating to the appointments of people to very high positions, where of necessity sobriety is expected and where the holders of the positions are nob expected to sap their brains by unnecessary drinking, no such provision as is contained in this Pill could be found. The Minister would be well advised to leave out this sub-clause, which, while it will get us nowhere, will prove unnecessarily &#39;Offensive, and will afford to busybodies the opportunity- to pry tate) the private lives of public servants. </para>

                    <para>-  What the honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> desires is done  every  day, as the chamber is as thoroughly ventilated and cleansed as is possible with the appliances and in the time at our disposal. After the House rises and before it meets, and also during the meal adjournments, every effort is made to allow the vitiated air to escape. Before passing into the chamber the air which is  drawn  from outside passes through  a  water screen. But there is no doubt the atmosphere of the chamber, especially after a long sitting, and when the galleries are full, becomes very foul. There is also an installation of fans in the roof to draw up the vitiated air. </para>
