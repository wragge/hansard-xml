If so, in view of the danger to farmers in low lying districts if information is not made available in regard to water coming down, so as to enable the stock to be removed in time of flood, and also the danger to shipping om the coast; will the Minister issue instructions that the reports be continued ? </para>

Laffer, South Australian Minister for Repatriation, regarding the closing down of works on War Service Homes in that State, and the refusal of the State Bank to receive further applications owing to the inadequacy of the financial accommodation provided by the Commonwealth Government? If so, will the Government give immediate consideration to the granting of a further instalment of financial help to the bank to enable War Service Homes to be completed and further applications to be dealt with? </para>

                            <para>- My attention has been directed by nearly all the representatives of South Australia to the newspaper statement to which the honorable member refers. The allocation of moneys for the construction of War Service Homes in the States is made, after the annual appropriation by Parliament, on the basis of the number of enlistments for each State. We are working on the assumption that the amount available for the present financial year will be the same as was provided last year. In that case South Australia would be entitled to a sum of, approximately, £336,000. The State Bank of South Australia has already expended a sum in excess of £400,000, and unless the vote for the whole of Australia is increased the War Service Homes Department cannot make any further allocation until the end of the present financial year. </para>

To date I have received no resolution from its promoters. It is true that the Australian Workers Union of Queensland have asked for a renewal of the -sugar agreement. All bodies in Queensland concerned in that agreement, including the Australian Workers Union, waited on me during- my recent visit to Queensland in my capacity of  Chairman  of the Sugar Council, and asked for the extension of it. I refer the honorable member to my reply, as published in the Queensland newspapers. </para>

                        <para>- No definite conclusions have been arrived at in that regard; but inquiries, so far as they have gone, tend to show that the extent to which the Department of the Postmaster-General can place orders with the Small Arms Factory at Lithgow  for  telephone parts is so small that in most cases it would not pay to make the necessary tools with which to carry out the job. However, I am still making inquiries into the matter, because to whatever extent the factory can be used for that or any other purpose we are endeavouring to  so  utilize it. </para>

                            <para>At 30th June, 1922, the number of officers employed in the New South Wales Branch of the Commission totalled 166. The cost of the Branch, including salaries, wages, rent, stationery, and other incidental expenses, for the year 1921-22 equalled £43,356 14s.9d., which was a charge against revenue.

A number of these houses are occupied by applicants under a tenancy agreement pending determination of capital cost and subsequent sale to them. The amount added to the cost of each house to cover architects' fees is 1 per cent. of the estimated capital cost and 11/2 per cent. for supervision fees; total, 21/2 per cent. The amount added in the case of a house costing £800 is, therefore, £20. </para>

                    <para>- I wish to make a personal explanation regarding several matters referred to in the House last week. During the course of my speech on Thursday last, as reported at page 200 in the proof copy of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> I inadvertently mentioned the wrong christian name of a gentleman. I referred to Lionel Bridge ; the name should have been Clarence Bridge. The statement of Clarence Bridge made on 19th April, 1921, commences with the words "Lionel Bridge, my brother," and that led to the christian names becoming confused. I desire this error to be corrected in the permanent copy of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline></para>

It was not the same executive at all, because a number of the members had retired in order to become candidates at the State elections. Under the rules of the party, this course was imperative. The vacant positions upon the executive were thereupon filled by runners-up who had failed to gain a majority vote at the conference; and these new individuals altered the character of the executive altogether.

If it ever be necessary, I shall be able to prove the truth of what I said. Of course, I know that this House is not much concerned with the political squabbles and internal wranglings of the honorable member for Cook and the executive of the organization of which he was  a  member, and I do not desire to drag them under the notice of honorable members. Finally, I challenge the honorable member for Cook to go outside and make  his  statements, where the people whom he has slandered will have an opportunity to defend themselves. </para>

                        <para>.- Two years ago when the motion for the Address in-Reply was under consideration, I took the opportunity to make certain remarks, not only in relation to the Governor-General's Speech, but to the objects of the party to which I belong. I ventured to observe that I had at that early date discovered that it takes this House a very long time to do very little, and pointed out that this little Corner party seemed to be the bone of contention between the other two parties. 1 said that we in the Corner were not lovers of party government, and that we had shown our earnestness in this regard by remaining out of politics for nearly eighteen years of Federation. We wanted sound government. </para>

I regard the statements appearing in His Excellency the Governor-General's Speech as being merely a second edition of the Government's pre-election propaganda. We have in the Speech a reiteration of promises that have been made over and over again. Promise after promise has been made by the Government, but nothing has been accomplished. These  promises are renewed periodically, but are not followed by any progressive action on the part of the Ministry. In paragraph 13 of the Address we have the statement - </para>

Abraham Lincoln said, "You may fool all the people some of the time, and some of the people all the time, but you. cannot fool all the people all the time." I invite honorable members to consider the statements in the above paragraph in the light of the knowledge that we ha,ve a declining production, and that some 30,000 or 40,000 who were on the land have left it during the last decade. The Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> smiles, and seems to think he will be able to refute my statement. He may show that the amount received in respect of the reduced production is greater, but the fact that the area under cultivation has declined is a most material consideration in this connexion. </para>
                    <para>It would not be out of place to carefully examine paragraph 19 in  His  Excellency's Speech. In what way and by whom are these new markets to which reference is made to be opened up? Is there any evidence of a desire on the part of the Government to open up new markets? Owing to action of this Parliament during the last twelve months, revenue to the extent of millions of pounds has been lost to us. In Java and the neighbouring islands there are over 50,000,000 people who are anxious to trade with us and with whom the people of Australia wish to trade. We could very well do with their trade. As a primary producing country, we could supply them with many of the commodities they require, but we cannot enter into trade with them on a reasonable reciprocal basis. We ask them to give us free ports, and yet our ports are closed tight to them. That is the treatment that we have extended, for instance, to the people of Java and Fiji. </para>

It is necessary for us to export more meat in order to bring in fresh capital; but when we ask these people to give us the most favorable trade relations they at once remind us that under our Tariff there is a duty of Ss. 4d. per cental on their bananas entering this country. </para>

                            <para>- Since the honorable gentleman's conscience is laden with such a responsibility, it is no wonder that he expected me to refer to the duty on bananas. Primary production and its encouragement in Australia are of vital importance ; but what is the actual position ? Because of our Tariff, South Africa has set up a reprisal Tariff on our wheat, and the United States of America is ever increasing its Tariff against us. To whom shall we be able shortly to look? To whom shall we be able to go with our produce? We have vast financial obligations, and it is not possible for us to get rid of our enormous national debt unless we have trade relations with other countries on a clear, well-established basis. It is mere " flap-doodle " on the part of the Government to talk about sending Trade Commissioners to other countries to open up trade with people whom we have offended in this way. When our Trade Commissioners seek new business in the East, they will bo reminded that we have closed our doors to their products. When we seek trade with them, we need to have something to offer in return. All sides of the House are agreed that the only immigrants we require are these who are prepared to go on the land and to increase our production. Increased production is the need of the hour, if Australia is to progress. But why is it that the people already in our cities, who are at all conversant with the conditions here, will nob settle on the land? Why is it that we have to bring people 12,000 miles overseas to settle on the lands of Australia? The people in' our cities and towns will not go on the land, and many of those who have done so are forsaking the primary industries. Surely there must be something sadly wanting ! </para>

                            <para>- And I said it was largely due to the policy and tactics of the party to which the honorable member belonged. It would be interesting to examine the reasons why thousands of our citizens will not go on the land, and why so many are forsaking the primary industries. We are sending to the uttermost ends of the earth for land settlers, and only about 3 per cent, of those who come here go on the land. It is of paramount importance that we should determine the responsibility for this state of affairs. Every one recognises that the prosperity of a country depends on its primary production. Why is it, then, that we cannot induce people to go on the land? In the first place, our primary producers find the fight of competition in the world's market is too great for them. They are further removed from the principal markets of the world than any  competing  country, and this Parliament has don® nothing to help them in this direction. In no less than sixty one countries agricultural machinery and the machinery of production are exempt from import duties; but Australia places heavy imposts on the machinery required by those who are producing for world competition. There, again, we have another handicap imposed on the .primary producer. </para>

                            <para>- We are not asking for any such exemption. All that the people on the land ask is that a measure of justice shall be granted them. They ask that they be put on the same basis as other sections of the community . in so far as the income tax is concerned. At present they arc on a different footing. All parties say that primary production is of vital importance, yet the primary producers have to pay more by way of taxation than does any other section of the community in respect of the same amount of income. When the immigrants who are settling on the land discover that the incidence of our taxation is such that they are liable to pay three times more in respect of the same return than. i3 any other section of the community, they will wake up. At present they are1 too much like Pilgrim's man with the muck-rake - they have no time to look into these things. When they do become fully conscious of this treatment they will refuse to be fleeced any longer. If we are to have hundreds of thousands of people streaming into this country to go on the land, we must deal thoroughly with the whole question of taxation, and so make it possible for them to carry on. We must also take into consideration the opening up of new markets in other countries on a reciprocal basis. I fail to find evidence of an attempt on the part of the Government to do anything m that direction. It will be a mere waste of time a-rid money to bring more people here, unless simultaneously with our immigration policy the Murray Waters scheme and the Western  Australian  settlement scheme are proceeded with, and there is a genuine desire on the part of the States and the Federal Governments to provide markets for the produce raised in Australia. With the exception of a few of the items we send abroad there is no stability about the price of certain commodities consumed in Australia. One season we find potatoes quoted at £2 10s. per ton; at another time they are sold at £25 or £30 per ton. One year onions fetch £25 or £30 per ton; next year their price may be as low as £2 10s. per ton. </para>

Honorable members of the Country party have no occasion to make apologies. We are certainly twitted from one side of the House and the other, and the Prime Minister has made use of the long recess to visit the States, not for the purpose of setting forth a statesmanlike policy for the benefit of the people of Australia, but more than anything else for the purpose of endeavouring to damn the Country party, so that he might have a greater following, and so that he might have more of those followers who apologize for following him. </para>

In reply to the Treasurer's interjection, I shall read the reply given by the Commissioner of Taxation to the request of the Taxpayers' Association for information concerning the operation of the averaging system. The Commissioner pointed out that " the scheme does not involve the payment of tax on an average income." Of course it does not. It is a scheme by which payment is based on a rate of income which, without any stretch of imagination, can be shown to possess greater anomalies than existed before the Act was amended. </para>

                            <para>- This seems to be a House in which one can make explanations. The party to which I belong has as a very prominent plank in its platform a true and just averaging of incomes for a period of five years. When this Parliament opened, at the very first opportunity a. member of the Nationalist party sprang to his feet and moved the adjournment of the House for the purpose of considering the averaging system in taxation. Of course, his purpose was to forestall our moving to have our plank adopted by this Parliament. He was one of thos© " as good as a Country party " Nationalists. Naturally. I supported him. I want to secure the passage of legislation suitable to the people, and I care not if a motion comes from, this side or the other side of the chamber so long as what is sought to be enacted is just and proper. Of course, we know that political tactics are introduced into these things, but I shall be pleased to learn that the Government will bring down a just measure of taxation of primary producers. These people cannot be expected to look for less than justice. If we want to get settlers on the land, we must treat them justly, and not throw dust in their eyes, as the Prime Minister does when he claims that it was his party who gave them the averaging system in taxation, concerning which the Federal Taxation Commissioner states that it is not an averaging on incomes. Just before last Christmas I strongly criticised the Government's proposal. I regarded it as a clumsy and worthless amendment, but I voted for it because it was an admission of the averaging principle, and I accepted the Minister's assurance that after the final report of the Taxation Commission had been received an amending Bill would be brought forward to put the system on a proper basis. I had no intention of making such an extensive reference to taxation, but the present system is a deterrent to the settlement of the land. The primary producers axe unduly taxed. If their unjust burdens are not removed, any bait we may throw out to induce' people in other parts of the world to come hero will fail to attract them. I want to see immigration carried out. We have the land and the opportunities for immigrants if we only broaden our aspect, and give them a reasonable opportunity to make good. Then our secondary industries will proceed with greater success. At the present time the Government are endeavouring to help the secondary industries at the expense of the men on the land, spoon-feeding them by heavy protective duties at the expense of primary producers, to whom no protection can be afforded. </para>

                            <para>- I think the honorable member is astute enough to know that the solution of our problem is not to make things costly by increasing wages, but to improve the purchasing power of money. If the Parliament would set to work with that aim in view,' and make it possible for the man on the land to produce enough money for the others to spend, our troubles would be lessened. At the present time money is being spent faster than the man on the land can produce it, and at the same time he is being hampered with direct taxation, Customs duties, railway freights, and middlemen's charges, to such an extent that a situation is being created that is quite untenable, having regard to the fact that Australia's primary products have to compete with those of the outside world. </para>

                            <para>- Lift the burdens as far as possible from the shoulders of those who are producing our real wealth. I have shown that the Parliaments of sixty one other countries have displayed statesmanship .enough to reduce taxation. Let the farmers get as cheaply as possible the implements- they need for  the  production of greater wealth for the benefit of all. The average price which the farmer pays for his requisites is nearly 100 per cent, higher than is paid by his competitors in other countries. When he requires wire netting to keep the rabbits from his crops, which are to enrich the rest of the community as well as himself, he ought not to be called upon to pay at least 300 per cent, more than he paid in pre-war times, simply in order that that article may be fabricated in Melbourne or Sydney. When the dingoes are attacking his sheep and lambs, he does not desire to stay up night and day to protect them, but he cannot afford to buy wire netting. On my own property, forty miles of netting is required, but it is not a sound proposition to pay the price that is asked for it. The duty on manure and sulphur should be removed. And it has been proved that the Navigation Act is a clog on progress. </para>

                            <para>- I am indicting  the  Government, and incidentally the Opposition, who, representing the  majority  of the population centred about the cities of Australia, have voted as dictated by the manufacturers and consumers only. Like the three gentlemen to whom I have already referred,  they  voted for the highest Tariff possible, regardless of appeals from those who represent  the  men on the land, simply because implements and machinery are manufactured near the cities. But as soon as there arises a question regarding the price of sugar to feed the people of Melbourne, those same persons display gross inconsistency. If I ask for a cheap harvester I am told that I am in favour of black labour, but notwithstanding the declaration of a White Australia in connexion with the growing of a primary commodity, these people demand that it be sold to them cheaply because the price of the imported article happens to be low. I, too, want cheap sugar, but I also want cheap machinery, and therefore I am consistent. Those others who increase the price of machinery and yet ask for cheap primary products are inconsistent. Honorable members opposite voted for a high Tariff to be paid by the people outside of Melbourne, but they demand that their metropolitan constituents be supplied with sugar at a low price. </para>

                    <para class="block">Those figures disclose an extremely serious state of affairs. If Australia were u manufacturing country, and the people about the cities were producing things to sell to other countries in return for money which would help to meet our national debt, these secondary industries would be of national benefit; but under the present hot-house treatment they are actually crippling the people on the land, who  alone  are creating new money. It must be manifest to the House that the method adopted in the past has been equivalent to placing the cart before the horse. Give the horse a chance, and the cart will follow in the natural order of things. </para>

                            <para>- I regard it as highly significant. These countries have found it highly advantageous to distribute their populations; their factories have been so decentralized that there is no question of costly haulage to centres of consumption. The whole of their economic systems, indeed, is distinctly to their material advantage. The Australian States, however, are in the reverse position. In New South Wales and Western Australia, particularly, enormous distances have to be traversed in hauling foodstuffs to the consumers. Frequently the producers have the experience of sending their commodities to market and getting nothing for them.. Indeed, we sometimes get less' than nothing; for we are charged freight purely for the honour and privilege of despatching our products to- the points of consumption. Such are the evils of centralization. </para>

                    <para>The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> made a. great mistake, in spending a considerable part of the recess in visiting the various States, when he did not give the people an assurance, of his earnest intention to bring about conditions which would conduce to the true development of Australian industries. It is regrettable that the Prime Minister preferred to occupy more time in criticising the actions and intentions of other people, such as he saw or interpreted them. I would remind honorable members of the wild promises of the Prime Minister before the last general elections. I have in mind particularly the payment of the solders' gratuities. There- was unseemly bidding between the two old political parties concerning which would promise to give the most. The promises of both sides were that the soldiers should have their money, but without much regard to the manner in which it should be given them. The view taken by the Country party was that the Prime Minister should have considered very weightily the whole of the circumstances before making promises of cash payment. The Country party held that the gratuity should be distributed in such a way that the gift would prove of lasting advantage to the soldiers and to the country for whom they had fought. We proposed that they should be made shareholders in a huge national company, having a capital of £30,000,000, and that with that capital they should become the manufacturers and the merchants of the land for which they had fought. Thus, they would have had their gratuity in perpetuity. But the huge sum has been distributed to the soldiers in a manner which can only be described, at best, as thoughtless; and it has become as a handful of sand strewn upon a lawn - pick it up if you can ! The whole history of the gratuity reveals a sad lack of statesmanship on the part of the Prime Minister. As for my personal views upon this matter, I moved an amendment to enable the soldiers to do voluntarily what ought to have been compulsorily done for them, without any consideration of electioneering bidding with wild promises of cash. </para>
                    <para>Another of the electioneering cries heard during the last campaign was that rigid economy should be observed in the interests of the taxpayers. Upon an examination of the financial statements of the Government last year, one is confirmed in the view that there was absolutely no sincerity in such promises. The same must be said following an examination of the advance statement of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> last week, for there are stall no indications of the promised economies. </para>

                            <para>- It would seem that certain honorable members are scared that I am about to move a vote of want of confidence. Another of the promises of the Prime Minister during the last election campaign was in the form of a sop to Labour sympathizers. The Prime Minister makes promises wide enough to take in the world, the flesh, and the devil. The right honorable gentleman desired to cause quite a number of Labour supporters to be deflected from their adherence, and, therefore, he promised them the basic wage. The Prime Minister undertook to appoint a Commission to ascertain what was a reasonable basic wage for a man having a wife and three children. This Commission was subsequently sent forth to investigate. It examined a few of the facts, and then the Prime Minister was informed that if he carried out his promise the basic wage would ruin Australia. Such was the outcome of the Prime Minister's electioneering promise - one which had been given without any consideration at all. The Prime Minister had to admit that he did not know how the recommendation of the Commission could be put into practical effect. A statesman would have known before ho made any such promise; and a statesman would, therefore, never have put the country to the expense of paying for the Commission. However, this business was merely in keeping with the methods of the right honorable gentleman in making promises to the public, and in using the taxpayers of the country to pay for those promises. </para>

                    <para>I warn the people of Australia to beware of the Prime Minister's electioneering promises. One of those launched for the coming campaign has to do with a superannuation for the Public Service. We have in Australia to-day, in the States and Commonwealth combined, a Public Service numbering 248,000, and these officials are receiving in annual salaries £55,000,000. We are going to the bad financially. The balance-sheets of the Federation and of practically all the States are becoming more and more alarming. But an election is due, and the great army of Federal public servants is promised a Superannuation Bill. This latest promise of the Prime Minister is just another sop, and it is being proffered as hastily and with just as little consideration as were the other promises. Before the Public Service is granted a superannuation measure, one desires to be assured that a. fair return is being given for the huge salary bill. Is the Public Service rendering full and proper return? Is it necessary that Australia should be saddled with an annual payment of £55,000,000 ? </para>

                            <para>- I am speaking of State and Commonwealth services  combined.  .Since the Postmaster-General, flit* honorable member for Grey <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton),</inline> has interjected, I desire to pay hi in a compliment. I am moved to do so, not because he has been doing much for my constituency of late. That is not the point. The Government have announced that it is their intention to make a real endeavour to bring the arrears of work associated with the postal services up to date. The House recognises that this is no party matter. 'If we are to develop and produce in competition with other countries we must be able to take full advantage of the time-saving appliances which the ingenuity of. mau has devised; and the expenditure will be wise no matter what the conditions of the exchequer. These time-saving strings of intelligence must be extended to those people in the country who are creating wealth and adding to the peace and comfort of Australia; and the Postmaster-General has my commendation for his action in this regard. It does appear to me, however, that really the Prime Minister is "Hudhesing  " the people of this country. I hope that this session of Parliament will be occupied in giving consideration to those more weighty matters, such as economy, justice in. taxation, the extension of telephonic communication, and the removal of all obstacles in the way of development. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think I am unwisely taking up th-? time of this Chamber in making these remarks. My anxiety is to at once deal with those questions which matter most. I was ashamed when I sat here at the close of last session; and, there being a Christmas feeling in "the House, Bills were brought in by the barrow-load and the clumsiness of work, without thought or consideration of their merits, bestowed on them. I was assured on mere than one occasion - for instance, in regard to the taxation assessment measure - that if there was much opposition the measure would be pitched under the table. I have ventured to speak at length in order to show! that I am prepared, if the Government and the House are prepared, to deal with those measures that will really assist the progress of the country. We have been here now nearly three weeks and have done nothing; and if I have occupied a fair amount of time this afternoon, what I have said will indicate that I, at any rate, mean business; if the Government does not mean business they know what to expect so far as I am con;cerned. I thank honorable members for their patience. </para>

                        <para>. - We have had a long speech from the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse),</inline> and I do not propose at this stage to reply to more than one of his observations; later on I may have occasion to refer more fully to it. I never listen to the lamentations of this modern Jeremiah but I am reminded of a story that was told about an old farmer friend of mine, whom I knew very well. He was noted throughout the countryside in which he lived for the characteristic that no matter what happened he always grumbled. If it rained, it rained too soon or too late, or there was a little teo much or a little too little. Another friend of mine went to see him one day when there was a wonderful season.  His  farm from end to end was an absolute picture of prosperity ; the crops were showing over all the fences, and nothing could be better than the prospect from his verandah. My friend said to him, "Well, what are you grumbling about to-day?" He was, of course, grumbling as usual; and when asked whether anything could be better than his crops, he replied, " Ah ! but just look at what they are taking out of the ground." ' When I hear the honorable member for Swan complaining about the income tax, I cannot help thinking that, probably, if the truth were known, it would be discovered that he is paying in income tax from the products of his land a sum which the average citizen would regard with envy if he could think that he was to receive it as his annual income. And, further, the fact that the honorable gentleman has to pay this income tax is due, and due very largely, to the policy of this Government in supporting the primary producers of the country in obtaining the prices they have obtained, I shall have occasion later on in the course of my remarks to show those gentlemen in the corner, who are never tired of slandering this country, and who have been drawing their political lifeblood by their defamation of the country, that, considered in its broad aspects, there is not one scrap or iota of truth in what they are telling the public. The honorable member condemns the amending Income Tax Assessment Bill which was brought down in order to give effect to the averaging rate in income taxation, and his Leader <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> has gone throughout the length and breadth of Australia claiming credit for that very legislation. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable gentleman has claimed credit for this measure, though the credit does not belong to him, whoever it may belong to. The Government, before the last election, and before the Country party came into being, gave a definite promise, in the policy speech delivered in Bendigo, that, in regard to the anomalies which it waa admitted existed in connexion with direct taxation, in so far as that taxation affected primary producers, they would appoint a. Commission to inquire into these particular questions. No sooner was the Government returned to office than it set to work to form a Commission, and one of the very things in regard to which it was specially asked to report - I think the reference to the Commission was drawn up by the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> - was the averaging of incomes in the case of primary production. For the Leader of the Country party, or anybody else, to claim that he originated this measure, or influenced the decision of the Government in any way, is altogether astray from the facts. One cannot help stating here that opinion amongst primary producers themselves - people whose experience goes back very many years) - is very divided as to the right way to deal with the question of direct taxation as it affects them. The honorable member for Swan says that he believes that the averaging of the income is the best way, but there are many producers who can show just as conclusive figures as he himself has shown that that plan is quite wrong. There are many who believe that the right way is to set profits against losses, and so arrive at a fair and equitable basis; and I may say that that is what I personally believe is the right course. However, the Commission was appointed, and gave the whole question the most exhaustive consideration, and the Government pledged themselves to act on their report. </para>

He intimated that he thought the cattlemen were able to look after themselves - that they had experienced bad times before, and he considered that they had the pluck and the enterprise to stand up against the adverse conditions of to-day without assistance from the Government. </para>

                            <para>- I am going to deal with the honorable member's remedies and to show how utterly worthless they are to meet the existing situation. The honorable member suggested that the cattlemen were in a position to meet the present calamity - because it is a calamity  - without any assistance from the Government. It is quite clear that the people he had in mind were not the small men, but the men with large resources of capital, with long-established cattle businesses, who had been in the trade for many years. Those were the men he had in mind, and I dare say that they can stand up against the losses, colossal although they have been, in many cases. But what about the small man who has only entered the industry within the last year or two? Is he in as good a position to cope with the situation as are the big squatters, who, apparently, were the only people that the honorable member had in mind? What about the small men who are struggling to get a start? Are the Government to stand by and to allow those men to be wiped out? If that is the honorable member's idea of helping the man on the land it is not mine. It is not the view of the Government. We do not think that we should stand by and allow the small man practically to be wiped out so that the big man may reap the benefit. And that is exactly what would happen. If we allowed the small men to be wiped out the big cattlemen, whom the honorable member had in mind, would alone benefit. They would see the small men go to the wall and with a smile would step in and buy their stock for a mere song. That, I presume, is what the honorable member would like to happen. </para>

                            <para>- Let us come to the actual remedies suggested by the honorable member. He proposed first a reduction of taxation, and, secondly, a reduction of expenditure; thirdly, co-operation, and the improvement of the breed of stock. I am going to analyze one by one these three suggested remedies, and will show how far they could affect the existing position. Take the reduction of. expenditure, which the honorable member suggested should be to the tune of £14,000,000. I would ask the honorable member how he proposes to bring about such a reduction. We have to make provision for invalid and old-age pensions, war pensions, payments to the States, and interest on loans. All these are definite commitments from which there is no escape. I do not suppose the honorable member suggests that any. of them should be repudiated. </para>

                            <para>- Then I will consider the matter from that stand-point. Let us look at it, first of all, from the point of view of the Commonwealth. The Defence expenditure, I believe, has been absolutely cut to the bone. I do not think we could reduce it, with safety, to the extent of another penny. But setting aside the expenditure of the Postmaster-General's Department and payments for services rendered, if we were to wipe out the whole of the remaining Departments of the Commonwealth twice over and refrain from spending a sixpence on them, we would not save £14,000,000 per annum, or anything like that amount. </para>

                            <para>- I shall come directly to the suggested reduction of taxation and the extents to which we could assist the cattlemen in that direction. For the time being I merely say that if the cattlemen had to rely upon a reduction of taxation to help them out of the present difficulty, then God pity them. Let us suppose, for the sake of argument, that it was possible by cutting in every direction to save £2,000,000 by way of direct taxation, then such a reduction, on a very liberal' estimate, would help the cattlemen to the extent of only £100,000. I do not think it would be possible - cutting, and slashing here, there, and everywhere - to save more than £2,000,000 per annum by way of taxation. </para>

                            <para>- There ' must be a number of people in a large way of business in all avocations who pay at a very high rate, so the honorable member's argument does not hold water. The saving to the cattlemen worked out, as I have said, at 5 per cent.; and I do not think a reduction of taxation by £2,000,000 per annum, would represent a saving of more than £100,000 to the cattlemen alone. The suggestion made by the honorable member for Moreton that there should be a reduction of expenditure, brings' me to the question of whether we can look in the near future to a reduction of taxation. I agree with the honorable member that we should do our utmost to get the people on the land. I am thoroughly in accord with 'him in that regard. I do not think any man has been more earnest than. I have been in my endeavours, in public life, to assist primary production. Primary production I believe to be one of the great essentials to Australia's prosperity. But what is the position to-day in regard to land settlement? What is the trouble that we fmd in all the closely settled areas? Is not the price of land the chief obstacle in the way of the farmer. Is not the high price of land the greatest handicap under which the farmer labours to-day? </para>

                            <para>- All who know anything about primary production and the view of the small man will admit that the great trouble is the high price of land. If the farmer could only get his land at one-half or one-third of the price at which it is available to-day he would be much better off. The whole trouble in this regard arises from the fact that the area of land available in those parts of Australia where there are facilities for primary production on a small scale is not equal to the demand. Proof of that statement is to be found in the constantly soaring price of land. What is the use of the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse)</inline> telling me that people will not go on the land when I know that if a block of land in any of the privileged parts of Australia, where there is a. large rainfall, is thrown open for selection, there is not one applicant, but often hundreds apply for it. Every honorable member knows that that is true. There are hundreds of applicants for every block of land that is thrown open in any of the privileged parts  of Australia where there is a sufficient rainfall and facilities for getting one's produce to market. It is idle for any one to tell me that the people will not go on the land. People are going in for land settlement. The trouble does not arise from the causes which have been suggested by the honorable member, nor does it arise from lack of suitable areas capable of carrying a closely settled rural population. There is land in abundance in this great country. I could take honorable members to magnificent country, the equal of which I do not believe is to be found in Victoria, but a man could not live on less than about 2,000 acres of it. The reason is that it is far back, and lacks facilities for getting to market the produce which it is so eminently fitted to grow. The difficulty of getting produce to market from such, a district is so great that any one who has attempted farming on a small scale there has found it impossible to carry on. There are in Australia vast areas of such country, and it can be opened up only by the expenditure of money and, in many cases, by the expenditure of much money. If we are going to say that taxation must be reduced - that those who have these facilities to-day, those who have enjoyed all the privileges of the past - are not to help to open up the country, what will happen ? If we are to stop the work of developing this country by building more railways, opening up great irrigation schemes, establishing telephone and telegraph services, and providing all the facilities of roads and bridges and reasonable  means of communication, we might as well give up at once attempts to promote settlement. Notwithstanding the great burdens resting on our people, we must, in the interests of our national progress and national safety, press on with the work of development even if it means that whilst practising economy wherever practicable we cannot in the meantime lighten the load of taxation.

                    <para>In passing, I wish to refer to the question of immigration. I believe that unless we can get immigrants the safety of Australia in the future might be in a very parlous position. I believe we must have immigration side by side with the development of the country by the people who are already in Australia, and that wc must be prepared to press on with a scheme that will put people on the land. The Commonwealth Government have taken up the attitude that the task of putting people who are in Australia, the citizens of this country, on the land is the responsibility of the States, and that it is the work of the Commonwealth to assist the States in regard to works which are necessary to open up the country on which immigrants are to be placed. That is the division of responsibility. The Commonwealth Government believes that it should press on with a scheme of assisted immigration and with a scheme of helping these States who are willing to place immigrants on the land. But it will not advance money to any State unless, firstly it is satisfied that the land is available and suitable, secondly, it approves of the works upon which the States spend the money provided or raised by the Commonwealth, and, thirdly, it is further satisfied that the State's scheme will provide work for the immigrant on the actual land upon which he will have the right to a block after the first year's service. </para>

We hope that in the near future that agreement will be ready for signature by the State, the Commonwealth, and the Imperial Government. The Commonwealth are also in negotiation with Victoria and New South Wales for an extension of the Western Australian scheme, which, I believe, is a perfectly sound one, and likely to produce excellent results. </para>

                    <para>Now I come to the other two points raised by the honorable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wienholt).</inline> We have seen that his hope for large reduced expenditure, if we are to press on with the development of the Commonwealth in an adequate way, cannot be realized. Expenditure may be reduced a little, but not very much. If we are to press on with the work of development, we cannot expect very much reduction of taxation. The honorable member's second proposal was that cooperation should be extended. Long before any of the honorable members of the Country party thought of politics, and particularly of using the primary producers as a means of getting them into Parliament, I was at work among the primary producers helping a scheme of co-operation. No one has been a greater friend of this principle than I have been. I have lived through the experience of what the application of it means to the primary producer. I remember that when I was first interested in co-operation I was getting 1¾d.  per gallon for my milk, and I know how many years it took before we got any real benefit out of the movement. I applaud the honorable member on his conversion to cooperative ideals. It is one of those things in which I thoroughly believe, and which I realize will prove one of the greatest possible aids to the primary producers of this country. But there is a long row to hoe. It will be many days before the honorable member, if he preaches the gospel of co-operation to his cattle friends in Queensland, will be able to get them into line. </para>

It has taken a long time to get dairying people into line in co-operation, and it will take an equally long time to get the cattlemen of Queensland into line. In this instance, it will not .be simply a question of finding £10,000 or £12,000 among seventy or eighty dairymen. It will be a matter of finding millions of pounds to set up cooperative meat works for the purpose of dealing with the exportable beef of this country. What will be the use of purchasing works in Brisbane to help the cattle-owners north of Townsville? </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. It will be necessary to get three works, and .also all the finance which will enable the cattle to be got into those works and sent overseas. It will be a colossal task, and will involve the raising of a vast sum of money. I do not know whether the honorable member is prepared to go up north and preach his gospel to the cattle owners of Queensland, together with the gospel he has preached here in opposition to the payment of the bonus which these very men have asked the Government to give them in their desperate need. </para>

                    <para>Now let me deal with the last and remaining remedy suggested by the honorable member for Wide Bay, that is, to improve the breed of cattle. Here I am at one with the honorable member. I agree that we can still do a great deal to raise the standard of our beef cattle. But I ask the honorable member, who knows something about the matter, how long it will take to produce the necessary sires to have any real material effect upon the improvement of the breed as a whole in this country? One herd, two herds, or three herds, could be dealt with easily; but when it is a matter of applying the improvement to the whole industry, the production of the sires alone would mean a life-time's work, and even when we have the sires, any one who knows anything about cattle-breeding will realize, as I am sure the honorable member must, that the disappointments are almost as many as the good results. It would be a long, long process, and very many years would elapse before any real improvement could be effected. </para>

                            <para>- I agree with the honorable member; but what would be the use of his proposal when dealing with the problem that confronted the Government? It was an immediate problem. It was not one that could be dealt with in the dim and distant future, or one that could be assisted by building up cooperative enterprise or improving the breed of cattle. Those steps would not have benefited the cattlemen of Queensland in the dilemma in which they found themselves, nor would the reduction of taxation have helped them in the very least. There were thousands, tens of thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands, of fat cattle in Queensland for which there was no market. It was impossible to export them. It did not pay to drove them to the ports to ship them to the markets in the southern States. There they were, these fat cattle that could not be shipped, and for which their owners could find no market. What would have been the value of the honorable member's remedy in those circumstances? Would the reduction of taxation of £100,000 have shifted one hoof from the cattle stations? When cattle have been fed and are prime, there is an economic loss to the country if they are not shipped, because when they pass their prime they promptly lose their value. The Government's remedy was to try to give these people all the benefit we could. We called into our councils the cattle-men themselves, the shipping people, those who were in control of the meat works and the men engaged in the works. We said that if they would all agree among themselves, the ship-owners to give a reduction of £d. per lb., the managers qf the meat works to cut down their charges by Jd. per lb., and the employees to cut down their wages by Jd. per lb., the Government would give a subsidy of Jd. per lb., and thus make the advantage to tha cattle-owners Id. per lb. The immediate result was that the meat works started operations again. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> tells me that the bulk of them actually commenced, work. I am sorry to say that as a result of the season in Queensland failing to some extent, the number of cattle treated will not be as many as we anticipated. Nevertheless, the action taken by the Government has given very material relief to men who were in a desperate position. They are very grateful for what the Government have done. But the benefit is not confined to them. As the honorable member knows well, the fact that, these fat cattle could not be sold had a depressing effect on the whole market, upon the price of weaners, stores, cows, and breeders - right down the line; but when the Government got this " top hamper " moving off, the result was an immediate improvement in the market all round. Therefore, it was not merely a question of the Government giving a subsidy of £200,000 that meant a benefit of £800,000 to the cattlemen of Queensland. All the other cattle-owners iri Australia benefited to some extent. </para>

                    <para>I propose to deal further with the speech delivered by the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse),</inline> and with some remarks made by the honorable, member for Robertson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fleming).</inline> They were typical of the speeches which have been delivered all over Australia by,' I think, every honorable member of the Country party, with the exception probably of the honorable members for </para>
                    <para class="block">Maranoa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hunter),</inline> Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wienholt),</inline> and New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hay).</inline> From most of the other honorable members of the Country party, including the Leader <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page),</inline> we have heard a continuous wail about the parlous condition of the primary industries of this country. It has been said, not once, but many times, by the honorable member for Cowper, his  Deputy  Leader <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fleming),</inline> and the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse),</inline> that primary production is decreasing, that people! are going off the land, and that everything affecting the interests of 'the primary producers is in as bad a state as it can be. The Leader of the Country party said the other day that the net result of the advent of the present Government to office was a decrease of 11 per cent, in the total primary production of this country. I shall deal by-and-by with those figures, and quote others which, I think, will show that the honorable member has never given to this question one minute's consideration, and that he does not care " tuppence" about the primary, producer, except as a stick with which to flog the Government. He does not know anything about the condition of the primary industries, if one may judge by nine-tenths of the speeches that he delivers. Honorable members in the corner are never tired of saying that they desire people to go upon the land. One gentleman who listened to the Leader of the Country party and his  Deputy  in Adelaide recently told me something of the tenor of their speeches. There they were, he said, praying for people to go upon the land, and, at the same time, painting a. picture of the condition of the man upon the land which would frighten any individual from ever aspiring to a rural existence. That is what those honorable members have been doing, from one end of Australia to the other. I would not so much, mind such tactics if the picture they drew were true, but, as I shall show directly, it is the very opposite to a true representation of the condition of primary production in this country. </para>

The honorable member for Robertson seemed the other day to exhibit almost a fiendish joy at the fact that the great steel industry at Newcastle was not progressing. We all know what are the causes of the temporary eclipse - I believe it is purely temporary - of that industry at the present time. But I say with all earnestness that unless it does prosper in the near future God help this country if it is ever called upon to defend itself. </para>

                            <para>- That comparison as a.n argument will hold no more water than does a sieve. We are all aware that the drift of population to the metropolitan areas is a world-wide' problem, and that its causes are mainly economic. One of the chief factors which has led to the establishment of great cities, the drift of population thither, and the abandonment of many country centres cf industry, has been the fact that the .economic condi-tions under which industry is carried on to-day make it absolutely necessary to have massed production. The old-fashioned order by which -a local manufacturer worked a small plant with a few workmen has passed. We must to-day go in for mass production, and that leads to the accumulation of people about the cities. In addition, Australia has. peculiar topographical features which, of themselves, do&gt; very much to cause the drift of population towards the coastline. That is one factor that we cannot overcome. -Bit I join issue with honorable members in the "corner when they talk about the deserted homesteads of this country. </para>

                            <para>- I do not. But where do we find the people who have deserted those homesteads'? Living in the city upon the losses they made upon the land - I suppose they still own the land which they have deserted. Between Toorak and Brighton I could point to scores and hundreds of homes belonging to people who derive practically all their income from the land. There is not an honorable member who does not know that one of the causes of the increase' of population in the cities during the last few years has been the fact that to a large extent the old squatting life has passed away, and those people who used to live upon their homesteads, with their families- about them, are to-day to be found in every fashionable suburb of the great cities to which the honorable member referred. </para>

                            <para>- It is one of the causes, and honorable members themselves are not  free from blame in that respect. A little while ago we heard the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse)</inline> bewailing the terrible conditions of the man upon the laud. Why is it that his home is in one of the fashionable suburbs of Perth? And why do we find the mansion home of the honorable member for Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett)</inline> in Toorak? I could mention similar facts regarding other honor-  able members. No sooner did the Leader of the Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> enter this Parliament than his name-plate was placed with those of many other doctors in Macquarie-street, Sydney. Honorable members talk about the drift to the cities, but they know that these things of which I am speaking are perfectly true. When they compare the  rural population to-day with that of a few years ago, and when they talk about the decline of agriculture, I suggest to them that they should analyze the figures, and try to arrive at the real causes. I wonder if they have ever given any attention to mining? </para>

                            <para>- Then the honorable member knows something about the matter. This is what the Commonwealth Statistician tells me about mining and the people engaged in that rural industry. It is a rural industry; the shafts and poppet-heads of the great mines are not to be found about the cities, but are scattered throughout the length and breadth of the Commonwealth. - The Commonwealth Statistician, informs me that during the decade from the financial year 1910-11 to 1920-21, which provides the latest figures available, there has been a reduction in the number of workers in gold mining amounting to 32,S12. In silver mining during the same period there has been a diminution of 7,077 workers; in copper, of 6,164; and in tin, of 1,816, employees. The full particulars having to do with minerals are set forth in the following table : - </para>

                            <para>- I have not got these. I am dealing with the widely scattered metalliferous mining undertakings throughout Australia. Now, looking upon those 47,869 workers as having families each numbering three - which is a conservative estimate - and taking into consideration also those who minister to the needs of those miners' families, together with their own families, estimated to number, in all, 67,000, one arrives at a total diminution of 258,476 persons, or 5 per cent, of the population of Australia. What would have been the position if mining had held its own, or, indeed, if there had been an increase in the number of workers engaged? What would have been the balance compared with those engaged in rural industries? </para>

                            <para>- I have already emphasized that the Commonwealth Statistician has supplied me direct with the very latest particulars available. It is the matter of values, after all, which counts in the final consideration. If there had been an increase of production equalling 50 per cent. - as there has been in respect of some classes of produce - and there had. been at the same time a decrease in value, obviously primary producers  would be worse off rather than in a better position. But the actual story is entirely different. In 1910-11 the total value of the- dairy produce throughout Australia was £10,615,268. </para>

                            <para>- Precious little. In 1920-21  -  as the tables show - producers received a total return of £36,973,670- an increase in actual value equivalent to 257 per cent. If the position of the man on the land to-day is altogether calamitous - as one might be led to believe - what must have been the position of primary producers in 1910-11? Honorable members of the Country party say there are fewer primary producers on the soil to-day. I do not admit that.

                    <para class="block">It is when one deals with the aggregate covering those various lines ot agricultural production that the wonder-ful progress of Australia during the decade under review is revealed. It took Australia all the years from her first occupation to- reach the figures of 1910-11, and in the decade covered by that table there has been the greatest permanent development the country has ever seen. Let those honorable gentlemen who tell us that the country is " going to the dogs,"' and men are being driven off the land, meet those figures if they can. They are so obsessed with the idea that this Government is damning the man. on the land that they do not care how they defame this country;, and, in face of the facts, it is nothing short of criminal to send overseas the statements they do. If they had the slightest patriotism - if they had the slightest desire to see- Australia prosper and to see immigrants coming here - they would tell the true tale instead of spreading this wretched, scandalous libel broadcast over the world. </para>
                    <para class="block">The true facts and figures are sufficient to bring immigrants flocking to our shores. Now let us leave the matter of acreage and deal with values. </para>

                            <para>- I have not. The figures as to values only show how little the honorable members in the corner really understand what they are talking about. This increase in values lias been in progress whilst this Government has been, in office, and it is very largely owing to the policy of the Government which, with- the credit of the whole State, has backed' up the big co-operative movements. This is the reason why the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse)</inline> has to pay so much income tax; it is because the Government have stood' behind the primary producers' with the whole credit of the State- that we have had this wonderful' time- such as we had never known in our history. In the de-  cade under review the primary producers' receipts showed an increase of approximately 225 per cent. I cannot help wondering why those gentlemen in the corner do not tell these facts to the farmers, for, after all, they only represent the truth. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; but the final development to which we are stretching forward - the real progress and prosperity of Australia - must depend upon the advance and prosperity of its yeomanry. It is the small man, the farmer, the dairyman, the small grazier, the fruit-grower, and their kind, upon whom ultimately Australia must rest for her great production from primary industry, and it is only by the encouragement of, not the large, but the small man, that we can secure that close rural population which Australia requires and desires. As long as there are great pastoral areas, as long as land fit for agriculture is held in pastoral areas, and the facilities for opening up such country and putting small men upon it are withheld, we can never have a big rural population . It is by means only of the industries to which I have been referring that we can hope to secure that result. </para>

That was the total reward which this great body of primary producers received in that year. Pot the year 1920-21, however, their total reward was no- less than £145,349,829, showing an increase of £99,817,176, or approximately 225 per cent., in the actual reward which the primary producers over that great field of production secured. </para>

                    <para>I am not going to say that the life of the man on the land is an easy one. It is a hard one. Unless a man has a natural bent for life on the land he had better not go in for it. Unless he delights in improving natural conditions and conquering them, unless he has the peculiar characteristics, which, <inline font-style="italic">prima</inline><inline font-style="italic">facie,</inline> fit him for the laud, he had much better leave the land alone. I say, however, with all confidence, that the man who goes on the land  to-day  provided that he has the facilities for getting his products to market, and provided also that he knows how to use the land, and is prepared to work hard, can make a. competence, aye, and more than a competence, in this great country of ours. I do not believe that the picture which honorable members of the Country party have drawn is a true one. If it were, I would despair of the future of Australia. I know, however, that the picture which these honorable members draw - the picture of a land of drought, and flood, and fire, and dingoes, and other pests, is an entirely false one, and is doing incalculable harm to this country. That is why I have taken the trouble this afternoon to tell this story to the House and the country, believing that the telling of it will be to the benefit qf Australia. </para>

                        <para>.- Every honorable member should be grateful to the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> for his able account of many matters adversely criticised in this House. I think that our friends of the Country party are sometimes carried away by their desire to criticise the Ministry. When I sat in the State House in Queensland, 1. took up for a long while the position of being a Country party member within the ranks of the Liberal party, and I am perfectly satisfied that those associated with are in that Parliament were able to do a great deal to assist in the development of the large areas of land in Queensland suitable for settlement. There is now a Country party in that State, and I agree with most of their aims, but they are merely following the footsteps of those with whom I was associated in the Liberal party in the State House, with this exception, perhaps, that they are sectional in their attitude. I do not find fault with them on broad lines, because they are no doubt endeavouring to do their best to assist in the development of their State, which contains as much as 421,000,000 acres of land. Our friends in the corner say that no arrangement has been made to assist the primary producers, of whom they claim to be the representatives; but no one in this House has ever attacked the primary productions of Queensland as the so-called primary producers' representatives have done on occasions. </para>

                            <para>- No one has been a more bitter opponent in this House of the sugar industry 'than has the honorable member for Franklin, as reference to <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> will prove. In regard to the question of growing produce by white, instead of black, labour, those of us who advocated the interests of the white growers of bananas in Queensland and New South Wales were opposed by some of our friends of the primary producers or of the Country party, several of whom also opposed the white production of maize, while others voted against the attempt to give protection to another primary production of Queensland, namely, timber. I cannot understand honorable members professing to be representatives of the primary producers' interests voting against them when the producers concerned were not resident in their own States. Even if honorable members are in disagreement with me, I could give them credit for sincerity if they were only consistent, but I certainly cannot congratulate the members of the Country party in this House upon having displayed much sincerity in the past for the primary producers of the Commonwealth and their interests. </para>

                    <para>Very few men would have undertaken the arduous trip the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> has recently had at the request of the representatives of the primary producers of Queensland in this House that he should see the great sugar industry for himself. We asked him for no pledges. We simply asked him to lay before his Cabinet what he saw and heard and then come down to this House with his policy. Our attitude was quite fair and only in accordance with the fairness the producers of the northern States have always shown. When Federation was first inaugurated they received pledges from all sections of the Commonwealth Parliament to the effect that if they would do away with coloured labour and adopt the White Australia policy they would be safeguarded to the extent of the difference between the cost of sugar produced' all over the world by black labour and the extra cost of production by white labour in Australia. We are the only people in the world who are producing cane sugar by white labour. But what sympathy have we had ? The honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mcwilliams),</inline> who was formerly leader of the so-called Producers party, was the bitterest opponent of sugar-growing in Quensland. He wanted the Government to respect the agreement to give Tasmania about £90,000 per annum; but he was opposed to the fulfilment of the agreement to impose protective duties sufficient to enable the sugar-growers of Queensland to carry on their industry. </para>

                            <para>- Not the man who has to carry out duties imposed upon him, and has no say in regard to them. The responsibility rests upon the whole of this Parliament, which authorized the expenditure the Treasurer has had to incur through the various Departments. He was handed his Budget after it had been in existence for months, and had to carry it out in accordance with what had been arranged by his predecessor <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook).</inline> No one seems to give him credit for the work he has done, nor can any one say that the extra unanticipated expenditure of at least £1,166,950, which I shall itemize, could have been interfered with in the slightest degree. There was, for instance, the expenditure of £32,500 upon the settlement of the South African claim for 1 flour. This was an unavoidable payment that had not been put forward when the Budget was delivered. The item of £14,500, Australia's contribution to the cost of the League of Nations, was a liability no one knew about when the Budget was prepared. A sum of £5,500 represents the excess cost of the Taxation Commission, which was authorized by this House. Do honorable members criticise the payment of the £8,500 which represented the expenses of the delegation to Washington? Can they say that this expenditure should not have been undertaken? Belated payments to New" South Wales for distress occasioned by the maritime strike accounted for £4,450, which the Treasurer .could not refuse to honour. Nor could he do otherwise than spend the £49,000 authorized by this Parliament to relieve distress in "Europe. A sum of £12,000 was spent in the maintenance of persons in charitable - institutions. Do honorable members claim that we have no right to meet that obligation? There was a clamour for more and more assistance to the needy, and yet the Treasurer has been adversely criticised for carrying out an obligation of that kind. Neither could he avoid paying the £26,000 increased cost of coinage. A sum of £96,000 was paid for the investigation and purchase of the British Government's interests in the New Guinea oil explorations. The House authorized that expenditure, and it had to be met. There were items, however, which did not appear on the Estimates as passed by -the House, but were nevertheless obligations the Treasurer had to meet. For instance, the increased cost of the Health Department was £35,500; but honorable members are aware that in the latter part of the financial year, when bubonic plague was prevalent, very stringent precautions had to be taken to keep it out of Victoria. Does the Victorian press complain of that particular expenditure? Again, the anticipated expenditure on the payment of invalid and old-age pensions and the maternity allowance was exceeded by £100,000. This was another obligation that had to be met. Is the Treasurer to be held responsible because he fulfilled it ? The next item on my list is a sum of £25,000, which was advanced to returned soldiers for their woollen mills at Geelong. That was a matter authorized by Parliament at the tail end of last session, and the money had to be found by the Treasurer. Another increase in expenditure that had to be met was £378,000 for war pensions. The last item on my list is a sum of £380.000, representing the extra cost of the administration of the Post and Telegraph Department. We have long agitated to secure a better set of conditions for the people outback, so that we may offer greater inducements to the immigrants whom we hope to bring from the Mother Country. The greatest encouragement we can give to immigration will be to make it possible for those who settle in the back-blocks to enjoy something like reasonable comfort and opportunities foi- intercourse with their fellows. The items I have mentioned total £1,166,950. I like to give credit where credit is due, and I resent the attitude of the Victorian press and some members who ought to- know better than to slander a man on account .of a state of affairs for which he cannot rightly be held responsible. </para>

                    <para>In regard to the injustice of which I am about to speak, I do not hold the present Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> responsible, because the Tariff was disposed of before he took control of the Trade and Customs Department. On my arrival in Melbourne from Queensland, I discovered to my surprise that black-grown maize was being imported from South Africa at the low duty of ls. per cental. On 19th May, 1921, when the Tariff was before us, I proposed <inline font-style="italic">(Ronsard,</inline> page 8547) that the duty on maize should be, British preferential, 3s. ; and intermediate and general, 3s. 6d. ; or about 9d. per cental more than was proposed by the Minister, and I explained that my reason for proposing the increase was the large production of maize in South Africa and India by black labour, and that South Africa was receiving most favorable preferential treatment. The then Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> informed the Committee that when the Tariff was passed the preference would be withdrawn. We therefore imposed a high protective' duty on the by-products of maize, in the belief that, through the protection of maize, the Australian grower would secure the local market. For instance, we imposed a duty of £12 per ton on glucose, but this duty has proved to be not for the benefit of the white Australian grower, but for the benefit of people in South Africa who produce maize by black labour. The then Minister said (Hansard, page 8551) that the duty he proposed was 100 per cent. higher than that on the product of South Africa, from which country the greater part of the imported maize came. The duty on maize in the South African preferential Tariff was ls. per cental; but the Tariff schedule proposed that the duty should be 2s., and there the Government proposed to leave it. In answer to my question as to whether that would mean that South Africa would have to pay the same protective duty as any other country in the world the Minister answered " Yes." On 8th July, 1921 (Hansard, page 9875), the Minister and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Cook were ordered to prepare and bring in a Bill to carry out the resolutions of the Committee. The Tariff Bill was at once introduced and passed through all stages. When it was before the Senate, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> moved on 4th August, 1921 (Hansard <inline font-style="italic">,</inline> page 10755), that the House of Representatives be requested to make the duties on maize, intermediate, 2s. 6d. : and general, 3s. Gd., per cental. That proposal was somewhat on the lines of the amendment which I had submitted in this House. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> pointed out that the annual production of maize in Australia averaged between 8,000,000 and 9,000,000 bushels, and that grown by black labour in India was about 80,000,000 bushels, and that in South Africa 34,000,000 bushels. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell,</inline> who was in charge of the Tariff at that time, said that the real trouble of the maize -growers was caused by the reciprocal Tariff arrangements with South Africa under which maize could be imported at ls. per cental; that maize was grown by black labour. " We are not going to repeat our mistake," he said. " Under the present Tariff all imported maize will have to pay 2s. per cental." The Senate agreed to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie's</inline> request that the intermediate duty should be 2s. 6d., and the general duty 3s. 6d. When the Senate's requests were before this Chamber, the then Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> moved, on 13th October, that the Senate's requested amendment be made. That motion was agreed to (Hansard, page 11969). Thus both Houses had agreed to impose the duty proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline></para>
                    <para class="block">Guthrie. On pages11939-11940 the Minister for Trade and Customs moved that the request of the Senate for the repeal of the South African Preference Tariff be agreed to, and said that the reciprocal Tariff with South Africa would terminate with the assent to the Tariff Bill. The Senate's requested amendment was made, and on 8th December, at page 14166 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> reported the receipt of a message from the Governor-General assenting to the Tariff Bill. When the Minister moved that the Senate's requested amendment be agreed to he did not explain to the House, nor was an explanation given in the Senate when the Bill was before that Chamber, that the effect would be to enable South African maize to reach Australia at less than the Tariff rate of 3s. 6d. per cental. The subsequent discovery that maize could be imported at ls. per cental was a great surprise to me. I think this explanation is due to myself, for there are in my electorate probably tens of thousands of acres which are producing maize, and in the course of my travels I have explained to the maize-growers what Parliament had done to protect them against the black-grown maize of other countries. I have not been able to learn of any honorable member in this Chamber or the Senate outside the Cabinet who understood that at the eleventh hour of the session this Parliament enacted legislation that repealed what we had decided, in connexion with the Tariff. I ask that this matter be taken into very serious consideration by the present Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers).</inline> I am sure that had it been known that the duties we imposed upon glucose, cornflour, starch, and other by-products of maize would be enjoyed by the producers of black-grown maize in other parts of the world instead of by our own growers, we would never have agreed to them; and had we known that the Reciprocity Bill would have had that effect we would have insisted upon a further consideration of the items affected. The South African Department of Agriculture in Pretoria estimates the maize crop for the year at 12,000,000 bags, and that there will be a surplus of 2,250,000 available for export. Already some of that maize has been imported into Victoria, and I understand that shipments are on their way to Queensland and New South Wales, notwithstanding that most people believe  that the protective duty of 3s. 6d. per cental passed by this House still applies. The local producer of maize has no protection in regard to freights. The freight on shipments now coming from Durban t0 Australia is 22s. 6d. per ton weight, whilst from the port of Maryborough, Queensland, which is only about 190 miles north of Brisbane, to Melbourne it is 40s. per ton on minimum shipments of 1,000 tons. I ask that some alteration in the law be made so that justice may be done to the white maize-growers in Australia. I introduced a deputation to the Minister last week, and it was supported by the honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wise),</inline> the honorable member for Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mackay),</inline> the honorable member for Herbert <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bamford),</inline> the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs),</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Murphy,</inline> of Gippsland. The Minister promised to bring the matter under notice of Cabinet, and for that reason I refrained from speaking of it in the House earlier. I suggest that the Minister should take such steps as will carry out the intention of Parliament when it enacted the Tariff. </para>
                    <para>With  respect  to War Service Homes, some arrangements should be made by which returned men could be provided with homes of their own without such delay as is general in every State. I recently gave the responsible Minister particulars of a certain case which had come under my notice in Queensland. The ex-soldier concerned had a property under offer for £280. He owned an acre block in the town, where he was permanently employed in a, butter factory, and he was prepared to hand over his gratuity bond, valued at £80, together with £20 in cash, and to remove the house to his own allotment. There would remain a liability of only £180, which he would be required to find, and he desired the Department to advance to him. However, he was through me informed by the  Chairman  of the War Service Adjustment Board, Brisbane, that he was not likely to get any advance until some time in 1923. To provide a new home for that returned soldier would cost the country between £800 and £900; he cannot get any satisfaction in respect of his proposition involving a departmental advance of only £180. </para>
                    <para>Another matter upon which I desire to touch has to do with the necessity for encouraging cotton production in Australia. </para>
                    <para class="block">Last year there were 12,000 acres under cotton in Queensland ; by the end of the present year the area will be, I understand, about 40,000 acres. Hundreds of thousands of acres could easily be planted in Queensland alone. There are, in fact, millions of acres of the right kind of land available. During the American Civil War cotton was produced in Queensland, and a number of shipments were sent away consisting of tallow for ballast and cotton as cargo. The cotton was pronounced to be as good as any sample produced in any part of the world. After the Civil War, however, cheap coloured labour in America killed the Australian industry but it was proved that the land was there, and that a good quality of cotton could be grown in Australia. We still have the land, and cotton every bit as good can still be grown on it. Labour costs have provided the sole hindrance, but to-day the position has changed. The American labour situation is vastly different. The cost of picking cotton in the United States of America is as. high as in Queensland. Many of the negroes are now in a position to own their own blocks, and they insist on being paid white men's wages, or they will work their own land. Here is Australia's opportunity. The cotton plant grows with wonderful rapidity. Less than twelve months ago I planted a cotton seed in my own vegetable garden. In ten months I had a bush, 4 feet high and 3 feet in breadth, covered with cotton of the best quality. There had not been the slightest cultivation of the soil in which it grew. Indeed, rich soil, such as is needed for the production of sugar cane, or maize, or the like, is not required. The most suitable soil is what is known in Queensland as forest land, and there are millions of acres of it nea* to the ports, available for the  purpose.  When I was in the State Parliament, eleven or twelve years ago, I inquired how much land there was in Queensland that had not been utilized, and from which the Government got no return. I was officially informed that there were 137,000,000 acres. The reason for such a state of affairs was chiefly lack of railway communication. There will be no difficulty in making available all the land that is likely to be wanted for cotton growing, and at a very reasonable price. It is an important fact, in the light of the possibilities of  cotton growth in Australia, that a heavy rainfall is not required. </para>
                    <para>The Prime Minister has been criticised for not having assisted the North Burnett land scheme. The reason assigned for the deadlock has been that a Labour Government is in control in Queensland. I  have  known Queensland intimately  from  my youth. I am in a position to give the reason why nothing has been done with the North Burnett land. There has been a deadlock because there have been three rival railway projects. On the one hand it has been proposed to extend the railway over mountainous country. The cost of the line would be about£1, 000,000, and it would involve two years in building. Meanwhile, there would bc no settlement on the land to be served. On the other hand, for an expenditure of £750,000 to £1,000,000, a direct line could be laid through good agricultural country where there would be no mountains to impose engineering difficulties and unwarranted costs. The whole question is whether  a  line shall be constructed for political purposes, or in the best interests of the people and the State as a whole. </para>
                    <para>I regret that some honorable members have been advocating a reduction in the rates of letter postage. The question of cheaper postage came before the Conference of Chambers of Commerce some months ago, in Hobart; but such strenuous objections were raised that the proposal was dropped. What Australia wants is not cheaper postage, which would be of greatest value to people of the city. City residents are already well catered for in respect of every service administered by the Postmaster-General's Department. What is more urgently required is the extension of facilities throughout the country. It is all very well for honorable members of the Country Party to say that people are leaving the land. That is not so. </para>

It is results that tell, and I can only say that since assistance has been given to the primary producers the total value of produce sold under Federal control has been £484,000,000, of which butter and cheese alone, from 1917 to 30th March, 1921, in shipments to the Imperial Government, represent £19,763,987. In my own electorate, which is larger than the whole of little Tasmania, the co-operative companies have proved most successful. The original parent company has been extended, and there are now about five cheese factories. I may say that I have devoted both money and time to the promotion and support of these co-operative enterprises, and still hold shares in them. There are many hundreds of second and third sons of Victorian farmers there doing splendidly in the production of maize and other cereals, also in dairying. There is no doubt that the Commonwealth Government saved Australia from bankruptcy, securing, as it did, an average of 5s. per bushel for wheat as against the pre-war price of 3s. 9d. </para>

                            <para>- It is on record. As to wool, the report of the Commission says that the price received was  about  55 per cent. higher than that obtained before the war. Somebody must be credited with this, and it may be supposed that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> while at Home, and in Australia with his Cabinet, arranged the terms  on  which wheat and wool were sold overseas, and the whole business carried on without any fear of bankruptcy or  any  necessity for the producers to realize on their properties. I was very sorry, indeed, to hear the objection raised by the honorable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wienholt)</inline> to the arrangement made with the cattle-growers, for a bounty of1/4d. per lb. on meat to be exported, who certainly regard it as a  great blessing. Of course, to nien with, small holdings the price of cattle to-day means life or death. The men in affluent circumstances who sold largely before the drop in prices came are in a different position; there is a chance for them to buy from those to whom they originally sold. Personally, I 3peak for the small cattle-owner, who approves of anything that will give him a chance of getting his fat stock off his small run so that the ground may be ready for the calves. To retain such men on the land is to retain an asset which otherwise might be destroyed. I tell the honorable member for Moreton that cattle will keep fat only for a certain time, and will certainly lose their fat in &gt;the winter, when the cost of fattening becomes an asset lost. If, however, a man can realize when the cattle are fat, room is left for the calves to follow. x </para>

                    <para>I notice that the subject of wireless communication is mentioned in the Governor-General's Speech. Criticism has been levelled at the Government for having entered into an agreement authorized by this House, providing that the Royal Commission reported in favour of it. Apparently, there are honorable members who regard the business  investor  in this enterprise as fools, but I have a list of the shareholders which discloses that amongst them are the smartest business men in Australia. If it is good for such men to hold shares in this company, it is certainly good for the Commonwealth Government to have control, and in the conduct of the business the Government have a majority of one as a casting vote. Many people consider that the Government, should appoint some one out of the Public Service to manage this business, holding that otherwise we have no control; but it would be foolish for the Federal Government to attempt to do such a thing. We must have the best brains in this scheme if it is to succeed, and men for a business of this kind are not to be found in the Public Service, so that the Government had to go outside. </para>

                    <para>Some honorable members, principally, I believe, from our friends of the Corner party, contend that no good has resulted from the protection given our secondary industries. However, we have only to look at a return issued by the Director of the Bureau of Commerce and Industry, Melbourne, where it is pointed out that the number of industrial companies registered in 1920 was no less than 2,082. The nominal capital of the new companies was £148,270,614, and the increase of the nominal capital of existing companies, £36,937,302, the total nominal capital registered being £185,207,917. These secondary industries must mean employment for large numbers of -people, who have to buy the products of the primary producers. How could these people be replaced ? If there were any trouble overseas, where would our market be? It is no use shutting our eyes to the facts. We are told that people must be settled in this country, which could easily support 200,000,000. Australia is larger than the United States, and, considering the area from the north of Queensland to the south of Tasmania, is capable of a greater variety of products. There is .no doubt that we shall not be allowed to hold this territory if we do not populate it. Where is the justice of 5,000,000 ' people monopolizing a country when there are other countries which cannot find room for their surplus populations ? Since I was president of the Federal League in 1S99, no man has been a stronger advocate of a White Australia ; and from that time I have faithfully done all within my power to support the policy. I see no reason to depart from it; but it certainly is the duty of the Government to see that our products are protected against the products of the coloured races of the world. </para>
                    <para>There i.s just one other matter about which I should like to say a few words. As to the sugar industry, I shall probably deal with, that at length when the question of the renewal of the agreement is before U3. In the report of the Royal Commission on the  Sugar  Industry -which was published in 1950, it is set out thai; the  capital value  of improved cane farms at that time was £5,541,4S6-; that the value of raw 'sugar -mills in Queensland "was £4,500,060 ; and that 14,500 persons were' employed in cultivating sugar cane. There are at least 100,000 people directly and indirectly interested in the sugar industry in the northern State, and at least 4,000 of those engaged in cane-cutting come from States south of Queensland. From time to time we hear statements to the effect that either the Federal Government or the Colonial Sugar Refining Company are making huge profits as a result of the sugar agreement. I would remind the House, however, that that agreement was  made  between the Queensland Government, the cane-grower, the crude cane sugar manufacturers, and the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. All parties met, and in entering into the agreement saw to it that no one section should receive an advantage over the others. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company was called upon to lay all its cards on the table, and it agreed to undertake the manufacture, refining, storage, and handling of the sugar, together with all the risks of sales, at absolutely cost price. It was agreed, further, that the company should allow the Auditor-General's officers to examine its books whenever they pleased, in order to ascertain what the actual cost price was, and that it should receive fi per ton over and above the actual cost price for refining, selling, guaranteeing, financing, insuring, delivering, and taking all risks in connexion with the scheme. </para>

                            <para>- It was agreed that the company should receive fi in excess of its actual out-of-pocket expenses. The company secures no other return. If I  were  to consider my own interests and those of other merchants I should say, " Put an end to any interference with the ordinary course of trade and lot us return to what we were doing in respect of the sale of sugar before the Government stepped in." In the interests of the consumers and producers alike I hold, however, that the present system should be continued. Under the old arrangement we had perhaps twenty or twenty-five firms - my own amongst the number - selling sugar to South Australia, Tasmania, and elsewhere and charging 5 per cent, on sales and guarantees. It would be impossible to get any firm to do this for less at the present time. I invite honorable members to seriously consider whether it would be better for us to .pay 5 per cent, to twenty or  twenty-five  agents throughout Australia rather than to continue the payment to one company of fi per ton for this work. If the sales of this product were carried on as before larger commissions would have to be paid, and either the consumer would have to pay a higher price to meet the extra cost or the grower would have to take less for his product. I am out to see that neither the consumer nor the grower suffers. In their interests I favour the handling of our sugar in the cheapest possible way, and that is what is now being done. "We are anxious, as we always have been, that other industries, in whose manufactures sugar is used,  shall  not suffer. I can safely assert that during the war the arrangement made by the Government enabled the fruit-growers and manufacturers, of jams and preserves in Australia, to do an enormous export trade which otherwise would have been impossible. But for the sugar industry in Queensland and the selling of its product, not at the world's parity, which was then £100 per ton, but at f 30 6s. Sd. per ton, this export trade could not have been carried on. The sugar-growers of Queensland at that time did not clamour for world's parity. They did not say that they were out to get all they could. They asked simply for n. fair deal, and the reasonable stand taken by them enabled manufacturers of jams and preserves in Australia to carry on an export trade against all competitors, and to make huge profits which otherwise would have been impossible to them. When we  were  selling sugar in Australia at 6d. per lb., the price in Great Britain, was ls. 6d. per lb., and in the United States of America ls. 5d. per lb. Not only did we give the local manufacturers this enormous advantage over their competitors abroad, but we allowed them a rebate of £20 per ton in respect of sugar used in the manufacture of jam for export. Because the sugar produced in Australia was in sufficient to meet local requirements, supplies had to be obtained from abroad, and for these imports we had to pay about £100 per ton. Sugar for which that price had been paid could not be sold for 6d. a lb. without great loss, and the Government, by means of the low-priced sugar that they are obtaining from Queensland, are now gradually wiping out the loss sustained on the importations of black-grown sugar from Java. </para>

                            <para>- The area now under cane is 43,000 acres in excess of the area so cultivated last year. What we need to do is to stabilize the industry. If the growers receive an assurance that the agreement will continue, and that they will continue to receive something about the present price, which is only a fair one, they will undertake to produce sufficient to meet Australia's requirements. In Queensland there are tens of thousands of acres of land that are as quite suitable for cane growing as is any of the land now devoted to that purpose. The industry, however, has met with reverses. For instance, after the Dickson award was brought in many men went out of the industry finding that it was impossible to carry on and pay the rates of wages so fixed. At Innisfail, for instance, a large number of sugar farmers sold out to Italians, who have since been working their farms on co-operative lines. Only last month 200 Italians arrived there to engage in the industry. These men believe in co-operation. They are not paid per day for their labour, and I am convinced that the sooner our farmers cooperate the better will be their returns. Above all tilings, it is necessary that we should stabilize the industry, so that those who put their money into it will know that they will obtain a fair return for their labour. As the honorable member for Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mackay)</inline> said last week, only about <inline font-style="italic">2\</inline> per cent, of the sugar-cane growers of Queensland pay income tax. They are not wealthy men. On the contrary, they are struggling to make a living, clearing their land, fertilizing and working it as best they can, and looking to the future for a reward. </para>

                    <para class="block">Parliament sanctioned the establishment of the Commonwealth Mills at Geelong. In 1910, when the Fisher Labour Government was in" power, provision was made on the Estimates for the establishment of the woollen mills at Geelong, the Commonwealth Harness Factory, the Commonwealth Clothing Factory, and other industrial enterprises. I am convinced that there is not an honorable member in this House - not an intelligent member of the community - who will not freely admit that during the war these factories served the country well, and stood by our soldiers in their trying time in the trenches. Parliament was consulted as to their establishment, and if, following the traditions of this One-Man Government, a Government without any responsibility to Parliament, all these enterprises are to be thrown aside - because this, I believe, is but the beginning of a general policy of shutting down Commonwealth factories - it is time that Parliament intervened. Honorable members will have an opportunity to record their opinions with respect to this matter. I want specially to direct my attention to the Country party, members of which have had much to say in recent years about " Flinders-lane " and the profits it rakes off the primary products of this country. They will have an opportunity to cast a vote on this question, and we shall take more notice of their votes than of the speeches which they deliver in this House. </para>
                    <para>In 1910, as I have said, provision was made on the Estimates for the establishment of the Commonwealth Woollen Mills at Geelong. Operations were commenced in 1911, and the mills started to manufacture cloth in 1915. At the present time about 350 persons are employed there. It cannot be said that the Government are abolishing or proposing to sell the mills because they are not making a profit, or because they are inefficiently managed. The mills are efficiently managed. The manager and the whole staff of the mills are absolutely the best one could get in this country. I have not been able to get recent official reports, and I do not know why the Government have held them back so long, but by inquiries in many ways I have been able to get an estimate of the profits made by the mill. They have been more than sufficient to wipe out the capital cost of the establishment. I have been informed that it will show a surplus of approximately £250,000. Yet with a burden of debt on the country the Government propose to sell mills that are paying not only interest on the money invested in them, but also an accumulated profit of £250,000. </para>

                            <para>- Very well, the Minister will have the opportunity of giving the total profits. If we had a Government working in the interests of the community - I know it is not, and that it is the worst Government Australia has ever had - it would not be talking about selling the Geelong Woollen Mills, but would be making provision to increase their capacity, and taking steps to establish other mills throughout the country districts, for instance, at Bendigo, Ballarat, Warrnambool, and other centres. In that way the Government could carry out an extensive decentralization policy, and at the same time accumulate profits that would help to reduce the taxation about which honorable members in the Country party talk so much. Australia is not manufacturing more than .15 per cent, of its woollen requirements, although its manufacturers have at their command, locally produced, the best wool in the world. "Seeing that Australia imports five-sixths of its woollen goods, and that there is a vast field for the expansion of the woollen industry, opening up markets for our primary producers, and providing employment, not only for our own unemployed, but also for people of our kith and kin overseas, the Government should be laying down the foundation of a splendid manufacturing industry, instead of proposing to sell the only woollen mills they possess. This is but the beginning of one of the worst jobs the Ministry have ever undertaken. The honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse)</inline> has told us that we should go in for a policy of extension of markets. I have indicated one way in which we can do this, and I shall be interested to see how the honorable member's vote will go on this question. We are told by the supporters of the Government, and by the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> that there will be no trouble in selling the Geelong Woollen Mills. I should say there would not be. I do not mind prophesying that already buyers are in sight. I would not be surprised to learn that the Government know exactly where to put their fingers on the people who are going to buy the mills. Interwoven with this question are all the interests of those who are the masters of the Government. We are told by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> one of the Government's supporters, that it will be a splendid advantage to Geelong to have the mills sold, and that a company will come along, of which, if it be possible, he will be a shareholder, to extend the mills and carry them on. If a company is so eager to undertake the manufacturing of woollen cloth in Australia, why does it not get its own machinery and establish its own mills at Geelong, employing more labour there and producing more manufactured woollen goods in Australia?What is the significance of the statement that a company is eager to buy these mills? We are not told the price at which they are to be offered. No information is given as to the sweet pickings some one is about to get; because it is not one of those cases in which there can be a lot of competition. There are not too many supporters of this side of the House who can submit tenders for this plant. Competition will be left to a few of those who have a good deal of this world's goods ; they will get together and put in a tender. At this stage I want to call attention to a remarkable somersault on the part of the Government, and to investigate the reason for it. On 12th May, 1920, the Assistant Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Granville Eyrie),</inline> in answer to a question in this House, said - </para>

The Inter-State Commission's report on clothing was presented to this House on 13th December, 1918, shortly after the war closed; but the investigation of the Commission had been made during the war period. In one part of their report the Commissioners set out a table showing that the total capital employed in the woollen mills in 1914 was £1,144,385, and that the net profits for the three years, 1915, 1916, and 1917, amounted to £1,197,095.

The Inter-State Commission's report also indicates that these people will not sell direct to the retailers. Their goods go to Flinders-lane, and it is the influence of Flinders-lane that has prompted the sale of the Geelong Woollen Mills. A question was asked in the press the other day as to how Flinders-lane could benefit by the sale of these mills. I shall proceed to show how it will benefit. First of all let us examine the method adopted by the mills. They refuse to sell direct to the people who retail goods. Everything must filter through Flinders-lane No matter what parcels the retailers may be prepared to purchase, the mills will have nothing to do with them, and the retailers are obliged to buy from the wholesale people - those people who throw out their chests and talk about private enterprise, the wonderful efficiency of their system, and the wonderful blundering of public enterprise. For many years I lived in Ballarat, where there are woollen mills. These mills place their output on lorries and send it to the Ballarat West railway station, where it is railed 75 miles to Melbourne, and thence conveyed to the warehouses in Flinders-lane. Immediately a parcel of clothing arrives in a warehouse, its travellers board a train at Spencer-street, journey 75 miles to Ballarat, and go up and down Sturt street selling to the retailers and tailors the very goods which have been turned out in the mills scarcely half-a-mile away. That is what these people term their efficient system, and from which tilley absolutely refuse to depart. The one thing that Flinders-lane will not stand for is the selling of the output of woollen mills direct to retailers, and that is the " milk in the coconut" in this very question of the sale of the Commonwealth Woollen Mills at Geelong. The Inter-State Commission, reporting upon the profits of the wholesale warehouses during the war, says :  - </para>

                    <para class="block">It mentions that the profits in 1914 represented " satisfactory returns." Thus during the war period satisfactory returns were doubled by patriots who waved the flag and sooled their fellows on to fight while they themselves remained at home enjoying their profits and robbing the people. The latest report of the Commonwealth Woollen Mills I have been able to secure is dated 9th February, 1921, and in it I find the following : - </para>

                        <para>A new departure in the issue of tweed for returned soldiers in nice styles of serviceable materials at 50 per cent. of the current market value is keenly appreciated by the returned men. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">These mills in 1920 commenced to supply returned soldiers' needs with tweeds, and these tweeds were retailed by the League to their members and their members' dependents at a profit of ls. 6d. per yard. The League commenced with a profit of ls. per yard, but afterwards found it necessary to increase the charge to ls. 6d. per yard. The difference, therefore, between the mill price and the retail price of this tweed is ls. 6d. per yard, but when cloth comes from the other mills and filters into the hands of the retailers through Flinders-lane the difference is from15s. to £1 per yard. Here we have the reason why these people are now fighting to abolish the Government Mills. They are not game to say to the Returned Soldiers' League, " We will not allow you to trade in competition with Flinders lane and private traders ' ' ; because they play the soldiers for political interests and votes; but they are proposing to do it in a subtle way by wiping out the only mill that will supply the soldiers directly with the tweed. They propose to cut off the source of direct supply, and that means the killing of the whole proposition. In 1920 this mill entered into a contract with the Returned Soldiers Associations of Australia to provide them with 480,000 yards of their output of tweeds and twills. In Victoria 130,000 yards was to be supplied. In that State alone there are over 300 branches of the Returned Soldiers League retailing this material ; and it will be understood that when the soldiers and their friends went about the country - particularly when prices were at their peak and we were paying from £10 to £12 for a suit - and they could say to people, " The suit I am wearing was made up by my tailor from cloth made at the CommonwealthWoollen Mill and retailed by the Returned Soldiers League at a profit of ls. 6d. per yard; it has cost me £6,'' people would say that that material should be available to everybody, and that would be the best way to bring down the price of clothing. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member mouths co-operation; but this was cooperation of the best and most complete kind. The Commonwealth with its own mill was assisting co-operative returned soldiers; and with the same system of cooperation amongst others the people could have saved £3 or £4 on every suit of clothes, and £1 on every blanket which they required to keep themselves warm in the winter. I have here samples of the output of the Geelong Woollen Mills, and they are marked with the prices at which the material is retailed to the returned soldiers at Anzac House, and through the various associations of returned soldiers. I have received these samples from a soldier friend, and the marked prices, Which run from Ss. 6d. to 10s. 6d. per yard, include ls. 6d. per yard profit for retailing. A suit length costs 30s. to 35s. It can be made up by a good tailor with first-class trimmings for from £4 10s. to £5, making the total cost of the suit about £6, and I defy any honorable member to get as good an article at any tailor's shop for less than £10 at the present time. The distribution of this cloth to the Soldiers League is exposing the whole profiteering policy of the Flinders-lane gang, and is compelling them to keep prices lower than they wish; but let this mill be abolished and they will  again  " work in unison " as they did before, and up will soar the prices higher than ever. </para>

                            <para>- The Clothing Factory commenced operations in 1911, and subsequently was able to get supplies of cloth direct from the Commonwealth Woollen Mill. It is dependent on that mill today. Since the Armistice there has been a decrease in the demand for military uniforms, and in order to keep going, the factory has been manufacturing for State Departments. It lias been tendering for the uniforms of railway men such, as guards,  stationmasters,  and porters; and attendants in public institutions, policemen, and others. In so doing it 'has entered into direct competition with Flinders-lane so efficiently that it has undercut prices by at least 10 per cent. Consequently Flinders-lane has been howling for the last two years in the press and otherwise for the Commonwealth Clothing Factory to be closed because it- was said to be competing unfairly. The crime that it is committing is not that the workers are practising the Government stroke, not that it is inefficient, but that it is too efficient, and is carrying on its operations better than private enterprise is able to do. I have here a report that appeared in the public press on 11th June, 1920, of a deputation from the Chamber of Manufactures to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> - </para>

                        <para>The Commonwealth Clothing Factory, a Government-owned concern, was carrying out contracts for the State Governments at prices 1.0 per cent, lower than the prices at which private manufacturers could do the work. This was unfair competition. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">Those are the people who always talk about the inefficiency of Government concerns; yet they admit that the Factory was operating at 10 per cent, lower than private traders could do the work. A similar deputation waited upon the State Premier of Victoria on 6th May, 1920, and urged for the same reason that the State Government should not give their tenders to the Commonwealth Clothing Factory. In letters to the press, private merchants complained that the Clothing Factory procured its cloth direct- from the mill, and that private  enterprise  had no hope of ever getting a contract when the Federal Factory tendered in competition with them. The Commonwealth Factory was able to undercut private enterprise by 10 per cent., and-that, they said, was not fair. At that time the Clothing Factory was making a complete suit for railway stationmasters, on public tender, for £3 9s.. from the best of material turned out by the Commonwealth Mill, and made up in good style, yet private manufacturers said that the Factory should not. compete for State requirements. Only a. few months ago tenders were called by the State Government for uniforms for attendants in the mental hospitals. The Commonwealth Clothing Factory's tender was 5s. 6d. per uniform lower than the nearest private tender, that of Bowley and Company, but the latter was given the contract. There was no question as tot the quality of the material to be supT plied by the Commonwealth Clothing Factory. It was the same as, and in some instances better than, that of the private tenderer, but the State Government is acting in unison with the Federal Government in this private industries protection stunt, in order to put an end to everything that interferes with their masters keeping up prices and continuing to make profits. Not only did the Commonwealth Woollen Mill make a good deal of profit, but u" to date the accumulated profits of the Clothing Factory amount to £158,000. These figures may not mean much to honorable members opposite, who are prepared to spend £8,500 in sending a Minister to Washington; that was a scandal, and details of such expenditure by Ministers when they go abroad should be made public. That £158,000 was in addition to approximately £250,000 profit made by the Mill, and enterprise that can give such results should not be curtailed in this country. But that is only part of the story. It is nothing to what the Commonwealth saved during the war by having that enterprise in existence. Not only did it provide cheaper cloth and uniforms, but it acted as a check upon the greed of the profiteers. I shall give one illustration out of scores that could be given. I have followed this matter closely ever since these establishments were .started., because I was in the House at .the time, and I took a share .of the responsibility .for bringing them into existence. I noticed that when the first tenders were called for cadet uniforms in 1911, at the inception of the compulsory training scheme, the tender for one line of youths' breeches was 17s. 9d. In 1914, when the war broke out, tenders were called for large quantities ~&gt;f breeches, and prices ranged up to 30s. per pair. The Commonwealth Clothing Factory examined the tenders, and advised the Government not to accept them. After going into the whole of the factory costs the management offered to make the breeches at a certain price, and private traders were given an extra 10 per cent, for profit. When the Armistice was signed, in 1918, the peak price of men's, not youths', breeches made on the flat rate plus 10 per cent., was lis. 2d. per pair. Yet private enterprise was asking for 30s. per pair at a time when wages and prices were not so high. Upwards of 1,000,000 pairs of "breeches were ordered by the Defence Department, and I venture to estimate that on this line alone the Commonwealth Factory sawed, the community £250,000. </para>
                    <para>T can quote another item 'to show "bow  the  'Government mills are  hurting  the people in Flinders-lane, and I say 44, .  as surely as the sun will rise to-morrow morning, if the Woollen Mill is sold the Clothing Factory will be closed. Policemen have to pay for their own uniforms, and the price charged them by Bowley and Company in 1920 was £7 10s. </para>
                    <para class="block">Through the Clothing Factory they were able to get their suits for £3 12s., but on account of some increases that have taken place the price is now £4. The police as a body are amongst the lowest-paid public servants in the country; but Flinders-lane was ringing with protests, and that was the beginning of the agitation to wipe out the Commonwealth Woollen Mills. When we were proposing to establish the Woollen Mill, in 1912, there was a protest, particularly in the Senate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Simon</inline> Fraser spoke on behalf of private enterprise, and the then Minister for De-  fence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> said, on 9th September, 1910 - </para>
                    <para>The honorable .senator's old fashioned idea that the 'State cannot do anything has been bowled out long ago.  His  colleagues in Flinders lane are howling about the State entering into competition with private enterprise. </para>
                    <para>Those words are applicable to-da.y, but his " colleagues in Flinders-lane" are in the Cabinet with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> doing the sort of thing of which I complain. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> continued - </para>
                    <para>The fear which is expressed that State enterprise will not prove payable finds its best answer in the fear of the capitalist generally to be subjected to State competition </para>
                    <para>At that time <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> was a Minister in a. Labour Government, and he expressed the truth that we express now, that the great fear of the capitalist is not that State enterprise will fail, but that it will succeed and compete with private enterprise. There has been no argument in favour of the sale of the Woollen Mill at Geelong on the ground that it is inefficient, or that it will not pay. On the contrary, it has proved a splendid paying proposition, both directly and indirectly, and such enterprises, instead of being curtailed should be extended. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> D. Millen, speaking in the Senate on 9th September, 1910, said - </para>
                    <para>If these factories can be shown to be profitable there is no reason why they should not be launched. </para>
                    <para class="block">My answer is that these factories have proved profitable, and there is no 'valid reason why they should not be retained and extended. The 'profits made by the Woollen Mill,  clothing  Factory,, and the Harness Factory are net after allowing 5 per cent, on the capital invested, and proper depreciation on plant and machinery. And those profits are substantial. They represent something in the  direction of easing the burden of taxation upon the people. When it is proposed to part with such a, concern - one which is paying full interest upon capital, and is assisting indirectly to reduce the burden of taxation - I want to know where stands the Taxpayers Association. What is that body doing ? What is it saying about the proposition to part with such a profitable public tax-reducing concern? And where are honorable members of the Country party who have had so much to say about taxation ? Here is a chance to reduce taxation by extending this enterprise in order that it may make larger public profits. But the Taxpayers' Association says nothing. The Country party makes no protest. What conclusion can one come to other than that both bodies would prefer the continuance of high taxation rather than there should be any interference with private enterprise. Both organizations are out for economy. But if one may take their spoken word, or accept the written word of the press which represents them, it would appear that their sole idea of economy is to reduce the wages of the workers.  I  was amused this afternoon when the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> was giving the cane to the naughty boys in the Corner. The Minister talked largely about " no competition with private traders," but he evidently believes in any amount of competition with the working classes. He cried, " Press on with immigration." The Minister informed the House that for every block of land having the necessary facilities and available for settlement there were hundreds of applicants waiting. Within ten minutes of making that statement, the Minister said, " We must press on with immigration." Then he proceeded to explain the Government's policy. Be said, in effect, that the settlement of Australians on the  land  was the work of the States alone, but that, when it came to settling immigrants on the land, the Commonwealth Government would assist the State Governments. Two conditions were laid down, among others. I noted them. They were that the Commonwealth Government would assist if work in preparing the land was given to immigrants and if the blocks of land were made available to the immigrants. Preference for immigrants! No money or assistance to States if they propose to settle more Australians ! </para>
                    <para class="block">The Minister for Defence said there were hundreds of applicants waiting for every available block; and, almost in the same breath, he cried, " Press on with immigration." All this means that immigrants will be dumped into the cities to become competitors with our working men. That, however, will be all right from the point of view of the Government so long as there is no competition with the private traders of this country. </para>
                    <para>Is this House going to allow the Government to sell the Commonwealth Mill at Geelong? Is there to be no protest from honorable members on the Government side who, when the enterprise in question was established, offered up their cheers? Members of the Country party have been making speeches throughout the land, talking about the prices realized for their wool, and comparing them with what they have to pay for their clothes. What are they going to do about this matter? If the House fails to record a vote against the Government, and if the people at large do not protest, the mill at Geelong will be sold. The only source of supply at a cheap and reasonable rate which the returned soldiers have will be cut off; the only competition with the private trading profiteers will be abolished. And the Harness Factory will follow. Its activities have already been reduced to a minimum. In pre-war times that factory employed eighty men; to-day it is finding work for eighteen. It will be the next to go. Then the Commonwealth ships will follow. And, if the people do not protest, as sure as I live, the Commonwealth Bank will be handed over to private enterprise. The Government have stated that the mill at Geelong cannot be carried on except during three months in the year unless it competes with private enterprise; and that, the Government will not permit it to continue to do. The Commonwealth Bank has so successfully competed with private banking institutions that its profits total more than £3,700,000. Is the Minister for Defence prepared to say that the Government will not continue that profit-making public institution in competition with private banking companies ? The Minister does not answer. I ask the House to note that I have put the question direct. Does the remark of the Minister to the effect that the Government  will not, compete with private trading apply to the Commonwealth Bank ? </para>

They would wipe out the Commonwealth Bank tomorrow. The Commonwealth Bank was the only institution of the kind which, during the war, did not raise its rate of interest on overdrafts.

Would the Minister for Defence, if he had a good paying proposition, such as that mill, airily wave his hand and say, " I will sell it to somebody who is eager to buy from me " ? Would the Treasurer, the honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce),</inline> sell some Flinders lane concern in which he might be interested if it were providing him' with profits such as are produced by the Geelong mill? Not much! When it is a public concern, however, and one which is making profits for the people, the Government do not hesitate to say, " Pass it over to a company which is very eager to buy it." One sees in this issue the dictation of the masters of the Government. The Prime Minister says that honorable members on this side are in the web of the unions. We are not controlled by the moneyed interests of the country, who are the masters of the Government, and keep them fettered. </para>

                            <para>- I repeat that they are up for sale. The New South Wales Government are limiting or selling every enterprise. The State motor garage, which has been working at a profit, is being limited in its scope of activity. The State drug stores, which have been supplying medicines at cheap rates to hospitals, and conferring benefits upon the poor, have now been limited entirely to Government concerns. All these signs are part of the general scheme in the interests and for the welfare of private traders. The war furnished opportunities for this country to get on with State enterprises, which have proved successful ; but the Government, speaking for those whom they represent, say that these activities must no' longer continue. It is not as if the management of these various public institutions had proved a failure. The managers have shown themselves to be excellent business men. Labour conditions at that factory are better than those to be found in an average mill in any part of Australia. The mill has saved the Government thousands of pounds indirectly, besides making direct profits. It has shielded returned soldiers from exploitation, and it would save money for the civilian population, too, if it were permitted to extend its operations so as to cater for the public generally. Its successful operations have had the effect of exposing and hurting the profiteers, for which reasons the mill is to be handed over to private enterprise. Competition must be stifled; Flinders-lane must be freed from this irksome competitor. All the private traders will soon be able to act in unison again. What a happy hunting-ground there will be for the profiteers ! In disposing of the mill the Government will be merely doing the behest of their masters, of those men who subscribe to the party funds, of those who have given their tips for the benefit of the Prime Minister. </para>

                    <para>My purpose is to devote some attention  to  a matter raised by  the  honor able member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corser),</inline> having to do with the duty on maize. The presentation of the case put by the honorable member is substantially correct up to the stage at which this House accepted an. amendment made in another place fixing the duties at1s.6d. preferential, 3s. 6d. intermediate, and 3s. general Tariff. The statements of my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Greene</inline> were made in perfect good faith, as will be shown by what I have  to  say. Following on those statements, cable communications were opened up between the South African Government and the Commonwealth Government. It was the intention of the Commonwealth Government at that particular stage to place South African maize in the same position as maize from any other country, and then to negotiate terms for the future relationship of South Africa and the </para>
                    <para class="block">Commonwealth, so far as maize and other commodities are concerned, on a reciprocal basis. I remind the House very briefly that, in 1906, the Commonwealth Government negotiated an agreement with South Africa in respect of many items, of which maize was one, and under that arrangement the duty was fixed at1s. per cental. That position South Africa has enjoyed since 1906. It is only fair to say at this juncture that, while South Africa was not prepared to accept the position in which we placed her in the general Tariff, as approved by this Chamber and another place - namely, that South Africa, until we negotiated other terms, was to pay the same duty as any other  country -  the balance of trade, in the year prior to the telegrams sent by my colleague, was overwhelmingly in favour of the Commonwealth. The figures show £3,900,000 of trade from Australia to South Africa, as against £400,000 of trade from South Africa to Australia. So important was the position that I venture to say that not even the honorable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corser)</inline> would suggest that we should have imperilled an agreement so overwhelmingly in favour of Australia, and all for the sake of this one item. Therefore, at the eleventh hour of the session,  as  the honorable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corser)</inline> mentioned - when my colleague received the intimation from South Africa that, unless she were allowed to denounce the whole of the1906 treaty arrangement, she was not prepared to accept the position with respect to maize - he, in the interests of this country, effected an amendment in the Bill on a message from the Governor-General. As a result we have the position in which we find ourselves to-day, and that position I, personally, very much regret. The matter was, however, so serious for Australia that it  would never have  done for us to imperil a trade treaty under  which  Australia enjoyed preferential treatment in respect  of  the volume of trade I have mentioned. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. As I have said, the assurances were given  by  my colleague in perfect good faith, and I regret that those assurances should have been relied upon  by  certain honorable members. All I can say is that the facts do not speak too well for some of the manufacturers of cornflour, starch, and glucose, who, on the strength of their utilization of the Australian raw products, received a greatly increased duty on their secondary product. The intention of the House was that those manufacturers should use Australian maize, and thus assist a primary industry; but. at a time when they could got the maize a little cheaper elsewhere, they threw over the local producers and obtained it from outside. I certainly do not regard that as in keeping with their attitude on the question when they were granted an increased duty. A number of returned soldiers area growing maize; and I must repeat that, in my judgment, the attitude of the manufacturers was not a commendable one. However, the Government are opening up negotiations with South Africa with a view to a reconsideration of the trade relations of the two countries. The whole question of the Tariff relations will bc reviewed, and the maize question gone into thoroughly. In the meantime, however, I am considering very carefully another alternative which is at the disposal of the Government. Of that I will say nothing further to-night, but I hope that the warning given will show those who asked for protection for the secondary industry of which maize is the raw material that it is " up to them " to stand by the men who grow it here. </para>
