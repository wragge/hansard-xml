                        <para>- The Government having received representations from the United Fruit-growers National Conference, and having heard the views of others interested, have formed the opinion that it is necessary to assist the producers in the marketing of their crop this year, though it has not been decided what form the assistance shall take. The honorable member, I think, refers to fruit suitable for canning. Beyond that I do not think the Governmentcould go. We have consulted the States, and have suggested the holding of a conference on the 28th instant. </para>

                            <para>- I have received no cable conveying any information of any sort or kind&#39; other than that which I received on Sunday. Yesterday, I gave to the House the whole&#34; of the information contained in that message, although I did not read it word for word, and I now again invite the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> to came to my office and see the cable for himself. Another cablegram certainly came to hand yesterday, but its contents were published in the newspapers <inline font-style="italic">in extenso</inline> by, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George. It referred to the satisfaction which had been expressed in Great Britain at the receipt of the information that the Commonwealth was prepared to associate itself with the Mother Country. That exhausts all the communications I. have received from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George or the British Government in regard to the matter. Any other information which has come to hand has been contained in despatches which are at least six to eight weeks old, and have no reference whatever to the present situation. I may add that I said yesterday, in the course of my speech, that the British Government had been asked to supply us with full and precise information. I repeat that all that we have had so far was conveyed in the&#39; one cable the substance of which, without exception, I gave to the House yesterday. </para>

In a section of this morning&#39;s press, it was made to appear that the carrying, on the voices, of the motion moved by the Prime Minister yesterday here, involved the indorsement of what the right honorable gentleman has communicated to the British Prime Minister in connexion with the situation in the Near East.

But, having regard to the fact that the honorable member for Darling has been debarred from ventilating the subject on a substantive motion, by the decision of the House to give precedence on all sitting days to Government business, I do not feel justified in ruling the motion out of order, provided it is clearly understood that, under cover of this motion, no attack or personal reflection can be made upon the Judge or the Court, nor can the conduct of the Judge be debated. </para>

I understood that it was quite proper to attack judicial conduct, or to utter criticism of a judicial decision in a way which possibly involved reflections  on a Judge, provided it was done by a motion. This motion, of course, is for the adjournment of the House; but would it not be fitting, and within the Standing Orders, to give the House the fullest and freest opportunity to discuss the Judge&#39;s conduct, as well as the award he made, and all the circumstances relevant thereto which we think should be ventilated ? </para>

                            <para>-  Would that apply if he were  President  of the Court and not a Judge, or does it apply only because he is a Judge? I point out that the  Deputy  Presidents and the  Chairman  of the Coal Board are not Judges. I wish to make it perfectly clear that I am not taking aides in the matter at all, but only desire to know whether the distinction is to be drawn between the  President,  because he is a Judge, and Deputy-Presidents and the  Chairman  of the Coal Tribunal, who are not Judges. If these latter may be criticised while the  President  of the Court may not be criticised, not because he is  President  of the Court, but because he is also a Judge,, then, to a certain extent, we are hampered in dealing with the matter. I, of course, take a different view of the matter from that of my friend opposite, but there is the position, and I desire your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline></para>

If a case of that kind arises I shall be prepared to deal with it; but in the present case the motion deals with an award of a Judge of the Court. I have mentioned the matter at this stage to avoid, if I can, any occasion to intervene while debate is in progress. </para>

                        <para>.- I thank you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> and the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> for giving me warning as to what may befall me if I transgress the rules of the House. This, <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> think, is the sixth attempt I have made here to ventilate the very extraordinary judgment given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Powers, the  President  of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. There is a mass of material connected with the matter, and the time at my disposal will not allow me to&#39; use it all. I do not desire to do the Judge any injustice, and I shall carefully give extracts from his own judgment, and use his own words as they appear in the transcript and minutes. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>May I say that in this Parliament it should be possible for any member, if he so desires, to submit a motion censuring a Judge and asking for his removal? But when I moved a motion, which was practically one of censure on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Powers, it was placed at the bottom, of the business-paper, and the Government refused to allow it to be discussed. Personally, I do not think that a man occupying a high judicial position should continue in office in the face of such a motion. To give an idea of the extraordinary circumstances in connexion with this particular award, I shall refer, as briefly as possible,- to some of the incidents during the hearing. I take full responsibility for my action in dealing with this important matter, which involves between 40,000 and 50,000 men in Australia. The shearing industry is  held up; sheds which should have been &#34; cut out &#34; three months ago are still without labour, and at the award rates are likely to continue without labour. This will mean a great loss to the country, and a great loss to the workers, because they are without shearing. I shall give one illustration of the many mistakes which have been made, and it is an extraordinary mistake on the part of a Judge occupying the highest position in the Industrial Courts of Australia. In one portion of his judgment, which appears in the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Arbitration Re cords,</inline> he said that if a man sheared 200 sheep a day at 30s. per 100 this equalled &#163;3 10s. This ought to have been stated as &#163;3; but, on the rate of &#163;3 10s., the Judge declared that a shearer would receive &#163;19 5s. per week. </para>

In the first judgment, delivered on 5th May, 1922,  His  Honour fixed the shearing rate at 30s. per 100, and shed hands&#39; wages at &#163;3 per week. Four pages of his judgment were occupied in proving to the respondents and applicants before him that 30s. per 100 was a fair rate; and, after he had proved this to his own satisfaction, he suddenly discovered that he had made a mistake. Later on, based on such reasons as I have indicated, he fixed the rate at 35s. On page 16 of his judgment, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Powers says - </para>

                        <para>As it is proposed to fix the basic wage at the same rate as in the 1917 award, because the rate is fair now, the shearers and other piece-work rates and wages will remain the same as in the old award. I am satisfied that the 30s. rate will secure to the shearers in 1922-23-24 much better returns than it did, or, at any rate, what the Court intimated it would return to the average shearer in the days when the 30s. was first fixed. </para>
                        <para class="block">As. a matter of fact the basic wage for 1916 was 63s. <inline font-style="italic">(vide</inline> page 71 March Bulletin, No. 87, index No. 1324, equals 10s. 6d. per day, 63s. per week; whereas same Bulletin, page 73, shows index No. for March, 1922, as 1630, equals 13s. 4d. per day,&#34; or 80s. per week). The old claim was based upon the 1915 index figures as to cost of living <inline font-style="italic">(vide</inline> same Bulletin, page 71 index figure 1278, equal tot 10s.. 2d. per day, or 61s. per week). That claim was for 30s. per 100, and though the case was not heard until about June, 1917, when 30s. was not a fair rate; yet, because it was the limit asked for, and the claim could not be amended, that rate was&#34; awarded by consent of the parties, the Court having  no  power to do anything else. The rate of 30s. was based upon the known procedure of the Court; but, before we could obtain our award, the cost of living had increased so rapidly that we were really entitled to the 32s. 6d. per 100. However, as I have just mentioned, we were legally prevented from securing anything better. </para>
                        <para>Before making his award final, His Honour discovered that something had gone wrong with his figures, and he altered the rate from 30s. per 100 and <inline font-style="italic">&#163;3</inline> per week, to 35s. per 100 and <inline font-style="italic">&#163;3</inline> 10s. per week. And he said he had never intended to do anything else. That was after he had occupied four pages in order to justify his judgment for 30s. per 100. This, though an improvement on the first intimation, is not a fair award. His Honour; on &#39;page 24 of his statement, says, &#34; On the whole I am satisfied that 25 per cent, lost time is reasonable for the whole expedition.&#34; On page 25 he says - </para>
                        <para>In the judgment, when making the award in 1911, it was apparently accepted as a fair estimate that whatever average number of sheep were shorn at a shed, the average number for the time of the expedition was about 338 per week. Those figures appear to have been accepted in 1917. </para>
                        <para>His Honour further says, on the same page- </para>
                        <para>On the evidence before, although it was shown in 1912 that shearers averaged whilst at the sheds 439 sheep per week, I do not think, even allowing for the better organization in some districts to secure a run of sheds, that shearers generally had increased the average for the expedition from 338 to more than 350. </para>

                    </para>
                    <para>This shows that instead of the average being, as His Honour states, 338 for the whole of the expedition, it shows only 254. Yet he bases his award on an average of 350 sheep per week - roughly, 100 more than1 91 1-17. The respondents put in evidence to show that shearers averaged 439 per week while at the shed, and though we had no returns to show anything different, it is ridiculous to assume that the average shearer does 100 per week more now than formerly. There may be a slight difference owing to better organization of runs, but nothing to account for any such increase. </para>
                    <para>On page 25a of his fourth judgment His Honour says - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>Assuming that 439 sheep a week is the average while at the sheds, it is clear that in four weeks the number of sheep shorn by a shearer would be 1,756; but if 25 per cent, is fair for lost time, it would take five weeks to shear them, and that would mean only 351 sheep per week. I cannot, therefore, base rates on 439 sheep, even if it is an average. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>But His Honour does base his rates on the 350 sheep per week, which is also wrong. If 439 sheep per week at the shed is right, and 25 per cent. for lost time is fair, then the average number of sheep over the whole expedition is 329 ; and even that total is 75 sheep per week more than shearers were shown to average when both parties were collecting statistics. The reason why they can now show a 439 average per week is, most likely, because they knew we we&#39;re not collecting statistics; and they probably selected the sheds to show what they wanted. This view is borne out when one remembers that, in the hours case, a few months before the general case, the respondents tried to prove to the Court that the shearer averaged from 5 to 27 per cent, fewer sheep in forty-four hours than he did in forty-eight. </para>

                    <para class="block">That would be the amount a shearer would get if he were a wages man and shore only 50 sheep a day, but in all awards made by this Court for piece-workers the rates fixed are from 10 per cent, to 33 per cent, more than on wages. If 20 (19s. 2d.) per cent, is added for piece-work, it would amount to about &#163;6 l1s. 2d. It would be necessary on these figures to give to the average shearer about 35s. per 100, if the average number he shore per week for the time of the expedition &#34;were 350 in order to secure to him &#163;6 12s. 6d. Out of that amount he would have to pay his mess account of 25s. per week and 6s. per week for fares. It will be noted that 350 sheep at 35s. per 100 will only give &#163;6 2s. 6d., not, as stated, &#163;6 12s. 6d.  His  Honour says that the discrepancy is due to a typist&#39;s error, but most likely it was not, as he was testing a sum of &#163;6 l1s. 2d., and by making a mistake of 10s. in the sum misled himself. To produce &#163;6 12s. 6d. it would require 38s. per 100, not 35s. as stated, but if the actual average in the shed on the respondents&#39; own figures are taken, 325, over 40s. per 100 will be required to produce <inline font-style="italic">&#163;6 12s.</inline> 6d.

                    <para class="block">Let me now give an illustration of the chaos which this award has caused in the pastoral industry. I quote from the report published in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Worker</inline> of 30th August of the case of the <inline font-style="italic">Graziers Association</inline> versus <inline font-style="italic">H. E. Boote,</inline> who was  charged with continuing a strike. This was after <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Barnes</inline> and I had been fined &#163;100, and had been told by the magistrate that if we came before him again he would be compelled to sentence us to imprisonment without the option of a fine. When an award is responsible for such chaos as exists in the pastoral industry, and is based upon such extraordinary miscalculations, no citizen who resists it - should be charged with a criminal offence, and possibly gaoled. That is probably what will happen to some of us before this case is finished. </para>

                    <para class="block">Charles McDonnell, a member of a shearing contracting firm, and Thomas Bell Eyre, manager of Bringagee station, gave similar evidence. There have been strikes all over New South Wales. In South Australia practically the whole of the sheds, so far as we know, are shearing at &#163;2 per 100. The contractors and pastoralists are paying the &#163;2 without any demur, recognising, I believe, as quite a number of the squatters do, that the award is based upon wrong grounds, and that miscalculations and mistakes occurred, as a result of which the men are not getting a fair deal. On page 13 of his judgment, the  President,  after mentioning that different methods of calculating the rates for shearing had been suggested, said - </para>
                    <para>For instance, although the purchasing power of money increased as a matter of fact it decreased - by at least 2s. between 1907 and 1911, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins in 1911 found that 24s. a 100, the rate fixed in 1907, would give to the shearer under the then existing conditions, for the reasons mentioned by him, all he was fairly entitled to during the expedition, and fixed the same rate in 1911 as was fixed in 1907, 24s. per 100. </para>
                    <para class="block">The Judge has made many errors. Did time permit, I could give, I think, twelve illustrations of the extraordinary attitude of his mind in dealing with this case. I do not know whether he personally arrived at the figures that he used or relied upon the calculations of some one else. If the calculations were his own, his education in arithmetic was sadly neglected, but in any case he was responsible for the correctness of the figures&#39; used. One instance of the absurdity of. his calculations is the working out of 200 sheep at 30s. per 100 as <inline font-style="italic">&#163;3</inline> 10s. There is not the slightest chance of the shearers working under the award, and no hope of peace in the pastoral industry under it. Next&#39; year the men will be even more solid than they are this year. The pastoralists  may believe themselves strong, but we feel that we are much stronger. . We will not work under the award, and refuse to abide by its conditions. From 1907 to 1922 the Australian Workers Union worked under Arbitration Court awards and agreements. </para>

                            <para>- No. In 1917 we claimed 30s., allowing a margin on the cost of living, which did not then entitle us to quite so much. Because of the congestion of business it was six months before the case could be heard, and by that time the cost of living had increased so much that we were entitled to 32s. 6d ; but the law prevented us from claiming more than our original demand. During the war we could have compelled the pastoralists, if we had wished to do so, to pay &#163;3 per 100. </para>

                            <para>- The result of the honorable member&#39;s neglect is that I am not so fully equipped with information as I would have been under other cirum- stances.  I wish to say at the beginning that Parliament is not the place in which to review the judgments of the Arbitration Court. Were every honorable member to use his position here to get legal cases discussed in Parliament with a view to influencing decisions, the Courts would lose their character as judicial tribunals.  The Arbitration Court is part of our legal machinery. Parties have the right to go before it, and to submit to it the whole of their case, and law-abiding citizens in a Democracy, having the right to govern themselves, will abide by the decisions of such a Court, whether they like them or not. That is the proper attitude towards the judgment of all&#39; the Courts in a properly ordered community. Any other attitude towards them would produce chaos. Parties cannot go to a Court, take any benefit that may result from its judgments, and flout its jurisdiction when decisions go against them. The honorable member for Darling <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blakeley)</inline> has made an <inline font-style="italic">ex parte</inline> statement. I am not in a position at this moment to criticise it in detail. &#39; He based his case on remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Powers during the progress of a trial; but what we have to ask is, Does the award do substantial justice? The honorable member cannot say that there was not every opportunity for his union to put before the Court every possible phase of its case. </para>

                        <para>The miscalculation or error on which the union principally relies was an error in copying the judgment by typing &#163;6 12s. 6d. instead of &#163;6 2s. 6d. as the result of multiplying 35s. by 3* (300 at 35s. a 100) , equal to &#163;6 2s.6d. </para>

                    <para>It has been referred to as if I could hot do that simple sum correctly; and because the typist put in &#163;6 12s.6d. instead of &#163;6. 2s.6d. it has been contended that I intended to give over 37s. 6d. a 100 at least instead of 35s. a 100. </para>

                        <para>It is true that since the award was made the Statistician&#39;s figures show that the cost of living has risen during the present quarter, but I cannot take that into consideration on this application.The union protested against the rate being subject to quarterly adjustments, preferring to leave increases of the rates during the term because of the increased cost of living to be granted by the Court on application to vary the award. </para>
                        <para>It ought not to be forgotten in considering the request - (1) That the award rates in 1911 and 1917 were based on forty-eight hours a week, and the present award rates are based on forty-four hours a week; (2) the present award grants better conditions to shearers than in former awards, including lower prices for meat and stores than in previous awards; (3) although the thirty-towns&#39; rates are based on the prices supplied to the Statistician by shopkeepers for meat and other food, shearers have to be supplied with meat at from 3d. to 4d. a lb., and other stores at only 7&#163; per cent, on their actual cost to the station; (4) the basic rate of &#163;3 18s. a week on which the shearers&#39; rates were fixed is 12s. per week higher than the rural basic rate in New South Wales fixed by the Board of Trade in force  in June last and at the present time- The majority of sheep to be shorn under the award are in New South Wales; (5) the pastoralists of New Zealand offer to the shearers in June, 1922, , was 20s. a 100 for flock sheep, but rates have not been definitely settled.&#39; </para>

                        <para>Prom 1886 to 1907, for twenty-one years before the Arbitration Court was constituted (although strikes had taken place to secure higher rates), the shearing rate was 20s. a 100. Since then the Court raised the rate, first, by <inline font-style="italic">is. a 100;</inline> then because of the increased cost of living <inline font-style="italic">by 10s.;</inline> then by agreement by 20s. a 100 (because the Court could have been applied to if no agreement had been made and retrospective rates allowed). </para>
                        <para>Surely when the cost of living has decreased by- 16s. since the 1920 shearing season - equal to 7s. 2d. a 100 - the union is not justified, because the Court <inline font-style="italic">acts consistently</inline> and reduces the rate in part- because of the <inline font-style="italic">decreased cost of living,</inline> in refusing to advise its members to observe the award of 35s. a 100, and thus deprive all its members of the benefit of arbitration, which has done so much for the shearers and its other members since 1906 - and the country generally - by avoiding the necessity of direct action to secure what the Court (not the union or pastoralists) considers fair rates for shearing and other work done by members of the union. </para>

                            <para>- It was the union, and not the pastoralists, which went to the Court. Obviously, if I go to a Court and ask for a judgment, I agree to abide by the decision given; otherwise, it is hypocrisy on my part to go to the Court. The honorable member for Darling admits that all the facts were placed before the  President  of the Court. Both sides were heard, and the Judge, holding the balance fairly between them in an endeavour to do what was right as between party and party, as it was his duty to do, gave his award. The honorable member then went through the country conveying the erroneous impression that the award given was based upon a mistake, and inciting men not to abide by it. In this course of action he and the other members of the executive of his union were checked by an injunction from a Court. The next step, taken by the union, was a further appeal to the  President  of the Arbitration Court, who afforded them every opportunity to show where any mistake had been made in his judgment. He allowed them to apply for a variation of the award, but on ai reconsideration of that award the Judge held that it was sound, and that no error or mistake had been made by him. In that judgment, which has been circulated to honorable members, he justifies his award. The next step we have had in this matter is the . action of the honorable member for Darling, a dissatisfied litigant, who probably believes quite honestly that he has not secured justice, in coining to Parliament, and setting up propaganda work here in the hope that it will circulate outside and create dissatisfaction, thus providing further confusion &#39;and unemployment in the Australian industrial world. The honorable member&#39;s action is a thing to be censured. </para>

                            <para>- On ordinary principles of honesty, is it right for any person to invite a union to apply to a Tribunal for a decision and then, having got an award, given according to the law, to go out and create discontent, in order to nullify it? The judgment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Powers was given after a most careful inquiry, and it is deeply to be regretted that the honorable member has taken this action. It is certainly not in the interests of the workers. Before I conclude, let me quote the following, which shows what big money is earned by shearers under the award in question: - </para>

                        <para>In a statement issued by the Graziers&#39; Association to-day, it was said that 2,000 shearers were earning from &#163;9 to &#163;17 a week in the sheds of New South Wales. These men are said to be working only forty-four hours, weekly, at the Federal award rates of 35s. a hundred. Weekly earnings of from &#163;10 to &#163;12, it was also stated, were common, and ringers were drawing from &#163;13 to &#163;17. </para>
                        <para>At Boorooma, Walgett, twenty-three shearers shore 14,725 sheep in one week, averaging about 640 a man. This, on the Federal award Tate, would work out at just over &#163;11 a man for a week&#39;s work. During a previous week at the same shed, the same shearers shore 12,302 sheep for the week, or an average of about 534 a man. On award rates this would work out at about &#163;9 6s. a man for the week. The ringer&#39;s tally for the week was 752, which would return him just over &#163;13. </para>
                        <para>At Dummbral, Collarenebri, 20 shearers shore 13,008 sheep in one week, averaging 650 a man, which would work out at &#163;11 12s. 6d. a man. At Midkin, Moree, 40 shearers shore 21,800 in one week, working out approximately at &#163;9 10s. a man, while at Tallawanta, Garah, 10 shearers shore 7,258 sheep for the week, averaging &#163;12 10s. a man. A ringer here shore 968 sheep, equal to about &#163;17. Ten shearers at Wootawa, Morah, shore 7,617 sheep for the week, averaging a little over &#163;13 each, while the ringer&#39;s tally for the week was 929, for which he would be paid just over &#163;16. </para>
                        <para>At Charlton, Brewarrina, 13 shearers shore 1,946 sheep in one day, averaging &#163;2 10s. a man, and one of the, shearers was only a learner. One day the ringer shore 216, for which he would be paid about &#163;3 15s. </para>
                        <para>In the face of these figures the Association comments, &#34; Surely no reasonable man will contend that genuine shearers are. not at work, or that the Federal award rate does not offer a good return to shearers.&#34; </para>
                        <para>Many of the bigger sheds, it is stated, are shearing or will shear a neighboring small man&#39;s sheep. This will increase the shearers&#39; earnings for the season by cutting down their travelling bill and lost time in getting from shed to shed. Shearers will have a highly remunerative run this year. </para>

                    <para>That report is an indication of the money that is being earned by the shearers under the award they have obtained.

                    <para>Mr.SCULLIN. - He made charges against an award given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Powers, the  President  of the Arbitration Court, and any Government that believes in arbitration and wants to see the system continued should immediately take cognisance of such charges, instead of proceeding to harangue the unionists of the country as to its&#39; being their duty to abide by awards whether they are right or wrong. The honorable member for Darling was speaking to-day on behalf of the biggest industrial organization in Australia. This union has loyally and faithfully abided by awards of the Arbitration Court for fifteen years. Although  it has had it in its power to create turmoil in the country, and although, on many occasions, it has not got all it has asked for and has suffered many disappointments in awards given since it first went to the Court in 1907, it has never once struck against a decision once an award has been given. The responsibility rests upon the Government to say how it happens that this union, which has so faithfully abided by the awards of the Arbitration Court, is now proceeding to break an award today. Not one of the facts put forward by the honorable member for Darling has been controverted. It is a simple question of arithmetic. The Attorney-General says that if the Judge made a mistake in arriving at his figure, the union should have gone before him again. As a matter of fact, the Minister knows that the union did go before the Judge again. It placed all these facts before  His  Honour, but its efforts were of no avail. The  President  of the Arbitration Court stubbornly stood to his mistake, not even admitting that he had been guilty of making a common, ordinary, arithmetical error. If the Government choose to bluff through a proposition like that, I am afraid that this big organization, the Australian &#34;Workers Union, will have nothing more to do with arbitration. I say this with regret, because if we can have peace in the industrial world, and justice done to the men who toil, without the arbitrament of strikes, it will be of benefit to the country. But if the Government choose to stand by a Judge who makes this kind of error, and stubbornly stands by it, they will have to take the responsibility for the industrial discord that will prevail in Australia. The award given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Powers is one of the worst examples of bungling ever perpetrated by a man in a responsible position. </para>

                            <para>- It is very difficult to keep within the ruling of the Chair. I shall take one out of the many illustrations given by the honorable member for Darling to prove that the award in question was based upon a mistake.  His  Honour based his decision on figures supplied by the Pastoralists Union, namely, that the average shear is 439 per week. That this was an increase of 101 on the previous year&#39;s average was admitted. The very men who came before the Court and supplied these figures were those who had previously contended that the introduction of the forty-four hour week would reduce the speed of shearing by from 5&#39; to 27&#189; per cent. Yet  His  Honour accepted the <inline font-style="italic">ex parte</inline> statement of these&#39; men, which, on the face of it, could not be true. He not only does that- </para>

                            <para>- I will try my best to discuss the award itself. It provides for 439 sheep per week as the average, and then allows a reduction of twenty-five for lost time. An ordinary &#34;school boy with a third-class education, if asked to take 25 per cent. from 439, would give the answer as 329. but the award gives it as 351. I pin the Minister down to that one fact. Without traversing the supporting arguments of the honorable member for Darling, I ask the Minister, who is responsible to this country in the matter of arbitration, whether he is prepared to say that the workers are bound to abide by awards based on such erroneous figures? When the question came before the Court again, and the figures were put before the Judge, no man not stubbornly prepared to stand by statements made, however erroneous, would have refrained from correcting them. That has not been done, and yet this body of men are expected to accept the award. Further, the Judge has allowed 20 per cent., although he says that the right allowance is 25 per cent. I ask honorable members to exercise their common sense, and to put themselves in the position of those men who earn their living in this industry.  They may have gone to the Court, and have been disappointed in the award given, hut they have abided by the award. The Minister -for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> says that that is because the awards have always improved the position of the men ; but I point out that the awards were not always in accordance with the cost of living. These men, as I say, may have been disappointed in this regard, but in many cases have abided by the decision. When, however, there is  an obvious mistake in arithmetic which robs them, at any rate, of 5s. per 100, it is asking too much of human nature to expect the men to accept the award. There is no organization in Australia, and certainly not the Australian Workers Union, which could ask its members to abide by such an award. If the Minister is simply going to brush the matter aside, and, lecturing the shearers, tell them that they must abide by the award whether they like it or not-that they must accept the bad arithmetic of the  President  - it is making a&#62; farce of arbitration, and, indeed, wiping arbitration out. </para>

They will not, as the Minister says in his airy way, accept the award. Those who, after all, will lose the most will be the members of the Pastoralists Union, who are sheltering themselves behind the Arbitration Court, and endeavouring to lower living conditions in this country.

That is the kind of thing that is killing arbitration - it is that kind of thing which, supported by the Government, stands for industrial turmoil!. I stand for arbitration, and voted for it when I sat on the Government side; I am in favour of the principle of tribunals to settle industrial questions. Although that is my policy and belief, I say deliberately here, that for the Government to stand by awards like this, awards that are manifestly unjust, based as they are on bad arithmetic, is to sign the death-warrant of arbitration, and means going back to the old days of strikes. </para>

The honorable  member  for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> has taken credit to the Australian Workers Union for abiding by the awards of the Arbitration Court for a considerable period. He has told us that the objection to this particular award is the defective arithmetic displayed by the  President,  Me.

                    <para>Mr.CONSIDINE.- In his concluding remarks the honorable member for Yarra intimated that this same Judge had reduced the daily wages of the miners by 1s. per day below the basic wage; and that is not due to any fault of arithmetic. My view is that the mistake of the shearers was in going, in the first place, to the Arbitration Court. The Australian Workers Union desired, by means of a conference with the Pastoralists Union, to obviate an upheaval, but the Pastoralists Union refused to meet them and&#39; discuss any alteration of the conditions. Of course, the Australian Workers Union has its own method of doing its business, and I am not attempting to dictate to the members of another organization. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know that that is so. If I can assist the men of the pastoral industry to win the fight&#39; they are now waging I shall certainly do so, and we shall see whether or not the pastoralists are concerned about what I do. The honorable member who is so unconcerned at the present time, is not so unconcerned in his capacity of a pastoralist when the officials of the Australian Workers Union stand by their members as they are doing at the present time. The pastoralists go to the Courts for an injunction, hale members of the union before Judges, have them fined, and threaten them with imprisonment; and that, I suppose, is all to show how unconcerned they are. The position,, as it strikes me, is that there is a calculated effort on the part of the employers of this country, through their various organizations, to wipe out the previous effects of the Arbitration Court with regard to wages and conditions. That effort is not confined to Australia; there has been a world-wide attack on organized labour since the Armistice. We see this in the United States of America, in Great Britain, and in every country where there is organized labour. There is a concerted effort on the part of organized capital to lower the standard of living of the workers, and to force them back to conditions which, if not worse than pre-war conditions, are certainly no better. It is no use our shutting our eyes to the fact; there is a struggle taking place between organized labour and organized employers. This is not a matter that will be settled in the Arbitration Court; it will be settled, as in the past, by the strength of the organized forces. It will be the determination of the workers as against the bank balance of the pastoralists, and the desire of the latter to have their sheep shorn. It will be a question of whether the circumstances are -favorable to the pastoralists or the men. The latter are certainly handicapped by lack of resources, and by the fact that all the paraphernalia for repression is in the hands of their political and industrial enemy. I am glad that the honorable member for Yarra has intimated that the old fighting spirit of the Australian Workers Union is not dead. </para>

                            <para>Certain oversea mailboats do call at a port in each State except Tasmania. The only oversea mailboats running under contract with the Commonwealth Government to deliver mails in the United Kingdom are those of the Orient Company. Under the terms of the contract, three vessels of the line call at Hobart each year during the months of February to May inclusive. The vessels of the Peninsular and Oriental Line carrying mails under contract with the British Government do not, it is understood, make Hobart a port of call. As regards the latter part of the question, investigation has shown that Tasmanian producers are not adversely affected to any appreciable extent by the failure of the Peninsular and Oriental vessels to call at Hobart, the refrigerated space in any one of the &#34; Bay &#34; steamers of the Commonwealth Line (three of which were diverted to Hobart for the special benefit of the apple exporters) being more than equivalent to the whole of the refrigerated space  available on all the Peninsular and Oriental vessels that could &#39;have called at Hobart during the period mentioned. </para>

Act came into operation has this service been unable to&#39; carry all the &#39;passengers offering, so that it cannot, either in law or in fact, be regarded as inadequate. Under the circumstances, there is no power to grant the permits asked for. </para>

                    <para>.- I desire to be informed of the reason for the extraordinary amendment proposed in the Act. Since electors have been given the right of absent voting, they should be free to exercise it; &#39;their opportunity to do so should not be merely permissive. One of the greatest privileges of our electoral system is the right of absent voting. It does away with much postal voting, and, compared with that method, is infinitely more to be desired. One of its advantages is that an elector need not worry about being within reach of his own subdivision on polling day. He knows that, under the law, he will be accorded the right of voting as an absent voter in any polling booth in the State in which he resides. Many an elector does not know, until the last moment, whether he will be within his own subdivision on polling day; by which time - in the case of his absence - if the law demanded that he should vote by post rather than as an absentee, it would be too late for him to secure postal voting papers. The Government now propose that an elector shall no longer retain the right to vote as an absentee, as a matter of unquestioned legal procedure, but that he may be accorded that privilege. Who will determine whether he may or may not be so permitted? I understand that the reason of the Government for proposing the change in the law is based upon trouble which arose out of the last election. At a certain polling place in the division of Ballarat there was an insufficient supply of absent voting papers. Surely, however, it is the duty of the electoral authorities to see that every polling place is furnished with adequate supplies. The Government should not stint money in securing full and true expression of the will of the people by medium of the ballot-box. Every possible facility under the law should be provided for electors to record their votes. Rather than that this permissive provision should be inserted in the Electoral Act, I would prefer to see the privilege of absent voting actually withdrawn. Electors would then know exactly where they stood. It would be an altogether unsatisfactory position if, when an elector entered a polling booth at the last moment on polling day and applied for the necessary papers to enable him to record his vote as an absentee, the presiding officer saw fit to withhold those papers. I ask the Government not to press this amendment of the law. </para>

                    <para>. - The reason for the amendment is that in the last general elections trouble arose owing to an insufficiency of absent voters&#39; ballot-papers at one polling . place in the Ballarat division. It was held during the hearing of the petition arising out of that election that there was an absolute duty on the part of the Commonwealth Electoral Department to provide voting facilities, under section 113 - that which is proposed to be amended - for any person who might make application ; provided, of course, that the elector was able to fulfil the conditions of the section. I ask honorable members to visualize the enormous area of the Commonwealth, and to think of the tremendous number of polling places which are scattered over the length and breadth of the land. It may again happen that at some particular polling booth there will not be sufficient absent voters&#39; ballot-papers to meet an unexpected demand ; whereupon the whole election might be invalidated. The object of the amendment is not to take away the right of absent voting; the Government realize as keenly as any honorable member the value of this method of vote-recording. Nor will there be curtailment of any of the facilities for voting, from the . administrative point of view. </para>

                <para>Mr.GROOM.-Probably, but the intention is that all &#39;Returning Officers shall be provided with the necessary absentee voting forms. This clause is not the result of Government policy, but is suggested by the Electoral Department. The working of the Act has shown that this defect exists, &#39;and, in &#39; accordance&#39; with the views -of the Department, we are seeking to remedy it, in order to obviate the possibility of a petition to invalidate an election owing to a purely technical non-compliance with the law. </para>

                    <para>.- The Minister&#39;s explanation of the need for this clause is about the weakest I have heard. A number of elections have been held under the existing law, and, so far as my memory serves, there has been only one . complaint in regard to this absentee voting . provision, and . that occurred in connexion with the Ballarat election in 1919. Three men went to a polling place just outside the boundaries of the Ballarat electorate, &#39; and asked to be . all owed to record absentee votes. . The evidence before <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Isaacs &#39;showed clearly that the Presiding Officer humbugged the -men, and, . although -they waited in -the . booth until 8 o&#39;clock, he would not supply . them, &#39;with absentee ballot-papers. It was not -necessary -that they should receive a ballot-paper with the names of &#34;Kerby&#34; . and &#39;&#39;McGrath&#34; printed on them.; the . law . would &#39;have been complied with had the Presiding Officer taken &#38; blank slip of . paper and written &#34;, Ballarat election &#34; and the names of the candidates upon it. But either because of his antiLabour prejudices or his indifference to his. duty he refused both -men an opportunity to vote. The Presiding Officer did not deny to the . Court that he had refused to allow the men to vote; it was clearly proved that their names were on the Ballarat roll, that their wives and families resided in Ballarat, and that they were merely temporary workers in the district -in which they . sought to vote. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Isaacs properly said that Parliament had expressed by its legislation the wish . that every adult should be given . an opportunity to record : his vote. The absentee voting system is much fairer than the postal vote, because the elector has to go into the polling booth- to record his vote. The carrying of this clause will practically abolish absentee voting. </para>

                        <para>- There is a risk of that happening in practice. One Presiding Officer may say that he is too busy to supply an absentee ballot-paper, whilst some other Presiding Officer will courteously issue the paper. Thus one man will get an absentee vote, whilst the other, though equally entitled to it, will be refused. I have had some experience of these cases. It was largely due to the refusal of a Presiding Officer to issue absentee ballot-papers that I was put out of this House for six months, and forced to incur the cost of an appeal to the High Court and a by-election. I do not wish to leave it in the discretion of any Presiding Officer tat say whether ; or not a person shall  be  allowed to. exercise: an absentee vote. . </para>

                        <para>. -  I omitted to explain, when moving the second reading, that the purpose of this clause is to disallow the use of- the cross in the marking of a ballot-paper. When Parliament originally adopted the system of indicating the vote  by  numerals, it was suggested that the- people might be confused by the new system, and that&#39; it would be well, in- an election for the- House of Representatives, where there are only two candidates to allow the voter to also put a cross opposite the name of the candidate he favoured. The operation, of two methods of marking is only leading to confusion-, as was declared in connexion with the disputed Ballarat election. Everybody is now conversant with the system of showing the preference by the marking of numerals, and this clause, therefore, proposes to strike out the optional use of the cross. </para>

                    <para>.- The Committee should understand clearly what votes will be formal in an election in which there are only two candidates. In the Ballarat election a number of ballot-papers were marked with the figure 1 opposite the name Kerby, and a cross opposite the name McGrath, and <inline font-style="italic">vice versa.</inline> Those votes were declared to be informal, and, I think, rightly so, because it was impossible to determine the intention of the voter. A number of other electors indicated their votes by marking 1 or a cross opposite the name of the preferred candidate, or struck out the name of the candidate for whom they did not wish to vote. We should understand whether such votes will be formal or informal. I think they should be allowed, because the intention of the voter is clearly indicated in all those methods. </para>

                        <para>- If a ballot-paper containing the names of two candidates is marked with a cross against  one name and the numeral 1 against the other, it is rightly treated as informal, but we should not, because of such informalities as that, take away the privilege that the electors now enjoy* We should treat as formal, so far as that is possible, every ballot-paper in regard to which the intention of the voter is ascertainable by the application of common sense; we should not make ballot-papers informal for mere technical reasons. Whenever the intention of the elector is discernible, his ballot-paper should be treated as formal. </para>

                        <para>- Of course, no one can read another person&#39;s mind, and there will always be informalities. Similarly we cannot remedy mistakes such as are made when a voter numbers his ballot-paper in an order which* does not express his true preference. We can only take the marking on a ballot-paper as it stands, and if it clearly indicates a choice on the part of the voter the paper should be treated as formal. Where there are only two candidates standing, there is no need to mark the order of preference by using the numerals 1 and 2. To declare informal a ballot-paper which clearly indicates the choice of the voter is to rob a voter of his franchise. </para>

                    <para>. -  I would remind the Committee what a narrow right this marking with a cross is. The Act provides that in an election for the House of Representatives at which there are not more than two candidates, the voter&#39;s preference shall be deemed to be sufficiently indicated by a mark showing his first preference, and that the placing of a cross in the square opposite the name of one candidate shall be deemed to indicate that that candidate is the voter&#39;s first preference. It is only in the case in which there are not more than two candidates that&#39; the voters have the option of using a cross or the figure 1. The effect of this option has been to make many votes informal, and thus to deprive many voters of the franchise. </para>

                    <para>I am impelled by some of the ballot-papers I have seen to observe that it is possible that some of the voters have been misled as to the use of a cross. When they have placed a 1 for one candidate, and a cross for the other, it might be conjectured that they thought that they were simply crossing out and voting against the other candidate. That being only conjecture, I am not entitled to act on it in deciding this case. But the possibility might be guarded against for the future. It is noticeable that, although section 133 provides for a cross in substitution of the figure 1 in the cases mentioned, there is no reference to that in the ballot-paper, Form F in the schedule.. Perhaps some means of informing electors of the law as to the use of a cross may be desirable. </para>

                    <para>.- The effect of the amendment would be to rob some voters of the franchise. At the present time, when there are only two candidates standing, a cross placed in the square opposite the name of one of them makes a ballot-paper valid, but, under the law as it is proposed to amend it, such a ballot-paper would .be invalid. The Minister holds that confusion is caused by permitting two methods of marking ballot-papers, but I do not think that he is right, because the electors are not instructed that they may use either of two methods. The provision which it is proposed to amend is a. provision governing only the counting of ballot-papers. </para>

                        <para>- Only by those who have made a close study of the Act. &#39; I cannot imagine that any one would direct electors to mark their ballot-papers with a cross. Even if the amendment were carried, there would still remain an inconsistency in the method of marking: ballot-papers, because where there are only two candidates the elector is allowed to indicate his preference by placing the numeral 1 opposite the name of the candidate for whom he wishes to vote, and leaving the other name unmarked; whereas, if there are three candidates, he must mark all three names in the order of his preference - 1, 2, and 3. This inconsistency has led some voters to think that it is sufficient, where there are three candidates, to set the figures 1 and 2 against their first and second choice, leaving the third name unmarked. Such ballot-papers are informal, though they should, I think, be counted, because they clearly indicate the intention of the voter. Confusion also arises because where there are several candidates the elector is instructed to mark his first preference with the figure 1 and his following preferences with the figures 2, 3, 4,  and. so; on. As the figure 1 is printed in smaller and lighter type than the other figures, a number of voters have marked their ballot-papers 2, 3, 4, and so on, without using the figure 1 to indicate their first preference. In the Yarra by election a number of ballot-papers were, according to the Returning Officer; thus rendered informal. The intention is to compel the electors to express their preference, and surely it is fair where a cross indicates the first preference of the voter in a casein which there are not more than two candidates to treat the ballot-paper as formal. There are many organizations an which people still vote by using the cross. </para>

                <para>Mr.SCULLIN. - I would not allow the use of a cross where there are more than two candidates. In the South Australian State elections the cross is still in use. If the people of South Australia are accustomed to indicate their first preference by the use of the cross in State elections, they are likely to use it in Federal elections, and it would be hard to disfranchise them for doing so, particularly when nothing would be gained by insisting on the use of the figure 1. The honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wise)</inline> says that it would be a disadvantage to have two systems of voting - one for the House of Representatives and one for the Senate ; but we already distinguish between ballot-papers with two names and ballot-papers with more than two names. We should follow the broad principle that wherever there is no ambiguity as to the clear intention of. the voter the vote should be allowed. Nothing should prevent the clear intention of the elector being carried out. </para>

                    <para>. -I would be very loath indeed to deprive any elector of his right to have his vote recorded where his intention is perfectly clear ; but the number of informal votes at every election is astonishing, and; we shall never obviate the trouble in. this regard until we have uniformity in the electoral laws of Australia-.. Unfortunately, some States adopt one. method of expressing voters&#39; preferences, while: local bodies in those States adopt another- system, and the Federal method differs from either. We shall never educate the electors to that standard which will allow them to record their votes clearly until we have greater uniformity. The amendment now sought to be inserted in the Bill is justified for that reason. We cannot control the electoral laws of the States or the voting systems adopted by local bodies&#39; in the States, but we can have uniformity in our own voting system. The honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> has shown that where there are threes candidates, and the third preference is not expressed on the ballot-paper, the vote is informal. The Attorney General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> has pointed out that where there are two candidates the ballot-paper is formal if the second preference is not shown: The only way out of the difficulty is to make it compulsory that the voter should indicate his order of preference right through, whether there are only two candidates or more . The only means by which we can obviate informal votes is by educating the electors to observe one system only. While we are so jealous of the secrecy of the ballot we must continue to. have informal votes, but those are  recorded mostly by electors who are voting, at a Federal election for the first time. </para>

                <para>Mr.PARKER MOLONEY. - Yes. It has gone all over Australia that this method of voting is permissible, and people will go to the next election believing that it still exists, only to &#39;find themselves disfranchised. In past years, the method of voting was to put a cross opposite the candidate&#39;s name, but now the voters are to be asked to insert figures instead of a cross. At every election there is a. new system of voting.It is time we settled down to some recognised method. </para>

                        <para>- I think those are exceptions to the rule. The&#39; marking of a cross has been the method in the past, and the many, informal votes are due to the fact that ; the system has been so frequently (altered.

                    <para>.- The electoral method ought to be such as to give the fullest and freest expression of the will of the people. The argument put forward that where there are only two candidates, and where one of these only is marked, the marking should be taken as an indication of the voter&#39;s intention, is, in my opinion, a correct one. Of course, where there are more than two candidates, it is essential&#39;thatnumbers should be marked, but it by no means follows that, in the case of only two candidates, -the marking&#39; of numbers is necessary. If an elector has grown up under the old system of &#39;making across,I see no reason why we should now put him ina position where he is likely to cast an informal vote. &#39;The proposed amendment of the Act appears to me a restriction of that freedom which the people should have to express their desire, and will lead &#39;to more confusion in a system already confused enough. &#39;There have been so many different systems of marking ballot-papers that it is very difficult for some people to know quite what to do. It is our place to make voting as simple as possible, and I hope the Minister (Mr.Groom) will not adhere to the proposed amendment, which would merely have the effect of depriving a number of honest citizen s of the opportunity to express their choice.. Of course, the opportunity to express their choice is there, but in practice there are many thousand informal votes, a great number of which are due to confusion in the minds of the electors as to how to mark the papers. It has been laid down by Returning Officers, : over and over again, that, so long as voting paper clearly indicates theelector&#39;spreference, it should stand, and I see no reason for departing from that view. </para>

                <para>Mr.CONSIDINE (Barrier) &#91;5.10&#93;.- I join with other honorable members in their efforts to persuade the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)not</inline> to make it more difficult than it is at present for an elector to indicate his choice. There is; no doubt about the confusion in the minds of a great number of electors as to the preferential system. Last election was the only experience we have had of the system for this Parliament, and I know that about 300 votes which were cast for me were declared informal, owing to confusion on the part of. the electors as to how the numerals should be marked. </para>

                    <para>- There were three, and I am merely pointing out that at least 300 people were under the impression that if they marked numerals opposite candidates other than myself, they would be giving some support to those candidates, and, therefore, they marked no numerals opposite their names, simply putting No. 1 opposite mine. &#34;We all know how difficult it is, in view of the many changes in the electoral system, to remove the confusion in the minds of electors as to the correct method of marking papers. A voting &#187;paper ought to be accepted so long as it clearly indicates the intention of the elector, whether the elector makes a cross, strikes out the names of the candidates he does not favour, or puts a cross or a numeral in front of the candidate he does favour. </para>

                        <para>- I candidly admit that in the case of three candidates we cannot have preferential voting without a system of indicating the preferences, but I see no necessity for placing obstacles in the way of electors when there are only two candidates. Why make any change from the system carried out at the last election ? This continual tinkering with the methods of election only creates, rightly or wrongly, an impression that the particular Government which is responsible for it is deliberately trying to confuse the electors. </para>

                    <para>.- I urge the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> to reconsider his intention to proceed with this amendment. Although the amendment might make the Act uniform, the fact remains that the State and municipal elections are conducted with a different system of marking. If there were, as I hope there will be before long, a common electoral authority throughout the Commonwealth, I would heartily support the change, but to adopt the amendment under present circumstances would disfranchise many people because of the different systems in use. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not approve of disturbing a vote where a voter&#39;s intention is clear, but we have heard a good deal of the confusion which exists owing largely to the fact that one of two systems of voting may be used. At present it is the law that a cross may be used where there are only two candidates, and the electors, although they know this, unfortunately use the cross where there are more than two candidates. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> and the Federal authorities claim that this confusion in the minds of the electors would be dispelled if all voters had to put their votes in numerical order. If the law strictly provided that the marking of ballot-papers with crosses would render those papers informal, more valid votes would probably be cast than if electors were still permitted to make a cross. I presume that where there are only two candidates for one seat, if the name of one is erased, and there is no other mark on the ballot-paper, the vote will be regarded as valid. </para>

                        <para>- I understand that the High Court ruled, in the case arising out of the last Ballarat election, that if there are only two candidates for one seat, and one name is struck out, and there is no other mark upon the ballot-paper, the vote should be accepted as valid for the reason that the ballot-paper clearly indicates that the elector intended to vote for the candidate whose name had not been struck out. It has always been the practice of Returning Officers to accept ballot-papers in respect of which the intentions of electors are clear. Electors are now aware that, in certain cases, they may mark their ballot-papers with a cross. However, in many instances, ballot-papers are wrongly marked with a cross; for example, in respect of elections where more than two candidates are seeking to secure one seat. The consequence is that many votes are informal, Upon first examining this clause I was not impressed with the Government&#39;s proposal, but I perceive that unless electors are informed that they may not in any circumstances mark their ballot-papers with a cross, numerous invalid votes will be cast. For that reason I shall support the Government&#39;s proposal. </para>

The bulk of the people are used to a certain method of voting. &#34;Very many electors are accustomed to mark their ballot-papers with a cross. The public generally do not attend political meetings; that applies particularly to country residents. Their habit is to mark their papers with a cross before the name of the candidate whom they favour. If that method of voting is dome away with, informal votes will grow enormously in volume.

                        <para>-  His  vote would be informal. Electors have been trained to mark their papers with a cross. That is the principle in vogue in South Australia, and in many municipalities. If all the State systems of voting were made uniform with that of the Commonwealth, there would be fewer mistakes, and less informal votes would be cast. The Government should not seek to interfere with the existing method. At present, there is no doubt. that if an elector marks the name of one of two candidates with a cross his vote is accepted by the Returning Officer. </para>

                    <para>. - The innovation proposed by the Government is of a somewhat serious character, particularly since it is sought to be introduced on the eve of a general election. We are about to tell the people that if they vote as they have done at previous elections their papers will be regarded as informal. It is all very well&#39; to say that we should educate the electors. Less than 10 per cent. of them attend election meetings. At the last election the public understood that, in  respect  of any division where there were only two candidates for one seat, their ballot-papers would be formal if they placed a cross in front of the name of the candidate whom they favoured. I am confident that if a dispute should arise over the forthcoming elections, the Court would support the decision given in the Ballarat dispute, when it was properly held that where the intention of the voter was clearly indicated his ballot-paper should be regarded as valid. The Judge thus interpreted the common-sense view, if not the strict letter, of the law. If we now decide that the old system may no longer be employed,  informal  votes will, number thousands more than, would, otherwise be the case. One reason . why I advocated postal voting was that I held that every facility should be given to electors. The Government now propose to withdraw a facility. </para>

                        <para>- I think not. The system of voting in Tasmania is taught children upon school blackboards. Although some honorable members remarked yesterday that the proportional voting system, if adopted throughout the Commonwealth, would involve an enormous increase of informal votes, I would point out that the percentage of these is lower in Tasmania than in any of the other States. Rightly or wrongly, we have been allowing electors, when there are only two candidates, to express their preference either by marking a cross as is done in connexion with State elections in South Australia, or by marking No. 1 opposite the name of the favoured candidate.This clause will &#39;not produce uniformity. What is the use of honorable members saying that they want uniformity in the method of voting for the House of Representatives and the Senate when they have agreed to a system of groupingSenate candidates according to their party adherence, and candidates for the House of Representatives in alphabetical order? I. prophesy that this&#39;, differentiation will lead to greater confusion than will the continuance of the cross as an alternative method to the numeral for signifying the intention of the elector. </para>

                        <para>- If there are five or six candidates, representing two or three parties, for a seat in the House of Representatives, there is just as much reason for grouping them- according- to parties as. there is for. grouping Senate candidates in that way. I know one electorate in which probably five or six candidates, representing at least three parties, will nominate-. The present system of marking a cross against the preferred candidate has obtained&#39; for years without creating any serious disadvantage. The people have been educated in the belief that they can express their preference by a cross or by a numeral. Now, on the eve of an election, they are to be told that the use of the cross will render their votes informal. </para>

                        <para>-A vote should be accepted as formal if the intention of the elector is clearly indicated. In this attempt to secure uniformity - which is impossible-, because of the recent adoption of the party grouping system for Senate elections - there will be a very great risk of depriving a considerable number of electors of their votes. Already there, is difficulty in inducing people to go to the poll. In the cities electors will not vote at all unless motor cars are sent to their homes. The number of non-voters and informal votes are sufficiently large already, and this clause will deliberately increase&#39; the number of the latter. We are asked to pay too great a price for so-called uniformity. </para>

                    <para>.Anything I can do to enforce- uniformity in the method of voting throughout the Commonwealth I shall do. At the present time Tasmania has the preferential and proportional systems, and- the voter indicates his preference by writing the numerals 1, 2, 3, &#38;c. Victoria and Western Australia also have the preferential system. New South Wales operates the preferential and proportional representation systems, whilst Queensland  has  an optional system. South Australia is the only State in. which, the voter may indicate his preference only by marking, a cross opposite the name of the candidate. The sooner that State is brought into line with the other States the better. I look forward. &#39;to. the time  when all elections, Federal, State, and municipal, will be conducted on the preferential and proportional systems. Some honorable members have stressed the risk, of depriving people of their votes. Any person who cannot understand a ballot-paper, or the explanatory cards that are issued by the candidates, is not enticed, to have a vote. </para>

                <para>In a sparsely populated country like Australia, those who live in the rural districts, and especially those far away in the back-blocks, are under great disadvantages as compared with the residents of the cities. Among these disadvantages is the difficulty of recording their votes. An elector residing in a city electoral division can get easily to a polling booth by paying twopence for a tram ride, or he may be taken there in a motor car, but the case of the country elector is very different. The gathering together of population in the cities is likely to be a source of weakness to Australia. The disproportion of city and country population is apparent in every State of the Commonwealth, and even in Tasmania, but it is especially noticeable -in New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. In some of the States more than half the population resides in the capitals. This gives city residents an enormous preponderance of political power, and I would therefore desire to have it enacted that in future electoral redistributions an attempt shall be made to equalize the political power of the city and country electors by making a difference of at least one-fifth between the city and country divisional quotas. Although part of my own electorate is suburban, I represent a country area also, and I am well acquainted with the disabilities of country residents, whether they be workers or employers. The city worker is an aristocrat compared with the country worker. In many parts of Tasmania, during more than half the year, the timber-getters are wet through with the first blow of their axe on a tree, and remain wet all day, and other country workers suffer similar discomforts, besides being enormously handicapped in many ways. It is not right, nor in the interests of Australia, that the residents in the cities should have so much political power. But the only way in which we can equalize the political powers of city and country constituencies is to make the quota for country electorates 20 or 25 per cent, lower than that for city electorates. It will be for the Electoral Commissioners to decide which are metropolitan and which are rural electorates. </para>

                    <para>.- I support the. amendment submitted by the honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mcwilliams)</inline> on behalf of the honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory).</inline> If the Committee takes the matter into reasonable consideration, it will see the soundness of the claim that the Distribution Commissioners must discriminate in favour of rural districts as against metropolitan areas to the extent of giving them a quota, margin of 20 or 25 per cent. less. It is physically impossible for the representative of a vast area of country to consult the wishes of his constituents in the way that the member representing a congested metropolitan area is able to do. The people the amendment is sought to benefit are those whose important function it is to develop Australia,, and as we are asking immigrants to come here and assist in that task, wa ought to see that their requirements are fairly represented in this House. I would rather represent 40,000 in a metropolitan constituency than 30,000 persons distributed over my own electorate. </para>

                        <para>- The Perth and Fremantle electorates are metropolitan districts, and the representative of either division can do all his electioneering business, and attend to the whole of his constituents&#39; requirements, by making use of the train service, whereas I am obliged to travel  3,000  miles to visit the townships in my electorate. I have to keep in constant communication with the varied interests of these numerous townships. The needs of country districts in the matter of telephone communication differ widely from those of metropolitan areas. The labouring people in rural districts cannot organize or attend to their needs as can be done by the workers in metropolitan areas. Nor can their member represent their varied needs as they would wish them, to be made known. To do ordinary justice, discrimination should be shown  in  the arrangement of electoral boundaries to the extent indicated in the amendment.  In  fact, those who framed the Constitution really had in their minds the need for. this.  I  trust that the Attorney General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom,)</inline> will give the amendment serious Consideration, and see his way clear to accept it. </para>

                    <para>. -  I cannot see my way clear to accept the amendment. It attempts to fix by Statute an arbitrary dividing line between country and city, as if there are conflicting interests between the two, whereas they both have interests in common. It also seeks to lay down the very undesirable principle of applying an arbitrary statutory limit to the Commonwealth as a whole, quite oblivious of the varying geographical conditions in the States. For instance, the conditions in Western Australia and Queensland differ considerably from those in Victoria. The provision already laid down in the Act, which allows a margin of  20  per cent., is preferable. The Distribution Commissioners have already exercised their discretion in this regard in their endeavour to frame constituencies to meet the varying conditions to which I have just referred. </para>

                        <para>- They have done it ir connexion with the New South Wales electorates, and they also exercised the discretion allowed to them under the Act when they were drawing up their second Victorian distribution. In any case,  if  Parliament considers that the Commissioners have erred in the exercise of their discretion, it has the right  of  rejecting their distribution. In fact, it has already exercised that right. However, the main point is that, in a vast continent, with so many varying conditions, a considerable amount of elasticity must be allowed to the Distribution Commissioners, whereas the amendment would make the rule too rigid. Under the law as it now stands, in making any proposed distribution of a State into divisions, the Distribution Commissioners are obliged to give due consideration to community or diversity of interests, means of communication, physical features, existing boundaries of divisions  4ind  subdivisions, and State electoral boundaries; and they are empowered to depart from the quota to the extent of one-fifth more or one-fifth less. That is to say, they are allowed a margin of <inline font-style="italic">30</inline> per cent., whereas the amendment proposes, in an arbitrary fashion, that the Commissioners shall fix the average quota of electors in country districts at from  20  per cent, to  25  per cent, less than the average quota for metropolitan districts, permitting no elasticity to meet the varying conditions in the States.  <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. PROWSE</inline> - But the Commissioners have not been seised with the importance of the provision which gives them the right to depart from the quota. </para>

                    <para>.- In discussing this matter we should remember what the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> said when quite recently the redistribution of the Victorian electorates was under consideration. Because the Act, as it stands, is capable of being read in a variety of ways, the Distribution Commissioners in the various States have taken a different view of their responsibilities and duties, and, as a. result, we find that what is asked to be done by the amendment was actually carried out by the Commissioners in New South Wales, and, to some extent, also in Queensland, Western Australia, and South Australia, whereas, in Victoria, the Commissioners took up the attitude that it was not possible for them to do just as they pleased in this connexion. Community or diversity of interests, means of communication,, physical features, existing boundaries of divisions  and subdivisions bad no relationship whatever to the electoral boundaries in their scheme of distribution. </para>

Fortunately this House expressed a very strong opinion upon the matter, and this defect was remedied in the Commissioners&#39; second proposals. </para>

                        <para>- It :is the function of this Parliament to lay down the principle on which it expects a distribution to be carried out, and if there is evidence that the Commissioners in one State, have followed lines different from those adopted in other States, surely it is the proper function of Parliament to decide the exact verbiage that should be used in making its meaning absolutely clear. It was only after &#39;honorable members in this House had expressed their views upon the Victorian distribution that the Commissioners&#39; proposals were taken back and carried out on the lines suggested, which the Attorney-General now says are expressly provided for in this section of the Act. If the Minister can suggest any means by which the expressed intention of &#39;Parliament can be carried into&#39; effect in every State in the case of a redistribution, the amendment could be withdrawn, but otherwise I think it should be carried to a vote, because the section -of &#39; the Act does not1 really carry the margin as far as it is possible to do according to the interpretation placed upon the provision by the New South Wales Distribution Commissioners. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not propose to support the amendment- I quite well remember the discussion that took place upon the inequalities of the Victorian distributions. It was pointed out as being rather curious and open to criticism that the electorate which geographically was the largest in Victoria should also have the largest quota of electors. I supported the proposal while it enabled the Commissioners to exercise the discretion they have under the Act, if they so desired, in favour df country districts in particular instances, but T do not propose to &#39;lay down as a principle any infraction of the &#34;much older and sounder principle of  one-vote-one--  value. </para>

There &#39;were very special reasons, and there was no other method of having the Northern Territory effectively represented in, this&#39; Chamber. I was careful to point out, however, &#39;that I quite realized the very strong objection that could be raised on the &#39;ground that we were violating&#39; -the  principle  of one vote one value, and that it &#39;was a just criticism that &#39;we were &#39; proposing to allow a representative to come into&#39; this chamber, who spoke for 1*700 or 1,800 voters, whereas other representatives &#62; spoke for varying numbers over 40,000. , I admitted that that was an inequality, but I .said, and I repeat, that we had to choose the lesser of two evils, and. the . greater evil&#39; was to altogether disfranchise those persons. Inequality is wrong-, but total disfranchisement is the greater wrong, and I. pressed the argument to the extent of .saying that the enfranchisement was useless if it did not give the representative the right to vote. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member&#39;s case is a definite and considered attack on the principle of one-vote-one-value, and I shall not go one inch beyond that measure of flexibility which at present exists in the Act and the Constitution and enables- the Distributing Commissioners to vary the quota to the extent of one-fifth on principles that are laid down in the Act. That does not mean that the Commissioners are invited to say that country districts shall, have greater representation than city interests that principle is not affirmed for a- moment. But there is a give and take permissible1 to the Commissioners on the ground of community of interests, and a number of other grounds, which they are entitled to consider. They are <inline font-style="italic">not</inline> entitled, however, to accept the principle* that we are decentralizing agents, . and entitled to say tha tj because a district is. j country district, it is, therefore, entitled to more representation in Parliament, than is a metropolitan district. I was one who held that- there? was a curious- anomaly, m that the Commissioners had used their discretion in a way which resulted in a large tract of country having. a very large number of electors, by comparison with others. It was the view of some of us that the flexible provisions- of the Act might well have been employed to make the position otherwise. But the point that the honorable member now wishes to make is something quite different, and is objectionable from our point of view. We believe in the principle of one-vote-one-value. Residents in the city have their advantages and their disadvantages. I do- not accept the view that the people of the country cannot record, their votes. They have the advantages of country life, which they go to the country to- enjoy, and. they have their facilities of communication. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for Batman (Mr: Brennan) has made- much of the principle of one- vote-one-value ; but really what is at the bottom of the idea is to furnish an equal value of the franchise to each individual. No- one can reasonably claim that at present the person living in a distant country electorate has the same facilities for recording his- vote as has; a person in town. The aim is, as far1 as possible, to get an equality of value in the franchise. The proposal this afternoon is not a danger from that: point of view, for it. goes no further than does the present Act. </para>

                        <para>- It does not go so far;, but it does lay down definitely what is not, perhaps, correct in theory, according to the honorable member for Batman, but is certainly found correct in practice. Any one who has lived, in the country and in. the city knows, whether ho admits it or. not, that the man in the country, or the woman, particularly, has not. anything like the same opportunities for recording the vote as has the man or woman in town. All that we are asking is that the value of the franchise in each case shall be made as nearly equal as possible. If a man is given a -thing he cannot use it is of little value, and we wish to make the franchise of equal value to every individual. The votes will still remain at equal value - we do not propose to interfere in any way with the value- of the vote, for that is a question which is settled for good and all. We have- agreed that one-vote-one-value is the correct idea, and in common honesty we wish to make the franchise of equal value to every man and woman in Australia. That is all the amendment proposes. If honorable members will look at the amendment from a practical stand-point, instead of harping on the- theoretical side, they will see that, the proposal is abundantly justified. </para>

                    <para>.- I am opposed to the proposed- new clause of the honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory).</inline> It is wrong in principle. The honorable member for Robertson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fleming)</inline> rather- cleverly endeavoured to prove that there was some great principle involved in it; but such is not the case. The basic principles of the Act are, one adult one vote. and one-vote-one-value. The Act is elastic in the matter of its provision respecting the numbers of electors in a division. The suggested new section would withdraw that elasticity, and make the Act rigid. The honorable member for Robertson, in endeavouring to counter the argument respecting the principle of one-vote-one-value, held that the principle underlying the proposal of the honorable member for Dampier was that it sought to make votes of equal value. </para>

                        <para>- No one will dispute that greater facilities are provided for voting in metropolitan areas than in country divisions. But if the matter of difficulty in getting to the poll is to be taken into consideration, it would be logically necessary to instruct the Commissioners, further, to provide a smaller number of electors in Gippsland, for example, than in Corio; for the latter division has far greater facilities for travel. If areas are to be consulted it would be necessary to give to divisions in Queensland and Western Australia ten times fewer electors than to those in Victoria. The honorable member for Robertson said that, under existing facilities for voting, electors in some parts of the country are actually unable to attend a polling booth in order to record their votes. If the proposal under review is embraced in the Act the votes of those people will be given no greater value than they possess to-day. That is to say, they are of no value whatever, since they are not recorded. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member said that there were many people who were unable on polling day to record their votes. How can their case be met by instructing the Commissioners to decrease the numbers of electors in country divisions? And in what manner should the Commissioners be instructed in respect of such electorates as Corio, Ballarat, and Bendigo? Are they to be regarded as country, or as city electorates? There are some country divisions in which the facilities for voting over the greater part of their area, at any rate, are similar to those provided in metropolitan divisions. Honorable members on this side have said that where any degree of elasticity may be observed it should be in favour of country divisions; and that, of course, has been recently availed of. However, to make it mandatory that country electorates shall be smaller numerically than metropolitan is vicious in principle, and cannot be logically applied. </para>

                <para>My desire is that a vote of the Committee shall be taken on the &#39;definite principle of proportional representation for the Senate. The vote which has already been recorded in that direction may be regarded as a test, perhaps; but it was in respect of a clause which really dealt with the matter of deposits. To enable the principle of proportional representation in the Senate to be specifically voted upon by honorable members, and so that it shall be duly recorded in its proper light, I am seeking the omission from the Act of the present provisions for voting for Senate- candidates, and -the inclusion of the new sub-sections which I have just read. </para>

                <para class="block">The reason for my amendment is that the measure does not provide &#39;for a most important matter, namely, the control of selection ballots by party organizations. I shall submit a case for searching public inquiry, and a recasting of the law. </para>
                <para>Tammany&#39;s pollution of representative government. The influx of new Labour (members is controlled in New South Wales by the junta at Macdonell House. Sitting members live in perpetual terror of the tyranny of this Tammany junta The procedure is that nominations are invited, and they are subject to indorsement by the Tammany junta at its unfettered discretion. Then comes the party selection. The whole machinery for the selection of these candidates in <inline font-style="italic">&#34;New</inline> South Wales is also at the unfettered discretion of this corrupt junta at Macdonell House. The powerful machinery of the .Australian Workers Union Central Branch, its funds, and its organizers are utilized, together with the corrupt practices of hired mercenaries, hangers-on, and professional  impersonators.  The whole of this machinery is operated for the purpose of continuously intimidating the public men of the Labour movement. It is almost an impossibility for any Labour member in. New South Wales to obtain a selection in defiance of the corrupt crowd in control at Macdonell House. The enforced silence of Labour&#39;s public men in New South Wales in the presence of extensive and thinly veiled criminality is their unspoken acknowledgment of their fear of the power of this junta. </para>
                <para>The Industrial Section. One of the first acts of the Bailey-Lambert coterie, which controls the central branch of the Australian Workers Union, was to organize a star chamber in Sydney, misnamed the industrial section, an unconstitutional body, which had no standing or authority under the constitution and rules of the Australian Labour party, and which held the undated resignations of the members of the Central Executive. Before it the Central Executive was carpeted weekly, and had to present their reports and take their instructions. This corrupt assembly set about undermining sitting Labour members of Parliament, and engineering its own members into their places. In 1917 the  President  of this so-called industrial section was a man named Samuel Rosa, and the secretary, John Mauritius Power, now a member of the Legislative Council, and  president  of the Macdonell House Australian Labour party in New South Wales. Those two men endeavoured to capture  the Federal seats of East Sydney and West Sydney in circumstances of unparalleled corruption and rottenness, at that time unprecedented in the Labour movement of New South Wales. The Labour movement had not then become accustomed to these corrupt practices. The selection of Rosa was upset, and Con Wallace, whose name was third on the ballot, was given the selection for West Sydney. </para>
                <para>East Sydney, 1917. Power was the man who defeated John West, the sitting member for East&#39; Sydney, for the selection by the corrupt use of the Australian Workers Union votes in the control of Maltese, who were unable to speak English, and were living in boarding-houses in East Sydney. As I pointed out on a previous occasion  in  this House, in answer to an interjection by the honorable member, I was instrumental in having this East Sydney selection upset, and saving John West&#39;s political life. We brought the Maltese priest to the Australian Labour party executive. He acted as interpreter for the other Maltese, who could not speak English, and it was found that one of Power&#39;s agents, the present presiding genius of this Tammany junta, a <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Andrews,</inline> had gone to <inline font-style="italic">Hie Worker</inline> office and bought a number of copies of <inline font-style="italic">The Worker,</inline> in which the official ballot-paper was printed. She had cut out these ballot-papers, and by some means had induced the Maltese, who had Australian Workers Union tickets, to detach the voting slips. She also got them to sign their names on the flaps of envelopes, and marking the ballot-papers herself in favour of Power, they were sent in and counted as postal votes. In that way John Power defeated John West at the Labour selection for East Sydney in 1917. It is fitting that this gentleman, who started his career officially in the Labour movement with a corrupt selection ballot, should be, at this time, when Tammany is at its height, and when no effort is being made to cloak the corruption which stalks abroad unashamed, the  chairman  and presiding genius of this rotten corporation. </para>

                <para>The 1919 Namoi Selection. In this case the selection was a fraud. It was proved at the 1920 Australian Workers Union Convention that 250 faked Australian Workers Union voting slips were used. A number of these were locked away in the head-office safe of the Australian Workers Union. Convention ordered a criminal investigation/ Although this matter was dealt with in open conference, <inline font-style="italic">The Worker</inline> newspaper and the official report of the Australian Workers Union were censored so that the rank and file of the movement throughout Australia should not know the rottenness that was going on per medium of the machinery of their organization. The forged slips disappeared from the safe of the head office of the Australian Workers Union. These facts prove the complicity of high officials in the Australian Workers Union, as well as editor Boote, with corruption in the selection ballots. </para>
                <para>The 1919 Oxley Selection. In this case the local branches selected a young schoolmaster named R. H. Lamb, but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fitzgerald,</inline> now member of the Legislative Assembly, who was then secretary of the Timber Workers Union in Sydney, by a manipulation of faked union votes,  overrode the selection of the genuine Australian Labour party branches throughout the electorate. The Oxley electorate covers 14,000 square miles of territory, and it was alleged that 750 members of the Timber Workers Union were scattered over that huge area, yet no fewer than 743 votes were recorded in favour of Fitzgerald, and the young schoolmaster, who had spent years in organizing the Labour movement in the electorate, was turned down. Fitzgerald was returned to Parliament ; but it transpired afterwards that there were only 150 members of the Timber Workers Union in the electorate. </para>
                <para>The 1919 Goulburn Selection. This Labour selection by the branches in the country selection was manipulated to provide a seat in Parliament for Tam-, many boss Bailey. . At the time I was not acquainted with Bailey and his methods, having only recently met him. Tom Arthur, one of Bailey&#39;s henchmen, who was in Bailey&#39;s office, was appointed returning- officer in Sydney to control the selection for this country seat. He used Bailey&#39;s office for the purpose. P. C. Evans, then general secretary of the movement, won the selection; but sufficient corrupt Australian Workers Union votes were used after the returns were in to give the selection to Bailey. In this case I have a signed statement from Dick McDonald, an old - Australian Workers Union organizer, to the effect that Bailey put in 300 crook votes. Another statement from W. Minter, a prominent member of the Clerks Union, is as follows : - . </para>

                    pointed to packages of Australian Workers Union postal votes which had been got ready to be admitted to the -ballot, but which had not been required, and had not been used.

                    who was present, said to Buckland, &#34;You are a damn fool. You are practically telling these men that .we did it.&#34; Buckland said, &#34; You know we did. You know perfectly well. Look at all these voting papers left over that we had no occasion to use.&#34; Bailey swore at Buckland, and wheeled on his heel and walked out of the office.

                <para>This matter came before the Australian Workers Union convention in 1920. A committee was appointed, and went to the Australian Labour party&#39;s office to obtain these ballot-papers -so that the Australian Workers Union convention might make a scrutiny. The selection ballot had only  just  been taken, but it was found that the ballot-papers had again disappeared. The general secretary, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carey,</inline> professed surprise, but admitted to several persons, myself included, that he had spirited the ballot-papers away, and intended to hold them as a weapon  over Bailey&#39;s head should Bailey try to put &#34; the boot in &#34; at any time. </para>

                <para>West Sydney Federal Labour Selection 1921. It will be remembered that Con. Wallace stood down to enable T. J. Ryan to contest this seat. Upon the unfortunate death of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryan,</inline> and in view of the straitened circumstances of Con. Wallace, due to his sacrifice, had there been any humanitarian spirit of Labour in evidence, he would have been given the Labour selection unopposed. But <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lambert,</inline> who was then the paid secretary of &#39;the .central branch of the Australian Workers Union, a member of the Board of Health at &#163;2 per week, and Lord Mayor of Sydney, with .&#163;1,500 a year as an allowance, wanted the seat. Con. Wallace was .defeated in ,a corrupt selection, and died almost immediately afterwards. The following statement is made by :a member of the Municipal Employees Union : - &#34; There were ten motor cars engaged for the &#39;return of W. H. Lambert .as candidate- for West .Sydney selection. One car was engaged running from Bart. Stokes&#39; hotel in Chalmers-street. The organizer for this end was Alderman Stokes. They&#39; were running on wharf labourers&#39; tickets and water and sewerage pence cards. &#34;Another car was plying in charge of J. Brennan, employed .in the ashpit at the City Council power-house, bringing men who did not live in the electorate and impersonating people whose names were on the West Sydneyroll. &#34; At Harris-street,, Pyrmont, Alderman Holdsworth was directing persons who were not enrolled how to obtain a vote. &#34; In Harris-street, &#34; Pyrmont-Denison &#34; at MacArthur-street, Alderman Ryan had a team of impersonators, mostly employees of the City Council. &#34;A&#39; car was running from Woolloomooloo in charge of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cody,</inline> with impersonators. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. M.</inline> Ma-lone,,, a Labour League secretary, &#39; had one of .the tally clerks from the &#39;Wheat. .Board writing union tickets - timber workers, wharf labourers and &#39;Water and Sewerage Board union cards - and also supplying names of persons in, the league who &#39;would not be in the district &#39;to- vote. &#34; At the &#39;Coronation Hotel, opposite the Sydney Town. Hall, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tyrell</inline> was present with a number of wharf labourers&#39; pence cards, written out in &#39;the names of various people living in this -part of the electorate, also water and  sewerage  tickets  written out with .a &#39;piece of tape attached;, giving the. name -and &#39;address of .the person to : be impersonated. &#34; Plying all .round was Alderman Davoren with a pair of ponies, and a sociable with, other persons personating voters at various booths. &#34;There were &#39;also large numbers of Belmore voters who had no idea they had a vote. Persons were- voting for&#39; them under -Rule 6 on faked&#39; pence cards. &#39;These votes were polled at MacArthur-street and Allan-street polling booths. &#34; At the Phillip League booth.

This is the famous selection, in which Gregory McGirr was a. candidate. He. had as a colleague W. Teen, one of  the I.W.W.  prisoners recently released from gaol. In the following, statement Joe Warner referred to is the professional leader of the unemployed. Messrs.

T am a member of the United Labourers Union, and well known to all the officers of the union. On Saturday* 4th February.. 1922, I was at the Trades Hall looking for work, when I met Joe Warner. He said, &#39;Go into room 23, there is something doing. Get in with them.&#39; I went into room 23, and found myself one- of about forty men. I do not know the name3 of the men, but I know ten or twelve by sight, and could  pick  them out. A man named: Taylor, who, 1 think, works in the office of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Eldridge,</inline> . Minister of Health&#39;s Building, Macquarie-street  said, &#39; We- want you men to go and. vote in the Sydney selection .ballot to-day. It will be worth a good day&#39;s pay. I will go up to the Labour Council rooms and fix up the  union  tickets and your instructions, and then you will go out in the cars and vote.&#39; &#34;There was a fleet of seven motor cars in attendance. Later, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Taylor</inline> came back with a number of union tickets and &#34;&#39; how to vote &#39; cards, and gave them to those present. The cards to me were - (1) Waterside Workers Federation, No: 4240, in the name of E. C.

                    Wells states &#34; This is an absolutely true version of what occurred in the Trades and Labour Council rooms and elsewhere in connexion with the first selection ballot for Sydney, which took place on 4th February, 1022. I went into the matter at the instance of certain public men in the Labour movement to obtain evidence for
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McGirr&#39;s</inline>
                    expulsion, and my instructions were to do everything I was told in
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McGirr&#39;s</inline>
                    interest. &#34; I was engaged on the Friday night to run one of what were known as McGirr&#39;s motor cars, the next day, 4th February, in Sydney selection. A motor called for me on the Saturday morning, and after picking up several others we proceeded to the Trades Hall, and six of us were seated round a table in the Labour Council rooms. The roll book for each division was placed before us. Gentlemen in charge of the proceedings were
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline>
                    Eldridge  and
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Taylor,</inline>
                    the former wearing a returned soldiers&#39; badge. They said, &#39; Now,, you men need not do this unless you like, and can leave the table if you wish.&#39; &#34;After certain instructions were given wo wrote names from each division, choosing only labourers and domestics. Certain names on the rolls had crosses marked opposite them. We were instructed to Iea,ve these severely alone. &#34;The work went on all day. Names were chosen from the rolls and placed on union cards, namely, Storemen and Packers Union, Municipal Employees Union, and Water and Sewerage Employees Union. &#34; We, the impersonators, were taken from the Trades Hall together for our meals, and were watched very closely. At 7.45 p.m., after running all day, we rushed to the Addison polling place, Surry Hills, where we voted for the names given to us on &#39; how to vote &#39; cards, namely, Bridges, Buckley, Holdsworth, McGirr, and Teen. &#34;I voted in the names of R. Wardman,  37 Denman-street, Surry  Hils,  as a member of the Water and Sewerage Union. This pence card, No. 404, produced, shows 2s. paid on 19th January, and is initialed by the officer in charge  of  the polling booth. Two others with mc refused to vote, but I carried out my mission to the end. &#34; There were fully COO impersonations which came under my notice. We were all paid ?1 for the day and supplied with three meals. &#34; I can give the names of other men, two of whom were running cars. There were special code arrangements for telephone communication with the Trades and Labour Council rooms during the day. &#34; After trying in other directions to have this matter exposed, I decided to place the facts in the hands of
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline>

                <para>Second Sydney State Labour Selection, 1922. Here is a statement from W. Minter, Clerks Union, in connexion with the second Sydney selection ballot :- &#34; At Alderman Stokes&#39; committee rooms, Elizabeth-street, Redfern, near the Central Railway Station, operations were conducted in connexion with the second Sydney selection ballot. Alderman Stokes had four gangs of impersonators operating in connexion with this ballot, each gang under the charge of a superintendent or ganger. &#34; Alderman Stokes&#39; brother was in charge of Oke gang. Teen was in charge of a gang. A lady was part time in charge of a gang, and another man whose name I do not know. Hie lady in question after lunch obtained a list of those of the League who had not voted at the Belmore booth, and who it was understood did not intend to vote, or were away, and these were impersonated by the gangs. &#34; One of the candidates attended the funeral of a member of the Belmore League on Thursday prior to the ballot, and then impersonated this dead man ,in the ballot on the Saturday, and &#39;boasted in the committee rooms of having done so. &#34; The gangs in question were operating on forged union tickets with the exception of the time they were &#39;impersonating the residue of the Belmore League members previously referred to. &#34;&#39; There were 600 Federated Liquor Trade Union tickets, 1,000 municipal employees&#39; tickets, and 1,000 Water and Sewerage Board tickets, and there appeared to be an unlimited quantity of other trade union tickets. &#34;None of these tickets&#39; had a union label imprint on them. They were obviously forgeries* and had no printer&#39;s imprint. In the case of the Federated Liquor Trades the colour of the faked union ticket is different to the <inline font-style="italic">bon&#38; fide</inline> union ticket. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bains,</inline> organizer for the Liquor Trades Union, signed all the Liquor Trade faked union tickets himself, signing them C. Bains. In some cases Ted. Mooney, managing director, Catholic Insurance Company, signed some of the faked tickets, and other signatures were made by other persons promiscuously in the committee rooms. In the cases of these forgeries there were originals of the various signatures and other particulars that were copied. </para>
                <para>The clerks in the committee rooms supplied each member of the -impersonating gang with the name and address of some person from the electoral roll in the district on a slip of paper, and the union ticket or pence-card was made out in the name of the voter to be impersonated. </para>
                <para>The gangs were sent to operate first on one polling booth, then return to the committee rooms for fresh supplies of tickets and instructions, and then operated on another polling booth, and having gone round the whole of the booths they came back to the committee rooms and commenced the same procedure again. </para>
                <para>Scouts were sent out from the committee rooms to bring back reports as to the best booths for the operations of duplication and personation. These scouts reported that at the Pyrmont booth :it was an open go, that an unlimited number of votes could be polled there provided a union ticket of any sort could be produced. </para>
                <para>At the Belmore booth, where <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Magrath,</inline> the secretary, Printing Employees Union, was  deputy  returning officer in charge, more than 2fi  per cent, of the votes were challenged by the scrutineers, and these votes were placed in separate envelopes for investigation after the close of the booth. At the count <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Magrath</inline> said he proposed to treat them all as valid votes, and asked had anybody an}&#39; objection? Nobody objected, with the exception of myself, and I urged that the unchallenged votes be first counted and the challenged votes forwarded to the returning officer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bates,</inline> for his  investigation and decision. This demand was disregarded, and the whole, of these votes were admitted without scrutiny. Had these challenged votes been investigated, there is no doubt the fraud would have been exposed. </para>
                <para>In the ordinary course of events rule 6 voters (the union voters) should have signed their name and address in a book for that purpose when they produced their union ticket to vote. But this procedure was not followed at all in the Belmore booth, so&#39; that once a voter left the polling booth there waa no record of who he was supposed to be. In the case of the challenges, the name and address of the person supposed to be voting was written, down by the  deputy  returning officer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Magrath,</inline> on the envelope. </para>
                <para>There were eight dozen dead marines (empty beer bottles) in an adjoining room. The place was clearly a beer saloon all day. The booth was full of drunks at the close of the polling. It took over half-an-hour to get them out of the polling-booth. The scrutineers left in for counting were in a number of cases in such a state of intoxication that we were engaged on account of this at one booth till a quarter past  2  a.m. next morning. </para>
                <para>At the Belmore booth I ascertained that for every league member who voted there were twenty rule 6 votes. </para>
                <para>This evidence of criminality, graft, and corruption is capable of almost indefinite expansion. The Political Labour movement in New South Wales has gone, and its place has been usurped by an unscrupulous Tammany gang ready to sell the interests of the workers and the community generally to the highest bidder, and which seeks to obtain control of Parliaments only that it may extend its bribery and corruption to the Departments of State, including the administration of the Police and Judicial Departments. Boss Bailey actually tried to organize a number of Sydney police into his central branch, Australian Workers Union, but the Inspector-General of Police and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dooley,</inline> then Chief Secretary, frustrated this bold enterprise of Tammany. </para>
                <para>It is the duty of the Government to searchingly inquire into all the matters set forth and facts and allegations relevant thereto, in order that our Parliaments and public administrations may not be manipulated by and for a corrupt Tammany organization that would soon reduce our public affairs to the level of the worst days and phases of its notorious prototype in New York. </para>
                <para>Production of samples of forged union tickets. I now produce and hand to the  Clerk  of the House, for the inspection of honorable members, samples of some of the forged union tickets used in these criminal selection ballots, of which I have a considerable number: - (1) Tramway Union ticket, (2) Water and Sewerage Board Union ticket, (3) Storemen and Packers Union ticket, and (4) Municipal Employees Union ticket. None have a printer&#39;s imprint. Some are forged ready for use. The Municipal ticket has a false short butt to be tom off to represent it as having come out of a duplicate book. </para>

                <para>The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton),</inline> from his place in this House, read an affidavit. The gentlemen concerned want to say that the whole of my charges have been replied to. That affidavit is a perfectly harmless document. If every word of it .were an abominable falsehood no action could be taken against the person making it. It has not been lodged in a court of law. It is not in the hands of anybody who could take action. Some of its points side-step the charges made against  the person concerned. At any rate, this charge was based on the signed statement of a Red Cross matron; the charge was not mine. </para>
                <para>In other instances, the charges were obviously so true that the Australian Labour party and Macdonell House got into a fury of impatience to fill up some of the gaps which had been exposed by die statements given to the public. </para>

                        <para>- I do so, sir, at your request. But. the honorable member uttered some diatribe under his- breath to the effect&#39;,, apparently, that I wanted &#34; my cut &#34; out of this corrupt money. If these thieves and burglars at Macdonell House, and their special henchmen in this Chamber, thought- that one word could be said against me they would gc&#187; &#34; hot- foot &#34; for a public inquiry. They know, however, that I can go clean-handed into .any inquiry which may be opened. I shall do my duty to the workers, despite all the  vil&#93;any  of the lie factory at Macdonell House. I challenge them to enter into a public inquiry. They can make all the charges that their criminal minds may suggest. The exposures which have been made in this House would not be a circumstance, to what would&#39; come, to light if a proper, inquiry were set. on foot--an inquiry which witnesses could be compelled to attend and at which they, could be forced to undergo cross-examination. </para>

                <para>The- gentlemen involved in my charges have appointed a. second committee- of their own number to. issue a reply. This was after the fight which . has been going on. with the State Caucus for the past six. or seven weeks. This is a public acknowledgment that the reply issued by the first committee has been ridiculed beyond repair. But a &#34; packed &#34; committee is in no sense an inquiry. </para>
                <para>What is required is an investigation before a- competent Judge, who can send for books and papers, who can, if necessary, seize books and papers, who can compel the attendance of witnesses and demand answers to- questions. If such an investigation were launched there would be so wide-spread an exposure of the uttermost rottenness ever known in the political history of this country that the Macdonell House Labour movement would be well on the road at- last to a very thorough and urgently necessary clean-up. </para>
                <para>Because I had insisted on an end being put to all this  vileness,  as soon as the Tammany clique at Macdonell House found that they could rake up a majority of four or five in the executive for my expulsion, one of their chief agents: a man named Arthur, moved that expulsion. For the last month or so he has been  engaged in the Cook electorate endeavouring <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> get the labour selection for the  district, whose representative he was . instrumental, in having expelled by the narrow margin of four votes at a. meeting in. Macdonell House. The first ballot  was corrupt,, but it did not support Arthur, the tool of the  Bailey-Lambert  junta, and the central executive upset,&#39; it and had another try. However, the electors of Cook, even those .few. who i still remain in the. Macdonell , House Labour League, have such a holy horror of having to appear as sponsor for one&#62; of the direct agents, of the Tammany gang; that they have been careful to select a person who is willing to be a&#39; tool for them, but who, these people think, will act as&#39; a kind of decoy duck against whom charges cannot be brought with the same force and effect as if one of the direct participants in the corruption were a candidate. I shall defeat this tool of Tammany. I have no doubt what the result, will be.. </para>

Nominations were Galled for, and mine was. the only one sent in. I became the. selected and indorsed  candidate  without any ballot. I was, however, :a very young man, and it was said by some people that I would not be able &#39;.to put up much of a fight. I agreed to the&#39; selection being  re-opened.  Accordingly nominations&#39; were again called, and I was. again selected. </para>

                    <para>. - I second the amendment <inline font-style="italic">pro forma.</inline> I understand that the honorable member for Cook has been engaged, ever since he made his previous statement in regard to Labour politics in New South &#39;Wales some four or &#39;five &#34;weeks ago, in compiling and  faking-up  information on which to base the &#39;allegations he -has &#39;made  to-night.  &#39;He has taken&#39; the &#39;statements of self-confessed criminals, -and &#34;has gone to&#39; unreliable and unscrupulous persons for assistance in compiling a mass of evidence that, in some  circumstances,  &#39;would &#39;appear &#39;to contain a &#39;certain amount df truth. It is difficult &#39;to &#39;follow &#39;the honorable member in&#39; detail &#39; through the &#39;Whole of his&#34; statement. He referred to me in anything but flattering terms. He not only impugned my &#39;honesty, but &#39;spoke against&#39; my moral character also. He referred in disparaging terms to persons whom I shall name directly, but in particular to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bailey,</inline> reiterating practically all the statements he made on a previous occasion, pins some further allegations. In answering those statements I am &#39;fortified with a Tittle more information &#34;than I had before, which should enable me to show &#39;the House what class of man the. honorable member &#34;for Cook is. The late&#39; John &#39;Storey, an ex-Premier of New South Wales, said, in the presence of several members of the State Parliamentary Labour party, that the Federal Labour party -was not worth its salt to allow a man like Catts inside its. ranks after the disgraceful Divorce Court proceedings and . another law case in which &#39;the honorable member -was a party.  A learned Judge, who heard the latter case, remarked that the word of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. ;</inline> Catts no man could rely upon. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith has often been referred to by the honorable member for Cook. The deceased gentleman said on one occasion, &#34;Who is this bounder, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Catts&#34;?-</inline></para>

                <para>I will now -deal with what the honorable member said about faked union ballots and forged tickets. He said that I defeated Con Wallace corruptly in the West Sydney selection ballot of August, 1921. He cannot prove one act of corruption by me or any of my supporters during the taking of that ballot. He made the statement that a dozen or so motor cars were running from one end of the city to the other carrying corrupt voters and  impersonators.  I know nothing of that; but I do not believe the statement. I was not near the electorate on the day that the ballot was held, nor had I been there for several previous days. There were five or six other candidates in the field. The voting waa preferential, but I received an absolute majority of votes on the first count. The honorable member made another statement which was absolutely incorrect. He said that the ballot-box was brought to the Town Hall. That is not so. The ballot-box was taken. I understand, to the head-office of the Australian Labour party by a respectable and honest citizen who was acting as returning officer; I refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gavin</inline> Sutherland, who has a much cleaner reputation than that of the honorable member for Cook. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sutherland</inline> has never been before the Law Courts, and has never been publicly stigmatized by a Judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, as the honorable member has been, as an untruthful and unreliable man. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sutherland</inline> was in charge of the counting of the ballot, and every candidate except myself, who had no scrutineer, was present with his scrutineer, watching his own interests. Yet, as I say, I received a majority of the- votes on the first count. That is all I know of that ballot.&#34; As &#39; to the faking of tickets to. which the honorable member alluded, I would, remind honorable members that. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Catts</inline> himself has an interest in. a pretty decent printing, works in Sydney,, and has a very good knowledge of printing. At one time he was regarded as practically an expert. He mentioned a selection ballot for the old Namoi seat, taken in 1916, or thereabouts. It is a fact that some forged voting slips were found to be attached to some of the ballots; but the Returning Officer, who was the agent for the Australian Workers Union at Wee Waa, detected those- slips,  and brought them under the notice of the union, which impounded them with the intention of having them inspected. I have been told that the honorable member for Cook at one time knew a great deal about locks, and was very efficient in ferreting out things. However, that is no business- of mine. The ballot in question could not be described as corrupt, because the agent of the Australian Workers Union, who was Returning Officer, promptly brought the forged papers under the notice of the union, which took action in regard to them. I have a good idea ais to who it was who forged those slips, which could be detected at a glance as forgeries. They were certainly never received as good votes nor counted. </para>
                <para>The honorable member made many references to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.. John</inline> Bailey, member of the Legislative Assembly, and used words regarding him that,. to my mind, had no application. He spoke of a &#34; Tammany gang &#34; and of &#34; this corrupt gang of burglars.&#34; I would ask if that is .parliamentary language ? </para>

That being 50, it is a strange thing that the honorable member himself should have travelled all over the Goulburn electorate electioneering for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Bailey, and that he should have written him a congratulatory letter on his election. </para>

                <para>The honorable member spoke of the corruptness of the Australian Workers Union machinery.. That machinery is not under my control.. It was under my control some time back; but I voluntarily handed over the position that I held in it. He said, too, that the Australian Labour party is controlled by the corrupt machinery of the Australian Workers Union.. He spoke of the tentacles of the Australian Workers Union enfolding it, or something to that effect, and said that it intimidated Labour members, and tried to engineer sitting members out of their seats. I did not take the seat of any sitting member, nor did <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bailey. Mr. Arthur</inline> Blakeley was elected in opposition to a former member; but he was quite justified, from the point of view of the party, in opposing that former member. </para>
                <para class="block">With that exception, not one of probably a dozen members of the Australian Workers Union who have been members of this, or other Australian Parliaments, during the past two or three years, &#39;has taken a parliamentary seat away from a Labour member, and that man had &#34;ratted &#34; on the Labour party at that time. There is absolute disproof of the honorable member&#39;s statement that the Australian Workers Union machinery was operating through the Australian Labour party to engineer sitting men out of their seats, so that they might be occupied by men controlling the Australian Workers Union. </para>
                <para>The honorable member seemed rather annoyed because I was Lord Mayor of Sydney, and spoke scathingly of me as the &#34; Great Lord Mayor.&#34; Indeed, the honorable member was so ruffled that the venom almost oozed out of his mouth when he was uttering his vindictive words. He said that, when Mayor of Sydney, I had promised a certain person a good job, or something like that, if he would personate voters for me at the Sydney municipal election. It is what I would like to describe as a, lie, but I cannot, as it would not be parliamentary to do so. However, it is an absolutely incorrect statement. It is an unscrupulous and slanderous statement, which only a desperate man could make. I regret that there were certain cases of impersonation in the Sydney municipal elections just as there are cases of impersonation in all parliamentary elections, and yet, because one young fellow was proved guilty of impersonating and was unfortunate enough to receive three months&#39; imprisonment, the honorable member has the audacity to come to this House and make the unscrupulously mendacious statement that I actually arranged with men to personate voters for me. </para>

It was not a, very good job. It was navvy ing or similar work on the roads of Sydney. In any case, how can the honorable  member  prove his statement that this man voted for me? Once a ballot-paper goes into the ballot-box I am not likely to know the name of the person for whom the vote has been given. He may, or may not, have voted for me. I shall not mention his name, but from information received, I have been led to believe that his family have never been supporters of the Labour party. In all probability therefore, he did not vote for me or for any Labour candidate. I am sorry to have to mention these matters. It is getting right down into the gutter. I have never listened to more miserable, contemptible, and dirty arguments than I have heard to-night from the honorable member. </para>

He said that there were 700 timber workers spread over 14,000 miles of country on the north coast. I am a bushman of many year&#39;s training, and I have travelled a great deal in Australian States. Therefore, I am aware that there are more than 700 timber workers in the timber belt in the north of New South Wales, and if they voted for their secretary in the selection ballot that is all I know about the matter. However, it is absurd for the honorable member for Cook to come into this House and endeavour to attack the character of a member of the State House who compares much more than favorably with himself. </para>

I am not dirty enough to come into this House and, under the cloak of privilege, use the slanderous words which the honorable member has chosen to apply to men outside, calculating to do them injury and prevent some of them from earning a living. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dick</inline> MacDonald was not an old organizer of the Australian Workers Union in that sense of the word, but he was in a very bad way in Sydney in 1918, and as he was an acquaintance of mine I used the power that I possessed under the rules of my union to appoint an organizer for a month or two. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member also referred to my own personal selection ballot in 1922, and described it as a corrupt one. I can only say that it was a straight-out contest, and nobody protested at any time. _ Everything was clean and above-board as far as I know, and I obtained a very substantial majority. </para>

                <para>The honorable member also mentioned the name of a gentleman named Brennan. I do not know that gentleman&#39;s initials, but he is employed in the powerhouse in Sydney. The honorable member said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brennan</inline> did certain things; but if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brennan</inline> did those things, which I do not believe, he stands as a self-confessed criminal. The honorable member also speaks of a gentleman named Pritchard, who, he says, took &#163;1 for personating voters in the selection ballots. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pritchard</inline> did this he also is a self-confessed criminal. Indeed, everybody that the honorable member calls to his aid is either a self-confessed criminal or an exceedingly bad character, whose word would be taken nowhere. On a former occasion :the honorable member was very good at dragging in the names of dead men, and it would appear that, having run out of the supply of departed ones, he is now substituting the names of some of the most desperate characters to be found about the city of Sydney. I do not know any of the gentlemen to whom he has referred except by reputation. </para>
                <para>The honorable member also impugned the good name and honour of one who is an honest man. I understand that this gentleman was Under-Secretary to the Minister for Health and Labour in the last Parliament of New South Wales.  His  name is Eldridge, and, .according to the honorable member for Cook, he directed the &#34; gang &#34; of impersonators at the last selection ballot for State members. That, however, is an unsupported statement, and absolutely incorrect. </para>

                        <para>- I do withdraw the words, sir, and substitute the word &#34; incorrect.&#34; The rolls for the city of Sydney are made up on the 1st May every three years, and when they are completed they are exhibited at the Court House, in order that people may see whether their names are there, and, further, whether there are the names of persons who ought not to be enrolled. Like every other organization which desires to get a majority in an institution or a Parliament, the Australian Labour party must see that there is no roll stuffing. As a matter of fact, close on 3,000 objections were lodged at the Revision Court, but they were not all lodged by supporters of Labour, many being by the opponents of the Labour party. However, at the instance of the Labour party, I believe there were close upon 1,000 names struck off the rolls at the Court. I may say that at the Revision Court the antiLabour people had the aid of a solicitor and barrister, a junior barrister, and four or five clerks for three or four weeks, whereas my organization was represented by an ordinary solicitor, with the result, as I have said, that close upon 1,000 names were struck off. Our only desire was to purify the rolls. Under the Sydney Corporation Act there are four classes of electors, namely. leaseholders, owners, occupiers, and lodgers. As ari instance of what occurred, I may say that for -one big institution, the name of which 1 shall not mention, the names of nineteen persons were placed on the rolls, whereas only the representative of the owning company of the institution was entitled to be enrolled ; and there were many cases of the kind. There were deliberate cases of stuffing the rolls, and the organization of the Australian Labour party simply did the right thing in having them cleansed. </para>

                        <para>- I withdraw them, but it is hard to find words with which to describe the honorable member. He is disappointed and disgruntled; he has such a &#34; sore head,&#34; and feels so bitter about his expulsion from the Australian Labour party for being a traitor to it, that he is almost driven to desperation.  His  state of mind has made him one of the most cowardly individuals possible for man to see, and I never desire to again meet such a person as he is. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member referred to my character, but I tell him that my character will stand investigation, morally, and in every other respect. The honorable member talks about a public inquiry, and said that on one occasion when &#39;I was speaking to another member of the Labour party, I &#34;woke up,&#34; meaning that I had been drunk. Now, such an insinuation is absolutely untrue. </para>

                    <para>That this Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of the measure is to give effect to the proposal indicated in the Budget statement for the removal of the war surcharge upon the land tax. The circumstances in regard to land taxation in Australia in general, and in the Commonwealth in particular, are well known to honorable members. The Commonwealth land tax was first introduced in 1910 for a definite purpose and as a definite act of policy. It was designed to endeavour to break up large estates, and it was not at any time regarded as a revenue measure. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Riley.</inline> - Who said so? / <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. BRUCE.-</inline> That has been often stated, and was clearly expressed by the party to which  the honorable member belongs. It was introduced by that party, and had the definite purpose I have mentioned. The tax was increased in 1918, but that increase was a purely revenue-producing impost. The circumstances of the war had placed the Commonwealth finances in such a position that revenue had to be drawn in for national purposes, but when the surcharge was increased in 1920 it was made perfectly clear that it was not added with any intention of giving effect to a policy of land taxation for the breaking up of large  estates, and the promotion of closer settlement, but was intended purely and simply to raise revenue for war- purposes. This charge was placed upon land because it was one of the easiest sources from which revenue could be obtained1. </para>

                        <para>- For once, I have a lot of sympathy with the honorable member. Land is an object that cannot be removed, and is certainly an easy victim of taxation. Whilst the circumstances of. the moment demanded that a revenue tax should be placed upon land, it is clear, and I think that every party in the House will agree, that it should be removed at the earliest moment. There might, at first sight, be some suggestion of opposition from honorable members of- the Labour party, but I have sufficient confidence in their sense of justice to&#62; believe that they do not wish the continuation of a special tax on one class of the community. The surcharge of land tax is an additional income tax, or a capital tax, levied on a particular class of property,, and it is neither just nor proper to impose taxation in this way. Those who say that property should be taxed to a .greater extent than it is are on sound and logical ground if they move for the increasing of taxation on all classes of property; but they are on unsound ground when they say that one particular class of property should bear a burden not imposed on other classes of property. It was stated in the Budget that the repeal of the surcharge would be proposed. Our financial circumstances are not all that we would wish, but they have improved sufficiently to allow us to carry out this promise. We are doing nothing at this stage to interfere with the land tax,, which-, has been in operation in the Commonwealth for many years as part of a policy designed to achieve a certain result ; all we are proposing is the removal of ai surcharge imposed in pursuance of no- other policy than- the raising, of additional revenue.. It has- been, suggested that this is- another sop to a particular class,, but that is not so.. The proposal, is. based on. definite principles o&#163; equity,, and it. is- a measure of relief that is rightly introduced as soon, as our financial circumstances permit of it being put into- effect. </para>

                        <para>- My request for an adjournment was only a formal one,, because I was confident that it would- be refused. Do the Government propose to apply the &#34; gag &#34; to the discussion of this measure?. The super tax which it is proposed, to. repeal was not imposed by the party with, which I am connected, but was brought forward by the present Government in 1918. We are-, now asked to discuss a; Bill- to amend the Land Tax Act 1910-1918-, and to. repeal- the. Land Tax Acts of 1918-1919. and 1920.. This- will bring the law back to where it stood when the- Act of 1&#39;910&#62; became law: That Act was a Labour measure,, designed to bring the lands of the country into fuller use by taking them out of the hands of the few, and putting them into those of the many. It was a wise and beneficial measure, and has brought about great industrial changes. Millions of acres which were in pastoral occupation have since been tilled, and the immense production of wheat, oats and barley that has resulted has increased the revenue obtained by the various Australian Governments through income taxation,, has increased our exportation, thus enabling the State Governments to meet their obligations in foreign markets,, and this has in turn increased our importations, and swelled our Customs: revenue-. Since the present Government have been in office there has been a falling off in agricultural production in this country. The present Government in 1918, for reasons which they considered to be just, imposed a super tax.. The Treasurer is now trying, to repeal that measure,, and would give the impression that the super tax. was imposed by a Labour Government.. Asa matter of fact: there, was not a Labour- Government in power&#39; in- 1918. and the super tax was- really imposed by the present Government. There are still a number of large estates, which have been untouched by the- operation! of the Federal land tax. It seems to- me that instead- of the tax being diminished it should be enormously increased, in view of the desire for the land settlement of soldiers with the intention of bringing properties previously occupied as &#34;pastoral Properties into use for ^agriculture. A statement which, -recently appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> gives some interesting information relating- to the ownership of these estates, which &#34;was contained in a return and <inline font-style="italic">cm.</inline> the table of the Legislative Assembly of Victoria in response to a inquest by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bailey,</inline> the honorable member for Port Fairy. The -return : Showed that at the 31st December, 1921, these <inline font-style="italic">-ment</inline> (fifteen estates of 20,000 acres- and over held, in this State of Victoria alone. Honorable members know that Victoria is the smallest of the States of the mainland -of Australia. New South Wales is about three times the size of Victoria, Queensland about three times the .size of &#39;New South, Wales, and Western .Australia contains an area of about one-third of the total area of .tha Commonwealth. In addition to the estates of 20,000 acres and over, there are many -estates in Victoria of 15000, 1.6,000, and 17,00.0 .acres. According to tha return presented, I fmd that the first estate mentioned is Terricks Estate, of 20,505 acres, in the county of Bendigo, .and the owner ia Evelyn L. Atkinson. The next estate mentioned is the Kongbool Estate, of Ul,786 acres, in Dundas county, and the owner is J. G-. Robertson. There is the Fulham Estate, of 28,1613 acres, also in Dundas county, which is, according to the return, the owners&#39; settlement of -G. M. Armytage. The Armytages are a very famous family in Victoria, and amongst the earliest of our settlers. <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> believe that the first of the family -to settle in Australia - George Armytage - arrived in Hew South Wales at a .place called Botany Bay, in about the year 1832, having a free passage, at the expense of his country. The next estate mentioned is the Glendenning and Melville Forest Estate, -of 52,879 acres, in Dundas .county, the .owner of which is R. S. falkiner, who, I believe, waa at one time a member of this House, hut thought he could do .better -outside. There is ne?t the Koolomert and Kadnook Estate, of 38,504 acres, in Dundas and Lowan counties, and the owner is Benjamin Chaffey. Tha Chaffeys came originally from America and started schemes in connexion with irrigation. Honorable members are aware that as the result off the development .of irrigation we have country now .along the Murray that is a blooming paradise which was previously practically a desert. There are thousands of  &#39;Orange, apple, <inline font-style="italic">and</inline> .other (fruit trees on these lands. I ask leave to continue any address later. </para>
