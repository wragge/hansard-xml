In view of the serious results that may ensue from that Conference, I desire to know whether the Dominions have any direct representation, or whether they were invited to be directly represented upon it? </para>

                        <para>- I am aware that a Conference is being held to discuss the matter to which the honorable member has referred. A communication has been received from the British Government in regard to Earl Balfour&#39;s note. It is not considered to be necessary, in the interests of the Commonwealth, that we should have direct representation on the Conference. The Commonwealth reserves to itself the right to accept any decision arrived at by the Conference, and, if it thinks fit, to stand by the Treaty of Versailles in regard to the reparations, I should like to add that, considering the magnitude of the amounts which are the subject of discussion at the Conference, the assent or dissent of the Dominions is not material. It would not be so regarded by France or Germany. If the Conference arrives at a decision which modifies the terms of the Treaty in such a way as to reduce the amount due by way of reparation to the Empire, opportunity will be given to this Parliament to express an opinion as to whether or not it should assent to that decision. </para>

I have to complain that, on the question of the redistribution of Victoria into Federal divisions, my pair was not honoured by the Government Whip. On the &#34;broad, national question&#34; relating to proposed expenditure at Canberra my pair was honoured, but when the issue was whether Victoria should or should not have an aditional representative in this House the Government Whip dishonoured it. I think I have cause to complain. I have been a member of this House for sixteen years, and have always honoured every pair I have given. </para>

                        <para>
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline>
                            referred today to the statement of
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Newman</inline>
                            Barwell, in which he alleged the Prime Minister had misquoted and misrepresented him in regard to his attitude on arbitration.
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline>
                            said he had not done so. &#34;If&#34; said the Prime Minister, &#34;
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Newman</inline>
                            Barwell will do me the honour of perusing my speech to which he refers, ho will  see that the. only statements I made as to his attitude, both on the White Australia policy and on arbitration, were actual quotations from his speeches or his contributions to the press. I notice
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Newman</inline>
                            is silent as to coloured labour. Why docs he now say nothing on a subject on which he was so eloquent overseas? Does he say I have misrepresented his views on the White Australia policy?
                        </para>
                        <para>Let me quote his own words in connexion with arbitration. On the 18th January <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Newman</inline> Barwell said, in speaking of the class hatred which existed between Capital and Labour - </para>
                        <para class="block">Another contributing factor to that mutual antagonism is, in my opinion, the existence of compulsory arbitration in Australia. While you &#39;have an arbitration system as at present, these two great forces will act with bitterness toward each other, and will be arrayed against each other as enemies. The doors of the Arbitration Court are everlastingly open, inviting Labour to come again and again in a never-ending struggle to wrest from Capital something more than it had enjoyed before. While Arbitration Courts exist in Australia Capital and Labour will maintain that spirit of antagonism; and while Capital and Labour maintain that spirit of antagonism Australia can never rise to the full height of her possibilities. The logical conclusion from these premises then is, that if Arbitration Courts continue to &#39;exist, Australia can never realize her great possibilities. These Courts stand in the way of adjustments which otherwise would come about automatically.&#39; &#34; &#34;When I retorted,&#34; continued <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> &#34;that if <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Newman</inline> Barwell was convinced that the arbitration system was such a menace he should begin his widely-trumpeted reform by abolishing his own State Courts, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Newman</inline> Barwell replied - </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> wants to know why, if I am in favour of wiping out Arbitration Courts, I have not done so in South Australia. Well, for a very simple reason. If the South Australian Parliament abolished the Arbitration Courts in South Australia while the Commonwealth Arbitration Court still remained in existence, our last condition would be worse than the first. </para>
                    <para>The only compulsory system of arbitration in Australia would then be the Commonwealth system, and the only Court the Commonwealth Court, which would exercise jurisdiction over the whole field of industry. Thus the plight of employee and employer in South Australia would be worse than ever. . . . The first thing to do, in my opinion, is to abolish the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. I will undertake to see that we follow suit in South Australia by putting an end to the State Court.&#39;&#34; &#34;Again, when during the course of our controversy I stated that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Newman</inline> Barwell&#39;s attitude at a recent Premiers&#39; Conference was quite different, and that he was then not so outspoken, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Newman</inline> Barwell replied - </para>
                    <para class="block"> At the Premiers&#39; Conference I knew - as a matter of fact, I knew before the debate began - that I could not get support for a proposal to abolish the Arbitration Court altogether. Consequently, I fell back on the alternative of trying to bring about such a delimitation of the powers of the Commonwealth Court as would prevent overlapping jurisdictions, great expense, endless friction, discontent, and industrial inefficiency, the inevitable accompaniment of the present system.&#39; &#34; &#34;It is abundantly clear,&#34; continued <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> &#34; from the above statements, that if <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Newman</inline> Barwell had his way he would abolish not only the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, but all other legal machinery for the compulsory settlement of industrial disputes. If he has changed his opinion, <inline font-style="italic">why</inline> does he not say so? For the sentiments he expressed some months ago on coloured labour and arbitration he was loudly applauded by certain people. Does he now wish to forego those plaudits by deliberately denying his confession of faith? He has over and over again declared himself opposed to &#39; the White Australia policy &#39; and arbitration, and in doing so he was voicing the aspirations of a small conservative section who regard national interests as subordinate to their own, and who are ready to scrap the industrial system of this country if they can obtain an abundant supply of coloured labour. </para>
                    <para>
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Newman</inline>
                        Barwell&#39;s protestations do not affect the facts. He stood openly against the arbitration system, by which employers and employees seek to redress their grievances, and loudly advocated the importation of coloured labour. For these sentiments he was vigorously lauded by reactionaries in London and Australians a brave and fearless champion of a desperate cause. Whether he has now come to realize that these people are, after all, greatly in the minority, or whether he has actually become a disciple of the true faith, I shall welcome a clear, definite, and final pronouncement from him on these matters.&#34;

                    <para>. - All honorable members are agreed that the question of the price of sugar is the most important matter that has been discussed during the term of this Parliament. Realizing this, I listened with the greatest attention to the speeches delivered by honorable members, in order to ascertain whether it was the intention of those who seemed to be so much interested in this important question to seek means to cheapen the price of the commodity, but I arrived a,t the conclusion that, so far as the honorable members opposite were concerned, this was a secondary consideration, and that their main purpose was to oust the Government. On the other hand, the majority of honorable members sitting on the Government side of the House seek a reduction in the price of sugar because so many industries and so many people would benefit. Naturally, &#34; cheap sugar &#34; will be an excellent cry at the forthcoming election, but the real effort of honorable members opposite is not to suggest- a method by which the price can be reduced. Their object is to put the Government out of office. In confirmation of my view, let me quote from the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> which has such a great influence on honorable members, particularly those who represent Victorian constituencies. This journal, commenting in its issue of the 7th August last, on the division <inline font-style="italic">upon</inline> the sugar question in this House last week, says - </para>

The House was sitting in Committee at the time, and the sense of the Committee was in favour of newspaper and other reports of the same debate being permitted to be read. It has been the practice ever since for the  Speaker  to allow quotations to be made from reports and comments, whether of newspapers or of other documents, referring to the same debate, but not to other debates in the same session.

                            <para>- Only a few minutes ago I called attention to the necessity for permitting the debate to proceed in silence, or without interruption. Since then, however, there have been repeated interjections. Indeed, disorder has punctuated the whole of the speech of the honorable member for Denison. I cannot permit such a state of affairs to continue. I was on the point of taking definite action against a certain honorable member when the Prime Minister rose to a point of order. I hope that I shall have the support of the House in any course of action I may deem it my duty to take. I warn the honorable member for Barrier particularly that he has offended on two or three occasions during the last few minutes. If he continues I shall certainly name him. </para>

                    <para>Mr.LAIRD SMITH.- If any remarks I made are regarded as offensive, I certainly withdraw them. What I did say was that I had the assurance of the Prime Minister given to me on the floor of the House that the Government intended to cheapen sugar as early as possible. I asked the right honorable gentleman on that occasion if the Government could see its way clear to do something to reduce the present price of sugar to the consumer, and the Prime Minister replied that the matter was now receiving the closest attention of the Government, and every effort would be made to secure a reduction of the price. Subsequently I asked the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> a question on the same subject, and, in effect, that gentleman replied that the Government had taken the matter into consideration, and had announced the reduction that was to be made,  adding that if any further reduction was possible it would be made at the earliest date. What more can honorable members require than this assurance from those high in power, who are ready to reduce the price as soon as that can be don&#169; with safety to the finances of the Commonwealth ? I, at any rate, am prepared to leave the matter in the hands of the Government. </para>
                    <para>We are indebted to the honorable member for Parramatta <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pratten)</inline> for the very able speech that he  made, but&#34; I am sorry to say that he was not able to base his remarks on fact. The position he took was that if so and so were true,&#39; then he arrived at certain conclusions; he had no official data at his command, and hence his conclusions were founded purely on supposition, as he himself admitted. This is rio reflection on the honorable member, but, at the same time, it very&#39; much discounts his speech. Of course, if the honorable member&#39;s premises were correct, we should be able to draw certain deductions therefrom - deductions most valuable to this House. But we are not able to do this with certainty; and consequently we await the statement that we hope the Minister for Trade and Customs will give us at an early date. What we require is a complete return spread over the full period of six years. </para>
                    <para>That reminds me of a statement that was made by the honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)&#39;</inline> when the main question was under debate. That honorable member criticised most bitterly the statement made to the House by the Minister, and questioned the authenticity of what the honorable gentleman had said; indeed, the honorable member for Maribyrnong not only questioned whether the Government desired to give the facte, but whether the facts were there to give. The Sugar Board is composed of the most able public servants we have ; these men have nothing to hide, yet for&#34; purely party purposes the honorable member made statements which were a reflection, not only on them, but on the whole Public Service: I know the- ability of those&#39; men, and feel sure that any task they axe set will be performed honestly and well. </para>

                    <para class="block">We ought to be very careful in dealing with this question, because involved in it is the prosperity of the great fruit industry, which is being carried on in Western Australia, Tasmania, and,, indeed, throughout the Commonwealth. Closely allied with this is the jam industry, and, finally, of course, the sugar industry itself . All -those industries are so interwoven that it behoves us to drop this party business; we ought not for party purposes to try to place this great industry in such a position as to affect detrimentally the people, and also the finances at this critical time. Surely honorable members realize the state of the financial world. Australia seems to be more stable than any other country, excepting, perhaps America.; but we have only to cast our eyes upon Europe to see quite a different picture. Again, I say, for purely party purposes, an attempt is being made to harass the Government, which is doing its best to deal with one of the great industries of Australia. The sugar industry together with the jam and fruit industries were saved by the Government during the great war. If the manufacturers during the war had not been able to get cheap sugar, our fruit would have rotted on the trees, and the valuable jam which we exported would have been nonexistent. After this great war, we find that, in 1919-20, we produced the greatest amount of jam in lb: weight that had been produced up to that time, namely, 79,272,560 lbs. This result was obtained because the Government rose to the occasion early in the day, and settled the sugar question. Manufacturers found&#39; it possible to get cheap sugar, and to send their products away with great profit to this community. Shortly, we shall have the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> showing, I hope, that there is a surplus instead of a deficit, as in other countries throughout the world, largely owing to the advance of our trade and commerce. The sugar industry developed enormously during the period of the war. The honorable member for Parramatta was good enough to furnish us with authentic figures showing that, in 1915-16, the value of the sugar produced was &#163;2,873,520, which, in 1921-22, had increased to &#163;7,583,333. The honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs),</inline> in the course of his recent speech, told us that labour&#39;s share of this production amounted to &#163;6,000,000. Who reaped the benefit? For the most part that money went into the pockets of many of the workers of Australia. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, and it has a great influence on the representatives of Victoria in this House. Honorable members opposite claim that if the amendment were amended as proposed by them the immediate result would be a reduction in the price of sugar. I hold that it would probably have the effect of at once reducing the wages of a very large body of workers in Queensland. The honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs)</inline> on Friday last delivered an able speech on this question, which I hope will be read by the workers generally. In it he showed most effectively what disastrous results would attend the carrying of the proposal of the Labour party. He showed that to give effect to it would be to paralyze a great Commonwealth industry, and to throw thousands of men out of work. I repeat that the object which the Opposition have in view is not to cheapen the price of the commodity, but rather to defeat the Government, so that they may come into office. </para>

                    <para>Our import duty on sugar is lower than that imposed by any other country. In the United Kingdom there is a general duty of &#163;25 13s. 4d. per ton; the Canadian duty is &#163;11 3s. per ton ; the United States of America has a duty of &#163;9 19s. per ton; and South Africa a duty of &#163;6 14s. per ton. In Australia the duty is &#163;6 per ton, and throughout the war we had cheaper sugar than had any other country. While the people of Great Britain were paying something like &#163;80 per ton for it we were obtaining it at less than half that price, with the result that the important industries to which I have already referred were able to carry on. The high price of sugar in Great Britain has had a most marked effect upon its consumption there. In 1920 the consumption per head of the population was 76 lbs., but in 1921 it fell away to 54 lbs. The people of the Old Country have not been rationed by the Government, but have been compelled, owing to the high price of sugar, to ration themselves. Throughout the trying period of the war, the Commonwealth Government exercised a control that enabled us to obtain sufficient for our wants at a price far below that prevailing in other countries. Although I have made the most careful inquiries I have not heard that any one in Australia, by reason of this agreement, has run short of supplies or has had to ration himself. </para>
                    <para>During the debate much has been said as to the work of the representatives of Queensland in this Parliament in connexion with this agreement. They undoubtedly have done excellent work in the interests of their own State, and no one can blame them for it, since the sugar industry is one of the biggest enterprises in Queensland. I am pleased to acknowledge the valuable and reliable information that I have received from them in regard to the whole position It cannot be said that they have attempted to mislead any honorable member who is concerned as to the position of industries in which sugar is largely used. Their sole object has been to obtain a fair deal for the great sugar industry of the northern State. </para>

I am surprised that any Queenslander visiting this State should have indulged in adverse criticism of the actions of representatives of Queensland in this Parliament. As a matter of fact, they have supplied the House with literature and personal advice that will be invaluable to us when we come later on to deal with the general question of control. Under the rules of the House I cannot now discuss the future control of the industry, but 1 hope to have an opportunity to do so later on. </para>

                    <para>I think that we may rest assured that the Government will give us cheaper sugar as early as possible, and that the Labour party, in proposing now to reduce the price, are influenced, not so much by a desire to obtain cheaper sugar for the people as to gain possession of the Treasury bench. I have nothing to fear from my constituents because of the attitude 1 am adopting on this question. The people of Australia read and think for themselves, and one is not afraid of their judgment of one&#39;s actions whore an honest attempt is being made to bring about a better state of affairs in the interest of the whole Commonwealth. I think it is wise that we should refrain from coming to a r&#39;1 vision on the question of the price of sugar until we have before us the full and  definite  facts which the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> alone can supply. The honorable member for Parramatta <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pratten),</inline> on the facts available to him, did remarkably well in the speech which he delivered in this House last Thursday. He gave us the </para>
                    <para class="block">Authority for all the figures quoted by hint, and said that, assuming that those  figures  were correct, be considered certain deductions could be drawn from them.  His  was a fair criticism, and I think he is to be commended for it. </para>
                    <para>T am not going to address myself further to this question, since I know that there awaits- our consideration a very important measure relating to the compensation to Ve  paid  to military men who are to be retired from the Defence Department. There is a large body of men affected by that Bill. They are anxious to know what they are to receive by way of compensation, so that they may lose no time in setting up business for themselves and so providing for their wives and families. The Leader of the Labour party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton),</inline> when the Minister referred to the importance of that measure, said that the question of cheaper sugar was still more important; but he must admit that the Bill, relating to the compensation to be paid to those who are being retired from the Department of Defence should receive our early attention. </para>

                        <para>. - I may be permitted to deal briefly with this question, in regard to which probably more loose and inaccurate statements have been made than on any other. I entirely agree with the view expressed by the honorable member who has just resumed his seat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Laird Smith)</inline> as to the attitude which certain honorable members have adopted towards it. For the reasons he has advanced, it is unnecessary to traverse the whole of the facts, or to deal with all the arguments that have been used; but one or two observations seem to me to be appropriate. The honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anstey)</inline> has submitted an amendment of the amendment, in which he proposes that the price of sugar shall be reduced to 4fd. per lb. The honorable member knows perfectly well what the position is. He knows that even if every honorable member, with the exception of myself, were to vote for his proposition, the price of sugar would not be reduced to 4|d. per lb., because it cannot be retailed at that price. We have to deal with facts. Resolutions do not alter facts; they certainly cannot alter prices where these are determined by the cost of production. I must remind honorable members of what the position is in regard to sugar. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>A great deal has been said about the price of sugar. May I remind honorable members of one or two facts? The first is that the price of sugar is determined by the sugar agreement of 1920. The other is that for this agreement this House must take the responsibility. Honorable members seem to have forgotten this fact, but I have not. I very well remember - declining any longer to be the football of circumstances, and being adjured over and over again by the House to take it into my confidence, and to submit measures while yet there was time for them to be moulded by the composite wisdom of the Parliament - I followed that most excellent advice, and submitted the draft agreement to Parliament. Parliament approved of it. There were differences of opinion, but even those who differed from us qualified their objections in such a way as to stop far short of recording a vote against the agreement. </para>
                    <para>For the agreement this House and this Parliament must take full responsibility. </para>
                    <para>If there is anything in the agreement to which honorable members take exception they  must  censure themselves and not the Government. The Government were merely the instruments that carried into effect the decision of this Parliament. The agreement fixes the price of raw sugar, and <inline font-style="italic">bo</inline> determines the price at which refined sugar can be retailed. If it be said that the price of sugar is too high, we have only to look at the agreement to see if the price of sugar is to bo justified  by  it, and the circumstances that have arisen out of it, or whether the present price of sugar is due to something not in the agreement or the circumstances that have arisen out of it.  Let me remind honorable members that before Parliament ratified the agreement it had all the facts presented to it. This House knew that the retail price of sugar could not be less than 6d. a lb. for a very long time. It knew that it might be more. It knew how this retail cost was made up: where every fractional part went to. It knew that the Government would have to purchase foreign sugar on which it must make a loss if it were sold at 6d. a lb. Knowing all these things, the House approved the agreement. The price of sugar has been, and is, determined by the agreement, and by the circumstances that have arisen out of it. There is not an item that goes to make up the present price of sugar that was not submitted to this House. It was not a question submitted at large. Each branch of the industry was scrutinized in detail. It is one of the features of the agreement that it lays down what each branch of the industry is to receive. For the first time in the history of this industry the people who buy the finished article know exactly what part of the price they pay goes to the workman, to the grower, to the miller, to the refiner, to the carrier, to the wholesale dealer, and to the retailer. Every fractional part of a penny is accounted for. In order that there shall be no misunderstanding of the position as it will be with sugar at 5d. a lb., I will give a detailed statement of the distribution amongst the various parties : - </para>
                    <para class="block">
                        <graphic href="099331192208091_11_0.jpg" />
                    </para>
                    <para class="block">I have set out in detail the cost, of producing sugar at each stage, and shown how the price of 5d. a lb. is made up. I ask honorable members to tell me to what items they take exception : where a reduction can be effected. They must not forget that we are under an agreement, which has yet some months to run. We- must discharge our obligation under the agreement. We must give to the cane-growers and the millers a price that will enable them to pay the wages agreed upon with the cane-cutters and other field hands, and the workers in the mills, the sailor on the ships, the workers in the refineries. We are under obligation to pay certain charges to the refiner and to the shipper, and to pay the wholesaler and the retailer certain definite amounts for the work they do, which is just as much a part of producing sugar as is any other of the processes necessary to make the finished article available to the householder. Every item has been fixed by agreement, and all are conditioned by the terms of the sugar agreement, which fixes the price for raw sugar. The figures speak for themselves, and there is no reduction possible unless there is to be an assault upon some particular section of the industry and its rights under the agreement. </para>
                    <para>The amendment submitted by the honorable member for Bourke seeks to bring about a reduction in the price to 4;5/8d. per lb., but if the honorable member gets the support of every honorable member of the House, it will not make the slightest difference to the price of sugar. Any reduction below 5d. can be effected only in one way. One course is open to the honorable member - to charge the whole body of taxpayers with the difference between 45/8d. and 5d. per lb., in which case sugar could be sold at 45/8d. per lb. But since every taxpayer is a consumer of sugar, there would be little gained, even if that course commended itself as a business-like proposal. Therefore, the honorable member&#39;s amendment must go. </para>
                    <para>I do not propose to repeat what has been said by the honorable member for Denison <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Laird Smith)</inline> to the effect that honorable members are not concerned with the price of sugar. If it were thought for one moment by the unions in Queensland that the assault upon this industry would be successful, there would be a change of tune within twenty-four hours. It is an attack on the Government, and is recognised as such. It is a <inline font-style="italic">tour de force</inline> which is not expected to have any result. However, so that the people outside may know where their money is going, I have set out the position quite clearly. </para>
                    <para>I have only one or two remarks to add. For this agreement, the House, and not myself, must take the responsibility. Two years ago, I put it before honorable members, and said that, unless the House accepted it, I would not take the responsibility on my shoulders. The House accepted the agreement, and it is not fair that I should be asked to take the responsibility, or to say that the Government must bear all these responsibilities that arise out of a shortage of sugar brought about through no fault on the part of the Government, but by one of those cataclysms which now and then overtake the sugar industry, such as cyclones, and one cause or another from which no industry is immune. At the time the agreement was approved by this Parliament, it was thought to be, by many, quite a. good agreement. The honorable member for Parramatta <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pratten),</inline> who made a speech the other evening, was  of opinion, when the agreement was before the Senate, that it was a very excellent one. He said - </para>
                    <para>I am going to say freely and frankly that the sugar-growers of Queensland have repaid their moral debt to the Government and the Australian consumers for preserving their industry through times of stress and difficulty. </para>
                    <para>I do not think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford</inline> and others interested will hear much more in regard to the handicap that fruit-growers have experienced as the result of sugar prices prevailing in the Commonwealth, although he may be pessimistic as regards the future price of the world&#39;s sugar. </para>
                    <para>I believe we have made a good deal for the consumers in the Commonwealth. The producers have been placed in a reasonably good position, the Government have safeguarded all interests, and have effected a fair compromise. </para>
                    <para class="block">When the agreement comes before the Senate I shall support it, and as this measure is an integral part of that document I shall support its passage also. </para>
                    <para class="block">I am hopeful that during the third, if not the second year of the agreement, the consumers of the Commonwealth, instead of paying a retail price of6d., will be paying only 5d. in consequence of the automatic drop I have mentioned. The Queensland producers and the Commonwealth Government are no worse off. and this elastic and clever agreement will bring about that state of affairs as soon as the world&#39;s price justifies it. </para>
                    <para class="block">What more could any man say in favour of the agreement? It was perfectly well known in this House that the price was to be fixed at 6d. per lb. I stated it, and the House accepted it. It is also  perfectly well known that the possibilities were that it might even be higher than 6d. lb. But we expressed the hope and belief that it would gradually fall. The honorable member for Parramatta <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pratten)</inline> stated that, in the third year he hoped the price would fall to 5d. per lb. It is about to do so. The honorable member said that the agreement was a perfectly good one for the fruit-grower. The agreement, such as it is, is the handiwork of this Parliament. Parliament went into it with its eyes open. It knew that the retail price would be 6d. per lb. It knew how much the grower was about to get, and how much the cane-cutter was to be paid. There has been a lot of talk about the high wages of the cane-cutter, and of this &#34; spoon-fed &#34; industry. But all the facts were well known when the agreement was in the hands of Parliament. Parliament deliberately accepted it. No honorable member who waa at that time in Parliament can now evade his responsibility. If we have erred - and I contend that we have not - we have done so in good company. If we have any differences of opinion on the matter we can discuss them on their merits. There is room enough, goodness knows, for difference of opinion; but the question ought not to be made a party one. At any rate, I propose to place the responsibility for the agreement where it belongs, namely, upon the shoulders of Parliament. I take the responsibility for having brought it before Parliament; Parliament must take the responsibility&#39; for accepting it, well knowing, as it did, that the retail cost would be 6d. per lb. and that the price would fall to 5d. before the end of the third year. It has fallen to 5d.. and it cannot fall any lower. </para>

                    <para>When the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> spoke, he did not attempt to deal with the charge that the high price of sugar was due to the exorbitant wages of the cane-workers or exorbitant profits of the growers ; but other honorable members did not hesitate to attribute the high price of sugar to this cause. It is quite true- that the wages of the workers have materially increased since 1914; but, of course, that fact was perfectly well known to honorable members in 1920, the award increasing the rates being then in force. In 1914 cane-cutters received 12s. a day; in 1922 they received 21s. 4d. per day - an increase of 78 per cent. But wages in the sugar industry have not increased more than those in other industries. In the same period the wages of coalminers increased from 54s. per shift to 99s. per shift - an increase of 83 per cent., and the wages of labourers increased from 48s. per shift to 99s. per shift - an approximate increase of 107 per cent. As for shearers, their pay increased from 24s. per 100 sheep in 1914, to 35s. in 1922, and, in Queensland, to 40s. - an increase of 46 per cent. Weekly wages in that industry were &#163;3 6s. in 1914; in 1922 they were &#163;4 16s. in all the States except Queensland - an increase of 45 per cent. ; and they were &#163;5 9s. 6d. in Queensland - an increase of 65 per cent. The wages of shed hands in 1914 were &#163;2 12s. 6d., and, in 1922, &#163;3 12s. - an increase of 37&#163; per cent. Slaughtermen in Melbourne received, eight years ago, 80s. a week; in 1922 they received 120s. - an increase of 50J per cent. Slaughtermen in Sydney were paid 85s. a week in 1914, and 145s. a week in 1922, which represents an increase of 70 per cent. In Brisbane the slaughtermen were paid 70s. in 1914, and 105s. in 1922 - an increase of 50 per cent. With respect to meat-work employees, labourers in Sydney were paid 60s. in 1914; at the 31st December, 1921, they were being paid 105s. per week - an increase of 75 per cent. In Melbourne the pay was 48s. in 1914, and 92s. at the end of last year - an increase of 92 per cent.; while in Brisbane, meat work labourers were paid 42s. 6d. in 1914 and 85s. a week at the end of 1921 - representing an increase of 100 per cent. Agricultural labourers in 1914-15 were being paid from 20s. to 25s. a week, while, in 1920, their wages had risen to 40s. weekly, representing an increase of about 60 per cent. </para>
                    <para>So much for high wages as an element in the price of sugar. Now as to prices of raw materials and the refined article. Although the price of sugar has risen, it has not done so proportionately more than the price of many other commodities. </para>
                    <para class="block">There has been such an outcry in these latter days about the retail cost of sugar that it is well for honorable members to be reminded of certain correlated facts. The following table should prove of especial interest to them: - </para>
                    <para class="block">The cost of living, as applied to these staple articles of diet, reveals an increase which is comparable with, and, in some oases, in excess of, the price of sugar. I emphasize the percentages of increase in respect of butter, bread, and jam. I have every respect for the jam maker. I represent an electorate- which, produces no sugar but which provides the Australian table with the very finest jam  manufactured  in the Commonwealth. Mine is a great fruit-growing electorate - the finest _ in Australia, it embraces the most magnificent country and the most beautiful city in all Australia. It has most historic interests. It has a salubrious climate and an energetic and most intelligent people. But it does not produce sugar. ! Yet I go about the whole country defending the sugar agreement! </para>
                    <para>There is nothing in the agreement which the House can usefully discuss at this stage. It has come to an <inline font-style="italic">impasse.</inline> It is face to face with its own handiwork. Parliament accepted the agreement with its eyes open. If (honorable members do not accept my assurance, the records will show that I clearly pointed out that the price would be 6d. per lb. At that time, indeed, some honorable members were apprehensive that it might be even more; while the present honorable member for Parramatta - as I have already mentioned - saw through  the  darkness of the oncoming yea.rs the rosy tints of a brighter day, and he ventured the opinion that the price would be 5d. in the third year of the agreement. So it is to be. </para>
                    <para>The House, while engaged in discussing its own agreement, will not be able to re- duce the price of sugar. That cannot be brought below, the price to which it is presently to bo reduced. I emphasize that the retail charge cannot be reduced below 5d., and that it cannot be reduced to 5d. until the Government&#39;s overdraft has been wiped off. The Minister for Trade and* Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> has fixed 1st November as the date on which the reduced price shall come into force; but if the overdraft can be cleared off before that day, the price of sugar will fall as from that very moment. </para>
                    <para>The position may be set out in this manner : Do the figures which have been submitted by the Minister for Trade and Customs faithfully reflect the actual facts? The honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse)</inline> has submitted an amendment. He suggests that  the whole subject-matter shall be referred to a Select Committee. I can scarcely agree with the honorable member upon that point. In my view, the proper Committee to undertake the task of settling the points in dispute is the Public Accounts Committee. The Government will welcome the reference of the  whole  question to that body. The Public Accounts Committee may have access to all the documents, which it can. analyze, and may have at its disposal such professional assistance as it thinks proper. The Committee may then present its .report to the House, when we shall then be dealing with the question in a proper manner. That is so because this is an agreement which sprang from the House, and for which the House must take full responsibility. The Government have presented accounts as they were handed to us. Honorable members can hardly expect that we ourselves have gone into .them,; they were handed to us by our professional advisers. Let the accounts be checked, and the matter reviewed by the Public Accounts Committee, and no useful purpose can be served in discussing the matter until such a report is presented. On behalf of the Government, I say that it is our earnest desire to reduce sugar to the lowest price that is possible under the agreement, and to do it at the earliest possible moment. If the Public Accounts Committee think that can be done a day sooner than suggested toy the Minister for Trade and Customs, the Government will be only too pleased to take action. The position- having been put on behalf of the Government, I submit we may well turn our attention to other and more pressing business. The honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse)</inline> is not present, and I do not know who is acting for him., but if the amendment is modified by substituting &#34; Public Accounts Committee &#34; for &#34; Select Committee &#34; we shall accept it. </para>

If I endeavoured to steer my course clear from all protests, .the position would become impossible - honorable members opposite protest against my very existence. I am not talking of the minority now, but of this House and Parliament, and surely unanimity is not expected on any question. The House deliberately accepted this price. Will honorable members show me what item- is to be cut down ? The price to the miller ? The price to the grower? What? I leave the matter there. We are prepared to accept the amendment, and the House can return to the question whenever further information is before us. </para>

                        <para>.-  It is unfortunate for- the House that, after waiting from the middle of last week, we have not now a statement which clears the atmosphere in regard to this question. We were under the impression that to-day certain further information and details would be forthcoming; but we have only this statement by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes).</inline> I point out that we have not even been supplied with copies of that statement, although we are expected, as a deliberative assembly, to debate it now. I wish to show in a few brief sentences how the position is even more unfair. If we compare the present statement with the previous statement made bv the Prime Minister we find that the two conflict. In the former, the deficit on 1st March, 1921, was estimated at &#163;220,802, and at that time he said the additional charge to the public of Australia was lid. per lb. Now we get a statement that the price cannot be reduced beyond a Id. per lb. Why these conflicting statements? I made reference to this matter on two previous occasions, and received no explanation, and no explanation is forthcoming to-day. </para>

                            <para>- I know the honorable member would like me to be ruled out of order because I am now able to show the position as it is. If the price cannot be reduced by l&#163;d. per lb., or, as now proposed, a little over, I contend I am perfectly justified in endeavouring to make the position clear. It is not for me, but for the Government, to show what can or cannot be done, and to submit statements that do not conflict.

                            <para>-But we have the full figures, and we have been given a statement that conflicts with the previous statement. If we had a deficit of only &#163;220,802 at that time, and we have been selling for 6d. since, where has the money gone? This is an important point, for the amount involved is very considerable. Some part of it may have been expended on the importation of sugar. I cannot say whether that is so or not, but we ought to be advised as to what is the exact position. The Prime Minister to-day submitted to us a statement which leads  us  nowhere. The object of it was to show that sugar could not be sold at less than 5d. per lb. That, however, is in conflict with a previous statement made by the right honorable gentleman. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable members are aware that when there is an amendment before the Chair an honorable member who has already spoken to the general question must confine himself to that amendment. I have been following the Leader of the Opposition, and it seems to me that he has not, so far, transgressed that rule.  His  speech, so far, has a direct relation to the amendment of the amendment submitted by the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anstey)</inline> advocating a reduction, in the price of sugar. </para>

                            <para>- I submit that I am perfectly in order in showing from a previous statement made by the Prime Minister that there should be in hand a considerable sum in excess of the amount required to wipe out the estimated deficit. Speaking in this House on 30th March, 1920, the right honorable gentleman stated, as reported in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> volume XCL, page &#34;948, that it was estimated that on 1st&#39; March, 1921, there would be a deficit of &#163;220,802. Take the whole position from that date to 1st July, 1922, a period of about fifteen months. The approximate consumption during that period would be 337,000 tons. The Prime Minister said that l&#163;d. per lb. out of the total of 6d. per lb. was an increase necessary to meet the extra cost involved in the purchase of foreign sugar. On 337,000 tons that additional Hd. per lb. would yield &#163;4,718,000. What then has become of the balance after the wiping off of the deficit of &#163;220,802. We ought to know why it should be necessary to continue to sell sugar at 6d. per lb., when the total deficit, on the date I have mentioned, was only &#163;220,802. We have had no explanation from the Prime Minister.  The right honorable gentleman has merely given us a bald statement m which there is no reference to this additional amount of money which has been collected. T have been endeavouring to ascertain the facts for myself by probing into such figures as are available. I find that during the year 1920-21, 116,274 tons, of sugar were purchased from abroad. No reference to that fact has been made by the Government. The cost of that sugar, so far as I can ascertain, was&#62; &#163;6,560,375. I do not know whether these figures are substantially correct; but the Government should be in a position to give us definite information on the point. If sold at &#163;30 6s. 8d. per ton that sugar would yield the Government &#163;3,526,978, so that presumably on the transaction there was a loss of &#163;3,033,397 in addition to the deficit already existing. The Prime Minister has told us nothing about that transaction. It would seem, however, from the figures quoted by him on 30th March, 1920, and to which I referred a few moments ago, that the price of sugar should have been reduced to 5d. per lb. long&#39; before the- present time. Surely, the Government who control the whole business should be able to tell the people what is the exact position. It ought not to be necessary for honorable members to have to seek information from various sources to clear up the position for themselves. I thought that we would have had from the Prime Minister to-day a statement justifying the maintenance of the price of sugar at 5d. per lb. until 1st November next as proposed by bini. I thought that he would have supplied full information so that we might know what justification there was for that contention; but he has not done so </para>

I am not finding fault with the agreement itself. My sole concern is as to what under the agreement should be the price of sugar to the people. It has been claimed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Theodore, Mr. Gillies,</inline> and also by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walker,</inline> subject to certain conditions, that the price should be l&#163;d. per lb. less than it is. The Government, up to the present, have not put before us any facts to justify the continuance of the price at 6d. per lb. until 1st November next, as now proposed by them. According to the Prime Minister&#39;s ora figures, allowing for an additional quantity of sugar that was imported to make good the local shortage, and of which no mention has been made by the Government, there should be in hand a sum considerably in excess of &#163;1,000,000 out of which to make good the deficit of &#163;200,000. That being so, I want to know why the price of sugar was not reduced to 5d. per lb. at least two mouths ago. Our contention is that it should be sold at 4$d. per lb. Our amendment in favour of such a reduction having been defeated, we are now proposing that the price be reduced to 4fd. per lb. </para>

                            <para>- The Prime Minister, speaking in this House in March, 1920, said that the retailer&#39;s profit was  &#163;8  9s. 5d.per ton. That works out at nine-tenths of a penny per lb. The House has been invited to vote against our proposal on the ground that it is impossible for the Government to reduce the price of sugar below 5d. per lb. We have no documentary evidence to support that contention. Allowing for a purchase of 116,274 tons at &#163;56 per ton we should still be &#163;1,000,000 to the good. In the circumstances, honorable members are not justified in voting for the motion submitted by the Government. </para>

What the Prime Minister is accepting from the Country party can be accepted without any danger, but it will not relieve the consumers, who will still (have to pay the present price of sugar until the Government feel disposed to reduce it to 5d. </para>

                            <para>- We shall vote against it, but I do. not want honorable members to run away with the idea that the table read by the Prime Minister puts everything right. It certainly conflicts with his statements made on a previous occasion. Since those in authority have led us to believe that, in order that the Government might be recouped the additional expenditure of buying sugar overseas, 11/2d. per lb. was charged over and above the price required to enable the terms of the sugar agreement to be carried out, it is only right that the price should now be reduced by that 11/2d. and fixed at 41/2d. However, the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Austey)</inline> proposes to allow an extra1/8d. to cover unforeseen contingencies.  His  proposal is perfectly sound, and I hope that the House will support it. </para>

                    <para>.- We all realize that it may be beneficial to the Commonwealth  and New  Zealand to have a reciprocal Tariff, but the question is whether the Tariff as drawn up is equitable as between the two countries. For some time past efforts have been made between the Governments of the Commonwealth  and  the Dominion to come to some understanding on this matter. For a considerable period nothing was  accomplished,  but  we  are told that quite recently at a Conference the Ministers of Customs of the two negotiating countries came to  an  understanding that a reciprocal Tariff as drawn up by them should be submitted in their respective Parliaments) simultaneously. I do not know that it is necessary for us to accept all the items in the schedule <inline font-style="italic">in, globo.</inline></para>

                        <para>- If any item in the schedule is rejected, the whole arrangement will fall to the ground. Parliament should not be faced with such a <inline font-style="italic">contretemps.</inline> Was it not avoidable? Could not the Minister for Trade and Customs have taken the precaution to insure that, in the event of any one item being rejected either by this Parliament or that of the sister Dominion, it could be dealt with separately at some future stage rather than that the whole schedule should be jeopardized ? There are certainly some items about which I am in doubt. There may be good reasons for their acceptance; there may be equally good reasons for their deletion from the list. The point is that the Minister has not provided sufficient information concerning details. With respect to iron and steel, for example, New Zealand appears to be about to reap a. considerable benefit compared with the preferential British rates and those  applicable to foreign countries. I do not know whether this Parliament will be justified in indulging in such a degree of reciprocity. If Australia&#39;s iron and steel industry is to be placed in a worse position than that under which it is suffering to-day, I am bound to say that, at the risk of breaking down the whole of these reciprocal arrangements, I shall endeavour to have the iron and steel duties recast. </para>

                        <para>- Then I invite the Minister to explain at a later stage exactly how that will come about, and to go into specific details respecting other important features of the schedule. Honorable members cannot be expected to make themselves acquainted with the subject along similar lines of comparison on such facts and figures as have so far been put before them. From such examination as I have had an opportunity to make, there appear to be quite a number of items in regard to which we will be giving away more than we are likely to get. New Zealand seems to have got the better of the deal. I make that comment particularly in respect of timber. Upon rough sawn timber, the produce of New Zealand, in sizes of 12 inches by 6 inches, the present duties are 3s. preferential, and 4s. general, per 100 super feet. That line is now proposed to be admitted from the Dominion free. What will be the effect generally upon the&#39; Australian timber industry? During the Tariff debate last year, honorable members on this side pointed out that the timber duties imposed appeared to be inadequate, and that the outcome would be to render a large number of men unemployed. Their prophecy has been fulfilled. Many mills have closed, and thousands of workers have lost their jobs. Will not the effect of still further reducing the duties upon various timbers imported from New Zealand be to accentuate the present unhappy state of affairs? Timber for the manufacture of boxes is now to be imported from New Zealand free, whereas the rate fixed last year was1s. per 100 super feet. With so many thousands unemployed in Australia, their numbers being increased almost every day, Parliament should be exceedingly cautious. Will this new schedule aggravate the unemployment difficulty? I repeat that it will be unfair to ask this Committee to accept the schedule <inline font-style="italic">in globo.</inline> Every item should be considered on its merits. I do not say that the whole should be rejected merely because one or two items may be deemed to be injurious to the Commonwealth; but, although I am desirous of bringing about a reciprocal agreement with New Zealand, I want to know, first, whether the end will justify the means. </para>

                        <para>- Nevertheless, there have been complaints with respect to the proposed duties on New Zealand timbers.

                    <para>As owners of three mills (and another in course of construction) in Tasmania, we view with much concern the proposal to admit New Zealand timber into the Commonwealth free of all duty, and the day that this takes effect we shall bo forced to close down our mills for the following reasons: - </para>
                    <para>We produce mostly Huon pine, and our greatest and practically only competition is with New Zealand white pine for house and office furniture, shelving,, and anywhere where white timber is required. It is fallacy to state or think that all New Zealand pine is used for boxes; such is not the case as, from the writer&#39;s experience as one of the largest importers of New Zealand timbers, quite 40 per cent, of New Zealand timbers is used for other purposes than boxes. </para>
                    <para>We have &#163;38,000 invested in mills, chiefly on the west coast of Tasmania; and now, while mining is so dead, our mills, together with Dunkley Brothers Limited, of Zeehan, constitute practically the only live industry on the Tasmanian west coast. Our mills at present practically keep the township of Strahan, and hundreds of people are dependent on our keeping going. Our operations cover the area down the coast towards Port Davey, from Strahan to Queenstown, and Strahan to Zeehan - a vast area of difficult country, only understood by bushmen who have practically lived all their lives in that part of the country, and who, in nine cases out of ten, own their own homes and are tied to the district. </para>
                    <para>The proposal to admit New Zealand timber free, while we pay the Tasmanian Government a royalty of 2s. 6d. per 100 feet - at present ls. 6d., working under a temporary rebate - is too big a handicap for us to live under, and we would be forced to immediately cease all our operations and close up. We consider the following a far more workable proposition: - </para>
                    <para>New Zealand white pine is practically the only white timber imported into the Commonwealth and has no competition, except for boxes and cases, other than Tasmanian Huon pine and Queensland hoop pine; <inline font-style="italic">and it can easily pay a</inline> 5s. <inline font-style="italic">duty on all that is used for any other purposes hut boxes and oases,</inline> which latter is chiefly the second quality portion of the log. Admit New Zealand white pine for the use of boxes and cases only <inline font-style="italic">Free;</inline> but, for any other purpose, let it pay a 5a. duty. Admit New Zealand rimu for the ase of boxes&#39; and cases only, <inline font-style="italic">Free;</inline> but, for any other purpose, let it pay a 3S. 6d. duty. Let there be no restrictions as to what class of boxes and cases are made from New Zealand timbers, and that will absorb all their second quality, which is what they want a market for. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">I do not know whether the statements made in the letter are correct or not, but this combination of saw-millers claim that the reciprocal Tariff will have injurious effects to the extent of closing some of the mills. Those mills are in Tasmania, and I should like to hear from some of the representatives of that State exactly what is the position. We ought to know the full effect of the alterations in the Tariff in regard to the different items. </para>

                        have gone pretty carefully through this schedule of the proposed Australian-New Zealand reciprocal Tariff agreement, and I think great care has been taken by the Tariff Board and the Minister in charge to come to an equitable agreement by which Australia will, at any rate, benefit as largely as New Zealand. I find that in the case of many items the advantages are distinctly in favour of the Commonwealth, and I think a few instances may be interesting. The New Zealand duty on locomotives, which are largely constructed in the Commonwealth, has been reduced from 35 per cent, to 20 per cent., the lowest duty against any part of the world; on doors and sashes, from 35 per cent, to 20 per cent,, again the lowest; leather, from 5d. to 3d., or from 25 per cent, to 15 per cent.; milk, preserved and condensed, from 40 per cent, to 25 per cent., again the lowest; hams and bacon, 4d. to 2d. per lb., again the lowest ; and wo arc large producers of these commodities for export.

The New Zealand duty on frozen meat has been reduced from 35 per cent, to 10 per cent., which is lower than the lowest duty imposed against any other country; and sugar, formerly &#163;d. per lb., is made free, and it is hoped that as the industry expands we may be able to export to the Dominion of New Zealand. </para>

If wo have sufficient encouragement, we hope to produce all the sugar we require, and to have a surplus which will, under this arrangement, have a free market. Jams, jellies, marmalades, and preserves are reduced from 3d. to 2&#163;cl. - a fact which should appeal to the honorable member for Wilmot <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Atkinson)</inline> - and the duty on citrus fruit pulp has been reduced from 35 pea- cent, to 20 per cent., which is the best that .is given to any country. In the tropical parts of the Commonwealth, as well as on the River Murra}&#39;, also in South Queensland and New South Wales, citrus fruits are grown to a very large extent,&#39; and such a concession as this is a matter of very great importance to those engaged in the industry. Then we find that the duty on pineapples, and other preserved fruits, which is at present 40 per cent, against Australia, is to be reduced under this agreement to 35 per cent. That is not a very substantial reduction, but it will alford some relief. On oranges the present duty against Australia is Id. per lb. The item is now to be free, so far as importations from Australia are concerned. On bananas there is a duty of Id. per lb. This likewise is to be removed, making them free. We are convinced that the production of bananas in Queensland will largely exceed the requirements of the whole Commonwealth. </para>

                <para>Mi-. CORSER.- In respect of a surplus production it becomes necessary sometimes to take a somewhat lower price than that at which we are prepared to sell generally, or that which would pay for all production. It is a good thing to have at our door a market which will take our surplus production of bananas. I would point out also- that the agreement between New Zealand and South Africa, whereby maize from South Africa was admitted into New Zealand at a low rate of duty, has been cancelled, so that Australia will how be on the same footing as South Africa in competing for the New Zealand -trade. We shall thus be able to do a trade with New Zealand, which was impossible while we had to compete with maize grown by black labour in South Africa, and admitted under a preferential duty. </para>
                <para>Currants and raisins are at present admitted into New Zealand free of duty from all countries. Bub New Zealand has provided under the general Tariff a rate of 2d. per lb. That duty is at present suspended, but the position is to be considered after the agreement has been concluded, with a view to bringing the suspended duty into effect, and thus giving Australia a preference of 2d. per lb. </para>

I understand that when the timber merchants of Queensland waited on the Tariff Board some little time ago their anxiety was not so much. &#39; to secure a variation of the items under this reciprocal Tariff as to obtain an amendment of the Commonwealth Customs Tariff, because they recognise that many of the soft woods which are now being imported from New Zealand are a steadily decreasing quantity. In some cases the exportation of New Zealand timber has been prohibited. </para>

                        <para>- That is the timber I had in mind. On the other hand, Australian hardwood is extensively imported by New Zealand, which does not produce hardwood. Under this agreement, we are receiving the benefit of a special duty in respect of Australian hardwood. The great objection voiced by the deputation of Queensland timber merchants which waited on the Tariff Board related to the duties on Baltic and oregon timber. It was contended that, in respect of all such imports, there should be additional protection. I think there is good ground for that contention. I have always urged that the Australian timber industry is not sufficiently protected against importations of Baltic and  Oregon  timbers, which are being dumped in the Commonwealth. The Tariff Board informed the deputation, and has also assured me that, having made, the fullest inquiries, they, are <inline font-style="italic">going</inline> into the question of making a recommendation in regard to a variation of the Commonwealth Tariff with a view to the proper protection of the timber industry. If that be done, there can be no question that, as the result of this reciprocal arrangement, we shall benefit largely. I would impress upon honorable members that the sooner we accept this agreement and so allow it to come into operation, the better. The Parliament of New Zealand, as I have said, has agreed to it, and as soon as it has passed this Legislature, it can be put into effect. I understand that there will be no further delay. </para>

                    <para>. -  I have a few observations to offer in regard to the timber industry. I am not satisfied that this agreement, so far as that industry is concerned, will benefit Australia, but I know that it will suit New Zealand. We are, necessarily, importers of softwood timbers from New Zealand, and on the other hand, New Zealand imports all the hardwood she requires from this country. It is a question of who is to get the better bargain. While I do not ask that we shall reap the chief gain, I do nob think we should suffer material injury. </para>

                        <para>- At all events, we ought not to have the thin end of it. I have no hard cash invested in the timber trade, but I know that in Victoria the industry has had great trouble in holding its own during the last two years. When the Customs Tariff Bill was before the House, we endeavoured to secure an increase of certain duties but were unsuccessful, and it seems to me that this reciprocal arrangement with New Zealand will tend to defeat the object of some of the timber duties under the general Tariff. The Minister should be careful in dealing with this question. Not being a timber expert, I do not know that I can go into it exhaustively, but I do know that there is danger, and that the timber-milling trade is very anxious about this matter. The Minister must be aware of the objections which the milling trade have to this scheme, and I hope that whatever is done will be in the best interests of Australia. </para>

                    <para>This looks an anomaly, as we do not think the Government ever intended to give New Zealand a preference over British-made goods, and that New Zealand would load the Australian-made, article 10 per cent. higher than on the British article. We are enclosing extracts from correspondence received from Messrs. Briscoe and Company Limited, Dunedin, Wellington, and Auckland; also from Messrs. Wingate and Company, and Spedding Limited, Auckland. You will notice from this correspondence that they all say that unless a reciprocal arrangement is arrived at between the New Zealand and AustralianGovernments they will in future be compelled to buy their requirements in England. You wall also note that they all expect, the reciprocal Tariff will be fixed up in a way satisfactory to Australian manufacturers. It will therefore come as a surprise to our New Zealand clients to know that the duty is 10 per cent. higher on Australian than on British-made sheets. </para>

                <para class="block">It is evident that New Zealand is determined to block out Australian trade in this line. Perhaps the British article does not come so much into competition with the local material as the Australian article does. We may be manufacturing something which can be produced in New Zealand, whereas England may not be doing so. However, it is peculiar that in a reciprocal arrangement the Australian manufacturer should be placed at such a disadvantage. The following are copies of extracts from letters from Briscoe and Company Limited:- 1st July, 1922. </para>
                <para>Our retaliation Tariff of 20 per cent., on Australian imports, as against 10 per cent. on other British, is a further factor in increasing the landed cost of durabestos; but we expect, as previously stated, that this clause will be revised during the coming season. 20th June, 1922. </para>
                <para>It is quite on the cards that the Tariff adjustment will within the next few months, put Australian imports on the same footing as other British goods. This would decrease the landed cost by 10 per cent. on invoice value, but it would not be sufficient to meet competition such as we mention: Please advise when quoting what your usual home consumption price is. Wo may be asked to pay dumping duty if export value is lower than home consumption. </para>
                <para class="block">New Zealand is not only placing Australian manufacturers at 100 per cent. disadvantage as compared with British manufacturers; it is also on the look-out to ascertain that the former are not resorting to dumping methods by selling in the Dominion at a price lower than the home consumption price. Other things being equal, it is only fair for the New Zealand Government to treat the Australian manufacturer in this way; but, seeing that the latter has already to pay a higher duty than is payable on the British article, it is sought to provide that he should not endeavour to secure an advantage over his competitor by selling at a lower price than the home consumption price. Further extracts from letters from Briscoe and Company Limited are as follow :  -  14th July, 1922. </para>
                <para>In regard to durabestos, owing to the extra cost caused through the preferential Tariff, we find the small lot we had from you very slow of sale against the cheaper sheets. We are not therefore buyers at the present moment of asbestos sheets. 13th July, 1922. </para>
                <para>Until the reciprocal Tariff is adjusted between your Federal Government and this Dominion, there is no chance of bringing durabestos sheets across. The preferential duty puts them out of court. We . can land British sheets at so much less. </para>
                <para class="block">I could quote other extracts to show how our manufacturers will be at a disadvantage.

                        <para>- Broadly speaking, the commercial community know very little about Tariffs, especially those recently submitted to Parliament, and they know less about political organization. When they approach a Government Department they are about as learned as a child in regard to the steps they should take. I am inclined to agree with the Leader of the Opposition that if there are many anomalies in the schedule similar to that to which I have just drawn attention we should not accept itin <inline font-style="italic">globo,</inline> but should consider it in detail. </para>

I would like to know whether we are likely to gain by making the interchange between the two Dominions free. I can inform the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton),</inline> that honey sent from Australia to Great&#39; Britain a few years ago for exhibition purposes took the first prize in competition with the whole world. There are many people in Australia who are endeavouring to put this industry on a sound and profitable basis, but so far it has not been found a profitable undertaking, except on a small scale. It is. a well known fact that the bees themselves absorb no man&#39;s profit. Their industry is all profit to Australia, and I do not?  wish to see anything done in this agrees ment which will- damage the prospects of those who are putting up a gallant fight to establish the bee industry in this country. </para>

                        <para>- And possibly the same remark applies to New Zealand, because it is one of the great sources of successful production in colder climates. In Australia, we rely too much on natural surroundings, whereas in countries where the climatic conditions are harsh, the producers take more trouble. For instance, they see that their animals, or, in the case of apiarists, their insects, are provided for at the proper time. Our industries suffer at times because Australians are only too ready to accept the climatic conditions as they come. If the Dominion of New Zealand can produce more honey than Australia does, the free admission of beeswax from the Dominion to Australia might injure the Australian bee industry. I ask the Minister to look into the matter. </para>

When I asked the Minister, he put mo off - though unintentionally, no doubt - t by talking about the balance of trade.&#39; What I am after is not merely an understanding of that factor.&#34; I desire to see that, under this new arrangement, we shall, as nearly as possible, balance our giving and our taking. Before this reciprocal arrangement was mooted, we had established a balance of trade with NewZealand. Will that* balance be disturbed, and, if so, will it be altered unfavorably as an outcome of this preferential understanding? Wc should know whether any such change will be in the direction of unevenly benefiting New Zealand, or whether the preponderance of benefit will be in our direction. </para>

But dealing with individual items shows that, whereas we are imposing no duty upon soap imported from New Zealand, that country proposes to set up a duty of 30 per cent, against our products. </para>

                        <para>- I am more keenly interested in the welfare of the men who produce the raw materials of which this and other manufactured lines are  made than in seeing that the manufac.turers themselves secure any very considerable benefits. Those who have given the most should be safeguarded in getting something substantial back. I notice that tallow may be sent free between the two Dominions. What of the balance there? Possibly, New Zealand will be sending us more than we send to the Dominion. Most of our tallow to-day goes overseas. There are various items in respect to which it would appear that the producers of the basic materials are being penalized, and I should like to be shown where and how they are to be compensated. </para>

                        <para>- Even so, if any glaring anomalies are revealed, the Minister, possibly, may be able to secure redress. The honorable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">((Mr. Mathews)</inline> has called attention to one striking anomaly in respect of an important article of manufacture which we export to New Zealand. On the other hand, there are very many satisfactory 0 features of the schedule. One in particular concerns the export of fresh fruit. . Queenslanders will be able to send their bananas into New Zealand free of duty. The orange-growers of Parramatta will be able to do the same with their fruit, and the apple-growers of Tasmania will be . placed in a very favorable position. There are many points that are satisfactory to Australia from the stand-point of reciprocal trade in the Tariff now under discussion. But I hope the Minister will find some way out of a most unfair and anomalous position that has grown up around asbestos sheet manufacture. At present, there are two or three firms in Australia who are doing a large export business with New Zealand, an export business that in the case of one firm runs into five figures per month. As the honorable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mathews)</inline> pointed out, this industry was well established in Australia during the war, and those concerned ask for nothing more than that their products shall be admitted into- New Zealand at the same rate as is charged for similar goods of British manufacture. </para>

                        <para>- Large quantities of these asbestos cement sheets go from Australia to New Zealand, not to compete with any New Zealand industry, but with imports from other countries there. Under this reciprocal Tariff, the duties on these goods in Australia are: - British preferential, 25 per cent. ; foreign, 35 per cent. ; New Zealand, 20 per cent. The New Zealand duties are: - British preferential, 10 per cent.; general (including Australia), 20 per cent. Here is an anomaly at once. Australia is conceding to New Zealand a 5 per cent, lower rate &#39;than to Great Britain, while New Zealand is conceding to Great Britain a 10 per cent, lower Tate than to Australia. The goods I am talking about have found a very good market in New Zealand, and the industry in Australia is of considerable importance. I have not the total -export figures in mind, but, judging by the exports of individual firms, I should  say  that trade to the extent of about &#163;250,000 a year is at stake. One naturally looks for the reason why there should be this variation in the reciprocal Tariff, and why Australia has not been given the British preferential rate in New Zealand on asbestos and cement sheets. It cannot be because New Zealand desires to protect a. local industry, because at present asbestos and cement sheets are not manufactured in the Dominion, and if an industry were established there, Great Britain, with only 10 per cent. duty, would be a keener competitor than Australia. She would be so, even at the same rate of duty. </para>

                        <para>- That is the exact position, and a fine industry that has been built up in Australia will be prejudiced. The figures which I have given show that, under this reciprocal Tariff, Australian goods will pay in Customs duty 300 per cent. more than British goods, and nearly double the amount collected in New Zealand on foreign goods. I have already quoted a letter written by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Downie</inline> Stewart, the Dominion Minister for Customs, when he was here in April last, stating fairly definitely that he could see no objection to admitting Australian goods of the class I am referring to into New Zealand on the same basis as British goods. I have been advised from New Zealand that British preference has been refused to Australian asbestos sheets because they are classified as terra cotta tiles, the manufacturers of which in New Zealand require protection. Consequently, a proper request now to make to New Zealand is that there should be a special classification of asbestos cement sheets,&#38;c., in order that they may be admitted at the same rate as British goods. </para>

                        <para>- I want to emphasize the fact that if the proposed rate against Australia at 20 per cent. <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> is confirmed, it will be very hard for Australian manufacturers of asbestos cement sheets to compete in the New Zealand market against British goods, but if Australia is put on the same rate, by giving, perhaps, quicker deliveries and having an advantage  in the shorter transit, resulting in less breakages of the material, Australia may be able to hold a share cf the business. It is important that, at this stage, nothing should happen to jeopardize an industry of which we are justly proud. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. I think importations of this class of goods into Australia are negligible. I have put the case as fairly as I could. The Minister himself admits there is an anomaly in this Tariff. It will not do New Zealand any harm, and will certainly assist an important Australian industry if it is rectified and Australian goods are given the same treatment as British goods. In view of the statements contained in the letter from the New Zealand Minister of Customs last April, and the sympathetic tone of the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.</inline> Rodgers)  to-night, there should be no objection to a reclassification of asbestos cement sheeting, &#38;c. I x trust that the Minister will see that this anomaly is not permitted to stand, because, generally speaking, in other directions the reciprocal Tariff is not objected to.  We know that the balance of trade, as between here and New Zealand, is in favour of Australia. We desire to &#39;give our New Zealand cousins what advantage we can in our own market. </para>

I hope that New Zealand in turn will recognise that, although Parliaments cannot hack about a reciprocal treaty, or allow a preferential Tariff to be held over month after month, and possibly year after year, any anomaly should be adjusted. I shall vote for this reciprocal Tariff, hoping that the anomaly I have pointed out will be adjusted by New Zealand after proper representations have been made, as I think they will be, by the Commonwealth Minister to the powers that be over there. </para>

I certainly should not be inclined to accept the Tariff as it is. </para>

                    <para>. - The very fact that the honorable member for Parramatta <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pratten)</inline> has been able to point to a serious anomaly in connexion with one item in this preferential Tariff, seems to me to prove that a close analysis of the schedule, by those who know something of the industries affected, by it, would reveal quite a number of defects. That is one reason why  the Government should accede to the request of the. Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> that the schedule be dealt with item by item, so that the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> could give the reasons why certain concessions were made aud others refused . </para>

                        <para>- I propose to enumerate quite a number of items in respect of which New Zealand has given Great Britain a greater preference than we are obtaining under this Tariff. On the surface, it may seem that some of the items are relatively unimportant to Australia, but an examination will show that, in many cases,- they are of much concern to us. Take, for instance, the item &#34; Coffee, roasted.&#34; Under its British Preferential Tariff New Zealand imposes a duty of 3d. per lb., whereas there is a duty of 5d. per lb. on imports from Australia. Then we come to &#34; Coffee, essence of, and Essence of Coffee, with milk or any other food substances,&#34; in respect of which the British preferential rate is 20 per cent.. and the duty against Australia 25 per cent. Item 17, relating to fruits preserved in juice or syrup, provides for a British preferential duty of 25 per cent., as compared with a duty of 35 per cent. against Australia. </para>

                <para>Mr.FEN TON.- The interjection just made by the Minister reminds me of &#39;a difficulty that confronts us in connexion with the consideration of all Tariff schedules. Are we always sure that goods that come from Great Britain are of British origin ? We are not. Britain may be made the medium through which goods from cheap-labour countries will be exported to New Zealand, where they will come into competition with Australian products in respect of which we have made this reciprocal agreement with the Dominion Government. </para>

British preference, 25 per cent. against Australia; blankets, shawls and rugs of wool, or containing wool, 20 per cent. British preference, 25 per cent. against Australia; and hats, caps or bonnets, &#38;c, British preferential Tariff, 25 per cent., Tariff against Australia 30 per cent. There is also a difference of 5 per cent. against Australia as compared with the British preferential rates imposed by New Zealand in respect of mouldings and panels and coil pieces; while the duty on paper bags and wrapping paper is 5s. per cwt. under the British preferential Tariff as compared with 6s. per cwt. on imports from Australia. An examination of the schedule shows that the Minister, in introducing it to the House, was unduly optimistic. Under it we are giving away a lot to New Zealand. The fact that the Dominion Parliament passed the schedule <inline font-style="italic">in globo,without</inline> making any amendment whatever, suggests to me that it is well satisfied with the agreement that has been made; and I am inclined to think that New Zealand has got a little the better of the deal. </para>

In the old days there was a very strong agitation on the part of Queensland millers against the free importation of New Zealand white pine, which is used for butter box making. In my humble judgment, this agreement will hit Tasmania and Queensland timber millers very hard. It will be especially harmful to those who are milling softwoods. Queensland pine is too good to be used for making butter boxes. New Zealand white pine is one of the timbers best suited for that purpose. </para>

                        <para>- I do not doubt it. New South Wales, South Australia, and Victoria use New Zealand white pine almost exclusively for butter box making. Such boxes when finished with in Great Britain, I understand, are sent in shooks to Sweden and elsewhere, where they are turned into matches, in which form they are doubtless returned to Australia to compete with the Australian product. </para>

                <para class="block">If we are to continue to export our butter in pine boxes, the day is not far distant when New Zealand will either prohibit the export of white pine or impose upon it an almost prohibitive duty. It is getting very scarce. The time may arrive when Australians will be obliged to look for another timber for butter boxes, or use another method of packing butter. Already those who use white pine have adopted a means of milling their timber that enables them to avoid cutting up more than half the quantity of timber they used in making their boxes ten years ago. </para>

                    <para>Anyhow, we do not intend to fight a losing battle, and if all New Zealand timber is admitted free that day we must close our mills, and hundreds on the west coast of Tasmania must suffer. We have been one of the few groups of Tasmanian millers that have managed to keep going constantly during the past twelve months of hard times. During that period we have paid big sums monthly to the Tasmanian Government in the shape of royalties, and the men and the district generally have had the rest. The company itself has been living &#34; on the smell of an oil rag.&#34; </para>

He says, in general terms, &#34; We argued about this and that, and I got the best I possibly could in the circumstances &#34;; but if honorable members had the details they might sympathize with the Minister in his struggle, and might be inclined to agree with him as to why he arrived at certain conclusions. The schedule itself contains elements of weakness. It establishes Great Britain as Australia&#39;s most serious competitor in the trade with New Zealand. In many cases the arrangement gives a distinct preference to Great Britain, the goods from which may have originated from foreign sources. </para>

                        <para>- In some cases a 10 per cent. preference is given to Great Britain. It is said that because Australia is not more than a few thousand miles from New Zealand, it has a natural freight advantage over Great Britain, which is so much further away; but it is all a matter of competition. Goods of a certain description may be landed in New Zealand from British ports at a cheaper freight than that prevailing from Australia to the Dominion. For instance, if the Peninsular and Oriental Company could secure loading they would trade to New Zealand, and the white sailors would come into competition with lascars. The cost of running a vessel largely influences the rate of freight charged. </para>

                    <para>- When we have worn ourselves to weariness, the Minister will rise and pour out a wealth of detail, which, had it been given in the initial stages, might have avoided a considerable amount of discussion. I hope that he will give us the details. He thinks that he. has made a big effort on behalf of Australia, but I believe that he could have done very much better. However, I am glad to know that if a serious injustice makes itself apparent in this schedule, redress can be obtained by giving notice. </para>

                    <para>.- The Committee should welcome the motion submitted by the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> and the policy which lies behind it. There are two ways of discussing a problem of this kind, as . the debate has already indicated. One method is to discuss the individual items of the schedule seriatim, and consider them on their merits; the other way is to discuss the broad general principle embodied in a proposal for reciprocity. The remarks of the honorable member for Maribyrnong, although he is a Tariff student, and was actively interested in the general Tariff recently passed by this Parliament, indicate clearly that he is not fully seised with what reciprocity means. It does not mean, surely, that one party to the agreement will get all that he wants. There must be plain give and take. In every walk of life reciprocity is the giving of something which one party wants for something which the other  wants, and the whole question is whether, in that method of bartering, this particular country, whose custodians we are, has had a fair deal. I shall show later on where I think we could have had a better deal if the Government had followed a different procedure, but, without endeavouring to deal with details, let me mention two items to which &#34;the honorable member for Maribyrnong has already referred. First, let me take Item 49, &#34; Blankets.&#34; It is very important that Australia should get as good an arrangement for Tariff admission into New Zealand as we can obtain with regard to all our rapidly expanding woollen industries. Without the reciprocity sanctioned by both Parliaments, and proclaimed, we have to pay a 35 per cent, duty if we send our blankets into New Zealand under the general Tariff. We will get them into New Zealand at 25 per cent, under this reciprocal agreement. Our only quarrel with the situation is that it would have been better to get the British rate of 20 per cent. Then we would have been 15 per cent, better off than under existing conditions. But we aro getting a 10 per cent, improvement, and that is two-thirds, at any rate, of what we desired. The same may be said in respect of boots and numbers of other articles. At present we have to pay 45 per cent, to get Australian boots into New Zealand. If this arrangement is sanctioned we shall be able to get them in at 35 per cent. The British preferential duty is 25 per cent., so that, if we had been able to secure the British rate, we would have been still better off; but we are getting half a loaf in place of nothing but competition with the outside world. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>I do not propose to dwell at length upon the individual items, for two reasons.  I have not sufficient information, nor have I been afforded an opportunity to investigate the incidence, of these 129 arbitrarily fixed items in the schedule.- But those items with which I am acquainted, and on which I am able to give judgment, are, in my view, dealt with properly. In other words, we are getting something better than we have at present. I am comforted also by the second reflection that the Tariff Board, whose concern it as to advise Parliament as to the wisdom of recommendations upon Customs and Excise duties, has examined and concurs in these propositions. We have the further knowledge that, under the Act which constitutes that Board, the latter will continue to watch the incidence of the reciprocal Tariff. It will be the Board&#39;s duty to advise the Minister or Parliament, or both, if any injury is inflicted upon Australia&#39;s industries by the operation of these arrangements. Therefore, this Committee may feel comforted in the knowledge that the be3t bargain that could have been struck in the circumstances has been achieved - supported as it is by the expert and specialized minds which have been working on the problems for many months past, and fortified by the knowledge that they will continue their survey of the actual effects of the arrangements generally. </para>
                <para>But the general principle of reciprocity must not be lost sight of. It stands - for a country such as this - on a perfectly sound basis; and the prospective advantage is all in favour of Australia. I say this more plainly now, when the Tariff has gone through the New . Zealand Legislature, than some -of us would have thought it discreet to do a week or so ago. New Zealand obviously realizes that she is about to get something which, at present, she has not; and she is prepared to let Australian manufacturers roam her markets, within the limits of the agreement. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, for the reason that we have left this reciprocal movement rather too late in order to reap the full advantage. New Zealand recently imposed what she regards as a Protective Tariff. Some of the infant industries of that Dominion which have begun to flourish behind that protective wall are loath to accept curtailment or to contemplate destruction at the hand of Australia&#39;s industries. Therefore, the New Zealand Legislature now proposes not to break down that guarding wall, but merely to lower it, in order to secure certain specific compensating advantages to that country. </para>

                <para>If one goes through these 129 items, one is bound to come to the conclusion that some of our Australian industries are likely to find substantial new markets; while, in return, we shall be offering certain New Zealand industries an entrance of a more favorable and generally easier character than has hitherto been afforded. A community of 5,000,000 people will be offering advantages to another community comprising 1,000,000; and, in such circumstances, the balance would appear to be in favour of the smaller community. A market of 5,000,000 people consumes more of the products of a community of 1,000,000 than <inline font-style="italic">vice</inline><inline font-style="italic">vers&#226;.</inline> But our industries, in many vital respects, are much more developed than those of New Zealand. Bearing that in mind, it will be perceived that, under this reciprocal Tariff, there will be something in the nature of an invasion of the New Zealand market by Australian industries for the first time. I say, then, that the balance of advantage will be distinctly in favour of the highly developed and organized community, such as is Australia, relatively, compared with New Zealand. But the Government have left the matter, unfortunately, late, when one contemplates the opportunity which has been afforded to secure full advantage of the British rates upon all items. I asked the Minister for Trade and Customs- some little while ago if he would be prepared to lay on the table all the correspondence which has passed between the two Governments upon this subject-matter, and the Minister promised that he would do so, provided it was not deemed harmful to take that course.  Later, the Minister intimated that it might be objectionable to lay all the correspondence on the table of the House ; but added that he would be glad to -&#176;how mp <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> documents.  T  have  not yet been provided with that opportunity; possibly that is due to the fact of the Minister for Trade and Customs having had his hands rather full during the past few days. I am not complaining, but I do suggest that if the papers had been made available they would have shown that New Zealand had* repeatedly asked the Commonwealth, before our Tariff was passed last year, to consider the question of reciprocity on a columnar basis. I am speculating now, of course, in the absence of those official papers;- but if they reveal a primal anxiety on the part of the Government of New Zealand to institute with the Commonwealth a British&#34; preferential Tariff rate reciprocity, and if it is seen that we have failed to avail&#39; ourselves of the invitation, then we have &#34; missed the bus &#34; ; and some of our industries will correspondingly suffer. &#39; I shall . be glad if, at some stage, the Minister advises honorable members whether I am right in this respect. </para>
                <para>If this Tariff is accepted in a large Australian spirit, and on the principle of give and take, I trust that it -will be the forerunner of other similar arrangements within the Empire. I speak particularly of our sister Dominions of Canada and South Africa. </para>

                        <para>- Tes ; there are lines along which we may suitably negotiate with India. There is a gigantic opening for us in India, with its 300,000,000 people gradually awakening to better economic conditions; and if we neglect that vast opportunity other countries will not do so, but will reap .the advantage. I speak now, .however, chiefly of the white communities which enjoy Dominion government. Later, I hope that an attempt may be made on the part of our Empire statesmen in London to arrange real reciprocity within the Empire - not an arrangement between the Dominions, but reciprocity on the part of -the Dominions respectively with the Mother Country. Up to about -eight or nine years ago - that is to say,, just. before the war - the policy which  is embodied in that -hope was spoken of in Britain .as &#34; preferential trade.&#34; It- was. generally frowned upon by &#39;the statesmen of the elder- countries within the Empire, and it was made to appear that the younger members of the British family were seeking concessions from the Mother Country. That is a narrow-minded, nonImperial view, no matter whether it be held here or in Great Britain. </para>

                        <para>- The view respecting reciprocity has changed, both in the Home Land and in the Dominions. The ideal of the British people trading among themselves is not now called preference, but is understood as a desire to reciprocate in trade matters as we do in many other directions. I believe that if the Ministers of Customs of the whole of the Dominions, sat down with the responsible leaders and thinkers of the Mother Country it would be possible, if not to &#39; arrange complete reciprocity, at any rate, to bring about a much fuller degree thereof than has ever yet been in contemplation. The British Empire is scattered over both hemispheres. While the people of the Old Land are rioting in summer in the northern hemisphere, we are hibernating in winter; and <inline font-style="italic">vice versa.</inline> There are, within the confines of the Empire, all the elements of human needs and happiness; and it would be wise and well if there could be brought about a league for trade which would be mutual and commonly beneficial to all the co-operating parties. If the arrangement under review is regarded as the first step in that direction, the Minister for Trade and Customs and his colleagues must be credited with having taken an important step in Empire consolidation, which, I am sure, future. Ministers will endeavour to complete. </para>

                <para>The honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> has complained that this Committee will be called upon to take the items <inline font-style="italic">in globo</inline> - to swallow the lot in one gulp. I know of no other way of passing a reciprocal Tariff. Fortunately, or unfortunately, we are driven to that method. If we were to alter any of these items, and New Zealand did not concur in those alterations, the whole business would go by the. board. There must be uniformity of enactment or there cannot be any operation of the agreement. Whether we like it or not, after proper investigation we are to be called upon to decide whether the balance of advantage will warrant us in completing this agreement or in doing the reverse. I believe, and I emphasize my view, that the balance is in favour of Australia; and I intend to vote in favour of the proposition. </para>
                <para>In signifying our acceptance, honorable members will realize that, to some extent, we are sacrificing the freedom which this Committee of Ways and Means has hitherto enjoyed on all Tariff matters. That freedom - limited as it will be in this instance - is to be safeguarded, however, as far as it is possible for any agreement so to do. We say in the agreement that we may not impose any Customs duties or increase the rates on specific items until we have given six months&#39; notice to our partner in the reciprocal arrangement. To that extent we are limited. New Zealand has already accepted the arrangement; but it has not yet been proclaimed; that must be done mutually and coincidentally by the two Dominions. We have certain exemptions from that limitation to which I have just referred; a certain degree of freedom as held, so to speak, in reserve. One phase is mentioned in clause 3 of the agreement, which states- </para>
                <para>Nothing in this agreement shall be construed to affect the right of the Commonwealth or of the Dominion to impose new duties upon any articles for the protection of any new industry established or proposed to be established in the Commonwealth or the Dominion as the case may be; provided that such new duties do not exceed the duties imposed on the importation of similar articles from the United Kingdom into the Commonwealth or the Dominion as the case may be. </para>
                <para class="block">In other words, if we desire to establish new protective duties after this agreement is entered into, we cannot do so at higher rates than the British preferential Tariff. There is, however, one phase of the question dealt with in clause 6 which the Minister has not explained, and on which I would like his opinion. If, under this agreement, primage duties are imposed- </para>

                        <para>- At any rate, the jam manufacturers of Tasmania have put a vast amount &#60;?f money, brains, and organization into this business; and why should they not have the same advantage in New Zealand as they have in South Africa? By making this agreement we, in this respect, are worse off than we should be if we did not make it; and this is the only case where that argument would apply. We are better off in the case of South Africa, witheut an agreement, than we shall bc in the case of New Zealand when we have an agreement. I suggest that the Minister very forcibly stress this argument to the Government of New Zealand, as will be done in the case of asbestos sheets, with the object of getting this market if we can get it in fair competition, as we are doing throughout the world. </para>

If New Zealand is not now making jam, and has to learn the business, and import all the bulk stuff, I cannot conceive of her meeting with any success. I do not know ,what the incidence of this arrangement will be, but I do not believe it is fair to the fruit people who desire to share the benefit of the arrangement with New Zealand.  1  hope the Minister will make strong representations to the Government of the Dominion in favour of an&#39; early amendment- </para>

We ought to give it a fair trial, knowing that its operations will be watched closely by the statutory body which we have ourselves created, and whose sole business it will be to warn Parliament of any ill effects of Tariff action. </para>

                    <para>.- I intend to support the agreement. An advantage is given to Australia, inasmuch as our hardwoods are allowed to enter the Dominion at a much more reasonable rate, while we have the benefit of cheaper timbers from the Dominion. The building trade is hampered because of the present higher duties on New Zealand timbers, and those duties under this agreement are to be reduced. Norway has nearly captured the timber market of Australia, and it is not- to the advantage of the workers of this country or of New Zealand that the control of the trade should be with that country. The new duty will prove most welcome to the building trade and also to the boxmakers Vessels which trade between here and New Zealand are manned under Commonwealth laws and observe Commonwealth conditions; moreover, they have all repairs made here. On the other hand, Norwegian vessels do not observe Australian conditions, and none of the repairs to them, are done by our workmen. Consequently, if we can transfer the. timber trade from Norway to New Zealand it will be a benefit to both Dominions. Why should we be afraid to trade with New Zealand on equal terms? They are a white race, and almost partners with us. They have the same standard of living, and, therefore, we have no reason to fear any attempt at cutting down the wages of the workers. </para>

New Zealand has timbers that are suitable for house building, and these are the very timbers we lack. At present the cost of house construction is increased largely because of the Tariff on New Zealand timbers. </para>

                    <para>. - So far as manufactured articles are concerned, I cannot see why Australia  cannot compete with New Zealand. The honorable member for South Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Riley),</inline> who is an autherity on these matters, has said that they observe the .same standards of living that we do ourselves, and their wages are as high, if not a little higher, than here. Why, then, should we be afraid to trade and compete with the neighbouring Dominion? The Tariff may, perhaps, embarrass somewhat a few mills that are handling softer, timbers, such as .celery top and pine, but,  taking the great bulk of the timbers, I should say that the advantage of the exchange is on our side. Upon the matter mentioned by the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt),</inline> I cannot see why the New Zealand Government should object- to the rebates in the duty on sugar used in the manufacture of jam for export. Some honorable members seem to think that this question of rebate dates only from the advent of Government control of sugar. As a matter of fact, it goes back very much further than that. The policy of this Parliament has always been to allow an export rebate- in the duty on raw materials for manufacturing purposes. Therefore, I can see no reason why New Zealand should object to the operation of this principle. The Dominion is in the extraordinary position that while sugar is not grown there, it is being, retailed at about 4jd. per lb., which, I think, is the very utmost that should be charged in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I think the retail price was very much the same as- in Australia. Since the peak in sugar prices, the position in New Zealand has been  as good,  from the consumer&#39;s point of view, as in Australia. There appears1 to be an. impression that our jam manufacturers and fruit preservers are getting some enormous concession in the matter of luba,te on export lines. B*ib, so far as&#39; my own State is concerned, the figures show that 80 per cent, of jam manufactured in Tasmania is consumed in Australia, and not. more than 20 per cent, is exported. If this export rebate is not to be permitted, the manufacturers of the Commonwealth- exporting to New Zealand will be in a worse position, as the honorable member for Balaclava has pointed out, than when they are trading with other countries with which we have no such reciprocal arrangement. </para>

                        <para>- i think it wm be found that, with the exception_ of perhaps oranges for marmalade, the fruit export trade to New Zealand is unimportant. But I am not going to attempt to interfere with this Tariff. I believe it is a step in the right direction. At all events, it will give us something approaching competition in those manufactured articles that are the tools of trade for the primary producers, and perhaps it will help to break down the ring that has existed in Australia&#39; for so many years, and which to-day is charging such monstrous prices for everything the farmer has to use. If it will have that effect,- and that effect only, we shall owe a debt of gratitude to the Minister for having concluded the agreement. Nevertheless, I urge him to point out to New Zealand that concessions in the matter of &#39; rebates in the duty on sugar for the manufacture of jam for export, should be allowed to stand, because this will not inflict any injury upon New Zealand industries. </para>

                    <para>. - I am sure this reciprocal Tariff will meet with the approval of the people generally. On the whole, there has been no suggestion of serious opposition, although honorable members may have found some items that are not likely to work out so satisfactorily as is desired. I can see no reason why Australia should not be able to compete on equal terms with New Zealand. We in this country are of their kin, and those of us who had the privilege of working or fighting side by side with New Zealanders will be pleased that this reciprocal Tariff has been introduced as an indication that we are prepared to meet New Zealand on terms of equality. Nevertheless, I am concerned about the future of the timber industry, or at least that section of the industry that is engaged in the milling of softwoods in Tasmania. The trouble is that there has been no warning to the people engaged in the business that any such arrangement as has been arrived at was likely to be brought about, at least not for some time. Last session there was a general belief that we were to have something like stability in Tariff matters; but if we are now going to admit New Zealand white pine into the Commonwealth free of duty, those mills engaged in cutting huon, king-billy, and celery top will, in all probability, have to close down. Although wo may be willing to do all we can to bring about a satisfactory reciprocal arrangement with New Zealand, it seems hard that, in order to accomplish this desirable object, a considerable number of our workmen should have to suffer through unemployment, and a loss of capital should result from the closing of certain mills. I have not the least doubt that a number of mills on the west coast of Tasmania will not be able to compete with New Zealand white pine under this reciprocal Tariff. For them the position is very serious indeed, because hundreds of workmen will be without employment. I should like the Minister to consider a suggestion that the Tariff on imported foreign timber, such as Oregon, used for box-making in particular, should be increased to the normal rate; that is, a rate nearly equal to the Tariff that we impose on other soft timbers from the Baltic and America. At present the duty on Oregon and other similar American timbers considered to be suitable for boxmaking is only ls. per 100 feet. That amount of protection is practically worth- less. The industry I am concerned about would think it fair, and consider they could meet competition from New Zealand, if a Tariff of 4s. per 100 feet were imposed on Oregon in the spar or cut in larger sizes for building or other purposes. If this were done, there  could  be no reasonable objection to New Zealand timber coming in free for. the purposes for which it is used in Australia. The mill-owners to whom I refer claim that timber fer box-making solely should bo admitted free from New Zealand; but I feel that such an arrangement cannot be effected under this schedule, because the Minister has already told us that we must take this reciprocal Tariff <inline font-style="italic">in globo</inline> or reject it. I suggest, however, that the Minister should place the position of the timber industry before the Tariff Board, and ask members of that body to consider if it is not fair, in the interests of Australian timber millers, to impose the duties I have mentioned, namely, 4s.. instead of ls. per 100 feet, on certain timbers imported from America and the Baltic. </para>

                        <para>- I thank the Minister for that statement. It is very satisfactory, and I have no doubt that when the Tariff Board has considered the .matter some arrangement such as I have suggested will be made. I realize that although, as the outcome of this agreement, one branch of the industry will suffer, that may be unavoidable, and that other branches of the saw-milling industry will gain. There will be large exports from these shores to New Zealand, where there are practically no hardwoods, and I expect to see a considerable trade done with New Zealand by Tasmania, Victoria, and other States. I realize also that the butter industry will benefit as the result of New Zealand pine for making butter boxes being allowed to come in free. </para>

                        <para>- It is a very important consideration. When the Customs Tariff Bill was under consideration last session I claimed that where we had no timber  equal for certain purposes to that which could be imported - timber such as that used for butter boxes - the item should be free. In that I was consistent. I have always claimed that where the product of another country can be introduced with advantage to an Australian industry since we have no local product that is its equal, there is no reason why we should impose upon it a heavy duty. There are other items in the schedule to this agreement in respect of which I am afraid some of our farmers - and I am a farmer - will be rather anxious. I would refer the Committee, for instance, to the reduced rates which .are to operate in respect of hay, chaff, hams and bacon from New Zealand. Hams and bacon are produced largely in Tasmania, Victoria, and New South Wales, and the industry must go side by side with the dairying industry. At the same time I &#39;recognise that these industries will gain advantages in other directions; they are to reap the benefit of a lower tariff on machinery and tools used &#39; by them. On broad lines, so far as I can judge, this agreement should be acceptable to our farmers, and I think, with my limited knowledge of the manufacturing industries generally, that it will be acceptable to our manufacturers. I congratulate the Minister on having been able to come to an  arrangement with the New Zealand Minister- for Trade and Customs that, on the whole, is acceptable to this Parliament, which is a reflex of the feelings of the people. Since the agreement has been passed by the New -Zealand Parliament, and evidently will be accepted within a few hours by this Parliament, it must be regarded as a step in the right direction, upon which the Minister, as well as honorable members generally, are to be congratulated. </para>

                    <para>.- Speaking generally, I am in favour of reciprocal trade treaties within the Empire, but I find it difficult, in the absence of detailed information as to items in respect of which <inline font-style="italic">aci valorem</inline> duties have been substituted for specific duties, to discuss with any degree of confidence the schedule to this agreement. In the Customs Tariff that we passed last year, we granted in some cases a British preference of 5 per cent., but under the general Tariff we imposed duties designed to lead to the establishment of new industries (here. We are now asked by the Minister to accept a reciprocal trade agreement with New Zealand which we are told by him is greatly in favour of Australia. On examination it will be found to cut deeply into some of the new industries that have been established in Australia of recent years and which to-day are languishing for lack of trade. The honorable member for Darwin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bell)</inline> has dealt with the timber duties. We have, under- this agreement, given up a good many -duties relating to timbers so far as New Zealand is concerned, with the result that her softwoods will come in here to compete, not with the pine or other soft- timbers of this country, but with the &#39;hardwood milling industry. Many of the hardwood mills in Tasmania and elsewhere are closing down. </para>

                        <para>- I shall do so later on I am not a supporter of rings or combines that establish themselves &#39;here, and put up prices; and it seems to me that it is far better that we should have the Massey-Harris Company or other similar manufacturing . concerns producing agricultural machinery here rather than that they , should set up big works in New Zealand and supply us, as would be possible under this agreement, from that country. In respect of agricultural machinery, under the general Customs Tariff, we have duties of 30 per cent, and 35 per cent; these, so far as imports from New Zealand are concerned, - are now to be wiped out. I know that New Zealand does not produce such machinery to any extent at the present time, but she may do so. Under this agreement &#39; we .shall encourage the establishment of factories in New Zealand to compete with our own industries. </para>

                <para>During the war period quite a number of big. works were established in Australia. To-day most of them are idle, and thousands of men have been thrown out of employment. It seems to me that under this reciprocal trade agreement, instead of restoring those men to their former employment, we shall give them another kick, and perhaps, put a few more out of work. That seems, for some time, to have been the policy of some people in this country. I would draw the attention of the Committee to the item relating to boilers. Huge works for the manufacture of land and marine boilers have just commenced operations in New South Wales, and thousands of pounds have been invested in the industry. </para>

                    <para>. -  I desire to address myself briefly to this question. In the. first place, I . have a complaint to make in regard to the timber duties. . The honorable member for Darwin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bell)</inline> has pleaded for the free introduction of timber used in the manufacture of butter boxes. The day is not far distant when such timber will not be procurable from either, New Zealand or Queensland, and some substitute will have to be found for the timber now being used for that purpose. Like the honorable member for Balaclava, I am in favour of reciprocity, and I am. sure we all share the hope expressed by. him that some day. we shall have trade reciprocity throughout the Empire. In 1919-20 we exported to New, Zealand timber of the value of &#163;178,982, but we imported from that country during the same period timber of the value of &#163;673,943. This is a matter which requires investigation, since the trade seems to be very one-sided. </para>

                        <para>- Those figures indicate that some adjustment might be made by the Tariff Board. While I have cause of complaint in regard to the balance of trade in timber, the honorable member for Newcastle (Mr: Watkins) has no complaint whatever in regard to metals and machinery. While we imported in one period from New Zealand agricultural machinery to the value of &#163;3,006, and other machinery to the value of &#163;9,551, or a total value of &#163;12,557, we exported to New Zealand in the same period agricultural implements and machinery to the value of &#163;17,311, other machinery to the value of &#163;188,696, and other manufactured metals to the value of &#163;364,743, or a total value of &#163;560,750. The honorable member need not be alarmed in regard to importations of metals and machinery frost New Zealand. However, the Minister might refer the timber duties to the Tariff Board. </para>

                    <para>. -  I am thankful to the Committee for the manner in which it has received the agreement with New Zealand, with the attached schedule, and I am fortified in my belief that it has met with general satisfaction in Australia, not only from the paucity of complaints in this Chamber, but also from the small number of requests for alterations received from the general manufacturing and commercial community. That, a reciprocal arrangement covering a wide range of subjects is bound to disturb existing conditions in some details is to be expected, but, as a whole, I think this agreement arrives at a fair basis of reciprocity; that is to say, it gives mutual concessions to both countries without damaging the essential industries of either, I thought that the honorable member for Newcastle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watkins)</inline> proposed to complain of some injustice being done to the iron and steel industry of Australia. The position is exactly the reverse. By this arrangement the industry in question has benefited to a very substantial extent. </para>

                        <para>- All that the honorable member could say was that if some industry should be established in New Zealand, at a later date, and commence exporting to Australia, it would have a free market, but the answer to that contention is quite simple. The agricultural machinery manufacturing industry being firmly established in the Commonwealth, and having substantial protection over, wide agricultural belts, is in a commanding situation to serve the sister Dominion. New Zealand, on the other hand, is in a very backward position in regard to this class of machinery, because it is more a grazing and intense dairying country than an agricultural country, and as a matter of fact, barely produces sufficient wheat for its own requirements. There is little danger of an outside corporation seeking to establish a base in the Dominion. It would not have any field on which to operate. But even if such an improbable thing should take place, it would be quite open to the Commonwealth, by giving notice to the Dominion of New Zealand, to make any alteration necessary to protect Australia in this regard. The iron, and steel industry has been benefited by this agreement. </para>

                <para>Australian steel products, viz.: Bar, angle, and tee girders; beams; railway rails; plate and sheet iron (galvanized or plain), will be admitted into New Zealand free of duty under the British preferential Tariff. On the other hand, New Zealand products of a similar kind will be classifiable under the Australian-British preferential Tariff. New Zealand does not supply steel products to Australia, but there has been a considerable trade with New Zealand in Australian steel. For example, in 1920-21 Australian steel products were exported to New Zealand to the following extent: - </para>

                </para>
                <para class="block">If any member of the Committee could have shown that injury was likely to accrue to any of Australia&#39;s key industries or any of its manufacturing industries already firmly established, I would have welcomed such an intimation, because it would clearly have- shown laxity on the part of myself and my advisers. On the other hand, the advantages to be gained by the agreement can be well gauged by comparison of the trade figures between Australia and New Zealand over a period of the ten years from 1911 to 1920-21. These show that the total exports from Australia to New Zealand of goods of Australian origin or manufacture during the period reached a value of &#163;29,432,320, while the exports of goods of New Zealand origin from New Zealand to Australia were valued at &#163;22,280,579. If we take the figures year by year we see that Australian industries have developed to a much greater extent than have those of New Zealand. In 1911, the exports of goods of Australian origin from Australia to New Zealand was valued at &#163;1,740,788, while the export of goods of New Zealand origin to Australia was valued at &#163;2,810,163. The figures for 1920-21 show how vastly the balance of trade has changed in- ten years. In 1920-21 our imports of goods  of New Zealand origin were valued at &#163;1,995,897, while the value of goods of Australian origin exported to New Zealand was &#163;6,271,739. Honorable members have been so fair in their criticism that I do not propose to delay the Committee. The consensus of opinion, I take it, is that this reciprocal arrangement, if anything, has been delayed too long. I hope that the Committee will accept it <inline font-style="italic">in globo,</inline> with my assurance that I shall negotiate with the New Zealand Government in regard to all matters capable of rectification where it is possible to have that rectification carried out before both Parliaments rise; and that when the agreement is put into operation, and it becomes apparent that its effect is to very definitely injure Australian industry without conferring any corresponding advantage to New Zealand industry, I shall negotiate, as it will be my duty to do, under the guidance of the Tariff Board, with the New Zealand Government subject to the terms of the agreement we have already tentatively made. It is unnecessary for me to delve into the subject in detail. Answering the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> and the honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Penton),</inline> who protested that the debate should partake of a detailed character, I would remind them of my promise to the New Zealand Minister that I would invite the Commonwealth Parliament not to go through the schedule item by item - to be submitted individually and subjected, possibly, to a vote in every instance - but that I would endeavour to show that a fair bargain had been struck ; and, lastly, that if possible I would have the agreement accepted <inline font-style="italic">in globo.</inline> I am pleased that that is to be done, because the Government have in contemplation the establishment of reciprocal arrangements, on somewhat similar lines, with Canada and South Africa. The attitude of this Parliament in standing up to the New Zealand agreement in full will be a strong evidence of our good faith. </para>

                        <para>- I know what the honorable member is thinking of; but there, again, New Zealand has demonstrated her <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> by abrogating the agreement previously made with South Africa in respect of wine and maize, so that she might enter upon this new reciprocal basis of trade, the effect of which will be to bestow great benefits upon the Commonwealth, whereas previously South Africa had been in the favoured position. On the whole we have been able to effect substantial advantages, both for our primary and our secondary industries. I have already given statistics revealing the balance of trade as between the two countries. I have pointed out, for example, that the value of New Zealand&#39;s exports to Australia last year was &#163;1,995,000, whereas the value of our exports to New Zealand was &#163;6,271,000. It would be displaying a poor spirit, therefore, if the larger and better established and more experienced manufacturing Dominion were to set up the argument that unless she got everything she sought there would be no agreement. Reciprocity has been the basis of negotiation, and we have both given and taken. Broadly, the arrangement will serve both the Commonwealth and the Dominion. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not think the Commonwealth will suffer by this arrangement. Indeed, we should reap great advantages, because we have so many established industries, particularly in Victoria. I fail to see how industries which may be established in New Zealand will be able to compete with such firmly established and widely known industries as, for example, the Sunshine Works; these should profit greatly as an outcome of the treaty. In Tasmania, unfortunately, we are experiencing overproduction of fruit, both in regard to home consumption and - owing to costly shipping facilities - with respect to export. Now, however, New Zealand is about to open her markets to the Tasmanian orchardists. She is ready to admit her apples free of duty ; and, notwithstanding that New Zealand will be importing our fruit and sugar free of duty, it is my view that she will be unable to compete with our strongly established Tasmanian jam-manufacturing industry. In that State there is one of the finest jam-producing works in all the world. I trust that the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> will carry out the suggestion of the honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mcwilliams)</inline> by seeing that Australian jam is despatched to New Zealand under the same conditions as it is sent to other parts of the Empire. </para>

                        <para>.- On behalf of the Opposition, I enter an emphatic protest against the action of the Government. Last week honorable members were promised that further specific information upon the subject of sugar would be made available on the first day of sitting this week. No further particulars, however, , have been given, except a tabulated statement by the Prime- Minister regarding the agreement; we have been told nothing about the transactions during the seven years. Suddenly we find the Government carrying: a motion to adjourn the debate until to-morrow. But to-morrow appears to be some day in the far and distant future, probably not within the life of this Parliament. This matter is of such magnitude that no Committee - though I dare say the Public Accounts Committee would do as well as any other - could possibly deal with it in an effective way within some months. Here is a business extending over seven years, and involving &#163;60,000,000, and we expect a Committee to investigate it and present a report within a few weeks. This is asking the Committee to do something that is absolutely impossible. By the time the Committee could make a report we shall be well on towards the end of the session, if we have not reached it. But before then the Government will say, &#34; Now we are in a position to reduce the price of sugar to 5d.,&#34; and the thing will be shelved. What we, on this side, have been contending for some time is that there should be an immediate reduction in the price of sugar. According to the information that we have, it could be sold at 41/2d. per lb. </para>

                        <para>.- I also wish to register my protest against the manner in which the Government have dealt with this sugar matter. This afternoon the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> said most emphatically that he accepted the proposal put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Prowse</inline> for the appointment of a Select Committee. It appears now, the debate having been adjourned on the assumption that it would be resumed to-morrow - the adjournment being to enable the urgent matter of the New Zealand reciprocal Tariff agreement to be discussed - that the Government, after further consideration, have taken the business away from the House. It rather looks to me like a little bit of smart business. The Prime Minister, when he was informed that the proposal to refer the matter to the Public Accounts Committee was not acceptable, frankly stated that the Government would go the whole way and accept the proposal for a Select Committee. Now, a few hours afterwards, it is announced by the Government that the matter is to go to the Public Accounts Committee. Personally, I do not think that the reference to the Public Accounts Committee meets the position. I protest against the manner in which the Government have dealt with the whole business. </para>

                        <para>. - I also protest against the &#39;manner in which the Government have dealt with the question. Last Thursday the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> made a definite statement that information would be made available to-day to enable us to properly discuss the position. When the House meets, it finds itself with practically no more information than before. The action of the Government is in direct apposition to the amendment standing in the name of the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse).</inline> As you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> said, the amendment was in two portions, one dealing with the price of sugar and the other with the appointment of a Select Committee to investigate the general transactions of the Government in the purchase of sugar. These are two quite different matters, and I see no reason why the question of price should be one for a Committee. It is one for the House to decide, after the information promised by the Minister for Trade and Customs has been given. </para>

                        <para>.- This action on the part of the Government has come as a surprise to me. I may be at a disadvantage in not having heard the speech of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> this afternoon, but when I voted for the adjournment of. the debate I understood we were to have the promised information tomorrow, or, at the latest, in a day or two. If the Minister cannot supply the requisite information to enable the House to form an opinion as to what the price of sugar, should be, I do not see how he can supply that information to the Public Accounts Committee, nor do I see how we can have even an interim report within a reasonable time. </para>

                        <para>. - I join in the general protest being made, for there appears to me to have been some pretty sharp practice on the part of the Government, but it is only in thorough accord with their attitude right through the piece. If ever there was a question of vital interest to the public it is that of sugar. It is three weeks ago since the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> made his original statement. A few days after I asked when we were likely to have the details, and the Minister replied that we should have them next week, at any rate, and covering six years. Three weeks later we are still without the information, and now the whole thing is passed over to a Committee which will probably deliberate for months. I hope, however, that the Country party have learnt a lesson. Last week when the Government were in difficulties- </para>

                            <para>- In the case of a Select Committee we find all sorts of side issues raised, and an inquiry may be stretched out for an interminable time. Finally a report is laid on the table, though we may have to wait for a considerable time before it is printed and put into circulation. The, real point i3 that this matter will then not come before the House, unless a definite motion is tabled by a Minister, or some private member. In the ordinary course, the report will merely be presented. Therefore I enter my protest against the action of the Minister; and I should like to know if this is a decision of Cabinet, or whether it is merely a decision communicated over the telephone from the Prime Minister to the Minister for Defence. Can the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> say if this is the policy of the &#39; Government? Surely the House is entitled to some information? </para>

The Minister and honorable members will, no doubt, remember the difficulty that confronted us when we were seeking information from the Colonial Sugar Refining Company on a former occasion. <inline font-style="italic">No</inline> inquiry into the sugar position can be complete witheut an examination of the books of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and, as I have already stated, some years ago the company absolutely defied the Government. They declined to make any statement, and in this matter they were upheld by the High Court. Therefore, we have not power to compel the company to disclose their profits. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister must think that we have come down in the last shower I He knows that if this question is referred to the Public Accounts Committee we shall have .to wait for the report of that body, and that will not be available this year. The Committee have done splendid work in regard to other matters, but this will be one of the biggest questions it has ever been called upon to investigate. Therefore, I ask. the Government not to insist on remitting it .to the Public Accounts Committee. </para>

                        <para>.- I should like to know if honorable members have asked themselves what this really means. A terrible - in my opinion, quite unjustifiable - fuss is being made about it. The average consumption .of sugar per head in Australia is 112 lbs., and, taking the average family of five, that gives a total of 560 lbs. </para>
