                        <para>. - I am sorry that I was not able to be here yesterday, when the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> moved his amendment, but I have informed myself as well as I could by a perusal of the press reports of his speech and from the notes taken by my honorable colleagues. It would serve no good purpose to remind the honorable member that he has taken a very unusual course in moving two censure motions without an interval between them. In his speech in support of the amendment now before the House ho covered, for all practical purposes, the ground traversed last week in his first attack. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Before I come to the honorable member's charges, there is a matter of procedure to which I must refer. According to the newspaper accounts of yesterday's proceedings, exception was taken by some of the honorable member's party to the moving of the adjournment of the debate by the Minister then in charge of the House. When I was informed that the Leader of the Opposition intended to move an amendment on the Address-in-Reply, I said that if he desired the adjournment of the debate I would consent to it, but that otherwise the discussion should continue. The course taken by the Government was the proper one. In moving the adjournment of the debate, we followed an almost invariable custom ; to do otherwise would have been an act of discourtesy to the Opposition. Had I been present, however, and heard from the honorable member's own lips that he took exception to the proposed adjournment, the debate would not have been adjourned. </para>
                    <para>Let me now deal with his charges seriatim. The honorable member claimed credit on behalf of his party for the results arrived at through the Washington Conference, for the reference of the wireless agreement to the Parliamentary Committee, for the expansion of telephone and telegraph connexions, and for the reduction of the defence vote. He did not disclose the grounds on which these claims were based, and an examination of the facts will show them to be without foundation. </para>
                    <para>The honorable member claimed kudos for himself and his party for what was done at the Conference at Washington.. During the many years that I have been a. member of the House, I have known audacity, under the whip of party exigencies, to go to great lengths, but I have not heard any statement quite so audacious as this. The honorable gentleman said that the Labour party was responsible for the appointment of a delegate to represent the Commonwealth at Washington, and that attention had been drawn by the Labour party to the need for Australian representation there. No doubt the Labour party did draw attention to this matter; I should be surprised to hear of anything in the wide world to which, at some time or another, the Labour party has not drawn attention. But, as the honorable member has claimed credit for the achievements of the Washington Conference, seeking to make it appear that without the efforts of the Labour party no good thing would have come out of Washington, I must quote extracts from that very inconvenient publication known to <inline font-style="italic">oi woXXoi</inline> as <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> to show where the honorable member and his party really stood in reference to Australian representation at Washington. On 6th October last <inline font-style="italic">(Hansard,</inline> vol. XCVII, page 11717), the honorable member is reported as saying - </para>

                    <para class="block">It is clear, therefore, that if any good thing has come out of "Washington, and if my distinguished and right honorable colleague has come back, as he has done, having covered himself with distinction and credit, it is not due to honorable gentlemen opposite, for they not only did all they could to prevent him going, but they urged a course which they knew was quite impracticable. They suggested that there should be' substituted for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> some other representative, and that he should be accompanied by a representative from each of the other political parties in this Parliament. They did that, though they very well knew that it was not for us to decide how many should go. The Government of the United States of America issued the invitations, and restricted the number of representatives from each country invited. The Dominions as such were not recognised at all, but went by virtue of the fact that they were partners in the British Empire. </para>
                    <para>As the attitude of honorable members on the other side, or most of them, towards the British Empire is perfectly well known - and it is known that the party are opposed to the British Empire, even when they do not say so - it must be said that not only is the honorable gentleman's party not entitled to the credit for the achievements of the Washington Conference, but that all that has been gained has come despite the policy and the opposition of honorable members of the Official Labour party, and that they are not entitled to claim any share whatever in the splendid results of that Conference. </para>
                    <para>The Leader of the Opposition referred to the Wireless Agreement, claiming this also to be due to the action of his party. Doubtless the honorable member referred to those subterranean machinations' by which they manage to influence the affairs of the world, let- alone the affairs of the Commonwealth, but of which we see not the faintest signs above the surface of things. But the honorable gentleman's, party is not entitled to any credit in this matter. On the other hand, whatever has been done has been done despite their opposition. What are the facts about the Wireless Agreement <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> The honorable gentleman finds himself in this position : Whilst he takes credit for the 'agreement, he says that it should never have been executed. I think  it  may be said that one could secure unanimity on the other side for the execution of only one thing and .that is myself. Let me state the facts relating to this matter. A motion covering a  draft  wireless agreement was put before this House, and agreed to. The motion read - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>That the House approves of the execution by the Prime Minister of the agreement proposed to- bc made -between the Commonwealth and Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, a draft of which has been laid upon the table of the House, subject to investigation and  approval,  with such alteration as they may deem necessary, by a Committee to consist "of six members of the House of Representatives, two nominated by the Prime Minister, two -by the Leader of the Opposition, two by the Leader of the Country , party. and three members of the Senate, such senators' to be Senators Drake Brockman, J. D. Millen, and Wilson. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">When this motion was submitted, debate ensued, the honorable member and his party opposed the motion, a division waa taken, .and the Leader of the Opposition and his party voted against it. Whatever there is of virtue, either in the motion itself, the Committee which the motion created, or the decisions of that Committee, or the agreement, or its execution, comes as the result not of the support of the honorable gentle-  man and his party, but despite their opposition. They wore beaten in the division on the motion. The House authorized, and in fact directed the Government to take certain action -subject to certain conditions which were set out in the motion - </para>
                    <para>That the House approves of the execution of the agreement proposed to be made subject to the investigation and approval of a Committee to consist of six members of the House of Representatives, and -three members of the Senate. </para>
                    <para>The Committee was appointed; it met and considered -the matter at great length, and by eight votes to one recommended the ratification and execution of the agreement. The only dissentient member of the Committee, the honorable member for Batman, about whose attitude on this matter a certain amount of mystery seems to prevail, did not put in his minority report until a few days before, the assembling of Parliament. No doubt the honorable gentleman will say that this belated dissent has no political significance whatever, and that, its relation to party is so remote as not to be measurable. All I have to say to that is that while he may tell that to the marines or to his constituents the people of this' country will never believe it. The facts are then, that the agreement was signed because this Parliament by a specific motion directed the Government to sign it, and neither for the idea, the motion, the Committee, or the agreement itself, are the Leader of the Opposition and his party entitled to one iota of credit.  The honorable member next takes credit for the proposed expansion of post and telegraphic facilities. It is true, of course - and one must give the devil his due - that honorable members opposite are always in favour of expanding every thing. Insignificant as I am, I have had the* honour of their support on more than one occasion when I have moved motions which expanded matters in which; they . were vitally interested. When it is a question of imposing new burdens  by the expenditure of public money, one may always rely with confidence on the support of honorable members of the Labour party, and it is no doubt  true that they have always said that they were in favour of the expansion of postal and telegraphic facilities ; but the Leader of the Opposition must forbear with me a moment while I remind him of one or two rather painful facts. He and many of those who are with him to-day were followers of mine in days gone by. We were in office for years. We had ample opportunity to. do a great many things. We had an overwhelming majority - 72 members - in both Houses. The honorable member was not then, as he is now, a member of a party - poor, forlorn, rejected,- and despised, compelled to resort to most abject and miserable expedients in order to attract attention. On the contrary, he was a member of a party whose word was law. I invite him now to tell us what any of the Labour Governments, including my own - because we want to be perfectly fair in the matter - did for the telegraphic and telephonic communications of Australia. He cannot deny <inline font-style="italic">}h.at</inline> we could have done a good deal more in a direction which he now sees possible. 1 claim that - the present Government is entitled to the credit of having' done and shown the way to do far more for the expansion of postal and telegraphic facilities throughout this country than was done by any preceding Government, and that the credit is not to be shared by the honorable member or his party. They did not do these things when they had the power. If they had the reins of power now they would, owing to the forces which control th,in, destroy this country. </para>
                    <para>The honorable member, having taken credit for the contemplated expenditure of some millions of pounds on postal and telephonic facilities next claims credit for the reduction effected in. the defence expenditure. There is something in this assertion which makes me a little apprehensive. When I see the honorable member associated, as he is now, with people whose ideas were abhorrent to him a little while ago, I cannot but feel ti little anxious when I learn that he and those with him approve of anything that' this Government has done. We know very well what their attitude was towards this country during the war, and what their - suggestions were when Australia was standing with its back to the wall and literally fighting for its life. </para>
                    <para class="block">We remember their counsels for a premature peace, and their protests against reinforcements. What, then, nave we done in regard to the Defence Forces of the, country that has secured the approbation of such a party? I shall say no more about this matter now than to remark that the fact that the honorable member takes credit for and supports the action of the Government in this regard is a rather sinister circumstance. During last session the honorable member did all that he could to put the Government out of office. He moved motions which, had they been carried, would, as he must have known, have destroyed the whole Military Defence Force of this country, thrown tens of thousands of men out of work, and rendered the Commonwealth helpless before her enemies. We must never forget that the honorable member's motions which, if carried, would have destroyed the Defence Force of Australia, were moved long before the Washington. Conference had made a reduction in military expenditure possible. Even at a time when the honorable member said that such a Conference could not succeed, he wished us to go far beyond what we have done to-day. For the present reductions the Government, and the Government alone, are responsible. If there be some things for which, credit is due, which, since the honorable member supports them, I begin to doubt - the credit belongs to the -Government, and not to the honorable member, who would have had us disarm and leave ourselves defenceless in the face of the enemy before the Washington Conference had yet met, and arrived at those momentous decisions which have changed the face of the whole world, and particularly the Pacific. </para>
                    <para>The honorable member then spoke of immigration. Apparently ' he is much concerned about this matter. I am not quite clear as to what his charges are in this connexion. Nor do I know what is his attitude towards the question. The other day, in his attack upon the Government, I understood that the gravamen of his charges was that we were about to bring hundreds of thousands of people to Australia, which was already thronged with unemployed men.' I gather now, and the honorable member will correct me if I am wrong, that we are now charged with doing nothing. </para>

                            <para>- Let me put the facts before the honorable member. They will speak for themselves. The foundation of the immigration policy of the Commonwealth Government was the resolution agreed to at the Premiers' Conference in 1920, which gave the Commonwealth charge of immigration affairs overseas, and of the transport of' immigrants from overseas to Australia, .and left to the States the responsibility for dealing with immigrants when they reached our shores and the right- to determine the number and class of immigrants to be admitted into each State. If fewer immigrants are arriving than we should like, it is solely the States who are to blame, unless it can be shown that the transport facilities provided by the Commonwealth are insufficient. But that is not alleged. I stated the matter very clearly at the Premiers' Conference held in January of this year. I shall read an extract from a report of the proceedings. I said - </para>

The Commonwealth has a very clear and practicable policy, which it has endeavoured, and is still endeavouring, to carry out. First of all, there are these concrete schemes to one of which I have just referred, . and with which I shall deal in detail later. Then there is the scheme of nominated immigrants, under which persons now resident in Australia nominate their friends in Britain or elsewhere. These are brought out here by assisted passages. This is an excellent form of immigration, if it be on a wide enough, scale, because the immigrants have friends to go to, and these give thom counsel and' aid, and set their  feet  upon the right road. Assisted passages are granted under various minor schemes. <inline font-style="italic">Fat</inline> example, in New South Wales the Commonwealth Government are recruiting agricultural trainees, known as " Dreadnought " boys, at the rate of sixty a month, for the State of New South Wales. In connexion with the Fairbridge  Farm  School, in Western Australia, the Commonwealth Government recently decided to co-operate with the Western Australian Government by providing portion of the maintenance cost of the school. The maximum contribution of the Commonwealth has been fixed at £2,600 per annum, and the total cost to the Commonwealth, is not to exceed £10,000, spread over a period of five years. </para>
                    <para>About 2,000 British officers of the Indian Army will shortly bo retired owing to the intended reduction in the Army establishment in India. These officers are young men in the prime of life, and they will each receive as compensation a sum of between £1,000 and £1,500. In response to inquiries recently made by General Lord Rawlinson, I have given an assurance that the Government will extend a hearty, welcome to any of these officers who may choose to settle 'here. I have communicated this matter to all the States. Victoria has sent a representative to India. New South Wales has definitely offered to set aside 800 irrigated farms for these , officers, I hope that the other States will not lag behind. As each officer will have between £1,000 and £1,500, and is in the prime of life, it is desirable: from every point of view that they be secured for </para>
                    <para class="block">Australia. The Commonwealth Govern/ ment have offered to send a representative to India to give all information that tie' officers may  require,  or alternatively ' to pay the expenses of two of their number to Australia in order that they mav see the country for themselves. These' constitute what may be termed the subsidiary schemes of our immigration policy. There are the nominated immigrants, who are given assisted passages, and those other schemes, such as the <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Barnardo</inline> Homes boys, the "Dreadnought" boys, and the Fairbridge Farm. Then wo have the scheme of the South Australian Government, who are bringing out ' 6,000 boys, with a view to placing them with farmers and training them for the work of land settlement. In all these schemes we are co-operating with the State Governments. </para>
                    <para>Now I come to the greater schemes which aim at developing the great resources of Australia by bringing out large numbers of immigrants from Britain and settling them on Crown lands.  With  Western Australia a draft agreement has been drawn up, and it sets out, with some wealth of detail, the circumstances under which we are prepared to co-operate with the Government of that State. Broadly speaking, the agreement is one for settlement in which the States and the Commonwealth - and since the passage, of the Empire Settlement Act, the United Kingdom also - are to co-operate  in bringing people to this country and settling them on the land. Land settlement is a <inline font-style="italic">sine qua non</inline> of the  Commonwealth  immigration policy. The Government of the Commonwealth is not a party to any immigration proposal which has not for its object the settlement of men on the .land. I have already referred to the Western Australian undertaking, which I hope will shortly bo completed. I have discussed at great length with the Government of New South Wales a scheme covering large areas of land, both irrigated and dry, in different ports of that Stale, and I am very hopeful of being able to conclude a satisfactory agreement. I have been in close touch lately with the Premier of Victoria, una only yesterday I had -a communication from him, setting out in broad outlines a scheme in which foe wishes the Commonwealth Government to co-operate. We are looking into the matter now, and although we cannot commit ourselves to details, I have said in the most unqualified way that we most earnestly desire to act in co-operation with the State Government. The Premier of Victoria has set out that the whole object is to settle men on the land. That is the policy of the State of Victoria,and it is the policy of this Government. The High Commissioner of the Commonwealth has recently signed an agreement with the British Government relating to providing portion of the passage money for approved immigrants. Under this agreement the British Government bears half the cost. The liability of both parties is limited by the terms of the agreement. </para>
                    <para>The rate at which immigrants arc coming in this year shows a great improvement over last year. The total number of assisted immigrants who arrived during 1921 was 14,677; while the number this year, if the present monthly average is maintained, will be 24,652. This, of course, is still very far from satisfactory, but we anticipate that when the Western Australian scheme is in full operation that number will be doubled. And I do not hesitate to say that only in this way can this country be developed, and shall we be able to obtain results from the co-operation of the British Government and the State Governments with the Commonwealth, which will, I hope, mark a turning point in Australia's career, and indicate to the world our settled determination to show ourselves worthy of the inheritance of a continent. </para>
                    <para>It has been suggested. I think, by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> that the Commonwealth rejected the immigration proposals of Queensland because a. Labour Government is in power there. That is quite untrue, as I shall prove by some extracts from speeches by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Theodore</inline> himself. What the Commonwealth sets out to do is to assist immigration. The responsibility of dealing with unemployment in the various parts of the Commonwealth belongs to the States, and not to the Commonwealth Government. It is an unfortunate fact, as I showed on Friday last, that the number of unemployed in the State of Queensland is greater than in any other State. That is most regrettable, but it is also the most complete condemnation of the policy of honorable members opposite, either in <inline font-style="italic">esse</inline> or in <inline font-style="italic">posse,</inline> that can be imagined. But it does not affect, the position : that the immigration policy of the Commonwealth must not be used by the States to settle unemployment of their own citizens. Let me now read to the House what the Leader of the Labour Government in Queensland has to say about the matter. On 1st July, 1921, when a deputation of unemployed waited upon him, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Theodore</inline> said - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>He knew that there was depression in Queensland and unemployment. Unemployment was rendered more acute because of this depression, and there was distress in the pastoral industry in particular. Thefinancial stringency was having a bad effect on industry generally. At the present time, the Government could not offer the unemployed relief work. The Government could find employment for thousands of men if the funds were available. He had formed his own opinion that an expenditure of £15,000,000 over the next four or five years would make land available for 10,000 settlers, say, and find employment for 50,000 adults. </para>
                        <para>The following extract is from the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of 5th January, 1922 : - </para>
                        <para>Asked to-day what Queensland was doing in the matter of immigration, the Premier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Theodore)</inline> said ". . . The Government had not abandoned hopes of the Upper Burnett scheme. ... It would endeavour to finance a vigorous land settlement scheme in the near future. This was one of the chief means of solving the unemployment problem." </para>
                        <para>I commend to the Leader of the Opposition those words of wisdom from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Theodore,</inline> that the only hope of solving the unemployed problem is not the socialization of industry, is not the policy represented by the flamboyant resolutions passed at the recent Labour Conference in Melbourne, is not any of those solutions which the honorable member urged upon us, but is the simple, time-honoured way, initiated by Adam, of going upon the land and producing more wealth. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Theodore</inline> said, in Brisbane, on 5th January, 1922- </para>
                        <para>This is one of the chief means of solving the unemployed problem and making for the development and progress of the State that is so necessary, and strenuous efforts will be made by the Government to have such a scheme definitely launched this year. </para>
                        <para>Speaking at the Premiers' Conference on l8th January, 1922, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Theodore</inline> said- </para>
                        <para>Every State Government was restricted in its finances at that time. We all recognise that, on account of the unemployed situation, we ought to open up lands for settlement, and to absorb intending immigrants in that way, but we could not finance big schemes at that period. We got no assistance from the Commonwealth to help us to finance any such scheme. At the present time, we arc endeavouring to finance the scheme ourselves, and if we are to succeed in putting this Burnett, scheme into operation we must look to our own resources, because the Commonwealth,, it seems, will continue to "dilly-dally" with the matter. </para>
                        <para>We hare had no difficulty in getting all the settlers we wont on the perpetual leasehold system on our Crown lands, and we would have no difficulty, if we could get £2,500,000 to build those railways and roads, in getting applications for 3,500 settlers in twelve months, if the area were made available under perpetual leasehold. We could get them in Australia. </para>
                        <para>We do not know what provision we can make to take immigrants from overseas twelve months hence; but if we can get assistance to open up land for settlement on a progressive scheme, our conditions will become such that we will be able, not only to reduce  out  unemployment difficulty, but to absorb a very large number of new immigrants, and that is the main thing. </para>

                    <para class="block">There are two or three points that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Theodore</inline> emphasized which I commend to honorable members opposite. The first is that there is no way of solving the unemployed difficulty unless we develop land settlement, and the second is that immigration is the main thing, and that immigrants must be settled upon the land. The third point which emerges from all this is, despite the fact that a Labour Government is in power in Queensland, unemployment is very prevalent there, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Theodore</inline> has testified in the three extracts I have read. In the course of a press interview on 31st January, 1922, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Theodore</inline> is reported to have said - </para>

                            had said the Ministry wanted positive ' assurances that the money would be used for immigration only. That was a new feature of the controversy. The Queensland Government did not &gt;ask for money, to be used for immigration, but asked for money to be used for the development of the Burnett scheme,  which would have the effect of enabling the State to absorb theusands of newcomers.
                        </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">That is the point upon which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Theodore</inline> and I differ. I say that the first duty of the Governments of Australia is to look after their own fellow citizens, and that, so far as unemployment is concerned - of course, outside the scope of the Commonwealth Public Service - that duty <inline font-style="italic">fails</inline> properly upon t,he States. It is the duty of the States to develop land settlement in order to deal with their own unemployed. It is the function of the Commonwealth to deal with immigration, and we say to the States, " If you desire immigrants, and will make arrangements for them to go upon, your Crown lands, we will assist you. We will advance you millions of pounds upon an arrangement that may be arrived at if you will present a definite scheme, which will show where every penny is to be spent upon reproductive works for the purpose of building railways and roads, clearing and preparing the land for the immigrant." We laid it down, further, that a condition precedent must be that the immigrant be given twelve months' work- upon the land. We are insisting upon this condition with every State. All immigrants are to go on the land, and all are to be guaranteed at least twelve months' preparatory work on the land, and subsequently a block of land upon which to settle. The Commonwealth scheme of immigration, therefore, does not and cannot cause unemployment, but the very reverse. We shall not cause one man to be unemployed. All will be employed <inline font-style="italic">ipso facto.</inline> But <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Theodore,</inline> having got himself up to his neck in debt&lt;, I suppose, wanted the Commonwealth to lend him money to provide work for his awn State's unemployed. We could not do that; honorable members would scarcely expect us to do so. That is why we were unable to finance the Queensland- Government with, their Upper Burnett scheme. I take it that what I have said is sufficient answer to all that has been advanced. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Theodore</inline> said, " We will absorb Australian applicants for the land first." That is quite right; he. ought to do so. But he must do so with his own money. We will assist him to absorb immigrants; but I insist that the State must  absorb its own ' unemployed. The Commonwealth, will see to it that the immigrant does not compete with Australia's unemployed by ensuring that the immigrant shall be settled on the land ; and I repeat that we will not make an agreement with any State unless it can guarantee every immigrant twelve months' work on the land, and a block of land at the expiration of that term. I do not know whether the honorable member for Hunter is in favour of immigration or not. It is very difficult for any one to know his views upon, this subject. I do not think he knows them himself, for the position of his party at present is very much like that of the sick man who, upon being asked in the morning how he was, said that he could not tell until he had read the doctor's bulletin to be published in the paper later that day. The Labour party does not know from day to day where it is upon any particular; subject. I do not know whether there is an individual member of that party in this Chamber who, if he were put up against a wall, and threatened with a firing party, could state what is his party's programme. It is protean. </para>
                    <para>Let me now deal with coal. Coal has for the honorable member for Hunter an attraction such as honey has for the fly or the bee. The honorable member is in a. difficulty about coal, but he is merely in the same position as every one else in this country. We are all in trouble about coal. . Yesterday I bought some coal. I took the trouble to work out the cost, and found that it amounted to £3 6s. per ton. Coal appears to be a rather expensive luxury for a poor person, like myself, who is obliged to buy the commodity in dribs and drabs. But this experience is common to almost all of us. So I have come here to-day, being cold and very far from well, because coal is very far from being cheap. The honorable member for Hunter finds himself in a most difficult position. Let me state what that position is. A little while ago the honorable gentleman stood up in his place, and delivered what, in the case of another man, would, have amounted to a panegyric upon a. measure that had been passed into law upon my own. initiative. I allude to the- Industrial Peace Act. The honorable member said it was the finest piece of legislation ever passed in this country.  Certain other people did not agree with him; but that was his formed opinion . The honorable member far Darling <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blakeley),</inline> for example, regarded the act as a covert blow at what was then the very, child of his bosom, namely, the Arbitration Court. But last week, or a, few days before that, the constituents of the honorable member for Hunter applied ta the Court for an injunction, or a mandamus; and it now turns out that the Tribunal is <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires</inline> the Act.  Those whom the Industrial Peace Act was brought into existence to benefit have themselves destroyed it. </para>

I bring in certain legislation. The honorable member's friends, Messrs. Baddeley and Willis, come to me and tell me that they have a passionate desire to obey the law. Of course, I know that they have not; I have known those gentlemen for a long while. But I ask of them, '* What is it they want? " They tell me, and the honorable member for Hunter agrees with them. In fact, there is a general consensus of opinion upon what is wanted by these gentlemen. Even the mine-owners agree. All are opposed to the Arbitration Court. There is talk of direct action, of strikes, of confusion. The Industrial Peace Act is thereupon brought into force, and everything goes as merrily as a mar,riage boll. There are, of course, some stoppages, which the miners explain away. Everything is still going on all right and promises to continue to do so, as long as the tribunal created by the Act churns out at regular intervals an increase in the hewing rate, in the current rate of wages - which, in the opinion of the honorable member, is what the Tribunal was created solely to do. But at length there comes a frost - a killing frost. The employers say they, want a reduction of 33-J per cent, upon the rate of payment. Immediately the matter is referred to the Tribunal. The honorable member for Hunter and his friends, Messrs. Baddeley and Willis, fear that the Tribunal will not do what they hold that every arbitrator is supposed to do ; that is to say, give a verdict in their favour. Therefore, in that frame of mind, they say, '' We will lay the Tribunal out." And they do so. It is very difficult to know "where the honorable member for Hunter and his constituents are upon this subject. Have they lost faith in the Tribunal? </para>

                            <para>- lt is obvious that all this, and the references made to  it  by the honorable member, comprise merely an  Attempt  to ward off the inevitable. "When, the other day,  I mentioned the   price  of small coal in England, the honorable gentleman said I knew nothing about coal. That is quite true. I am not a coal miner; but I am a citizen of this country, .and I buy coal privately and, as head of the Government, buy a great deal of  it.  Above all, I am concerned in the welfare of our people, and when I am asked to deal with this question of unemployment, I affirm that the problem is very much aggravated, even if it is not caused, by the present high price of coal. Despite all the contradictions of the honorable member, it is true that the price of small coal, out of which  coke  is made, is very much lower in England than it1 is here. The honorable member for Hunter is reported to have stated that I said the English price was 9s. Perhaps he did not do me the honour to read my speech, for I stated that the prices were - Welsh smalls 13s. per ton, Scotch 12s., Midlands 15s., Tyne 15s., Leeds (non.coking), 9s. But non-coking smalls must be ruled out of consideration, because we were talking about the cost of coal out of which coke is made. The honorable member for Hunter must not try to confuse the unfortunate 'members of this Parliament by introducing these subtle technicalities, which are too much for the overstrained mentalities of my friends on this side of the House. We must not allow him to evade the point by confusing us with the terminology of the industry. Ab a matter of fact, the honorable member cannot deny that it costs 37s. 9d., I think, to produce a ton of coke in Australia, whereas, in England, it can be produced for very much less. </para>

                            <para>- The price of this coal is one reason - I do not say it is the only reason - why men hitherto employed in the Australian steel industry , are idle today. I have said, times out of number, that as the cost of living comes down, wages also must come down. That is the universal law the world over. The honorable member for Hunter, or another honorable member opposite, had something to say about the high profits of the coal-owners. I believe some mine-owners are making huge profits, but I should like to point out that there was a studied silence on the .part of the coal miners in regard to this matter until the suggestion was made by the owners that the hewing rate should come down. So long as the Tribunal ' was giving increases to the miners and, naturally, making possible greater profits for the mine-owners,, nothing was said, but as soon as it was proposed to reduce the wages of the men, proportionate only to the decrease in the cost of living, then we were told that the owners were making huge profits. Probably, some of them are, and perhaps the best remedy would be to compel them to compete in the markets of the world. At the present time, as the honorable member for Hunter knows, our foreign trade in coal has almost entirely disappeared. That is a very bad condition of affairs for the country generally, and the coal-owners and miners particularly. </para>

Baddeley and Willis asked me not to lift the coal control, but I said I would not agree to their request. Then requests were made by the Governments of Victoria and South Australia, and, as a result, coal control is still on. We shall never get stability in this industry, and. never be able to compete in the markets of the world, until coal gets down to the world's priced I am sure we can produce coal here as cheaply as anywhere else in the world. </para>

But that is not the position at all. Some of the miners are making very high wages indeed, but some are not. The mine-owners are in exactly the same position ; some making huge profits and others unable to show any profit at all. That is the cause of the whole trouble, as the honorable member for Hunter knows very well. I regret very much that any attempt has been made to interfere with this reference to the Tribunal, which was brought into existence at the suggestion of the unions. It has worked very well, and has, at any rate, maintained a greater degree of peace in the industry than existed before its appointment. One fact emerges from all this trouble. Things cannot go on as they are. If unemployment is to decrease prices must be readjusted to world conditions. </para>

                    <para class="block">It is no use burking the facts, for there they are. Coal is the raw material of perhaps ninety-nine out of every hundred manufactured articles in this country. It enters into each manufactured article from 10 per. cent, up to 70 per cent., and unless and until it is reduced in price we cannot expect to be able to compete successfully and so provide employment for our citizens. I do not mean to say that the price should be reduced by cutting wages and leaving the profits of the mine-owners just where they are. The <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> recently had an excellent leader on the subject. It pointed out that the suggestion had been made that the necessary sacrifice should be made by the men while nothing was said about the mine-owners. It disagreed with that view, and contended that this was a time for both parties to make sacrifices if any had to be made. With that I agree; it expresses my own opinions. </para>
                    <para>I now leans the question of coal, and come to that of sugar. I shall not go into it at any great length. The Leader of- the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> seems concerned about the high price of sugar. He is, of course, against reducing wages, for he believes in wages being high. Yet, curiously enough, he wants cheap goods. Moy I point out to him that there is one obvious way to get cheap sugar, and that is to get black-labour sugar. If the honorable gentleman does not believe in that course, I recommend him to go and see the men engaged in the cane-fields. Let him watch those men at work; and if he can then come and say that they ought to work for less than they are getting- </para>

                            <para>-  Do not let us be canting humbugs about the matter; there is no way in which we can get white-grown sugar unless we can induce men to go to the tropical and semi-tropical' parts of Australia, and do the hardest work that men can be called to do in this country. Personally, I would sooner do firing in the gas-works than out cane. We have to face the question; it is a fundamental one. We have to make up our minds to use black-grown sugar, or else pay the price for white-grown sugar. t We cannot discuss this great question now; but it will have to be faced. The Leader of the Opposition says that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company is making great profits. The figures I have here are those which I quoted when the sugar agreement was before the House. The refining charge of the company is £1 116. per ton ; the selling charge 7s.. per ton ; and cost of management £1 per ton, or altogether £2 18s. One penny per lb. is £9 6s. 8d., and £2 18s., I should say, represents about 5-16ths of a penny; but this honorable members can work out. If the price of sugar is high to-day, it is not- because the Colonial Sugar Refining Company is getting exorbitant profits. I notice that the Leader of the Opposition said that the profits had amounted  to 17$ per cent. All I can say is that the books of the company axe audited by the Government auditor, and the honorable member can. have access to the accounts at our sugar office here. I say that the charges of the company do not account for the high price of sugar. The fact is, as the honorable member knows perfectly well, that we had to pay up to £100 per ton for sugar as a result of the shortage in the Australian crop; and  as  we were selling sugar at £46 ls. 6d., it was necessary for the Commonwealth to recoup its loss,, and that is being done. It has been said that we have long ago made up t-ha.t loss, but there is not a word of truth in the statement. There is still an overdraft. As soon as it is made up, sugar will drop immediately in price. However, this question cannot be dealt with as a. side question en an occasion like this. We hear a lot of talk from interested quarters about sugar, but I invite Those who talk so much to see the conditions under which sugar is grown. I invite those people to visit the great State of Queensland, at which some are sneering as if it were some foreign country.. The men in that groat industry in our Northern State are doing their best- and their best is very good - to develop our Vast and wonderful tropical lands. There are people who talk about Java as a place where cheap sugar may 'be got j let those people go to Java and see how sugar is grown, there and compare it with the conditions obtaining in Australia. </para>

                    <para>I have figures here showing the prices of sugar in various countries of the world to-day. In Australia the price is £46 ls. 6d.; in  the United Kingdom, £48 10s.; and in New Zealand, £48 10s. f.o.b. Auckland. The retail prices are - Australia, 6d. ; United Kingdom, 5£d.; United States of America, 6 cents, or 3d.; New Zealand, 4Jd. to 5Jd. ; and South Africa, 5d. We must remember that in South Africa all sugar is grown by coolie labour, and yet the price is 5d: per lb. We could sell sugar here at 5d., if it were not that we have to make up the amount we lost through buying overseas sugars when the price was high. I think these figures disclose a fairly satisfactory state of affairs. It is said that imported sugar could be sold here at a very much lower </para>

                        Hashes. price than that which we now pay, and that the jam and other industries using sugar cannot compete in the markets of the world as a result. What are the facts? Java whites are quoted at £18, or landed here at £30 6s. 4d.; Cuba B £14 15s., landed £28 16s. 4d. ; American granulated £20 5s., landed £29 10s., and Belgian granulated £20,. landed £29. These figures show that imported sugars are only about . Id. less per lb. than the price of Australian coarse sugar, which is £39 15s. Australian jam manufacturers who manufacture for export get their sugar at 30s. per ton less than, the world's parity to-day. Remember, it is the oversea trade to which we must look; we have long ago exploited our own comparatively restricted market. All these facts have to be assimilated. The extent to which our export trade is growing is not, perhaps, generally recognised. Sometimes, too, it is forgotten how for many years we in Australia had the cheapest sugar in the world, and nobody wen suggested that the sugar-grower in Queensland ought to bring his price up to the world's parity. I remind honorable members again that not only jam manufacturers, but the manufacturers of milk, confectionery, biscuits, and the like for export get their sugar at 30s. per ton cheaper than the world's parity, while such goods going into England get the advantage of the English preference, so that the man who exports to the United Kingdom, as the majority of our manufacturers do, are in a much better position than are the manufacturers in any- other part of the world. I repeat that the price of sugar to-day is regulated only in part by' the contract, and in part is the result of the high price at which foreign sugars had to be purchased during the shortage. '

                    <para>The amendment of the Leader of the Opposition refers only to old-age and invalid pensions, but he said very little about them. He complained that we had not indicated that wc intended to increase these pensions. He brought in this reference almost as an afterthought, at the tail-end of his speech. Every one desires to do whatever is possible for the aged, the invalid, and the unfortunate, but we have to consider the circumstances of this country. The Leader of the Labour party knows very well what our financial  position is. He knows that, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Theodore:</inline> well put it, " The States now find themselves limited in many ways by finance." Invalid and old-age pensions to-day are on the same basis as that on which the Labour party put them when the scheme was first introduced. The Government recognise to the full their obligations to the aged, the invalid, the unfortunate, and are endeavouring by means of proposals with regard to health which we hope to develop, to do something for them. We cannot, however, venture upon proposals that would land us in a financial morass. If we did the Leader of the Labour party would be the first to denounce us. </para>
                    <para>The honorable member's references to old-age and invalid pensions are just an electioneering placard. When they were last before the country, the Labour party put forward a policy showing what they would do if returned to power. They said that they would increase the invalid and old-age pensions to £1 per week; that they would provide pensions for widows and orphans, and pensions for children whose fathers could not maintain them, whilst they would also provide food, and medical and dental attendance. My honorable friend the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt),</inline> who was then Treasurer, prepared a very effective return showing what it would cost to give effect to these proposals. He showed that they would involve an annual charge of £17,114,976 in respect of invalid, old-age, and these additional pensions, or a total increase of £11,320,000 per annum over the expenditure under these heads at that time. </para>
                    <para>My answer to the Leader of the Opposition must be exactly that made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Theodore</inline> to the unemployed when, in reply to a request for help, he said, " We have not got the money." The claim of the aged and invalid is, however, a just one. They have as much right to be considered as any other persons in the community. They have, indeed, a greater claim. The circumstances of the Commonwealth, however, must be taken into account. It would be well, perhaps, for honorable members opposite to turn their eyes towards Mecca - I mean Moscow - and see how it fares with the old, the infirm, and the unfortunate in that part of the world. I think the position there is that, nowadays, no one lives long enough to become old. They all fall by the wayside. There, under the benign influence and protection of the dictatorship of the proletariat they are hit on the head by Chinese mercenaries. </para>

It was made plain to us at the recent Economic Conference that representatives of the employees would not attend the Conference unless they were paid their expenses. Their expenses rested upon this foundation: That they should receive an amount equal to the wages they would have earned if they had been left at work, plus their hotel and travelling expenses. To this I agreed, and when one wage slave made out his account he put in for a daily wage of £2 5s. </para>

                        <para>.- The administration of the Australian Labour party and trade union movement have far-reaching public consequences in both political and industrial spheres affecting the character of our Parliaments and the relationships of the workers in the necessary production of the country. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>There has grown up in New South Wales, with its head-quarters at Macdonell House, Sydney, a Tammany junta, under Boss John Bailey, M.L.A., which systematically plunders and exploits the workers and pollutes Parliament. </para>
                    <para>So disease-laden has the whole machinery of the Australian- Labour party in New South Wales become - the germs of corruption having so infested the very warp and  woof of the Labour fabric - the timbers of the -temple of Labour having its vitals so eaten out with rottenness, that internal reform and rectification have become impossible. </para>
                    <para>It is in the public interest that the disclosures I propose to submit should be made the basis of a searching public inquiry. </para>
                    <para>In 1917, as Labour campaign director for New South Wales, two corrupt Labour ballots for the selection of Federal Labour candidates for East Sydney and West Sydney came under my notice. </para>
                    <para>I was largely instrumental in having them upset. They represented to me an entirely new and isolated development, and, having had them upset, the matter ended. I shall refer in particular to these again later. </para>
                    <para>In 1919, in consequence of another extraordinary development, namely, an insidious and widespread propaganda of Russian origin within the Labour movement, I led a successful campaign to prevent the Labour movement adopting, as its political programme what was in essence the Russian Soviet system, </para>
                    <para>Although an active member of the Australian Labour party for twenty-five years, and one of its leading organizers and campaigners throughout, I had not previously been associated with any internal rivalries or factions. But my experience in searching out the  Russian  white-anting campaign within the political Labour movement in 1919 revealed to me that I was part and parcel of a movement that now had strange characteristics that I could not understand. It was at this point that I joined a cleaning-up crusade. </para>
                    <para>The 1919-1920 New South Wales State election followed, and I was again in charge of the direction of Labour's forces in a successful campaign that  returned  the Storey Labour Government. </para>
                    <para>Then came the 1919 Federal election. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryan,</inline> who had retired from the Labour Premiership of Queensland to enter Federal politics, was made Federal campaign director, in order to create an official post -that would give him some Federal Labour status throughout the campaign. I was appointed, as usual, in charge in New South Wales, where  Labour was- very successful. </para>
                    <para>During these two last-mentioned State and Federal campaigns two startling incidents came under my notice. The first was an amount of corrupt money coming into the Federal campaign per medium of John Bailey. M.L.A., President of the New .South Wales Central Branch of the Australian Workers Union, and the Tammany Boss of New South Wales Labour. </para>
                    <para class="block">This caused me, after the election, to investigate the Labour selection ballot of the Goulburn State electorate, for  which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bailey</inline> was returned, and I found it grossly corrupt. </para>
                    <para>At the 3920 State Australian Labour Party Conference for New South Wales, I had motions placed on the official' business-paper designed to correct both these vile abuses - (1) The receipt by the Australian Labour .party of corrupt money, and (2) the corrupt manipulation of Australian Labour party parliamentary selection ballots.  But  Tammany got in early. With a Conference packed by Tammany - with the order of business coming before Conference per the hands of an Agenda Committee appointed under Tammany's direction - and with one&gt; of Tammany's chief agents - William Lambert - presiding at the Conference - my resolutions were at the convenient moment ruled out of order, and I was effectively gagged by what I afterwards discovered was a pre-arranged plan. Tammany dictated its own Australian Labour party Executive for 1920-1921 to control the movement and Government. Bailey selected the <inline font-style="italic">personnel,</inline> and had his own factotum made returning officer. The rest was easy. </para>
                    <para>The coming into power of the Labour Government provided Tammany with its golden opportunity. Tammany hastened the death of the State Labour Premier, John Storey, and Con. Wallace. </para>

                    <para>That was John Storey's last .Labour message. When he returned from England it waa plain that his life was spent. Even then Tammany was sharpening its axe for him, as Cecil Last, one of Tammany's subordinates, blurted out in the  press, and the public reception  I  organized in. the Sydney Town Hall was intended as a checkmate to the villanies of the gang. </para>
                    <para>I appealed openly, frankly, and publicly to the Labour movement prior to the 1921 Conference to rescue itself from Tammany, by means of a four-page signed explanatory circular, part of which appeared in the public press on 27th March, 1921, the following being an extract : - </para>

                        <para>Before going to England <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Storey informed me that the major time of Ministers was taken up trying to prevent intrigue and abuses.

                        <para>Another development of the 1919 elections, the first time in all my experience in the management of Labour campaigns in this State, was that large sums of money originating from sources not' made public were not bond <inline font-style="italic">fide</inline> administered. It would take too long for this nauseous subject to be dealt with in detail. To put a stop, to all the potentialities for corruption in this state of affairs also became a most vital matter. There are moneyed interests in Sydney that  Wlil  bribe their way through anything, and squeezing Governments in all manner of devious ways is their favourite get-rich-quick scheme. The Labour movement  is  in serious danger of being overwhelmed with illicit money. </para>
                        <para>I appeal to the delegates to the 1921 Conference to act unitedly together to' prevent our great and glorious movement being dragged in the mire of selfishness and corruption. </para>

                    <para>Time does not permit of a description of the villany and the criminality of the 1921 Labour Conference. I explained it in the New South Wales <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Times</inline> on 16th April last. There was undoubtedly a good majority for a clean up; but Tammany having control of the official machinery governing the admission of delegates and the direction of Conference, and finding itself cornered, rallied a sectarian campaign to its aid, and just managed with all its corrupt practices to save itself from defeat. </para>
                    <para>I was again gagged in the 1921 Conference by the <inline font-weight="bold">chairman, Mr. Lambert,</inline> refusing to " call me" when I rose to speak on a dozen occasions. Whilst Conference was still sitting I issued an invitation to delegates to meet me in the Southern Cross Hall on 31st March, 1921. I sent a special invitation explaining the purport of the meeting, by hand, to Messrs. Bailey and Lambert, Boote (editor of the <inline font-style="italic">Worker),</inline> Grayndler (general secretary of the Australian Workers Union), and Hinchcliffe <inline font-style="italic">(Worker</inline> manager). <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Grayndler</inline> I learned was in Melbourne. Of those named only <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Boote</inline> attended. For two hours I described the corruption of John Bailey and his Tammany junta to the delegates. Bailey blocked any further action in Conference by commencing a libel suit for £2,000 damages, which he withdrew later on when I gave him eight days' notice to set the case down for hearing. It was in pursuit of my inquiries for the defence of this libel suit that I discovered the widespread nature of the activities of this Tammany junta. </para>
                    <para>An extraordinary election having been forced on New South Wales, the Labour Government was smashed at the polls on 25th March, 1922. On 2nd April, after exhausting every other avenue, for the first time I published a carefully considered and mildly- worded analysis of Labour's deplorable condition, with a constructive appeal to the whole of New South Wales Labour to join together in an effort to publicly and candidly put our house in order as absolutely essential  if! .we were to be rehabilitated in the confidence and good will of the people. As every Labour channel of publication is under a strict censorship, which shields Tammany from exposure, the only means of reaching the rank and file of Labour was through the public press.  </para>
                    <para>In violation of the constitution and rules of the Australian Labour party, and without any charge being preferred, the Tammany-controlled New South Wales Australian Labour party executive declared my expulsion on 7th April last. Tammany's two chiefs - Bailey and Lambert - were present directing the operations far my so-called expulsion. </para>
                    <para>Thus Tammany declared that it would not allow an investigation and a rectification of unparalleled wrong-doing - that to be a Labour member under the Australian Labour party every Labour member's eyes must be closed to, and he must connive at, and bo a consenting party to, well-known, widespread corruption. </para>
                    <para>In the New South Wales <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Times</inline> of 9th, 16th, 23rd, and 30th April last, I produced overwhelming evidence 'to substantiate the most sensational charges. Not one Labour member - Federal or State - nor, indeed, any other person, has answered or contradicted those charges in any shape or form. Corruption is so rampant, so generally accepted, and Tammany's control so complete, that not one Labour member even so much as demands either an inquiry to resolve his doubts, if he has any, or reform, to correct wholesale wrong-doing, if he is satisfied, as he must inevitably be, that the case against Tammany is unanswerable. </para>
                    <para>The New South Wales State Conference which followed, and which has just terminated abruptly in disorder, was more entirely controlled by Tammany than ever. In face of the gravest charges challenging the <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> of the administration of the Australian Labour party at every essential -point - for serious charges were made by responsible Labour men even at this Conference - not one step was taken for either inquiry or reform. Tammany was able once again to stifle all who challenged its rotten administration. </para>
                    <para>Administration of the Australian Workers Union. From 1915 to the present, John Bailey has been president of the Central Branch, Australian Workers Union. During that period till the end of 1921 its secretary was W. H. Lambert. Probably this branch has handled upwards of £100,000 of membership contributions in that time. the last credit balance was £52. These men came into office by the previous officers being jockeyed out between elections. They have since controlled the appointment- of the returning officer, and the conduct of their own election by postal ballot from the four comers of New South Wales. No one with inside knowledge believes  that  an honest ballot has been conducted "since 1915. The clearest possible evidence of wholesale, barefaced ballot-faking and impropriety and embezzlement in the administration of union funds is given by A. B. Berry, 14 Henry -street, Lidcombe, New South Wales, an organizer of the Australian Workers Union, in two pamphlets issued, and signed by him, dated 14th December, 1921, and 24th February. 1922. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Berry</inline> will supply particulars to any person interested. Time does not permit me to go over the proofs of the. wholesale ballot-faking and embezzlement of union moneys which are given in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Berry's</inline> pamphlets. </para>
                    <para>At the last ballot for officers of - this organization, two organizers - Messrs. Berry and Dunn - paid a scrutineer £62 to watch the count, drawn out obviously to make the scrutiny so costly that the scrutineer would have to be withdrawn. It took seven weeks to count 2,000 votes. Out of a membership of 14,000, reduced from 23,000 the previous year - for tha Australian Workers Union members are becoming so disgusted with this rottenness that they are refusing to pay their contributions --only 2,000 votes were recorded. With this partial oversight at the count <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lambert</inline> could only ' obtain 504 votes for delegate to the Australian Workers Union Convention. Bailey's vote was 555. Their union offices were not contested. The whole membership is convinced of the dishonesty and futility of the ballots. </para>
                    <para>Messrs. Lavelle, M.H.B., Berry, and others appealed to the last Australian Workers Union Convention for an investigation into the affairs of the Central Branch. They obtained an auditor's inquiry, but limited to £1,000 of expenditure out of some £25,000 for the year, when of this amount over £300 was proven to have been embezzled or improperly used. The auditors also showed that the representation of the union to the Australian Labour party Conference was swollen enormously, and that the funds of the union were used to fake up delegates from other organizations. But the auditors' report has been suppressed, and the report of the Australian Workers Union Convention severely censored, so that the members shall not know how they are cheated and robbed. The manner in which the fund faking of the Central Branch is hushed up shows that the majority of the delegates to the Australian Workers Union Convention, who are mostly officials, are afraid of an inquiry" for fear of light being let in on the whole administration of the union. </para>
                    <para>In connexion with the 1919 election for the chief executive of the Australian Workers Union, a committee of inquiry was appointed, and it found that votes were cast for hundreds of faked members' names appearing in the Central Branch books. It was also discovered that the Central Branch had obtained an undue number of duplicate members' tickets from the <inline font-style="italic">Worker</inline> office. </para>

                    <para>For the past seven years Messrs. Bailey and Lambert have controlled the Australian Labour party in New South Wales by the manipulation of the machinery and funds of the central branch of the Australian Workers Union.' It was barefacedly announced by Tom Arthur, at a meeting of the Australian Labour party executive, that lie was a party to a meeting which included Messrs. Bailey and Lambert, at Orange, 15th July, 1915, where it was decided to transfer the headquarters of the central branch of the Australian Workers Union from Orange to Sydney, for the express purpose of controlling the Australian Labour party. As the grip of this gang has increased, so has corruption become progressively widespread up to the present intolerable and unchallenged condition. </para>
                    <para>The Rabbit Skin Scheme. During the war, this central branch handled rabbits and rabbit skins for its rabbit-trapper membership. This ran into big figures, reaching as much as £150,000 in a year. No balance-sheet was ever published. </para>
                    <para>Some individual members, after the greatest difficulty in the world, succeeded <inline font-style="italic">h\</inline> getting, in typed form, what were alleged to be balance-sheets. A few were thus sent out, but they were never published. I defy any one to show me a <inline font-style="italic">Worker</inline> report, or a report, of the central branch, or of the union as a whole, or to show a balance-sheet published in any of the official organs. </para>
                    <para>Instead of marketing these products to save the charges of the middlemen by union officers, as the members were led to believe, they were taken delivery of by John Bridge and Company, by arrangement with Messrs. Bailey and Lambert. </para>
                    <para>Clarence Bridge stated on 19th April, 1921, that the skins marketed for the Australian Workers Union by John Bridge and Company reached as much as £3,000 per week, and that Bailey received a secret rebate of 2| per cent, as commission, amounting to £100 per week. Clarence Bridge ' indicates what steps should bc taken to substantiate his statement. He states that while shipping was held up during the war, special permits were obtained to ship skins to America, and that the profits from this source alone ran into additional theusands per week. These moneys were never accounted for to the membership. ^ </para>
                    <para>At the 1919 Federal election, Bailey distributed £500 through the Australian Labour party, stating it was Australian Workers Union money. Some of this went to certain Federal members to help pay their election expenses. As campaign director, I challenged this money, that it was not from the Australian Workers Union. When cornered, Bailey admitted that he received £1,000 from John Bridge and Company in a lump sum at the time, that he put £500 into the Labour campaign, and could have kept the whole of it. </para>

                    <para>I was excluded from meetings of the branches to put my case, and in my absence the best the honorable member for Darling could get in the district in which he lives was an equal division of nineteen for either side. </para>

                    <para class="block">In 1920, following the election and the distribution of this John Bridge money, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Blakely, president</inline> of the Australian Workers Union, defeated me for the party secretaryship. Both before and since, the Labour movement appointed me to direct its campaigns. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Blakely</inline> did not defeat me on service or ability. Certain members thought their campaign contributions came from the Australian Workers Union, whereas this money was -part of the stolen property of the- rabbit-trappers  of New South Wales. </para>
                    <para>These are only some of the cases of maladministration of the Australian Workers Union. Much more could be exposed upon inquiry. </para>
                    <para>The Mark Lane Stevedoring Company. The  chairman  of this company is J. K. Trethowan, M.L.C. He is also  chairman  of the Farmers  and Graziers Cooperative Company. In 1920, the latter took over the business of John Bridge and Company, and continued to handle the rabbit skins for the Australian Workers Union. At this time the handling of wheat at Darling Island was being carried out by day labour, under the Labour Government. At the New South Wales Australian Labour party executive meeting, 11th February, 1921, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tyrell</inline> stated he had reason to believe that the Minister for Agriculture intended giving this work by contract to the Mark Lane Stevedoring Company, thus abolishing day labour. He moved, and it was carried, that a letter of protest be sent to the Minister by hand next morning. At the same time, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mills, president</inline> of the Wharf Labourers Union, saw me and stated that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bailey</inline> was trying to have the Darling Island wheat handling dealt with by contractors. About the same time <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bailey</inline> moved in the New South Wales Labour Caucus to abolish the handling of wheat for the Wheat Pool by day labour and substitute the contract system by wheat agents. Only five members voted for the proposal. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bailey</inline> had the audacity to have a list made of the voters - a threat of consequences by Tammany. . </para>
                    <para>Silo Construction. When the New South Wales Labour Government took office in 1920, the construction of silos was incomplete and suspended. The policy of the Labour Government was day labour. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bailey</inline> saw Tees dale Smith, contractor, and offered to arrange the contracts for build- . ing the remaining silos, and see that no objection was made by the Railway Workers branch' »of the Australian Workers Union for the sum of £1,000. Teesdale Smith, in anger, came to me about the matter. I at once rang up the Minister for Agriculture, made an appointment, and reported the matter to him. Later on, one of the country Labour members informed me that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bailey</inline> had convened a meeting of country Labour members, and there urged the building of the silos by contract. This matter was reported by me to the' Australian Labour party Conference delegates, 21st Marsh, 1921, together with a long catalogue of corruption. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bailey'</inline> chose this item for the issue of a writ for £2,000 damages, thinking that as Teesdale Smith had since died I could not substantiate my statement. The Australian Labour party executive subsequently white-washed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bailey,</inline> in their own words they " accepted <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bailey's</inline> assurance " that there was no truth in the statement, and resolved to pay my costs if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bailey</inline> withdrew his writ. Upon a notice by me to set the case down for hearing, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bailey</inline> withdrew his writ, and the Australian Labour party executive subsequently paid my costs, between £60 and £70. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bailey</inline> stated the Australian Workers Union would pay his costs. </para>
                    <para>The Lord Mayoralty of Sydney. In 1920 W. P. Fitzgerald was Labour Lord Mayor. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lambert</inline> was an alderman,  president  of the Australian Labour party, and secretary of the central branch of the Australian Workers Union. A proposal to acquire a coal mine for the city council was under the consideration of Labour aldermen. The purchase price was £75,000, and it transpired that the mine had only cost £5,000. The thirteen Labour aldermen were caucused on it, and a small majority forced the other's to concur. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fitzgerald</inline> opposed this vigorously. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lambert</inline> had ambitions to become Lord Mayor. A canvass of his fellow aldermen showed he had no chance. There were two reasons to get <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fitzgerald</inline> out r* the way. </para>

                        and reported that a lady assistant demanded Id. over the fixed price for a pint of kerosene. There was a storm in the Sydney press, and the Lambert campaign to displace

                        as Lord Mayor was thereby advanced. Suddenly, the inspector's report disappeared from the files of the Profiteering Court. There is evidence, that Alexander stole the report and returned it to Bailey.

                            <para>- Yes. I shall have to return to the subject on three or four more occasions in order to deal with other matters as vital and important as that to which I have referred to-day, but of a different character altogether. </para>

                    <para>It is incomprehensible that members who are put forward to carry the banner of this organization in New South Wales have not taken a united and determined stand for a thorough inquiry into and a correction of the widespread gross abuses. </para>
                    <para>In all the years during which I have been associated with the Labour movement, I have never before had any serious differences with my colleagues - certainly not in Parliament, and not with the executive body in New South Wales. During those twenty-five years no man has given more of the' life-blood of his young manhood than I in the hard work of the Labour movement, in the organization of its campaigns, and in the preparation of its literature. It may have been a misfortune or otherwise - I do not know - that my part in the Labour movement was associated with the organization of its campaigns, and was intimately concerned with its management, but it was impossible for me to see what I saw going on recently without protest. Know, ing that a young man could not obtain selection as a parliamentary candidate unless he abased himself to the Tammany junta, which is up for the highest bidder, it  waB  impossible for 'me to remain associated with such an organization without doing everything in my power to root that element out. It is of no personal advantage to me to take the stand I have. I could have sat down quietly and winked at the whole situation, but I have reported these matters to the Labour organizations in my own electorate, and I have attended Labour Conferences with resolutions on the authority of Cook branches of the Australian Labour party, and the approval of the Cook Federal Labour Council, placed on the business-paper in accordance with every requirement of the rule-book, but the motions have been brutally ruled out of order, because the Tammany junta would not allow an inquiry or a correction within the Labour movement. </para>
                    <para>This year, 1922, there was every prospect of a Labour Government being again returned to power to work great good for the masses in a difficult and trying time; but when I saw the Labour Government smashed, because the workers of New South Wales had experienced so much of the treachery and rottenness of the Australian Labour party that they spewed the thing out of their mouths, I realized that it was time for me to put the facts before the Labour electors in my State, particularly when the Labour press and the Worker suppress all criticism of the thieves and fakirs. </para>
                    <para>I repeat what I have said - and it will have to be repeated over and over again - that Labour, organized through the Australian Labour party, cannot be rehabilitated in the good-will and esteem of the country until there has been a . thorough cleaning-out of the movement. </para>

                        <para>. - I have been amused and somewhat shocked to hear the extraordinary statements and accusations of the honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Catts).</inline> As my name was associated with what he has been speaking about, and as be has taken advantage of the protection which parliamentary privilege affords him to  make  a lot of allegations and assumptions of a very serious nature, I think it devolves upon me to show honorable members that there is not an atom of truth in any one of -  those  statements. The honorable member has abused all and sundry; he has referred to me as an associate  of  a gang of corruptionists, and as a person who has manipulated, corruptly the funds of a political body and a great industrial organization. Before I deal with those statements, I would like to mention one or two matters that concern the honorable member vitally. He stated that the late  Hon.  John Storey, shortly before his death, had an interview with him and said, " For God's sake, save us from .these savages !" <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Storey</inline> is a dead man, and that statement was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Catts</inline> after his death. </para>

                            <para>- I shall deal first with the honorable member's statement m connexion with the Australian Workers Union management. That directly concerns me, as I was secretary of the organization for some eight years. Any moneys spent from the funds of the union are used in accordance with the rules, and not otherwise. The accounts of the organization are .thoroughly audited by chartered accountants every year. Balance-sheets are placed before the annual convention, the members of which are elected throughout Australia on a plebiscite vote of the members of the union. I also desire to refer to the statement that the Australian Workers Union is being used to maintain the Australian Labour party organization. The union certainly is affiliated with the Australian Labour party, but so are many other unions, each of which pays its affiliation fees, and the books of the organization of which I was secretary will show plainly that no more than the affiliation fees have been paid. </para>

                    <para>The honorable member has accused the Australian Labour party of receiving illicit moneys, but he has not adduced an atom of proof to support his allegation of corrupt practice. It is very easy for a man to come here like a coward, under the cloak of privilege, and attack men who are not in a position to defend themselves. He mentioned the names of men such as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. James</inline> Tyrrell, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Woods,</inline> of the Wharf Labourers Union, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mills,1 Mr. William</inline> Carey (secretary of the Australian Labour party), and Mr: Gibb, who is at present acting secretary. It is most cowardly for a man to make such statements without endeavouring in the slightest way to prove any of them. These men have no means of defending themselves. They are. not able to institute action against the honorable member for damages; but I would like him to go outside the walls of Parliament and repeat these statements. </para>

I heard the honorable member for Cook abuse the executive who expelled him from the Labour party, and he said that I and another gentleman attended the meeting, and directed the campaign against him. I shall read to the House an opinion of the executive expressed by the honorable member before that meeting. </para>

It has elected a strong, capable, and representative team that can and will work well together. It is the strongest and brainiest executive we have had for many years. It is distinctly an anti-Bailey executive.

                            <para>-I cannot state the exact date off hand, but the information is at my disposal elsewhere. If all that the honorable member for Cook has  Bald  be true, why did he squeal so loudly when he wad booted out of the Labour organization recently? He was intimately associated with the management and counsels of the Labour movement in New South Wales, and if his allegations have any foundation in fact, he must have been a party to all that was taking place, and must be held equally guilty with every other person connected with the organization. The honorable member has stated that money was illicitly received by some person or organization. I was  president  of the Australian Labour party for five years, and I voluntarily resigned from the position. It was not part of my duty, as  president,  to handle the cash of the organization; that is the duty of the secretary and the finance committee. The honorable member told the House that he heard somebody say that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bailey</inline> had received £1,000 from the brewers' organization, and that he handed £500 to some Labour delegates, and pocketed the balance. He also alleges that he heard a lady say that she could get £500 from the brewers to pack the Australian Labour Party Conference. That was a most cowardly statement, and slanders a man and woman who, so far as I know, are decent and honest. On the face of it the statement is absurd. The Conference is composed of delegates elected from hundreds of branches of the organization throughout New South Wales, and from the big affiliated trade unions, and to talk of packing such a great body by means of an expenditure of £500 is ridiculous. It would be necessary for each and every one of the delegates to be corruptible. Usually there are over 200 delegates from all parts of the States, and at least 50 per cent. of them would require to be dishonest and ready to sell their vote for a couple of pounds. No doubt, if anything like that was taking place, the honorable member for Cook had a better knowledge of it than I had, and he probably was the gentleman most concerned. He spoke about the criminality of the Labour Conference of 1921, and seems to be very much aggrieved because some motion brought forward by him was ruled out of order. The honorable member is one who would understand the standing orders of any organization with which he was connected, and he knows that most constitutions give the right to any member or delegate to move dissent from any ruling by the  chairman.  I believe that the honorable member for Cook did move some unimportant and superfluous motion in regard to a matter already provided for in the constitution, and his proposal was accordingly ruled out of order. A motion of dissent was submitted, but the ruling was upheld by about 200 votes to six. Apparently the honorable member accuses the 200 delegates who voted against him of being dishonest and corrupt, thieves, swindlers, and criminal intriguers. He quoted a remark said to have been made by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Percy</inline> Brookfield about the duplication of Australian Workers Union tickets. All the tickets issued by the Australian Workers Union are printed at <inline font-style="italic">The Worker</inline> office, in Sydney, and the trustees of that newspaper are the only indentors of a particular class of paper. When the tickets are printed they are distributed to the branch secretaries throughout Australia in accordance with orders previously sent by them to the manager of <inline font-style="italic">The Worker.</inline> These branch secretaries must account for every ticket, and if they do not return intact all tickets unissued, they must pay for those that are missing. It is not likely that an officer receiving £400 or £500 per annum would pay for many tickets at 25s. each in Order to steal a few votes for himself. It is easy to say that the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brookfield</inline> made a statement; the poor fellow has gone to his grave, and cannot deny the allegation. I understand, also, that the machine which prints the tickets in <inline font-style="italic">The Worker</inline> office has a special numbering device, and that it is almost impossible to imitate or fake that number in any way. On one occasion some bogus tickets did appear in  connexion with a Labour selection, ballot in the old Naomi electorate, but I do not think that the candidates included one member of the Australian Workers Union, let alone an officer of that organization. </para>

                            <para>- Yes ; it was exposed by the returning officer. (He discovered  that some forged  voting-slips similar to those attached to the Australian Workers Union tickets had been used in order to record votes for a certain candidate; but those votes were not admitted. An inquiry was held as to the genuineness of the tickets, and the forgery was detected at a glance. Upon that incident the honorable member for Cook founds an allegation that there is widespread duplication of tickets in connexion with the Australian Workers Union, that there is. widespread fraud amongst its officers, and that the whole organization is corrupt and rotten. As for the statements of the honorable member for Cook - those in which he slanders various officers of the Australian Workers Union throughout Australia, and dumps them down here as criminals and, altogether, as persons who cannot be trusted, as men who are robbing the workers of Australia, - I would stake my reputation against that of the honorable member at any time. Morally or privately, or from the political or any other stand-point, my reputation will compare more than favorably with that of the honorable member. Moreover, there is not an officer in the Australian Workers Union to-day who cannot say the same. Each and every individual of those officers is elected, in his own respective branch, by a plebiscite of members; not by any postal vote, but by votes marked in the various camps, or sheds, or quarries, or in whatever place members of the Australian  Workers  Union may be employed, by a  deputy  returning officer. These votes are sealed and addressed to a returning officer in Sydney. No person other than that returning officer has access to the papers, and he does not see them until he has opened the box concerned, and is ready to count the votes in the presence of two scrutineers. </para>

                    </continue><para>The honorable member for Cook has also said that it is about time some searching inquiry was made into the scheme which I initiated for the benefit of the bush workers in 1918, or thereabouts. This project was known as the rabbit-skin handling scheme. I was then secretary of the central branch of the Australian Workers Union, situated at Orange.' I could see that the rabbit trappers, who are mostly members of the Australian Workers Union, were not getting a square deal. The middlemen and small buyers at the various centres and stations and corners throughout New South Wales were buying up the trappers' stuff at less than half the fair price. I initiated a scheme, and advertised it, and got, as best I could, into touch with practically all of the men concerned. 1 asked the' trappers to send me their skins, and said I would rut them on the Sydney auction market, and would get them a fair price. The  scheme  was put into operation, and <inline font-style="italic">X</inline> put through many tens of thousands of pounds worth pf skins. I received actually, in some cases, as much as in the vicinity of 17s. for 1 lb. of skins, and sometimes as much as £80 odd for about 60 lbs. of rabbit skins. This was at auction. The carrying on of the scheme naturally entailed a little labour. I had an expert for a while whom I had trained up with the scheme, and I had also a stenographer. I was getting a rebate from the Belling agents of lj per cent, in order to carry on the business, and pay for my labour. That lj per- cent, did not quite' suffice to keep matters going. I considered, there-, fore, that it would be an absolutely fail thing if I were to make a further deduction. I thereupon deducted another $ per cent, from the returns sent to me. That was done, of course, with the full knowledge and acquiescence of the people who were sending me their goods. This $ per cent, made up a total of 2 per cent. Whether the scheme will be carried on further, I do not know. It has been practically dead for the past six months or more. There have been no rabbits to skin; the drought wiped out nearly all of them. Just latterly, however, the rabbits are becoming more plentiful again, and men are beginning <inline font-style="italic">to-</inline> drift out, and to take on trapping once more. Thus, probably, the scheme will be carried on further. I understand that the Australian Workers Union itself is about £50 behind in its funds as a result of carrying through the scheme. It was a matter of organization in order to benefit members of the Australian Workers Union, and also of organizing the men themselves into the union. </para><para>So much for the honorable member for Cook and his bald and unscrupulous statement. The honorable member knows that I went over the whole of the ground in connexion with the scheme before the Australian Workers Union, at an annual convention, and that I produced a balance-sheet there, and was unanimously complimented by the conference of delegates from all over Australia upon the way in which I had initiated and handled the project. The honorable member for Cook made a deliberate and wilfully untrue statement when he said that there was no balance-sheet published in connexion with the scheme. A balance-sheet has been published from time to time, and the whole of the accounts in connexion with the scheme are kept by an. expert &lt; bookkeeper in the Australian Workers Union offices. When statements of the kind which have been uttered by the honorable member are publicly made, one cannot refer to them other than by stigmatizing them as unscrupulous and  untruthful  - baldly, as lies - and as not being fair to anybody, either inside or outside of this House. It comes very hard upon honorable men outside of this chamber that they should be so attacked. It is particularly hard upon them that a person such ds the honorable member for Cook, under the protection and privileges of Parliament, should come here and make such a determined and cowardly attempt to destroy their characters. </para><para>The honorable member has mentioned a statement which he alleges was made to him by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith. It is significant that the honorable member did_ not announce that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith had told him certain things until after that gentleman had died. The honorable member seems to have a convenient knack of doing such things. He made some statement, I believe, at a gathering of his own friends in Castlereagh street, at the time of the 1921 Australian Labour Party Conference. Things wore not going too well with him at that conference, and he became so perturbed and disgruntled that he got a few of the malcontents around him. I hardly like </para><para>Ur. Lambert. to call them  Tammanyites,  for that would be employing a word which the honorable member himself likes to use, but which expression is so played out that only the honorable member would now resort to it. He gathered these friends about him, and, with a flourish of trumpets and the beating of drums, called them together in a little hall in Castlereagh-street. There happened to be one or two honest men there, and afterwards they made known what the honorable member for Cook had told those present. I understand that there were also representatives of the press present. I do not think they published the honorable member's statements, however, for the reason that they were too libellous. I sholl now quote an extract from the apology of the honorable member, made in connexion with this business.  I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> Bailey, a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, issued a writ against the honorable member for Cook for a sum of £1,000, or the like. The honorable member for Cook has just stated in this chamber that he gave <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bailey</inline> eight days in which to go ahead with the charge. I do not know just exactly what is the legal position in Victoria, but I understand that, in New South Wales, if a person issues a writ against another he has an option concerning when he shall go on with it ; that is to say, as to <inline font-style="italic">-when</inline> the case shall be dealt with. The extract from the honorable member's apology is as follows:-- </para><para>After the denial of the truth of it by Messrs. Alexander Brown &amp; Co., solicitors for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bailey,</inline> I accept tha opportunity this evening to apologize in connexion with this Teesdale Smith matter. My apology is full, unreserved, and withdraws all imputations that might be considered made. </para><para class="block">The honorable member for Cook has stood up in his place in the House of Representatives and has made deliberately untrue statements. I have the proof of their untruthfulness. Moreover, as I remarked at the beginning of my speech, in my own opinion, and in that of very many other men who know the honorable member, his word is one which cannot be taken by any honest person. </para><para>I do not propose to deal with every petty insinuation and obviously untrue statement that the honorable member has made here. It is not a very pleasant thing for me to drag into this Chamber  details concerning the organization with which I have the honour to be connected. It is most distasteful, indeed, that such matters should be aired in Parliament, particularly when they are altogether irrelevant to the subject under discussion. But since the honorable member for Cook has been allowed to get this " dope," or " tripe," into <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> then, no matter, how distasteful the task, I feel it to be my duty to make reply. In conclusion, 1 desire to point out that the honorable member for Cook is a disgruntled and disappointed man to-day. He has been kicked out of the Labour party for turning traitor; for being absolutely disloyal to the party. He has been disappointed in his aspirations; his ambitions have not been fulfilled. He has aspired to every position in the movement. I cannot help it if the movement has not seen fit to put him into any one of those positions which he has sought. He has aspired to fill practically every office offering in the Labour party movement, both State and Federal. But the members of the party, and of the Conferences, and of the executives, have taken the honorable member for Cook at his own face value. They have distrusted him, and under no circumstances have they been induced to give to him any position in the movement. Therefore, in his disappointment and chagrin at the failure of his intrigues, he has practically sold the Labour party. Whereupon, I repeat, for turning traitor, he has now been, expelled. Now he is endeavouring to expose a lot of faked or imaginary grievances and crimes, and having made the allegations so often, no doubt he is beginning to think that some' of them aro true. </para><interjection>

                            <para>-  As a personal explanation I should like .to say that the apology to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bailey</inline> in connexion with the Teesdale Smith matter has not been correctly stated by the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lambert).</inline> Before the writ was served upon me, I was asked if I would go to the Labour Conference and explain the matter, and accept <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bailey's</inline> denial. It was .my object to get the whole of the facts before the Labour Conference, and I made a categorical statement setting forth the facts. It was a tactical method of getting the facts officially before the Conference. These facts were so terribly damaging to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bailey</inline> and others that his solicitor absolutely refused to allow them to . go before the Labour Conference. . I had ' drafted my letter in that particular way in order that the whole matter should go before the Conference, but they declined to allow it. As a matter of fact, therefore, that apology was not made at all: It was after the refusal, to regard this as an apology that the writ was issued. The honorable member for West Sydney merely read a few lines out of a three page foolscap typewritten document, in which I sought to get all of the facts before the Labour Conference. I shall deal with other points raised by the honorable member for West Sydney on another occasion. </para>

                        <para>. - I am very glad that, in view of" the Prime Minister's unsatisfactory state of health to-day, the indulgence which he asked of the House was extended to him ; but making all allowances for his ill-health I must confess that I have never heard him flounder so badly as he did this afternoon in his attempt to reply to the charges made by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton).</inline> The real issues before the House were not. touched upon at all by the right honorable gentleman. He mentioned them, it is true, but then he endeavoured by a, skilful manipulation of words to evade any specific statement. He accused the honorable member for Hunter of being extremely solicitous now about the . carrying out of, a number of important public works in connexion with the Postal Department, and wanted to know what the honorable member or his party had done in connexion with- these public works. Without unnecessary boasting as to the achievements of the Labour party, at that time, it may be said that the first Fisher Government, which held office from 1910 to 1913, carried out, as part of a continuous policy in connexion with the Post Office, a number of important works, such as the undergrounding of telephones, with the result that the honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce),</inline> as Treasurer, is now receiving a considerable amount of revenue. I am sure the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> will admit that I am stating the facts. He knows very well that, in order to insure the best results, there must be continuity of policy in big public undertakings, and that it is unwise to shut down on works simply because the end' of the financial year is approaching, because when Parliament has given the necessary authorization there must necessarily be some loss of time before the staffs can be assembled again. It was the policy of the Fisher Government to insure continuity in the carrying out of such public works, and, therefore, large sums of money were made available from time to time. </para>

I challenge honorable members opposite to deny this statement. On other occasions, I have pointed out these facts to the members of the present Ministry, so they cannot now claim to be the originators of the proposal. When the Prime Minister suggests that the Leader of the Opposition and his party have never done anything to push on with great developmental public works in connexion with this great money-earning Department, he is certainly talking with his tongue in his cheek. My complaint now is that the Government did not make an earlier start with these developmental works that have been outlined. For some years, there has been absolute unanimity of opinion in the House as to the necessity for a more progressive policy in connexion with the Postal Department, and only now, at the eleventh hour, have the Government come down with a flourish of trumpets- </para>

                            <para>- I am not complaining. I am only expressing regret that this policy was not adopted much earlier because the Government have practically had the assent of Parliament to this course of action. Nobody is more opposed than I am to the spending of public money without parliamentary authority, but when there are 13,000 people throughout Australia waiting to pour money into the Treasury as soon as they can get telephonic connexions, the Government would be justified in taking some definite steps promptly to secure the additional revenue. Parliament would readily assent to the expenditure for this purpose. The Government, somewhat late in the day, have come down with a proposal to spend about £8,000,000 over a series of years at the rate of about £2,000,000 per annum to bring our telephonic and telegraphic services up to date, but I suppose that before anything is really done, they will await the vote of Parliament for the authorization of the first loan. </para>

                    <para>On the question of immigration, I want to make it quite clear that my Leader and other honorable members on this side have said, over and over again, that as a party we are not opposed to immigration, provided a scheme is formulated to absorb the immigrants, as well as employ our own people. That must be done first. The Prime Minister declared that the States would receive no financial help from the Commonwealth Government unless their immigration schemes insured that the immigrants should go upon the land. But what are the results? I come in contact with many farmers, and I know what is happening. Only the other day I was informed by a returned soldier farmer that his experience and the experience of many others waa. that, after about a fortnight or three weeks on the land, very many of the immigrants gravitate to the cities seeking employment. I remind the House of what happened in Victoria. About twelve years ago we had a batch of immigrants settled on the land; but as soon as their doles had given out they came down to Melbourne and, metaphorically speaking, held a pistol at the head of the Government, declaring that if the Government did not provide them with jobs similar to those they had held in England they would write home to their friends stating that Victoria was not a very desirable place to come to. Those men, many of them, are now in our workshops and other city concerns. I am afraid that the same results will follow the adoption of the present immigration scheme, and that while the Commonwealth Government may advance money to the States for the purpose of settling newcomers on the land, by-and-by they will come trooping in their thousands into the towns and cities looking for employment. Only to-day I heard on very good authority how immigration is affecting men who have been engaged in the Newport Workshops for years carrying out important works of construction. Last week the order came for the displacement of a large number of them, and though there was no serious decline of work to justify such a step, these Australianborn citizens had to make way for others who have recently been brought from the other side of the world. Is this the sort of result that we are to expect from the vast sums of money that are being spent on immigration? Of course, the Government make certain grants to the States, but when the money has been handed over there is no sort of supervision on the part of the Commonwealth. </para>

Hitherto, owing first to unwise selection, men have been brought here out of the factories of the Old World, and placed on the land without their having any idea of practical farming. Then, as soon as the system shows any signs of breaking down, these immigrants come to the authorities and demand work under threats of letting the people on the other side of the world know that the country is no good. </para>

                    <para>Mr.FENTON.- If the Government have any means of organizing to meet the unemployment difficulty, and to encourage proper immigration, they ought, in the name of all that is good, at once set to work and give some evidence of the fact. When the Government have done this, I shall be found with them up to the hilt, but their present course must, as in the past, lead to absolute disaster. I do not know whether any arrangement has been made with the Premier of Western. Australian to co-operate in the scheme which has been drawn up between that State and the Imperial Government, with the approval of certain organizations, to further emigration. It would seem that the Premier of Western Australia has made a good impression of the Imperial authorities, who are willing to support him in the scheme he has in hand. </para>

                            <para>- That, of course, comes well from the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fowler),</inline> but, in my opinion, Queensland is " on top " in that regard. I did see, the other day, that one of the most valuable estates in Western Australia had been acquired by the State Government at the small price of 30s. an acre; all I can say is, that if any decent estates in Victoria were required, even for the most benevolent purposes, the owners would open thoir mouths extraordinarily wide, and demand an exorbitant price. If the climatic conditions are all right, and proper facilities are provided, the Western Australian scheme ought to prove a good one ; but, at the same time - and I shall be borne out by Queensland representatives - I think the Queensland Government have put forward the best proposition up to the present. There are in that State the Burnett lands, a magnificent tract of country awaiting settlement, fertile, with certain facilities already there, and others to be provided. When, however, the Commonwealth Government is approached by a State Labour Government to take part in the development of this land, which would provide work for the unemployed and for immigrants, no desire is shown to cooperate. Immediately, however, a scheme is suggested in Western Australia, where the political complexion of the Government is different, the Prime Minister is prepared to offer help. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Theodore,</inline> because he is the Leader of a Labour Government, cannot induce the Prime Minister to take any further interest in the scheme for the Northern State; and I charge the Government with, in this instance, drawing an obvious distinction. </para>

                    <para>This afternoon the Prime Minister made the wonderful statement, that it is the duty of the State Governments to see that the people are employed. The Commonwealth Government have a Post and Telegraph Department and a Works and Railways Department, and they are carrying out, or assisting in carrying out, such great schemes as that on the Murray. At present, millions are being spent in giving employment, and millions more could be spent if the Government were a little more sympathetic. It is the duty of the Government to find employment, seeing that there are Federal works which have to be carried out in the various States. </para>
                    <para>Another peculiar statement made by the Prime Minister is that to increase old-age pensions would draw the Government into a " financial morass." Did ever a more unsympathetic sentence fall from the lips of a Prime Minister, or any other member of this House? The dear old men and women of this land have gone through trouble and trials, of which we of this day have had no experience, but of which we have heard, and yet these pioneers, in a time of high prices, are expected to live on 15s. a week. The honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> read the letter of a town clerk in one of the coal-mining districts to the effect that, owing to the revaluations that have taken place, the pensions in some cases have been reduced by 7s. a week. I do not wonder at some public authorities taking action when the Prime Minister states that tq increase old-age pensions would lead us into a " financial morass." What would the additional expenditure of £1,500,000 mean to a wonderfully wealthy community like this, especially when we are spending so much money in directions that do not mean nearly so good a return ? </para>

                            <para>- That is so; and we must remember that this money paid in pensions will remain in the community. Many of these old pensioners have now to live on " bread and scrape," with, perhaps, , tea with no milk, and very little sugar. They are imperfectly clothed, and compelled to live in houses that can fairly be classed as hovels, and a few shillings a week would mean much to them. Surely of all who need nourishing food, we must have regard to those in their declining years. "We have a revenue of £60,000,000. It is true that the Treasurer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce,</inline> forecasts an insignificant deficit of about £200,000; but, owing to the Pacific arrangement, great savings can be made, and those savings might well be devoted to relieving the distress of our old people. I am astonished to hear such a stubborn, hard-hearted statement from the Prime Minister as that to which I have referred. The right honorable gentleman leads and holds the Government in the palm of his hand, and yet he declares that to grant this little extra money will mean leading us into a financial morass. Shame that such a sentence should be given utterance in the Parliament of a country like this! </para>

                    <para>As to the Washington Conference anybody would think from the speech of the Prime Minister that everything done there was due to himself ; but had it not been for the agitation on this side of the House, and on the part of both press and public, it is doubtful whether the Government would have Bent a representative, Almost "from the jump" the Prime Minister tried to " throw cold water " on the project; and when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> was on his way to Washington, the right honorable gentleman spoke of the Conference in quite a contemptuous tone, saying, " The Washington . Conference for what it is worth." But I should say that the Washington Conference has been fruitful of far greater results than the Prime Minister ever expected. I think that our protests in the earlier stages of the discussion on the representation of Australia at the Conference were well justified. No member of the Parliament was more of a militarist, or more under military control, than was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> and we were opposed to the appointment of such a delegate. Our desire was that Australia Should be re presented by. a man whose very soul was charged with a desire for the peace of the world, and who would do all within his power to bring about the disarmament of the nations. For the most part <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pea</inline> rce's actions, up to that time, showed that his sympathies were in the opposite direction; but, ardent militarist that he was, the discussions which took place in this House had a very salutary effect upon his attitude at the Conference. </para>

Whatever may have been the advice ho received from Australia's representative his strong personality, his fine eloquence, and his general attributes, to my mind, had a marked influence on the decisions of the Conference. I have no desire to detract in any way from the merits of the other members of the Delegation; but in my opinion he did more than any one else, not excluding  President  Harding or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> the United States of America representatives, to bring about the results that we applaud to-day. </para>

                    <para>The stand taken by the Leader of the Labour party is undoubtedly a proper one. I well remember the speeches made by him in  regard to our representation at the Washington Conference. They made a great impression upon me, and I have a very clear recollection of the earnest way in which he insisted that Australia should bc represented. But because the- Labour party desired that all political parties in Australia should be represented at the Conference, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> has had the effrontery to criticise the amendment to that effect which was moved by our leader when the question was before the House. Had the amendment been carried, our representation would have been extended, and I think that Australian interests would have been safer in the hands of three delegates than they were when only one was appointed to look after them. I agree with the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fowler)</inline> that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> probably did not have much influence on the decisions of the Conference, but our object in urging that all political parties in Australia should be represented,, was to insure that the Commonwealth should speak with a united voice. </para>

If they were, the secret diplomacy ana trickery now indulged in by some nations would be abolished. That is what we have in view. Without desiring in any way to be boastful, I think we may take credit as a party for the part we played in insisting upon the representation of Australia at the Washington Conference. As a result of that Conference, I am hopeful that we shall have peace for a number of years, and that much of the money we 'have hitherto been spending on the Army and Navy will now be avail- </para>

I am glad that the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> is present, since I propose to take exception to the course he pursued as a member of the Committee appointed by this Parliament to inquire into the proposed wireless agreement. Honorable members on this side of the House, when the agreement was before us, urged that whatever the report of the Committee might be, no. agreement as between the Commonwealth Government and the Wireless Company should be entered into until it had been sanctioned by the Parliament itself. I admit that by the terms of the resolution agreed to, this House, to a large extent, removed from the shoulders of the Prime Minister the responsibility for entering into the agreement since it was provided that if the Committee, after inquiry, reported that the Government should expend £500,000 in the purchase of shares in the company, the contract should be signed by the Government and the scheme proceeded with. I compliment the Committee on having changed to a very considerable extent the face of the proposed agreement. The fact that it did so is a sufficient -justification for the stand that we took. The Committee considerably improved on the agreement as originally put before, us, but I agree with the minority report presented by the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan),</inline> in which he states that the lost word has not yet been said regarding wireless, and I am at a loss to account for the haste that was shown by the Government in connexion with the matter. I think that the honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> on taking office as Treasurer should have retired from the Committee and have allowed another honorable member to take his place, seeing that as Treasurer he would have to authorize the proposed expenditure. </para>

                            <para>- I am not casting any aspersions on the honorable gentleman, but I think he should have resigned from the Committee on taking office. I protest against the Government entering into any agreement involving the expenditure of £500,000 before the sanction of Parliament has been obtained. Notwithstanding the autherity given by resolution of this House to the Wireless Committee, I do not think the agreement should have been entered into until it had received parliamentary approval. I have been glancing oyer the list of shareholders in the company, and find that, with the exception of the promoters of the company, the shares are held for the most part by big concerns. The Marconi International Wireless Company, for instance, holds 16,000 shares, and the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company 33,000 shares. The shipping companies in and around Australia are also among the large shareholders. There are Huddart Parker Limited, with 14,700 shares; the Adelaide Steamship Company; the companies that trade between the mainland and Tasmania; Burns, Philp, &amp; Co. ; the Holyman Line ; McIlwraith, McEacharn, &amp; Company; and the Melbourne Steamship Coy. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fiske,</inline> in Sydney, holds 11,000 shares - we might naturally expect that. The Marconi companies in London - they are supposed to be two different companies, but they are really only one - hold between them nearly 50,000 shares. Their voting strength and their power in this concern will be very great. Although some of the terms of the agreement have been altered, I understand that, in spite of protests, the wireless people still have a majority of representatives on the directorate. If that is so, they will control the company. It is all very well for the Government to say that they hold 500,001 shares, and that they can dominate the rest of the shareholders by one vote. I would be quite content to give away that one extra vote to the general shareholders if I could have a majority on the directorate. The majority on the directorate is made up of those who are in the wireless business. The Government are in a minority, and yet are subscribing more than the private persons who are in a majority on the directorate. An agreement of that kind is not right. I indorse the views of the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan),</inline> and I would like the present Postmaster-General and his predecessor in that office to tell the candid truth about wireless. If they were to do so, I think that this House would be very considerably enlightened. The directors may order that more capital be called up, and, in that event, the Commonwealth Government would be made liable for the payment of further big sums of money. </para>

                            <para>- The agreement. These private organizations can always beat the Government; we may depend upon that. It is the directorate, and not the shareholders, that decide the policy of the company. They act, theoretically, of course, with the consent of the shareholders, but for the most part the general management of the concern is in private hands. That is a very undesirable position. </para>

He would say, " Give me a majority of the directors, and I can do what I like with the company." Is it not a mistake, seeing that we are paying more than the private individuals, not to have a majority on the directorate ? Provision to that effect ought to be made in the agreement, but, unfortunately, it is not made. </para>

                            <para>-Yes, we do; and I understand that the Government have a man on the other side of the world as their adviser in connexion with certain concerns who is the head of one of the biggest monopolies in the world. I refer to Lord Inchcape, who would, if he could, sink every Commonwealth ship that we own. I do not say that he is a desperate man ; but he would like to see those ships swept off the ocean. He made an offer last session to buy out the Commonwealth Government Line; and yet he is the trusted Commonwealth adviser in regard to other concerns. By-and-by this Government will find themselves not only in a minority on the directorate, but they probably will be mulct in expenses which the taxpayers of this country will have to meet. The directors will decide what the expenditure shall be. </para>

                            <para>- That is not in the agreement. The agreement gives a majority on the Board of Directors to private concerns. I do not know whether honorable' members have read <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brennan</inline> 's report on the Wireless Agreement. He said there was not a tittle of evidence to show that wireless communication between Great Britain and Australia could be successful as a commercial proposition, and that for such great distances it had not been proved to be practicable. Sending wireless messages over short distances and over long distances axe two quite different propositions. When the Government proposes sending wireless messages 12,000 miles through various atmospheres, and different weathers they are not likely to meet with the success they anticipate. Not one expert who was brought before the Committee was prepared to say- that such long distance messages could be successfully transmitted, yet in the face of that the Committee recommends the Government to spend over £500,000 on the venture, and to be content with a minority of representatives on the directorate. The Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> says we are going to get out of the Woollen Mills. Next to that, I suppose we shall abandon the -Clothing Factory, and then the Saddlery Factory, and, as a last resort, we shall run to the three-ball men to see if they will buy the Commonwealth Bank. The Government are already doing that in some directions. In Nauru, and under the agreement with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, we are spending large sums of money, with what result we do not know. It is others who are having the final say. We are spending £500,000 in the wireless business, and there is no emphatic evidence that wireless between Australia and Great Britain is going to be a success. None of the experts in Australia - not even the most enthusiastic - would venture the opinion that it is going to be a commercial success. </para>

No doubt, definite proposals will be submitted to Parliament for the unification of the gauges, but I warn the Government that there is a combination of the great engineering firms of the world which must be remembered when the work is undertaken, so that any attempt to jamb us into a position in which we shall have to pay through the nose may be prevented. The matter, however, is one which can be fully discussed at another time, and I hope then to have some figures to put before honorable members, which will show the need for pausing before entering into engineering contracts. </para>
                    <para>As to the proposed amendment of the Constitution, I would remind honorable members that we have heard of Constitutional amendments almost ever since the establishment of this Parliament. With all respect to those in the new State movement, and with all respect to the State Righters, I question whether a more national proposal for the amendment of the Constitution has been put 'forward than that of the Labour party. I am a thorough believer in local government, and I think, too, that we should have neither waste nor wasters in the community if it can be ' prevented. But I say to those who talk economy, that we shall never have real economy until our present Constitutions - Commonwealth and State - have been thrown into the melting pot and new Constitutions - national, and local, or national and State - have been  moulded more in harmony with the opinions of the people, and more in keeping with the numbers of our population. Many of us would not have voted for Federation had we thought that the expensive State Parliaments would have continued. </para>

Many of the powers of the State Parliaments might well be handed over to the Commonwealth Parliament, and we might well have a better system of local government; substituting provincial Parliaments for the present State Parliaments, and having more of the former, so that decentralization may bo of more real effect. </para>

I do not anticipate that he will be too liberal in his proposals for lessening the taxation of the community; but I have long been of the opinion that it would be fair to exempt from income taxation, remembering how much it costs these days to maintain a family, persons who do not receive more than £400 or £500 a year in wages or salary. Should the Treasurer propose to exempt such incomes from taxation, he would, I am sure, be heartily supported by every member on this side of the House. </para>

We are not bound to accept the views of Ministers that the .old-age pensions cannot be increased, or the incidence of the income taxation modified. If we have the numbers, as I believe we have, we should see that what is just to the community is done, and that both the old-age pensioners and the smaller taxpayers are reasonably treated. </para>

I am sorry,, too, that certain proceedings in this Chamber this afternoon were so unedifying. The provisions of this House should require that matters for debate should deal with the important questions of public interest which demand attention. Private grievances ought not to be aired in this Chamber. Those who have complaints to make which are merely personal should have the courage to drop the cloak of parliamentary  privilege, and make their statements outside, accepting the ordinary liability of private citizens. </para>

                            <para>- I may be here long after the honorable member has' ceased to hold a seat in this Parliament. Youth is not to be imputed to any man as a crime, and I trust that in the end my record will compare more than favorably with that of the honorable  member. I wish to impress upon the Government that old-age and invalid pensioners are going through hard and difficult experience because the pensions granted them are inadequate, and because of restrictions and limitations placed upon those who may make application for this form of assistance. I have received from the officials of the Pensions Department every possible courtesy and consideration. Within the provisions of the Act they are administering they have done all that might reasonably be expected of them to assist aged and invalid people. They cannot be blamed for any neglect of their duty under the Act, but there are certain provisions of the law, or features of its administration, which require amendment. Only recently I have had several cases added to my already lengthy list of adult invalids who are deprived of their pensions because they are living with their parents and the father of the household is in receipt of an income in excess of an average of £1 per week for the members of the family. The incapacitated in these cases are embarrassed by the fact that they are made to feel solely dependent upon those who can ill afford to render them the assistance they require. Another result of the practice adopted in these cases is to add to the difficulties of the parents who are unable to set aside to provide for their future that money which is required to maintain an invalid member of the family. If an invalid leaves the home of parents and lives elsewhere, such person can claim a pension, but under the practice of which I complain a penalty is imposed upon invalids who wish to retain the care and comfort of their own home circle. </para>

                    <para>Another matter I should like to bring under the notice of the Government, and one  which  should have been rectified long ago, is that while aged and feeble persons, living in their own homes, receive a full pension,  because of enfeeblement they leave their homes to live with a son or daughter or other relative, the rent which is received for the home is deducted from the pension. If they continue to live in their own homes these people suffer no reduction of pension. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so. The Labour party has endeavoured to liberalize the Old-age and Invalid Pensions Act in every possible way. If the present law is more liberal than the original measure, that is largely due to the action of the Labour party. Under the existing system, aged persons leaving, home to live with a relative or friend are deprived of any advantage from or reward for the thrift and sacrifice they have made to secure a home. It is only by constant sacrifice of comfort and pleasure that working people can secure a home, and in their declining years, surely they are entitled to enjoy the advantages which should follow from the assets they have been able to accumulate by their worthy efforts in earlier life. Although the Government set their face against such action now, I trust they will, at an early date, review the present position and liberalize considerably the administration of old-age and invalid pensions. "Whilst the amendment is especially directed to the action of the Government in connexion with old-age and invalid pensions, I may be permitted to direct attention to serious anomalies in the administration of other pensions, and particularly pensions received by returned soldiers and the dependants of deceased soldiers. On the merest technicalities and on the decisions of unsympathetic medical boards, many returned soldiers and dependants of deceased soldiers are not receiving what is their due, in spite of the promises made by the Government and their supporters to those who rendered service overseas. Two-thirds of my time as a public man is taken up in the endeavour to secure justice for those who are deprived of pensions rightly their due, and to secure from the Repatriation Department the consideration which returned soldiers have a right to claim from it. Whether this is due to secret instructions from the Minister that pensions must be reduced as much as possible I do not know, but many of the cases brought under my notice demonstrate the fact that sympathetic and just consideration is not given ' to the claims for pensions by those who were invalided home, or by dependants of deceased soldiers. One case brought under my notice was that of a returned soldier who had a wife and three children. He died .on the 4th January of this year. Although his death took place some considerable time after his discharge, there is, I contend, evidence to connect his illness and ultimate death with his war service.' At the time of his death the eldest child was three and a half years of age and the youngest four weeks old. The family was left in absolutely destitute circumstances, but an application by the widow of the deceased soldier for an increased pension, which is rightly her due, has not received from the Repatriation Department the. consideration which it merited. I have a case at present before the Department which I hope will receive favorable  consideration. It is that of a widow and child of a returned soldier who served approximately three years' active service,  and whose discharge was not due to misconduct, but who, it is alleged, was responsible for some misdemeanour against discipline. This woman has not been able up to the present moment to secure a pension. She has to care for a child nine months' old, and finds it very difficult to earn her own livelihood. She has no relatives in Australia.  Her  mother and sisters reside in England, and I feel that one so circumstanced should be dealt with in a sympathetic manner. </para>

Se recognises, as his supporters do, that the indifference of the Government to the aged and infirm cannot be justified, 'and when we find that honorable members on the Ministerial side, even honorable members of the Country party, are willing to allow this debate to be continued solely by honorable members of the Opposition, and that they are not prepared to justify the attitude taken up by the Government, or offer protest against their unsympathetic attitude, it is self-evident that their conscience has stricken them. They cannot justify the attitude of the Government. When they meet their masters on the next occasion they will have great difficulty in reconciling their indifference on this occasion. </para>

                            <para>- That is a charge which cannot be laid against the Labour party. In season and out of season we have advocated the cause of the aged and infirm. From the commencement of this Parliament we have put forward our requests on behalf of these people, who are so deserving of our consideration. It is not an eleventh-hour advocacy. The honorable member may have it' in his mind that the amendment is a sinister step designed for a certain purpose: That thought will not relieve him from his rightful duty to express himself either for or against an amendment whose purpose is to insure for the aged and infirm a greater measure of relief from the difficulties with which they have to contend for so long. The suggestion of motives comes with very bad grace from the honorable member, because the Labour party has always endeavoured to relieve the difficulties of the people, and make their portion in life more comfortable and congenial. </para>

Since I have been in public life I have always sought to assist those who are subjected to difficulties at the eventide of their life or who are suffering from physical disabilities. My efforts in that direction are sufficient recommendation as to my sincerity. I have always done my part in this House to champion the claims of these people. The charge of insincerity comes with ill grace from the honorable member. I lay my record beside his and ask the people of this country to judge as to which of us is prompted by the greater measure of sympathy for the aged and infirm. </para>

                    <para>The reply delivered by the Prime Minister this afternoon cannot be regarded as satisfactory. Instead of dealing with the subject that should have been the main theme of this debate, he made excursions iri all directions, and very seldom approached the real purpose of the amendment. He carefully evaded any endeavour to justify the Government's lack of consideration for the invalid and old-age pensioners. It seems to me that these people can only expect to receive better consideration when the party now in opposition occupies the Government. benches. I trust that the date is not far distant when we shall be able to show, in some practical form, our absolute sympathy for them, by giving them increased pensions, commensurate with the increased cost of living, by liberalizing the qualifications for the pensions, and by obviating many of the anomalies and unfair aud unjust restrictions now imposed upon the pioneers, who at all times have proved themselves to be faithful and honorable citizens of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>.- It gives me much pleasure that the first words I utter and the first vote I give in the new session shall be in the interests of the old people of the Commonwealth. But I cannot say that my feelings have been those of pleasure as I have listened to the debate as it has proceeded. What has most struck me is the fact that although the amendment moved by my Leader <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> reads - </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>We regret that your advisers have made no provision to liberalize the old-age and invalid pensions. </para>
                    <para class="block">I cannot find in the speech of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> as reported in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> more than a reference of about three minutes' duration, in a speech, lasting over an hour,'- to pensions, the only subject-matter of the amendment. It was painful to me to realize that with an amendment before the House, submitted in the interests of the old people of this country, the Leader of the Government should spend the whole of his time in talking about Labour conferences and every other subject but the one properly under consideration. I can well understand the feelings of any old-age pensioner in reading this debate. He will imagine that honorable members pay regard only to their own interests, and give very scant consideration to those of old-age pensioners. </para>
                    <para>I do not propose to follow the Prime Minister's example, and wander from Dan to Beersheeba. I shall confine my remarks to the question of pensions. I wonder how honorable members opposite propose to vote. If they vote against the amendment the effect of their action, camouflage it as they may, will be to say that they do not regret that the Government have made no provision to liberalize the old-age and invalid pensions. If they do regret the lack of consideration for the pensioners of the Commonwealth, they should vote for the amendment. I would rather think of them as voting contrary to their feelings. I would rather not have it said that men, comfortably situated as honorable members on the Government side are, really feel that there is np need to give increased pensions to the very deserving folk whom we call old-age pensioners. As the honorable member foi Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Makin)</inline> has just pointed out, the liberalizing of the pensions, might be brought about in various, ways. He has mentioned the invalid pension, and I would like to speak upon;- the same subject. Unless the. father '^jiih an invalid dependant is prepared to- plead poverty or be heartless and -.'jack his dependant out into the . "street, there is difficulty in obtaining a pension for the child, if the earnings of the father average fi per week for each adult member of the family. Another way to liberalize old-age pensions would be to permit greater earnings. A pensioner is allowed to-day to earn an average of 10s. a week and still receive the full pension. That rule has been in operation for a considerable time, and it was introduced when the cost of living was considerably lower than it is at present. If we only permitted increased earning sufficient to keep pace with the greater cost of living it would be a liberal act.. The Prime Minister has twitted the Labour party with having said on the hustings' that we would increase the old-age pension to the extent of 5s. a week. This, he said, according to an estimate of the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> would represent an increased expenditure of over £17,000,000. </para>

                            <para>- The Prime Minister was dealing with a manifesto issued by the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> before the last election. The honorable member dragged in widows' pensions, children's pensions, and many other things; and I have no doubt that in preparing an election manifesto he stretched the matter as far as he could. The object of the Prime Minister, in quoting the honorable member's statement in connexion with the amendment before the House, was to give the impression that an extra 5s. a week to the old-age pensioners would involve the country in an additional outlay of £17,500,000. .To make such an insinuation is wicked in itself, but it is particularly reprehensible considering the worthy object which members on this side have in view. </para>

                    <para>Referring to the inmates of charitable institutions, I understand that the Commonwealth Government pay to the State Governments the sum of 10s. 6d. for each pensioner, and that only 2s. per week is received by the pensioner himself, making a total of 12s. 6d., as against the 15s. paid to pensioners outside these homes. It seems to me that there might be a little more liberal treatment in that respect. I ask honorable members, some of whom spend 3s. a day on cigars, how they would like to manage on 2s. a week for. such luxuries as books, beer, and tobacco. </para>

                            <para>- According to information supplied' to me by responsible officers, that is not the position. If the State authorities can carry on the charitable homes with the payment of the 10s. 6d., surely the pensioners are entitled to the difference of 4s. 6d. per week between that amount and the ,15s. paid to pensioners outside these institutions. Simply because old folks are living in these homes it does not mean that they are not deserving citizens. There is a tendency to think that if people have not succeeded in life there is some blame to be laid at their doors. Many of the . inmates of these institutions have played their part in blazing the trail in this young country. Those who have not yet received the pension cannot obtain it if they remain in an institution. There is no need for differentiation between a person who happened to be inside such an institution and one who was outside when the pension system was, inaugurated. A curious anomaly is that there may be one old-age pensioner receiving nothing apart from- his keep, while another gets the allowance of 2s. a week. This is bound to cause a certain amount of dissatisfaction. </para>

                    <para>Some people have an idea that there should not be old-age pensions at all. Constituents of mine have indicated to me that they have no sympathy for the pensioners because they have " had their fling," and wasted their money in earlier days in intoxicating liquor. </para>

                            <para>-  Perhaps the honorable member for Denison has been in Parliament so' long that he has become accustomed to " ringing in " tales. I hope I shall not develop that habit. If the honorable member looks at <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> as I have, for the years 1906 to 1908, he will find that some honorable members belonging to the party he now supports plainly showed then by voice and vote that they were opposed .to the granting of the pension. A member of my party recently told me that it cost him ls. 6d. a day for tobacco. I, on' the other hand, do not smoke. Suppose it became necessary for that honorable member to receive an old-age pension, whereas I happened to be more fortunate, on that one item alone my comrade would have paid through the Customs a considerable sum to the revenue, and he would be only getting back some of the money he had himself contributed. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know which party was in power when the increase was granted, but I am sure that any move in that direction had the full concurrence of the Labour party. I should not be at all surprised if it was the pressure of that party that helped to produce that happy result. I remember that it was the' pressure brought to bear upon the Deakin Ministry by the Labour party that brought Federal old-age pensions into being. Nor shall I be surprised if pressure from the same source has the effect of securing a further increase. It is those who smoke and drink, and insist on having the luxuries of life, who make other people rich, thus helping to obtain incomes from which the income tax revenue is further increased. It is commonly said that men should make provision for their old age. I was speaking to a man in a lift - yesterday, and he told me that he paid 35s. a week in rent. He had a wife and four children to maintain, and he earned £4 a week. How can that man be expected to make provision for a rainy day? There are hundreds even less favorably situated, and it is useless to say that such people should provide against old age. </para>

                    <para>I notice that one of the Melbourne newspapers has referred to this amendment as a sham. The honorable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Austin Chapman)</inline> has spoken of it as camouflage; and the honorable member for Denison <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Laird Smith)</inline> has said, in effect, that it is merely political ammunition. It is altogether wrong for honorable members to profess to believe that no man can be sincere. I remember that about three weeks after I first entered this House, and when I was apparently taking matters rather seriously, the honorable member for Bourke' <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anstey)</inline> stopped me in the corridor and said, " Get out of your mind at once any idea that you will ever make anybody in this House believe that you are sincere." I thought the statement awful, and it worried me for a long time ; but after two and a half years' experience I am beginning to think that what the honorable member said was somewhere near the truth. Why should I not be sincere in urging an increase of the old-age and invalid pensions? I belong to the class to which most of the pensioners belong, and if the pension is increased it will be at the expense of the classes which honorable members opposite represent. </para>

The honorable member belongs to a party that represents these people in the community who do not need ; I belong to a party that represents the do-needs, and the increased pension must be taken from the pockets of those who do not need to the same extent. I can be true to my class, true to myself, and true to my country in asking the Government to treat better those old people who deserve all that we can give them. </para>

No honorable member will tell, me that men or women can feed, clothe, and house themselves on a pension of 15s. per week. Why, then, will honorable members not vote for the amendment ? They do not mean by their opposition to it that they do not regret that the Government cannot increase the old-age pension, and why do they not say that they do regret it ? </para>

                            <para>- Honorable members opposite do regret that old-age pensions, are not being increased, but because the amendment emanates from this side of the House, and because its adoption would place the Government in a difficult position, they think more of the needs of the Government and their party than they do of the aged people of this country. To accuse of insincerity a member who rises to fight the case of the old people is  wrong. I love the old people better than I do the young, because I find that the old people are always more sensible. When I was twenty-one years of age, I thought I knew everything; but as I advanced along the path of life I realized that I knew less and less. Now, -having reached the age of forty years, I know that those who have ascended higher up the hill can look back over my head, and have a wider vision. I like to be with the . old people, and when I have that feeling and come here to battle for them, it is not right that doubts should be cast upon my <inline font-style="italic">bona fides.</inline> No matter' how honorable members opposite may vote, I will not believe that in their innermost hearts they do not regret that an increased allowance is not to bo given to the old-age pensioners. I shall do them the credit of believing that in voting against the amendment they will vote against their own feelings, for I am confident that if party politics were not involved, and honorable members could be free to consider this matter on its merits, the bulk .of them would vote for an increase of the old-age and invalid pensions. </para>

                        <para>.- I can heartily agree with the last  speaker  that it seems a tragedy that to-day our highest national interests and our most humane feelings should be exploited for political purposes. We have seen, during the last few years, the sacrifices and wounds of our soldiers practically publicly auctioned by political leaders, and every week for the last two or three months the biggest national industries of Australia being  used as political pawns by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes).</inline> To-night we are hearing the hardships of the aged poor being exploited for electioneering purposes. The party which I have the honour to lead sympathizes deeply with the old-age pensioners; we recognise how difficult is their position by reason of various regulations, which we desire to see altered. But we would like to pay a tribute to the efficient way in which the officers of the Old-age and Invalid Pensions Department handle their work. There .must be many anomalies in connexion with the pensions, and we admit that during the last three or four years the old-age pensioners have suffered considerably by the increased cost of living. But one of the primary causes of the increased cost of living is the excessive taxation being imposed by both Federal and State; Governments, which withdraws so much money from commercial and reproductive undertakings and is absorbed- in huge Government expenditure. We believe that a substantial reduction in Federal Government expenditure and a cessation of extravagant administration would- be more helpful than any other single factor in reducing the cost of living,  but especially in view of the disappointing and unsatisfactory statement of the national financial position made by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> yesterday, we are opposed to any further increase in the current national expenditure at the present time. </para>

                        <para>. - I am heartily in accord with the proposal to increase the old-age and invalid pensions, and to liberalize the conditions governing them. I know exactly how badly this amendment is needed, and I cannot understand the attitude of honorable members opposite, who are taking no part in the discussion, but are questioning the motives of honorable members on this side. It is beyond my understanding how the Leader of the Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Pago)</inline> could rise in his place and say, in effect, that not now, but some years hence we may consider the granting of this needed reform. In the meantime the old people are starving. Not one word of protest does the Leader of the Country party offer to the proposal of the Government . to pay enormous sums in compensation to the " brass hats " who are being retired from the Defence Department. Generals and others who have been drawing as much as £1,500 per annum for many years are being retrenched, but there is no proposal to pay them 15s. per week. The Government, who cannot find sufficient money te insure that the old people may live in decency and comfort in their declining days, already propose to give large sums  in compensation to men who for twenty years and longer have been drawing as much as £1,500 per annum, plus from £50 to £100 for motor cars, plus 25s. a day for travelling allowance and £80 per annum as a command allowance'. </para>

                            <para>- The Commandant of the Military College receives £1,200 per annum, and he is being retired. A major-general receives £950; a brigadier general, £850; a colonel, £800, a lieutenant-colonel, £750; a major, £650; a captain, £625; and a lieutenant, £400. The non-commissioned warrant officer, who may have been a colonel during the war, but did not belong to the military caste, and, accordingly, had to return to the ranks <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> his return to Australia, is to receive about £155 compensation for the loss of his employment. Yet the Government can pay enormous sums to " brass hats," many of. whom did not serve in the war, and who, in addition to their salaries have drawn travelling allowances varying from 14s. to 25s. per day, and for a staff command from £40 to £100 per annum. The Government coolly proposes that these heavy compensations be paid, and yet the Prime Minister ridicules a proposal that the old-age pensioners should have their allowances liberalized in any .way whatever. The honorable member for Denison <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Laird Smith)</inline> questions whether we, on this side, have any conscience when we put forward such a .proposition. He should be the last man in this House to talk about conscience. </para>

                            <para>- A man who was booted out of the Ministry, and yet sits behind the Government without a word of protest, 'talks about conscience! Long before the honorable member was thought of I was  fighting the  case for the old-age pensioners in the Victorian State Parliament. A former Leader of the Liberal party, the present Chief Justice of Victoria, said that the old-age pensioners were the recipients of charity. Before the pensions were introduced sons who, perhaps, were married and had children, were fined and sent to gaol because they could not contribute 10s. per week towards the support of their parents. That was the method which the so-called Liberal party preferred to the system of old-age pensions. It was by fights such as we are putting up to-night that the scheme of old-age and invalid pensions was initiated, and before the pension was increased to 12s. 6d. the Labour party had to adopt similar tactics, and ultimately public opinion forced the Government to grant our very reasonable requests. In my own constituency I have, unfortunately, to come into contact with cases of poor old women who have to pay 8s. a week for a room, and they aro required to provide the necessities of life upon the remaining 7s. per week. How, in the name of God, can they be expected to do so in these times? I have quite a number of these pathetic old people who come to me every second Monday morning, and I hand them over 2s. 6d. with which to maintain body and soul during the few days following while they are awaiting payment of their pensions. The payment of a decent pension ought not to be a question of increased taxation. The Leader of the Country party, the honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page),</inline> should bo ashamed of raising such an issue in debating the question of providing more money for old-age and invalid pensioners. </para>

                    <para>Respecting the payment of pensions generally, there are other phases which are altogether unsatisfactory. I may cite as an example the case of war-broken men who cannot be said to be totally incapacitated, and aTe not given pensions in keeping with such a condition, but who, nevertheless,, are utterly unable to earn a living. The Government make no provision for a man who has had his two legs broken ; he may starve for all they will do for him. No doctor will certify that a man who has had both his legs broken is permanently incapacitated; yet I know of such unfortunates who are absolutely dependent on private charity. "We are bringing tens of' thousands of immigrants into this country. Labour proposes that some of the money which is being spent in that direction should be, and could be infinitely more worthily, devoted to the welfare of our very best type of new citizen, namely, the childhood of Australia. Honorable members need scarcely be reminded of the hard case of poor widows with families throughout the land. The breadwinner has been taken, and the responsibilities of the mother have become doubled.  Her  only hope in maintaining her children and providing the bare necessities of life is to scrub and wash for other people, while her kiddies run about the streets. Surely something should be done in the direction of providing pensions for widows! It ought to be one of the first' duties of Labour, when the party to which I belong occupies the Treasury benches, to make provision for this struggling class in the community. I have already mentioned that the cost of providing, adequate pensions should be the last phase to be taken into consideration. Even if it required a million and a half of money, that money ought to be found. When money was wanted to provide munitions with which to kill people, was there any trouble in finding tens of millions? Now, however,, when money is needed in order to do the right thing by our old-age and invalid pensioners, ana to help others who should be in receipt of pensions, the question of cost is permitted to stand in the way. </para>

                        <para>.- The amendment of the Leader of the Opposition, the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton),</inline> is very simple. It is very easily remembered, and is 83 easily understood. It consists of an expression of regret that the Advisers of  His Excellency  have not seen fit to make provision for the liberalization of old-age and invalid pensions. Honorable members of the Opposition say they ' cannot understand how any honorable member will be able to refrain from joining in this expression of regret. I state witheut fear of contradiction, that the amendment, so eminently simple, was framed after most careful consideration and consultation between the Leader of the Opposition and his followers ; and I have no hesitation in saying, further, that its objects was not merely to promote the interests of old-age and invalid pensioners. I cannot understand the attitude and statements of some honorable members opposite - those, for example, of the honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Makin}, whom I respect as a sincere and straightforward man. I cannot understand his suggestion that the amendment has for its sole purpose the advancement of the interests of pensioners. Its object is perfectly clear. It is framed most astutely. It was drafted for the purpose of putting honorable members on this side in a difficult and delicate position. I challenge the Leader of the Opposition to deny that he thought to place such honorable members as myself, for instance, in a quandary; that he did not say to himself, " The honorable member for Fawkner says he is in favour of increasing old-age and invalid pensions. If I bring forward this amendment in such a way as that he must choose between voting against the Government  and against the amendment I will, undoubtedly, place him in a difficult position. For if he votes for the Government, and against the amendment, the public will say that he is not in favour of increasing pensions." My friends know that that is. not my position. I repeat that I am as much in favour of increasing pensions as any other honorable member. I have occupied a consistent position with respect to this subject ever since I came here. When the question of granting a pension to the late Federal Chief Justice (Sir Samuel Griffith)</inline> was introduced in. this Chamber I opposed the motion on the ground that I would be no party to giving a pension in such a case  until adequate provision had been made for people less favorably situated. I said we should consider the whole question of pensions, with a view to placing those who have been unfortunate in their circumstances in the best position possible. </para>

                    <para>With regard to the sincerity of the amendment, I would like to point out that it was moved when the Leader of the Opposition was attacking the Government. The honorable member for Hunter had been discussing the question of the Washington Conference, the subject of immigration, of the sugar agreement, and of wireless telegraphy ; and it was only at the tail-end of his speech that the honorable member said a few words about the  circumstances of old-age and invalid pensioners, and then he wound up with his simple amendment - an expression of regret, so simple in itself; but so well calculated to damage the Government. If by any chance he could get those in favour of increasing  pensions to vote for the amendment there would follow the downfall of the Government; the Leader of the Opposition knew that. </para>

No honorable member would suggest that, if the sole object were to secure an increase of pensions, the best method would be to bring the matter forward after the manner adopted by the Leader of the Opposition.

                            <para>- It may be said that the motion of the honorable member for Eden-Monaro is insincere, but that charge cannot be more truly made against that honorable member than against the Leader of the Opposition. I cannot vote for the amendment, because to do so would amount to a reflection on the Government. The Government have accepted it as a motion of want of confidence. I have to choose between voting against the amendment - which, if it were carried, would confer no advantage upon pensioners - and assisting to bring about the downfall of the Government, and I simply cannot do that. </para>

                    <para>There are many things which I regret m regard to the Governor-General's speech. I regret, for instance, that provision has not been made for the reduction of parliamentary allowances. One reason given why our old people and in-  valid pensioners are not getting more is that the country cannot afford to pay more. In this Chamber to-day there are those who have deliberately raised their own salaries by £400 a year. I ask honorable members, " Are you ready to stand up and announce your willingness to make some sacrifice in respect of your augmented salaries in order that pensioners may receive a little morel" I, personally, am willing to make some sacrifice. </para>

But all members opposite cannot say that. I understand that the Leader of the Opposition is now in the chamber, and in his presence I repeat that, in ray opinion, the amendment was drafted with the deliberate object of damaging the Government, and framed in such a way as to make it most difficult for some honorable members on this side of the House who are in sympathy with the' idea of increasing the old-age and invalid pensions to vote against it. </para>

                        <para>.- This belated discovery from the Government side of the House, that an amendment moved from this side is not launched for the purpose of throwing bouquets at the Government, is rather refreshing. One would think that the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Maxwell)</inline> had just arrived, judging by the innocence he has displayed and his disclosure of this nefarious plot against the Government. No one else on that side of the House seems to have discovered the fell design. It does not seem to have crossed the mind of the honorable member that members on this side should be trying to improve the conditions under which our old-age and invalid pensioners are living, irrespective of whether any such action may jeopardize the position of the Ministry. </para>

                            <para>- If the amendment threatens the position of the Ministry, there is a simple way out of the difficulty - the Government can accept it. The honorable member for Fawkner himself, a few minutes ago, emphasized a glaring discrepancy in the attitude of the Government, of which he is a supporter, when dealing with pensions for one social class in the community, and their attitude towards pensioners who belong to the great bulk of the people whom we, on this side of the House, claim to represent. The honorable member himself is suffering from an unfortunate affliction, and he, of all members, should be sympathetically inclined towards those who are suffering similarly, and who are not in his favoured position and not able to make any sacrifice in the amount that may be coming to. them. Were he. to belong to the working class at the present time, and to be suffering from the same disability, how would ho like to try to make ends meet upon the amount they receive. </para>

                            <para>- At all events', the honorable member is not in a very good position in trying to defend his present attitude, and deciding whether loyalty to his party should override his natural inclination to do what is right towards our old-age and invalid pensioners. Honorable members know quito well where I stand on this question. I  Bay  that the old-age pension scheme as at present administered is pauperizing and degrading, and that' if the working class of this country had spirit and determination they would throw its benefits back at the Government as an insult to them. </para>

                            <para>- I suggest that they are too  long-suffering  and too tolerant towards the honorable member and his ilk. Every worker, when he reaches the age at which he should retire from active work, instead of receiving a miserable pittance of 15s. per week, should bc in a position to demand, as ' a right, an amount equal to the average wages received during his years of activity. At present, as the honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Makin)</inline> has pointed out, an applicant for an old-age pension must bc practically disowned and pauperized by his relatives before he may receive a pension. Then, again, the objection is raised that it is difficult to find the money for any increase in the amount paid. "Where does the money come from for 'those festivities that attend the reception of distinguished visitors from other countries? When it is a question of wining and dining the representatives of the social classes to which honorable mem-, bora opposite belong, any amount of money can be made available; but when it is a question of finding money for a decent existence for Australian men and women whose years of activity have passed, money cannot be obtained. I complain, also, of the manner in- which the Act is administered. At one time it was customary to include all those who received relief under the Miners Accident Belief Act  of New South Wales. In other words, they were entitled to full benefits under our old-age and invalid pensions scheme. Section 4 of the Act provides - " Income " means any moneys, valuable consideration or profits, earned, derived or received by any person for his own use or benefit by any means from any source whatever, whether in or out of the Commonwealth, and shall be deemed to include personal earnings but not any payment - </para>

                            <para>- I represent my own party at present, but I must say that I could do with considerable additions to it, for then the work of the party would be much easier. However, I rose for the purpose of according my support to the amendment, because I think I should be lacking in my duty as a representative of the working classes if I did not do so by both voice and vote. My further object was to draw attention to the specific instances I have brought under the notice of the Treasurer. </para>

                        <para>, - I desire to make a few remarks on the amendment submitted by the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton),</inline> but more particularly with reference to the speech of the honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Makin).</inline> The speech of that honorable member, in .some of its aspects, hardly, it seemed to me, did justice to his standing in the House. Anyone listening to him would believe that the history of invalid and old-age pensions was a history in which the Labour party had always done the most it could for the invalid and aged poor, and that every one not of the Labour party had done the least possible. I desire to draw attention to a few facts as against the assumption of the honorable member for Hindmarsh. I do this to enable those who read the debate to come to a more just conclusion than that at which they would arrive by listening only to him. The first fact I submit is that the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act was introduced and carried through this 'House by the present Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">.(Mr. Groom).</inline> That Act fixed the old-age pension at 10s. For a considerable number of' years, as a member of the party to which the honorable member for Hindmarsh now belongs, I endeavoured unsuccessfully to secure an extra 2s. 6d. for the old people. Practically all through the administration of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> that agitation was persistently kept up and persistently resisted, for the reasons that were given by the Prime Minister this morning. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member does not know either what I am trying to do, or what we are going to do. I suggest that the proper time for such <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> debate <inline font-style="italic">as</inline> this is not now, but when the Budget has been introduced, and honorable members know what tha Government propose. I wish to place the fact on record that the agitation .for the increase of the old-age pensions persisted for some years, and that it was only in the last years of the last Hughes Labour Government that an extra half-crown was given. This is the record of the parties up to that time. The Deakin Government made it possible to bring in an  old-age  pensions -measure before the ten-years period under the Constitution had expired. That solved a problem that to us appeared insolvable - I mean the difficulty of getting over the constitutional provision under which the surplus revenue was returned to the States. An Act was introduced, and the pension fixed at 10s., and after eight years of persistent agitation, during which, I think, Labour Governments were in power for most of the time, we failed to attain our object until near the end of the last Hughes Labour Administration. As against that record, I ask honorable members to place the record of the Nationalist party, which has raised the pension from 12s 6d. to 15s., and extended it to the blind very much more liberally than ever before. In addition, the Nationalist party has adopted the principle now suggested by the honorable member for Barrier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Considine),</inline> and in some cases, at any rate, provided that other pensions received shall not be counted in assessing the old-age pension; this is so in the case of a returned soldier. I submit that these facts show how much more enthusiasm there is among our Labour friends, on the eve of an election, for the poor, aged, and infirm, than there is when they are behind the Government of the day, and have the .power to do that which they are asking the present Government to do. I venture to say that if they were still supporting a Government led as the Government was by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> in the days gone by we should not have had the amendment- </para>

                            <para>- In that case the request of honorable members opposite is considerably weakened, because pensions have in the interval been increased 50 per cent, so that they are entitled now to ask for an addition of only 10 per cent I do not say that the aged people can maintain themselves comfortably on the amount given, which is only some' assistance towards their maintenance. I condemn the introduction of this amendment in this way at this time, and particularly do I condemn the assertion that has been made more than once in the debate, that all interest on behalf of the old-age pensioners lies in honorable members opposite, and that there is no such interest on this side. </para>

                            <para>- And the Honorary Minister will remember who forced these Ministers to do so. The most remarkable feature of this debate is the disclosure of how sore a point the " salary grab" is in some quarters; it certainly does seem to annoy a number of people. We have, a representative in this House telling- us how much he sacrificed when he accepted £600,. while the others were paid £1,000. Well, I took £1,000 because I was damned well worth it; the honorable member to whom I refer was never worth £600, because he gave only the fag end of his time here, and it was not of much use to the people be represented. The less he says about the " salary grab " the better it will be for himself and those associated with him. He has told, us that he could not afford to be a member of the Federal Parliament if it sat out of Melbourne - he could not earn his fees if he did. Yet he talks of the corruption and roguery of other people. </para>

We all know that they should have been increased to £1 a week long ago, and I agree with the honorable member for Barrier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Considine)</inline> that the pensioners should get full pay instead of the paltry dole we suggest now.

                    <para>I marvel at certain honorable members who seem to regard the Labour party as guilty, of a heinous crime in daring to submit an amendment of this sort against the Government. But it is the duty of an Opposition to make a  Government do what the Government may not wish to do, and I, for one, was pleased that the Labour party here decided to move the amendment. At any rate, this discussion will ventilate the subject, and let us see who are in f avour of an increase. I know that there are many members who do not wish to "face the music." Some of them are very adept at explanations, and they may bc required to explain a great deal later on ; but if any explaining is to be done, it should be during this .debate. I shall not further detain the House, but I again express the hope that the Treasurer will consider the advisableness of at once liberalizing many of the regulations which govern the payment of invalid and old-age pensions. </para>

                        <para>.- In common with my colleagues of the Labour party I am anxious that no time shall be lost in ' ascertaining the will of the House with regard, to the amendment that has been moved by the Leaden of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton),</inline> and it is only because of a strong sense of duty that I rise to make a few remarks in reply to the statements made this evening by the honorable member' for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr, Maxwell).</inline> He should be the last of all honorable members to make any reference whatever to the increase allowed- to members of Parliament. Those who, like myself, have followed the political history of Australia during the last forty years know that the strongest enemies of progressive legislation in this country have been members of the legal profession. . In order to qualify for admission to- the bar they have to pass certain examinations, and to devote much study to musty books dealing with old-time principles, which are altogether out of harmony with the views of the people of to-day. The honorable member for Fawkner knows that, in order to attend here, honorable members from other States have to make considerable business sacrifices. He must not think that he is the only pebble on the beach. When I entered this House I had to sacrifice my business, and from the date of my election I have devoted the whole of my time and energy to the task of serving the interests of the people. The honorable member, however, never loses an opportunity to try to cast a slur on those who voted to increase the parliamentary allowance to £1,000 a yean. In order to attend to his parliamentary duties, he has not to sacrifice his home life as have those who come from other States, nor has he to sacrifice his practice as a member of the legal profession. He lives hi a Melbourne suburb, is able to go to his chambers every morning, study his. briefs there, and take some home with him at night. Attendance in the House does not involve any sacrifice of his ordinary income. He should not forget that honorable members who come from other States are not in the same happy position. I hope this will be the last occasion on which he will deem it his duty to sneer at those members of Parliament- who are less fortunate than he is - men who came from other States, and have not the opportunities that he enjoys to carry on their ordinary business or professional occupation. As  a  criminal barrister he draws his fees from the poorer classes of the community. He is briefed, not by the banking and commercial institutions, but largely by people in humble circumstances, who find it difficult to provide the' fees necessary to engage him to appear in their behalf in the Criminal Court. </para>

                    <para>Coming to the question of invalid and old-age pensions, I think it was some thirty-eight or forty years ago that we first moved in the New South. Wales Labour Council - which was far ahead of the State Parliament of the day - to induce the Government to inaugurate an old-age pensions scheme. Trade unionists were the first to urge the provision of old-age pensions. They showed the people how necessary it was <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> provide for the aged and the infirm. We are told to-day that the Commonwealth Government cannot afford to increase the invalid and old-age pensions. Over and over again, we .have heard the same story.. Have the Government and their supporters ever studied this question <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> It seems to me that they have not, otherwise they would not say that the country cannot afford to liberalize the present pensions. The money which invalid and old-age pensioners receive from the Treasury) within three or four days of its distribution finds its way back once more to the banks. Unlike some sections of the Community, old-age pensioners do not spend their money on the purchase of pianos, or gold watches, or motor cars. They spend it on the necessities of life, and so benefit the primary producers. The Country party in this House is a mystery. It should be the first to urge that the invalid and old-age pensions should be increased, since primary producers benefit more than do any other section of the community from the expenditure of pensioners. Since the war, we have read from time to time of the departure of many of our citizens for a trip round the world. Those who go abroad take away much of the wealth of Australia. Invalids and old-age pensioners, however, spend all their money locally. People who set out on a holiday trip to the Old World lessen the value of Australia's production. These pensioners do not. For the twelve months ended 31st July, 1921, the value of the primary products of Australia was £348,183,000, while manufacturers, with the aid of Labour, during the same period produced £292,526,608 worth of manufactures, or a total of £640,719,608. Yet we are told that Australia cannot afford to give the aged and the infirm higher pensions than they now receive. </para>
                    <para>It is amusing to hear the supporters of the Government, who represent the gilded section of the community, protesting against the action taken by His Majesty's Opposition in this matter. We arc simply carrying out our duty, by endeavouring to force the Government to do something in the best interests of Australia. It is our duty to point out to the Government the error of their ways, to remind them of their stupidity and want of knowledge, and to endeavour to educate them to a proper sense of the true functions of government. We do not care a button for the opinions of honorable members opposite. We neither study their feelings nor their positions. Wo hope this session to remove them from the Government side of the House. </para>

                    <para>The old-age pension scheme is as yet in its infancy. Our liabilities fender it must increase, because it is a rule, not only of the Public Service, but of many mercantile and commercial houses, that when a man reaches the age of sixty years he must be dismissed. I am convinced that before long Labour will be in power. The people are anxiously awaiting an opportunity to record their verdict, and, as a result of the next appeal to the constituencies, my party will be on the Government benches. Australia will then be governed according to Constitutional usage, and will not be subjected, as it is to-day, to the high-handed actions of one individual. I am not casting any reflection on the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes).</inline> I have never said a word against him. The trouble is that he is supported by men who have not the best interest of Australia at heart, and the stand that he is at present taking is due largely to the company that he keeps. I do not fail to observe what is going on in this House. I am as keen and alert as 13 any other honorable member. Thank God, I am endowed with some ability and a certain degree of common sense. </para>
                    <para>The honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Maxwell)</inline> said that the object of the amendment was to embarrass the Government. Why is he so anxious not to embarrass the Government? What about the. poor, unfortunate creatures who have not the means with -which to sustain life? Ought not they to be of some concern to honorable members of this House? What do honorable members of the Opposition care about embarrassing the Government ? It is perhaps as well that we Labour representatives are oh this side of the House at present, because when we get on the. other side there will be something of a revolution in the conduct, of business. We shall have <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> bring the <inline font-style="italic">country</inline> back to 1913, which was, without doubt, the best year in Australian history. Very few members of the Government have the same practical work to do that Labour representatives undertake. I never go home without meeting some one who is distressed because a mistake or fault in the Pensions Act will not allow them to receive a pension to which they are justly entitled. My experience, like that of. other members of this party, is that the officers of the Old-age Pensions Department do their best. The officers of the New South Wales Department certainly have met with my approbation, because they have honestly endeavoured to carry out the provisions of the Act. We ought/ to bring that Act into conformity with the ' intentions of the Australian people. All that I am endeavouring to do and all that honorable members on this side of the House are endeavouring to do, is to carry out the wishes of the people. Is there a member sitting on the Government side of the House who honestly believes that the views expressed by honorable members on this' side, <inline font-style="italic">horn</inline> the Leader of the Opposition downwards, do not represent the opinions of the people outside ? </para>

I think that if it were not for the party Whip, honorable members on the Government side of the House would be actually in accord with the spirit of the amendment moved from this side. If the -Government would make a statement to the effect that the Treasurer, in his next Budget, would provide for old-age pensioners getting what we are asking for, the Leader of the Opposition, I have no doubt, would be quite satisfied. The honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Maxwell)</inline> has thrown slurs at us for accepting £1,000 a year. Whether he believes it or not, I certainly earn my thousand, and if I get out of Parliament to-morrow I shall not ask a soul for a threepenny bit without earning it. Next June the Treasurer will have an opportunity, owing to the larger amount collected from Customs and Excise duties, to augment the Trust Fund out of which pensions' are paid. If the Customs and Excise receipts are not large enough for the purpose, the Government might pay 2s. 6d. less <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> to the States, thus reducing the payment from 12s. 6d. to 10s. By this' means the Treasurer could obtain abundant money to pay more liberal old-age pensions, and by so doing he would more than satisfy the community. If he has any doubt about the outcome of the next elections, such action as I suggest would be a very great lever in his favour, and I believe a majority of the people of Australia would commend him for it. </para>

                            <para>- I think the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> did the right thing in drawing attention to the neglect of the Government in riot bringing forward, in the very comprehensive  'Speech  of the Governor-General, proposals on the lines indicated. He, as our leader, would be neglecting his duty, and we, who are the members of his party, would be neglecting our duty, if we did not support him in drawing the attention of the electors to that deplorable neglect on the part, not only of the Government, but also their followers. The Governor-General's Speech was formulated, no doubt, in the Nationalist party's caucus-room, where the followers of the Government had an opportunity to .put forward their views in regard to it, and to secure the embodiment in it of certain proposals and the omission of others. What evidence have  we  that the members of the Government party did not discuss the matter of liberalizing the allowance to old-age and invalid pensioners, and that the proposal was not turned down in the caucus-room. The decision that the Government should do nothing may thus have been cut and dried'. The honorable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Austin Chapman)</inline> may withdraw the motion that stands in his name on the notice-paper, or he may be taken ill and not be here on the day that it should be moved, even if he wishes to move it. Perhaps the party whip will be flourished over him, so that he may not desire, on that day, to move it. I am afraid the Government have been too much concerned in getting rid of those very necessary services which were established in Australia during the period of the war to pay attention to such matters as old-age and invalid pensions. </para>

                    </continue><para>It is rumoured in those circles which seem to know of the Government's intentions before Parliament is aware of them, that the Commonwealth Government line  of  Steamers is to be disposed of. We have the statement of the honorable the Minister representing the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene),</inline> that it is the intention of the Government to get rid of the Geelong Woollen. Mills. I would like to have the opinion  of , the  honorable member for  Corio <inline font-weight="bold">-.(Mr. Lister)</inline> on that. Is he in favour of the disposal of these mills, and the cessation of woollen manufacture in his electorate!  His  views on the subject would be interesting. The mills were established to protect the people of Australia from exploitation, and it is essential, remembering the prices charged and the enormous profits made by private individuals during the war, that the Government should continue to operate them so that, if extortion were threatened, they could say to the private manufacturers, " If your prices are exorbitant you will have competition." The evidence of Royal Commissions shows that there has been exploitation df .the public in the sale of woollen goods, and. it is continuing. It is deplorable that influences are being brought to bear on the Government to put an end to these mills, and to leave the community unprotected against those who- wish to .charge high prices for woollen manufactures. </para><para>It is not altogether surprising, under these circumstances, that the matter of invalid and old-age pensions has not received consideration from Ministers.  We  are not concerned now with what has been done by previous Parliaments in the fixing of invalid and old-age pension rates, nor does it matter particularly who originated the scheme.  If the rates are too low, or even if they are too high, they can be reviewed. Some of us were too young to be in Parliament when these pensions were first provided; but it is our duty now to see that proper pensions are paid, and that the pensioners are fairly treated. The insufficiency, of the pensions is not the only grievance of the .pensioners. Some members of the Police Forces and Public Services of the States are given, on retirement, pensions equivalent .to half, three-fourths, or the full amount of the salaries they drew, and they are. allowed also to engage- in business, and may make £1,000 or £2,000 a year in addition to their pensions. But the old-age pensioner, who has. not had a Public Service salary for the greater part of his life, is told that if he earns more than an amount which, together with his pension, comes to £65, the pension will be reduced. That is most unjust and unreasonable, and- operates very harshly in many- cases. Honorable members opposite have contended that the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton),</inline> by moving the amendment under discussion, has placed them  in an embarrassing position. I ask them -why they themselves did not discuss the matter in caucus, and have it referred to in the Governor-General's Speech. Obviously, nothing was said in caucus by any Ministerial supporter in favour of raising the old-age and invalid pension rates. The honorable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Austin Chapman)</inline> has given notice of a motion for increasing the old-age pension to £1, and, no doubt, if the Government would tell us that they intended to do that, the Leader of the Opposition would withdraw his amendment. </para><continue><talk.start>

The Commonwealth medical referee, however, will not give a certificate of permanent disability, and, as his .parents are keeping him, hie application for a pension has not been granted. Were his parents, who are poor people, to throw him on the street, and were he to become so ill . that the Commonwealth medical referee would give him a certificate, he would get the beggarly pension of 15s. a week. In another case, that of an old lady suffering from rheumatism, the Commonwealth medical referee would not at first grant a certificate, and the application was hung up for months, and the applicant had to travel a long distance and consult several other medical'' men before her pension was granted. We, on this side, have no desire to unduly embarrass Ministers, but we wish to get justice for those who are weak and suffering.. I suggest to the Government that where the opinion of the Commonwealth medical officer differs from that of the medical man supporting an application for a pension, the application should not be refused until the opinion of some other reputable medical man, preferably from another town or district, is taken on the case. We know- that doctors differ, and though he.' might be quite- sincere in the expression of it, , the opinion of the Commonwealth medical officer might be wrong. Rather than that an injustice should be done to an applicant for a pension, I offer the suggestion I have made, and if the Government give instructions for its adoption, it may prevent many complaints in. this connexion in the future. </para><para>There is another deserving class of persons who come under the provisions of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act. On the 22nd November, 1920, the then Treasurer, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Cook, introduced a short Bill dealing with the case of - pensions to blind persons. He said at the time - </para><para>Tt is a proposal to permit a blind pensioner to earn an amount which, together with his pension, will give him the  basic  wage as determined from time to time in any State, including the rate now paid in New South Wales, namely, £4 5s. per week. </para><para class="block">I regret to state that, notwithstanding the passage of this measure, when I brought under the notice of the late Treasurer, and also of the present Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce),</inline> the application of a body of musicians known as the Sydney Blind. Band, and asked that the provisions of the Act to which I have referred should be made applicable to them, the application was turned down in the first place because the information did not disclose their earnings. They play in the streets and accept engagements, and they are prepared to make, and have made, statutory declarations to the effect that their earnings are about £2 15s. each per week. Notwithstanding the fact that this statutory declaration was made, the Treasurer stated that it was not the practice to give pensions to such men.- He said, " Let them go into an institution, where they can learn some trade and become self-supporting." But that is not the object of the measure to which I have referred. It will be found that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Cook said, on the second reading of the Bill - </para><para>I am particularly referring to those pensioners who may, in some sense, be considered as alongside the blind people - those who are pensioners because of some disease or other from which they suffer. The blind pensioners, on the other hand, are healthy people, who can, and do, marry, and have families. The marriage of these people ought to be encouraged in a country like this, if we are to increase our population. They do all the other things that normal men always do - indeed, they have no disability but their blindness. That furnishes a reason, I think, for treating them in a category by themselves. There are only about 400 of these blind people in the whole Commonwealth, and only about 100 of these are in the various institutions of the States. Altogether it seems to me that this is a concession which they well deserve, </para><para class="block">Why should these men who are married and engaged in a legitimate occupation be asked to leave their homes and go into an institution? Why should the Government refuse to give them the benefit of a measure specially passed to deal with such cases? They are prepared to comply with the conditions imposed. They keep books and can give information as to their earnings, and yet their application is turned down. Isay it is most unreasonable and wrong that they should be asked to go into an institution before they can receive pensions. I bring the matter now under the notice of the Government in the hope that something may be done in the interests of these men. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- Exactly. We do not want them in institutions. In my opinion, street playing in the various cities might very well be left to such men who are good musicians, and are engaged in a legitimate occupation. Whilst the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition deals particularly with old-age and invalid pensions, I hope that some consideration will be given to blind persons making applications for pensions. </para>

I think that there is no honorable member present who will contend that old-age and invalid pensioners are now receiving a fair deal in getting a pension of only 15s. per week. </para><para class="block">It is most inadequate and unjust, and we on this side are doing only our duty to poor people who are not in a position to make their voices heard in this Chamber in moving an amendment to the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply in an endeavour to secure justice for them. </para></speech>
