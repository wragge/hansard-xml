                        <para>- Speaking from memory, our Act entitles the Federal public servants to a certain number of holidays in the year. Some of these holidays are uniform throughout Australia, but there are other days in regard to which the public servants in each State can make their choice. It is not the intention of the Government to add to the number of Public Service holidays. </para>

                        <para>- Parliament definitely expressed an opinion in favour of a duty of3s. per cental on South African maize, and the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene),</inline> who was then Minister for Trade and Customs, communicated with the Government of the Union of South Africa advising it of our intention to impose this duty. The South African Government replied immediately that if the duty were imposed it would put an end to the trade agreement between South Africa and the Commonwealth. The balance of the trade between the two Dominions is overwhelmingly in favour of the Commonwealth, the trade from Australia to South Africa in one year being valued at &#163;3,900,000, as against a value of &#163;400,000 for the trade from South Africa to Australia; and it was, therefore, felt that we could not take a step which would mean the ending of the trade agreement between the two countries. The present duty on maize is insufficient to protect the Australian growers of that cereal, and, in my judgment, action should be taken to put them in a proper position. We are now negotiating with the South African Government to bring about reciprocal trade relations between the two countries, and it would be an act of bad faith, at this juncture, to reimpose the duty. But the Government, in making a new arrangement with South Africa, will take into consideration the protection of our maize-growers, and I ask them to accept that assurance. There may be a short interval in which they may not be sufficiently protected, but we shall, as quickly as we can, come to an effective arrangement with South Africa. </para>

                        <para>- I did not know that a model was now being exhibited in the basement of the Senate&#39;s portion of this building; but applications have been made to me for the use of the Queen&#39;s Hall for the displaying of models By various inventors, and, in accordance with the rule that the Hall is not to be used for purposes other than those connected with Parliament or its activities, I refused permission for its display there. The  President  and myself have conferred on the subject. Applications are frequently made for the use of the Queen&#39;s Hall for various purposes. If a departure is made in the rule in favour of one applicant, trouble arises from the fact that a flood of applications immediately, comes from other persons, who ask for similar privileges. The only safe course to follow is to recognise that the Queen&#39;s Hall is not intended for such purposes, but, as part of the parliamentary building, should be kept entirely for uses associated with Parliament. Many honorable members have complained to me from time to time of the use of the Queen&#39;s Hall for other than parliamentary purposes.We have occasionally lent it for displays, and people have taken advantage of the opportunity to exhibit advertising matter, and to place persons in charge of the exhibits to point out their merits, and to take advantage of the occasion for commercial purposes. In declining to allow the Queen&#39;s Hall to be used for the display of the break-of-gauge model which has been spoken of, I informed those who had made the application that we would be prepared to allow them to exhibit the model in the basement of Parliament House. </para>

                            <para>- I think not. I have seen various exhibits there quite well, and the honorable member will recognise the unwisdom of departing from a rule which has been laid down when any departure is liable to abuse which it is very difficult to correct. When the Tariff schedule was under discussion, manufacturers wished to display all kinds of wares in the Queen&#39;s Hall. You cannot single out one applicant from others for specially favoured treatment. </para>

                            <para>At the October-November, 1921, Conference between Commonwealth and State Ministers, a resolution was carried to the effect that, with a view to providing for the employment of the immigrant in the preparation of land for settlement, and for subsequently affording him an opportunity of settling upon such land, the States should submit concrete schemes, and the Commonwealth should borrow the necessary money if such schemes were accepted. The Government of Queensland, in common with the Governments of the other States, was subsequently urgently requested, on two occasions, to submit definite proposals in compliance with the tenor of the Conference resolution. The details asked for were to include, <inline font-style="italic">inter alia,</inline> the work the Government would guarantee to immigrants, the number of immigrants they were prepared to absorb, and. the amount of money required from the Commonwealth for the necessary developmental works connected with the land proposed to be made available. The Government of Queensland did not supply the desired particulars in regard to any concrete scheme, with the result that no agreement has been entered into between the Commonwealth and that State with regard to the land settlement of immigrants. </para>

The measure under consideration is one which will inevitably lead to a great financial outlay, and its results are very doubtful.

                    <para>. - No definite salaries for the  president  and members of the Board have yet been fixed, but it is obvious that the man who is to be given charge of the administration of this measure should receive a salary commensurate with the heavy responsibilities which will be placed upon him. I indicated last night that the Government desire, if possible, to avoid the appointment of full-time men to these positions. Perhaps it will be some guide to the Committee if I inform honorable members that the man in charge of the New South Wales superannuation scheme receives &#163;950 a year, and the two men associated with him on the Board receive &#163;625 and &#163;500 respectively. </para>

                        <para>- No. I am not suggesting that we should blindly follow the course adopted in New South Wales. I am indicating to honorable members what we may reasonably expect to have to pay, and that should be some help to them. Honorable members who have any experience of the initiation of large undertakings will agree that it is not possible, at this stage, to fix arbitrarily what should be the salaries paid to the members of the Board. My own opinion is that the salaries paid should be in the neighbourhood of those paid in New South Wales. We do not want a cheap man at a low salary. What we want is efficiency and not cheapness. It is impossible, at this stage, to say exactly what salaries will be paid. </para>

                    <para>.- This clause is not drawn in the most effective way,. It provides a rather cumbersome way of settling any matter upon which, at any meeting, the voting is equal. If, at any meeting, the voting on a particular matter is equal, it would be far better to have the three members of the Board present at the next meeting to decide it rather than have a third meeting of two of the members and give one of them a casting vote. Where two members of the Board fail to agree upon a matter I see no difficulty in the way of summoning a meeting of the full Board, when there must be a majority voting in one way. </para>

It will not tend to the harmonious working of the measure if one of two members disagreeing upon any particular matter is given a casting vote at a third meeting.

                    <para>. - I do not think that the clause presents such serious difficulty as the honorable gentleman imagines. There must be occasions when there will be only two members of the Board present at a meeting. The clause provides that if on such an occasion there is an equal vote on any matter the decision must be postponed. Provision is then made that notice of the question about which the members have disagreed and the fact of their disagreement must be given with the notice of the next meeting. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not know what staff will be required for the Board, but I do hope that the cost of the administration of this measure will be minimized in every possible way. Honorable members are often under the impression that the administration of measures passed in this Chamber will involve but limited expenditure, and it is discovered later that it has involved the establishment of what in a short time becomes a large Department employing a considerable number of clerical and other hands. I see nothing to prevent that result following the passing of this Bill, and it is a thing that should be guarded against. The clause provides for a secretary and actuary, or an officer who is both secretary and actuary, and I trust that one officer will be appointed to fill both these positions. I hope the Minister will not take it for granted that, because we have agreed to the creation of a small Department for the administration of this Bill, that will justify him, or the Board, in appointing a large number of officials. It may be that, in the initial stages, it will be necessary to appoint a number of temporary hands, and I suggest that they should be taken from some of the other public Departments. After the office for the administration of the Bill is organized, there should be a considerable falling off in the work to be done, and it should be possible to carry it on at very small expense. I hope that the Minister will keep that in mind. </para>

                    <para>. -I quite agree with what has been said by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton).</inline> The staff created for the administration of this Bill will become a big Department unless the Government take action at the outset to make that impossible. I think that the Public Service Commissioner&#39;s office, or the Statistician&#39;s Branch of the Home and Territories Department, might very well administer this Bill. In that way we might minimize the expenditure involved in the appointment of the staff. I hope the Government will not set up a new Department entirely for the purpose of administering the Superannuation Act. It is bound to grow and to become more and more expensive. This costly scheme, for which the people at large will pay half, will be for the exclusive benefit of the Public Service. I do not think that in addition, the taxpayers should be called upon to maintain a costly administrative Department. </para>

                    <para>. -  The Government are quite in accord with honorable members with respect to keeping down administrative expense, particularly in view of the fact that the cost will not fall upon the fund, but must be borne out of the Consolidated Revenue. I do not think that administrative expenditure will involve large sums; it certainly should not do so. At the inception of any such scheme, however, there is inevitably an accumulation of work which must be promptly put in hand. It would be a mistake if the Government were to make permanent members of the Public Service do what may be but temporary work. But a staff of its own will be, necessary. </para>

There will be actuarial investigations constantly in hand as part of the administrative work involved by the very nature of the Act. Thus, it will be essential to have an official with actuarial experience. I can give the assurance that every effort will be made to keep down costs. </para>

Under the Federal Constitution, however, advisory views may not be secured from our Judges. They have power only to decide judicial questions properly brought before them. </para>

The proposed new clause will make the provision regarding this question quite general. The question of invalidity or physical or mental incapacity will he determined by the Board which, before giving its decision, must obtain a medical report. </para>

                    <para>.- I raise no objection to the proposed new clause, but I desire to point out that it is doubtful whether it will give the satisfaction that the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> expects. At present there is much dissatisfaction in connexion with medical reports. In this connexion, I do not wish to make any complaint, because I know how difficult it is in a continent <inline font-style="italic">like</inline> Australia to have medical testimony available throughout the different centres. Whilst the Board will be able to avail itself of the services of Government medical officers for the purpose of examining different civil servants who desire to take advantage of the provisions of the Bill, there appears to be no provision, either in the amendment or the Bill itself, to permit a dissatisfied applicant to appeal. </para>

                        <para>- It does not matter what the Bill says ; a Board of laymen must be guided entirely by medical testimony. It will be the doctor who will decide whether a certain individual should be allowed to retire and come under the provisions of the Act. I consider that, in connexion with old-age pensions, invalid pensions, and workmen&#39;s compensation, the applicant should have a right of appeal against a doctor&#39;s decision. The medical report may not be satisfactory to him, and he may know that the doctor&#39;s opinion is wrong, but he has no remedy. I suggest that applicants should have a right of appeal to another medical man, or to two medical men. </para>

                        <para>- That is all I want ; and I raise the point because of my experience of medical reports in connexion with other matters. Honorable members know that, in many cases brought under their notice, there is a doubt as to whether the medical testimony is satisfactory. Doctors often differ materially from one another, and the proposal submitted by the Minister leaves the matter entirely in the hands of the medical officer appointed by the Government in the particular district in which the applicant resides. A dissatisfied applicant could be brought to another district and examined by one or two of our medical officers. This concession would not be costly, and it would prevent the possibility of the Board acting unjustly. If it was found that the second medical report was at variance with the first, the Board would have to look into the matter very closely. No sane man sitting on a Board would go beyond the medical testimony. </para>

I do not think that any injustice is likely to arise. There is no necessity to have a  medical examination or a Board for retirement, a Board to consider his fitness for service, and a further Board of appeal. It is such a serious thing to deprive a man of his pension that I cannot imagine any Board, with a sense of its duty, acting in an arbitrary way or excluding reasonable evidence. </para>

                        <para>- No, but should there be a conflict of opinion - if the Public Service Board declares that the man is incapable of fulfilling his duties on account of ill-health and the medical officer appointed by .the Superannuation Board declares that he is fit to perform his duties - it would justify tha Minister in having the matter investigated. However, I do nob think it is a case that is likely to arise. </para>

                    <para>.- I agree with a great deal that the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> has stated, but he has not touched upon the point I have raised, namely, the case of a public servant who knows beyond a shadow of a doubt that he must desist from work on account of incapacity to carry out his duties. If the Superannuation Board refers his case to a medical officer and he certifies that the individual is incapacitated from following his employment a pension will be paid, but if, on the other hand, the medical officer certifies that the individual is still capable of performing his duties in the Public Service no pension will be paid, although the public servant may know that his health will not permit him to continue at work. </para>

The latter, however, may have no doubt about his incapacity to perform his duties. He may be backed up by the testimony of other medical men, who declare that it is imperative that he should cease work immediately. Would not such a man be placed outside the provisions of the Superannuation Act? </para>

                        <para>- The Minister practically agrees with me, but says that there is no need to make provision in the Bill for what Iwant, because the Board already has power to call in other medical opinion. The question is whether the Board will exercise that power. There would be no doubt about its doing so if the right of appeal were provided in the Bill. I am certain that the time will arrive when it will be found to be essential to have the provision for which I am now asking. Difficulty has already arisen in New South Wales under the Workers&#39; Compensation Act. There is constant conflict between the Government Department and the various Boards and others concerned owing to the fact that there is no appeal from the certificate of a medical officer. </para>

If that report conflicts with the decision of the Public Service Board, provision can easily be made in the regulations to be framed under this Bill requiring that the Superannuation Board may call for other medical officers&#39; certificates. Even without such a regulation the Board would have power to do so. </para>

Such men are available in every city, so that an appeal would involve no expense. Where other qualified medical men hold opinions differing from that expressed by the medical officer appointed by the Board it is only fair that a case should be reopened. </para>

There is nothing to prevent the insertion of a couple of lines in the proposed new clause providing that an applicant for a pension may, if he so desires, have a further medical examination. I urge this because I know what has happened in other directions, and because I am afraid that if my suggestion is not adopted now, Parliament, in a couple of years, will be called upon to amend the Act, in order to make this very provision. </para>

                <para class="block">Acts. It is not until the public servant has been passed out of the Public Service on the ground of invalidity by the Public  Service  Board that his case comes before the Superannuation Board, which can then, if it thinks fit to do so, call for further medical testimony upon the matter of invalidity. There are one or two other matters I wish to emphasize. I want to know whether the medical officer will be paid out of the Superannuation Fund or whether- the applicants for pensions who go before them for examination will be obliged to pay the fees. </para>

                    <para>. -  -I agree with the honorable member for Robertson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fleming)</inline> that every facility must be afforded to have public servants examined at localities reasonably close to their places of residence. I dare say that in this regard the provision made will be similar to that which is now to be found in the Public . Service Administration. Medical officers may be appointed, whose remuneration&#39; will be fees for services rendered when required. I ask the honorable member not to press, at this stage, the matter of who should pay the fees. It is a question still remaining to be considered, and will be dealt with by regulation. The attempt to include every detail of administration in a Statute allows no elasticity in administration. All that we can expect in a Bill of this sort is the inclusion of the main principles and main duties of the Board. </para>

                    <para>.- From my experience in connexion with invalid and old-age pensions administration, I feel disposed to support the request made by my Leader <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton).</inline> I have in mind six cases, including two returned soldiers, in which it was held by the Department that the men concerned were not entitled to pension privileges. In the case of one returned soldier, the medical officers declared that the disability was not due to warlike operations, but two other Sydney medical men who became interested in  the matter differed entirely from the report of the departmental medical officer, who was proved to be in error. The Department is now paying pensions in four of those six cases. It is very desirable to have some means of appealing against the decision of a medical officer. </para>

                        <para>- I know that some members of the Service are waiting for this Bill, because they want to get out. The Board might take the view that a person was not justified in asking for a pension because possibly of some ulterior motive. In view of the -magnitude of the issues involved it would be wise, and, I think, in the interests of the Public Service, to include some such provision as has been suggested by the honorable member for Hunter. i hope the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> will give this matter serious consideration. I realize, of course, that it would be hopeless to try and force the hands of the Government. </para>

                    <para>. - I understand, of course, that before any member of the Public Service can secure benefits under this scheme he must be retired from the Service, and till Board should take into&#39; consideration the circumstances under which he may be retired. In ordinary circumstances there is quite enough trouble about the dismissal or retirement of a public servant. All sorts of strings are pulled, in some instances, to get a case reviewed. With pension privileges attaching to the Public Service there will be still more trouble over dismissals, and it is more essential, I think, that there should be opportunity to appeal against an adverse decision of the medical officer1 or the Board. </para>

                    <para>, - If there is a doubt as to whether this suggested provision should be inserted or not, now is the time to settle the matter. If honorable members had had my experience of the administration of the Old-age and Invalid Pensions Act, they would not hesitate to request the Minister to insert this saving clause. It is possible that, otherwise, some injustice may be done to a member of the Public Service through, perhaps, the inability of a medical officer to properly diagnose his case. As the Bill stands, there is no recourse for the public servants concerned. Let me remind honorable . members of my experience in the Gunner Perry case. It was proved that Gunner Perry was brutally tortured in the military hospital by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Mead,</inline> but, fortunately, he was saved when the matter was brought before the military court martial by the testimony of one of the most highly qualified physicians in Melbourne, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Springthorpe,</inline> who gave him a letter from Egypt. Much to his disgust, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Mead</inline> lost his case,  for it was proved on sworn evidence that he had actually tortured this man. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Cook, who was then in opposition in this House, wanted to know why one of the Ministers did not make a personal inquiry into the allegations. I under stand that one did do so privately, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> who was then Minister for Defence, desired an inquiry, which was held at great expense. Gunner Perry was really under observation for six months in the Lunacy Department, and even then he did not get justice. Subsequently he went to Queensland when there was a great desire for more volunteers, and I understand he was actually employed by the military authorities in that State. Where he is now I do not know. I believe he committed suicide. Neither he, nor the unfortunate girl whom he persuaded to marry him, has been heard of since. If this provision is not inserted in the Bill the only appeal which members of the Public Service will have will be to members of Parliament. </para>

                        <para>-  But there must be some report before a public servant can be invalided and retired. If subsequently the report of a medical officer were unfavorable in regard to pension privileges, naturally the Board would ask for further medical testimony. There is nothing in the Bill to prevent this being done. It seems incredible that if a conflict of opinion &#39; arose between the departmental view and the view of the public servant other steps would not be taken. I remind the honorable member that of the three members on the Board one is to be  a  nominee of the Public Service. </para>

                    <para>. - A suggested amendment to clause 12 was handed to me yesterday, and. I brought it under the notice of the Attorney-General at a time when he was very busy. I ask him now whether he will consent to the recommittal of that clause in order to allow this proposal to be dealt with. Sub-clause 2 of clause 12 provides that contributors retiring on and after attaining the age of sixty years, and prior to the maximum age for retirement, may contribute, in a lump sum or in smaller amounts, the actuarial equivalent of the amount necessary to complete his payments up to the maximum age, &#34; at such periods as the Board approves,&#34; and it is suggested that these words should be added: &#34;or by contribution at an age rate five years in advance of the contributor&#39;s actual age.&#34; The object of this portion of the clause is to provide for a contributor retiring earlier than the maximum age. He may retire at sixty and be entitled to a full pension under the Act provided he contributes the actuarial equivalent of the sum necessary to complete his payments to the maximum age, namely, sixty-five years. It would be impossible for the average contributor to pay this amount in a lump sum, and comparatively heavy payments by way of deduction from a small pension would not leave the pensioner adequate maintenance. The pensioner on a small pension would thus be unable to avail himself of this clause as it stands. The proposed amendment would enable the contributor to pay the additional sum required while he is earning, and would bring the section within reach of the small man at no additional cost to the fund. For instance, a contributor fifty years of age will be required to pay 12s. 5d. per additional unit. If he wished to retire at sixty, for the purpose of contributions to the fund his age would be advanced to fifty-five years, and he would then pay 19s. 6d. per additional unit. </para>

                <para>This is not a very ambitious measure. It aims at remedying some of the defects which have been found in the original Act, and centres on three main proposals. First, it limits the powers which the Commissioner may exercise without reference to the Minister. As was explained the other night, most of the evils that have fallen on the War Service Homes Department are traceable to the fact that the Commissioner has had practically unrestricted power with regard to administration and the acquisition of land and property. The Bill before us restricts the Commissioner&#39;s powers in several directions. In the first place, he is limited to expenditures not exceeding &#163;2,000, and is prevented from realizing on properties of the Commission without reference to the Minister. Then the Commissioner is similarly restricted from purchasing existing houses, from building otherwise than by contract, from the disposal of surplus lands, and&#39; from compounding with contractors. On these phases of the Bill I do not anticipate there will be much difference of opinion amongst honorable members. </para>
                <para>Another important feature of the Bill is that it proposes to relieve the soldiers  from many of the restrictions that surround the occupancy of houses. Under the existing law, soldiers are unable to sublet, and in cases, of change of address, and so on, they have to realize the property and take their chances of getting other homes* when all other applicants have been satisfied. The Bill will relieve <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> soldier from all those obligations, and enable him to realize the property, if he so wishes it. In order that this may be done with safety, it is proposed ito ask that a deposit of 5 per cent, on the amount proposed to be advanced by the Commission shall bo made by the applicant before the application is proceeded with. </para>
                <para>One of the most difficult questions that confronted us in  the  reorganization of the Department was. that of excess costs. This has proved very difficult of adjustment, and it is inevitable that the Commonwealth will be called upon to dispose of houses at less than the fair cost, if we <inline font-style="italic">take</inline> into consideration the time at which they were built. Unfortunately, they were built at a time of exceedingly high values for everything that goes into a house, and. far the labour which constructs it. I wish to emphasize that, in every attempt to adjust these conditions, we have endeavoured to act justly to the soldier, without regard to what the cost might be to the Commonwealth-. </para>

                        <para>- A heroic attempt has been made to do that; but I am quite convinced that the values we shall attach to the houses will approximate much nearer to the values to-day than the values at the time at which they were erected. The latter, of course, would have been the fair thing to charge to the soldier under the circumstances. In connexion with the adjustment of these excess costs, two or three difficulties arose. In many cases, the soldier had undertaken to pay more than the. statutory amount for his house, and. had not been given a definite amount. In order to meet those cases, wo had to disregard the law to the extent of adding to the capital cost of the houses the various &#34; amounts in excess of &#163;.800, which is the&#34; limit laid down in the Act. It would have been impossible for some of the soldiers to. meet an obligation of &#163;50, &#163;75, or &#163;100 in excess costs; and, in order that their houses might be saved to them, in some cases the amount of extra cost was capitalized. In this Bill we seek authority to capitalize the excess costa in this way where the soldier is unable to meet his obligation to pay in the amount of excess in a lump sum.. In a few cases, and very few,, the excess cost of the houses has the effect of increasing the repayments <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> an extent that the soldier is unable to meet. In those cases, we hope to extend the term of the repayments, although, as a general rule, that is not a wise course to follow. I wish to make it clear that the powers conferred by the Bill in this respect are only to be used in connexion with the adjustment of difficulties arising from excess costs, and are not to apply to the future work of the Commission. </para>

                        <para>- It applies to all cases where the costs are in excess of the statutory limit - a fact, which may not have been anticipated by the soldier. But in other cases of excess costs, where it is evident that the book value of the house is an excessive one, it is written down, and naturally the soldier gets the whole benefit of that. Indeed, as a general thing, it may be saM that, owing to the way in which- the Department has been- administered, some of the soldiers will be given several hundred pounds&#39; worth of value in their house for which they will not have to pay. <inline font-style="italic">Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.80 p.m.</inline></para>

                        <para>- The provision is not open to any objection. Under the existing law the Commissioner is powerless to act in regard to groups of houses where roads have not been made, or where sewerage, electric lighting, or any of the other services which local governing bodies of various kinds in different parts of Australia supply on terms to ratepayers has not been provided. The Crown being the owner of War Service Homes property, these local governing bodies are not able to enforce the usual processes for the recovery of arrears, and so on. The clause has been framed to place the Commissioner practically in the same relation to the occupiers of War Service Homes as the local governing body is in under the arrangement they make with those to whom they supply services. This is particularly needed where, by reason of the lack of proper drainage, and in districts which are yet to be sewered, the soldier is at a distinct disadvantage because the Commissioner has not the power which we now propose to give him. I have stated the main outlines of the Bill; its details will be more fully explained in Committee. </para>

                <para class="block">It is contended that the adoption of that proposal will give the Board sufficient power to deal with the exchange difficulty. Possibly it may, but, as I said on a previous occasion, the effective way of dealing with the difficulty is, in my opinion, to bring the value of goods imported from a country with a depreciated currency to the par of British currency, and then to apply the Tariff to them. All imports, if that method were adopted, would be dealt with in the same way; and so long as the Tariff duties were high enough, Australian industries would be adequately protected. The Government proposal is somewhat different, though practically its effect is the same as would result from the adoption of my suggestion. I have no objection to this proposal, because I realize that it is absolutely needed. There has been a great deal of importation from countries with a depreciated currency. Before we recommenced to trade directly with Germany, a great deal of iron and steel, in the form of bars, rods, blooms, and so on, was imported from Belgium  and Germany, where the currencies are depreciated, into Great Britain, given the finishing touches there, and then sent here to the detriment of the Australian iron and steel industry. This has had much to do with the condition of our industry to-day. Under the law as it stands, there is no power to prevent this importation, and now that we are trading direct with Germany, there is still more reason for amending our law, in order to give the Tariff Board power to protect our industries from unfair competition. We were told, on the last occasion when we discussed this matter, that the&#39; Customs Department has an organization throughout the world whereby it can gather information regarding costs and prices in countries of origin, and that this information could be used to prevent clumping; but the facts prove, either that that organisation does not exist or that the Tariff Board has been unable to take advantage of it. When we pass laws for the protection of our industries, we should take pains to see that they are not evaded or overridden. There may bc differences of opinion as to the wisdom of imposing certain duties, but once duties are passed they should operate until Parliament makes some change.. It has -been found in many cases that effect has not been given to the will of Parliament, because there has not been the necessary power. In the original Bill, the Minister proposed to allow, in relation to the cost of production, a margin of 20 per cent.; but, at the request of some honorable members, he reduced that margin to 5 per cent. Now &#39;he proposes to restore it to 20 per cent., his proposal being as follows : - </para>

                        <para>W&#39;here the cost of production mentioned in the last preceding clause is not ascertainable, the Minister may, in lieu of substituting for the fair market value the cost of production estimated from such information as is available, plus 5 per centum of such estimated cost, substitute for the fair market value the cost of production estimated from such information as is available plus such addition, not exceeding 20 per centum of such estimated cost, as is determined by the Tariff Board. </para>

                <para class="block">Evidently the Tariff Board has found that the original proposal was necessary, and we are now being asked, to restore it. I think that that should be done. There may be room for amending the Minister&#39;s proposal, but evidently the Tariff Board must have additional powers. Under the present legislation, all the Board can do is to inquire about the position of industries in Australia, the competition with which they have to contend, and whence it comes; it has not the power to prevent unfair competition. We should be careful not to pass legislation which will allow manufacturers or others to exploit the Australian public; but, on the other hand, we should foster Australian industries to find employment&#34; for our own people. To-day thousands of persons are unemployed in the various States, many of whom are without employment because of the importations of goods from countries with a depreciated currency. Australian workmen cannot hope to compete against- cheap foreign labour. Australian products cannot&#34; be expected to hold their own against cheaply-produced foreign products, which are often landed here and sold at a price which is lower than the selling price in the country of origin. The standard of living in Australia is so high that our industries cannot compete with the output of cheap wage industries overseas. It has been argued that the item of freight is sufficient to level up costs, but that is not so.. As a matter of fact, goods can&#39; be carried from overseas and landed in Western Australia almost as cheaply as goods manufactured on the east coast of the Commonwealth can be conveyed by steamer to the West. We must have legislation which will adequately provide against competition with black-labour products and the output of the far cheaper markets of other parts of the world. Such is the purpose of this Bill;- and, to that extent*, therefore, the Government are to be commended for introducing it. It is unfortunate, however, that the original measure did not make adequate provision. To-day. hops are being imported from America and elsewhere to the serious detriment,  particularly, of Tasmanian hop-growers. . Their last year&#39;s crop is still in cold store, but brewers are importing hops at a lower price than is represented by the Australian cost of production. Australian producers must either be protected or go out of business1.&#39; America has &#34; gone dry,&#34; and the huge American hop-growing industry has been hard put to it to find outlets for its production. Australian, brewers are helping to provide a market. </para>

Yet they are compelled to compete, not only with the huge output of a country which has &#34;gone dry&#34; and has little use for its hop crops, but with countries where hops are grown by Asiatic labour. I have been informed that hops are being sold in Australia for about 3d. per lb. less than the price in America; and that, despite freights, Australian growers cannot produce to-day upon the same basis of costs as before the war. </para>

                        <para>- I can only repeat that somebody must be making very big profits between the cheap foreign hop producers and the Australian brewers. Our brewers are well protected under the Tariff schedule; they should be prepared to act fairly by an allied Australian industry. Personally, I think they will be so prepared. Some brewers have reassured me upon that point ; but there are others not so inclined. I am sure that the Tariff. Board is doing all that is possible to assist the Australian growers. Neither in Victoria nor in Tasmania did hop producers get the benefit of the high prices which ruled during the war. </para>

                        <para>- I repeat that, if the brewers insist upon excluding Australian grown hops in favor of imported supplies, this proposed legislation should be speedily applied. In no other way can the industry be preserved. Alarming reports reached me only yesterday to the effect that brewers in Queensland had stated that they would &#39;buy their hops in the cheapest market. If they could get them more cheaply from countries where the hops were grown by black labour than from any other source they would not hesitate to do so. </para>

                        <para>- That is most disquieting. The provisions of the Bill should be made adequate to cover the position. If brewers refrain from using Australian hops the local industry will decline, and possibly die. Then the brewers will probably find the American supplies no longer available, owing to the lack of a home market. What will the brewers then do for their hops? </para>

                        <para>- That is what the Minister has just told us. I am alarmed at his statement that we have not the power to meet the position, and I hope that he will take it. I am sure that if the brewers saw the matter in its true significance they would readily recognise how necessary it is that they should patronize our own hop-growers, especially in view of the fact that they are themselves given a good deal of protection under the Tariff. If they do not patronize the products of their own fellow countrymen, I think we would be justified in considering whether we should continue to afford them that protection. Every one in Australia should be sufficiently patriotic to do what he can for his own people. </para>

However, they are now out of business because, although they could easily supply practically the whole of the hop requirements of Australia, fully half of what they produce cannot find a market. A continuance of such a condition of affairs would spell nothing but disaster to them, and the Minister would be well advised to take the power he requires to meet the situation. </para>

                        <para>- This legislation is designed to meet abnormal conditions, otherwise we would not be occupying time in dealing with it. Our Tariff is supposed to cope with normal conditions. Special legislation is required to meet abnormal circumstances. Yet, although the Tariff has proved unsatisfactory, according to the experience of the Tariff Board, we are informed by the Minister that he does not think his proposal today will meet the position. In the interests of those people who live on small areas, and grow hops for a living, we should do something to protect them. We should not leave them to the mercy of the brewers. I know that some brewers recognise how necessary it is that they should buy Australian hops as far as possible; but, on the other hand, there are those who claim the right to get hops from wherever they can procure them, whether they be grown by white, black, or yellow people. However, the proposal submitted to-day is a step in the right direction, and I hope that the Minister will make every endeavour to meet the position. </para>

                    <para>.- There is a striking difference between the division of responsibility and authority as set out in the resolution and that contained in the Act itself. In the latter, in every section, we find the words, &#34; If the Minister is satisfied after inquiry and report by the Tariff Board.&#34; In the resolution these words occur, &#34;As is determined by the Tariff Board.&#34; The adoption of the words as they appear in the resolution would relieve the Minister of all responsibility, and would hand it over to an independent Board. I consider this would be an entirely wrong principle, and, in my opinion, the resolution ought to be worded in accordance with the provisions in the principal Act. </para>

                    <para>.- No doubt, to those who believe in high Protection the anti-dumping resolution submitted to-day appears to be a necessity; but I think it should be understood that Australia&#39;s high Protectionist policy is placing the country in some very peculiar positions. That we are beginning to realize this is shown by the very attitude we are taking up in trying to checkmate the influence of our highTariff upon industries within the Commonwealth itself. We are beginning to learn that the high duties afforded to one industry are injuring other industries, and we have the spectacle of the Government, soon after the adoption of the Tariff schedule, bringing down amending resolutions for the purpose of protecting certain primary industries which, it is recognised, have been crippled by the Tariff. It is a case of the dog chasing its tail. I try to regard this matter from the national stand-point. We hear a great deal of talk about creating a standard of living by the enforcement of a high Tariff; but when we have so created a high standard of living, the task is how to maintain it. An article, to which I drew attention this morning when submitting a question without notice, should be taken into serious consideration, because it informs us that the copra trade, formerly held by Australia, has been lost to this country, and the copra does not even touch at any Australian port in passing from its place of production to markets overseas, except that which, because of the provisions of the Navigation Act, must come to us from Papua. It is the Navigation Act which has shut us out from the other and larger portion of the trade in this commodity. This is another outcome of our effort to make Australia self-contained. The Australian Natives Association, which first came into existence in the State of Victoria, where it is now liveliest, has come to realize how the Commonwealth is being injured by a high Protectionist policy, and that this policy is untenable. In fact, at the annual conference of the association held in Perth in July last, the following resolution was carried: - </para>

I am not speaking out because what I say may suit the electors. I am talking simply because I do not think that our Protectionist policy is beneficial to Australia. No attempt has been made by the Government to check the cheap inflow of goods, even from white countries. We are afraid to face the competition of white countries where there is no black labour. There has never been any suggestion to improve the form of our industries, our machinery, or our output. Why cannot Australians compete with Frenchmen, Englishmen, Scotchmen, or Americans, as they ought to be able to do, particularly with the protection afforded by 12,000 miles of water carriage? </para>

                        <para>- Yes, and I dare say that is due to the Protectionist policy, which allows the manufacturer of these harvesters to sell at a dear price to Australians in order that he may give a cheaper machine to the people of the Argentine, whose markets are open for the receipt of those commodities in the manufacture of which she cannot compete with other countries. The latter produce them by reducing overhead charges. Argentine has realized her natural facilities for producing wealth, and is getting population into the country. She opened up her land, and facilitated the coming of immigrants, giving them every attention on arrival, and allowing them to bring in free of charge their furniture and implements of production. Implements and tools of trade are on the Tariff free list. The result of this policy is that Argentine is prosperous, and the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> asks us to keep our eye on that country. The article continued - </para>

It cannot be suggested that Britain&#39;s interest was purely philanthropic. Colonial investments attracted the financiers, and they have been amply repaid for their enterprise. The great estancias of Argentina produce ever-increasing revenue to swell Britain&#39;s wealth, and it pays Britain to maintain her hold. The Governments of Argentina have not been blind to the advantages arising from association with Britain. Until the last year or so, they have given every inducement to the foreigner to invest his money there. Right at the birth of the Republic,, the authorities reversed the insane dictum of the Spaniard that foreigners were to be rigidly excluded; and companies formed for the exploitation of Argentine resources were thenceforward given equal status with purely local concerns. At periods taxation was remitted, and compensation was guaranteed for damage to property by roving bands. Land was made available on attractive terms, and everything possible was done to encourage settlement and development. Australia could indeed learn much from the methods of the Argentine. </para>

                    <para>Since the total area of Argentina is approximately 1,135,850 square miles, it is apparent that that county has pushed further ahead in development than Australia, which, with an area of 3,000,000 square miles, has approximately 15,000,000 acres under crop. True, the population of Argentina is 10,000,000, as against Australia&#39;s 5,500,000, but a large portion at the southern end of the Republic is fit for nothing. As in Australia, the pastoral industry has laid the basis for permanent prosperiity,but the Argentine has devoted more attention to cattle than to sheep. This is probably due to the fact that the early Spanish colonists brought cattle there, which formed the nucleus for the vast herds which now graze on the stretching pampas of the territory. The industry, however, never attained great value until the British capitalists took a hand. Britain has been amply repaid. </para>
                    <para>During the war Argentina stood by her and her Allies, and helped towards victory by supplying meat and other foodstuffs for troops and civilians. Many of the greatest beef concerns in the world have vast interests in the Republic, and, in 1920, 4,165,573 quarters of frozen beef was exported, in addition to 581,286 quarters of chilled beef, 1,083,000 carcasses of mutton and 447,652 carcasses of frozen lamb, and great quantities of tinned meat and beef extract. Of the frozen beef, Britain took probably 95 per cent., while the bulk of the other lines also found their way to the British Isles. </para>

                <para>For a considerable time Argentine was importing more than she was exporting, but her people held to a policy which they knew would turn out right in the end. Their faith has been justified. </para>
                <para>Exports, therefore, have temporarily slumped. Whereas in 1920 5,029,528 tons of wheat was exported from Argentina, the sales in 1921 reached only 2,000,000 tons, whilst maize exports declined from 3,961,801 tons in 1920 to 2,622,000 tons in 1921. Other lines showed similar decreases. The setback, however, is regarded as being merely temporary, and every effort is now being made to remedy the situation.  Her  methods are different from those of the Commonwealth. While Australian cattle-breeders have gone on their knees to the Government for financial assistance, the Argentine have been helping themselves. They have instituted a great publicity campaign in the British Isles, and have purchased over 3,000 retail butchers&#39;  shops for the sale of Argentina meat. One fact on which the Republic can pride itself is that there is a substantial margin of export receipts over expenditure on imports, due partly to increased primary production and partly to the recent move towards the building up of secondary industries. In 1911 the exports amounted to &#163;67,785,000 as against imports totalling &#163;80,202,000, leaving a debit of &#163;12,417,000. But by 1920 the position had been completely reversed, and in that year goods valued at &#163;199,460,000 were exported, whilst the imports, in spite of inflated prices, were worth&#163; 169,000,000. During recent years an extensive immigration system has been built up, settlers being welcomed from almost every country in the world. </para>

For three years they pay no taxation whatever, and can even import their furniture, tools of trade, and clothing, and other necessaries without payment of duty. </para>

                <para class="block">Contrast that policy with the action of the Commonwealth Government in charging several hundreds of pounds in duty on each tree tractor imported for use in the group settlements. I believe that duty has since been remitted. I agree with the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> that Australia would do well to keep an eye on Argentina. We should also take a little introspective vision. Last year this Parliament imposed a duty on sulphur, one of the component parts of superphosphates, which are at the very foundation of Australia&#39;s prosperity. It was a most one-eyed policy. Of course, it is said that the imposition of a duty will&#39; stimulate local production, and lead to the supply of manures to the farmers at cheaper prices. But what do the manufacturers of superphosphates say? I quote this letter from Cuming, Smith and Company - 27th April, 1922. </para>

                <para class="block">It would not be difficult to point out that this impost on sulphur is not the only direct tax on our primary industries which have to compete with our great rival, Argentine. That country has a great advantage over us, inasmuch as she is three weeks nearer the world&#39;s markets, and the Government in imposing these burdens on our. primary industries are taking steps which they will have to retrace sooner or later. It is right enough to keep up our standard of living, but the way proposed is not the proper one. We ought to consider what is wrong with Australia that she cannot conduct secondary industries without being spoon-fed at the expense of primary industries. I have not forgotten the speech which the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> delivered when the first anti-dumping Bill was before us at the end of last year. I cannot quote the honorable member&#39;s exact words, but he made an excellent speech, in which he said that we had been for many months considering the protection of industries by the imposition of a heavy Tariff ; that the departmental officials and the Minister himself had been devoting much time in order to include every product they considered ought to be protected. The effect of such a policy is to deny the Australian the opportunity of obtaining anything cheaply; and the honorable member for. Batman told us that the Government, in case they had left some little hole whereby something cheap might creep into the country, were putting this anti-dumping plaster right over the Tariff. We have now had twelve months&#39; experience of the working of the decision then arrived at. I may point out here that the Tariff Board has not a primary producer on it, although the primary producer buys the bulk of his machinery in Australia, and it is on him we rely for 75 per cent, of the revenue of the country. We are told now by the Minister that the Tariff Board requires further powers. It would appear that some little draft of cheap goods may get into the hands of Australians, and, therefore, it is proposed that the anti-dumping plaster shall be made thicker, so as to preclude any possibility of such a thing. The primary producers must, it seems, be handicapped right down to the ground, and, at the same time, we see articles appearing in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> containing the warning, &#34; Keep your eye on Argentina.&#34; We now find that Fiji has taken trade away from Australia. - another step, I suppose, towards making Australia a self-contained country. The honorable member for Gippsland (Mr.&#34; Wise) asks for a heavy duty on maize, and representatives of Tasmania, desire a duty on hops because America has gone &#34; dry.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- If the production of hops were considered by the Board to be of sufficient importance, and its protection would not cost too much, that, too, should be considered. Australia is now, however, face to face with the great sugar industry. As a member of the Public Accounts Committee, I ought not, perhaps, to refer to this, but it has been stated that a duty of &#163;14 per ton will be required to protect the industry. I venture to predict, if such a duty were imposed, that in a few months that would be added to the general price of an imported ton of sugar. This really means that an Australian would be buying 1 ton of sugar at a price for which other people could buy 2 tons of sugar; and so we go around the vicious circle. But the most serious matter of all is that we cannot make anything to sell outside, and we have to sell something, indeed much, to cover our great financial obligations. </para>

I should like to impress on the Minister that my remarks are on lines which the Government have recently adopted. In my first speech in this Chamber, I said that if industries are so necessary to the centralized portions of Australia, they ought to be protected by means of bounties; and at last the Government have recognised the truth, and have so protected a couple of industries. </para>

Under a Protectionist Tariff the cost is placed on the shoulders of the few, and not on the shoulders of those who support and vote for such Tariffs. If secondary industries  are protected for the benefit of Australia, the whole of Australia should contribute to the cost of the protection. I am glad the Government have admitted the, principle of bounties, because it will make it easier for a succeeding Government to follow in their steps. </para>

                        <para>- With a Protectionist Government, such as we have, the proposals are excellent for the purpose for which they are framed, but I am dead against the principle involved in them. I should have much preferred if the Government, in sticking on this anti-dumping plaster, had asked themselves why it is that we cannot compete with other countries. Are the big works at Newcastle up-to-date, and as efficient as any American works? What is wrong? The Government ask themselves none of these questions; they simply thicken the plaster, and so handicap Australia that she will be beaten by Argentina and other countries which have more common sense. </para>

I remember that when the protection of the timber industry was before us, and it was shown that the dumping of timber by countries which had felled more trees than they required themselves, might impose some disability on the local industry, the honorable member for Swan, for three days, in speeches worthy of himself, and with a solemnity all his own, insisted on the inadvisability of any duty on timber. </para>

                        <para>- I know it is correct. The honorable member was justified in voting as he did, but he has no right to vote in direct opposition to his own arguments. And he is not the only culprit. The honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McWilliams),</inline> like the honorable member for Swan, assailed us whenever, in the desire that Australia might become something more than a merely mining and agrarian country, we made an attempt to preserve Australian industries. Now, however, we find that those honorable members who sit in the &#34; Amen &#34; corner have changed their opinions. The Division of Gippsland has always sent a Protectionist representative to this House, and is, therefore, justified in seeking the protection of its productions. Maize is a staple product of Gippsland, and the growers of maize there have been injured because South Africa, which has over-produced, is dumping maize into Australia. As for the hop-growers, we knew that with a certain amount of protection they would be able to compete against importations from abroad; but the present importation of American hops is due to a set of circumstances altogether abnormal. </para>

                        <para>- I am not going to discuss the cost of beer. An honorable member is right in seeking to protect an industry peculiar to the State from which he cornea; but the honorable member is inconsistent in his attitude towards Protection. Our efforts should be directed towards protecting the hop-growers by Statute, and an attempt should be made to induce the brewers to use only Australian-grown hops. No doubt the selfishness of individuals, and of the States, prevents the Federal spirit from spreading throughout Australia. The honorable member for Swan has no Australian feel ing whatever. He is so anti-Australian in his speeches and actions that I cannot understand his being elected by any division. If the electors of Swan impose him upon us again, I think that they  themselves should be removed from the country. </para>

                <para>Mr.Rodgers. - The honorable member goes too far. My statement was that, in view of the exceptional circumstances in America, where the nation has prohibited the use of hops for the manufacture of alcoholic beverages, it is almost impossible, except by prohibition of importation, to adequately protect the Australian hop-growers from the competition of importers from America. What I propose, however, does increase the measure of protection. Take the dumping below cost provision, in regard to which we make an increase from 5 to 10 per cent. ; that increases the protection. </para>

                        <para>- We can get imported American hops 50 per cent. cheaper than hops can be got in America, and that, after the cost of exchange, transit, and all handling charges has been paid. Nothing short of prohibition of importation can meet the case, and I say that to protect the hop-growers we should prohibit importation. People will not continue for long to grow hops in the United States of America, and, should our own hop fields go out of cultivation, we shall be without hops. From the teetotal point of view, that might be a good thing; though it is possible to make hop drinks which are not intoxicating, and the teetotallers would have done better had they spent half as much money in manufacturing a good teetotal drink as they have spent in publishing teetotal literature. </para>

                        <para>- The position in regard to maize is almost the same as that in regard to hops. Is it possible for Australian industries to live unless we protect them from dumping from abroad? We know that because of cheap production elsewhere and importation into this country one of our big manufacturing industries is being seriously injured. Had we protected it sufficiently the case would be different. As it is, subsidiary industries have gone to pieces from the failure to obtain the raw material that they needed. I hope that what has occurred will be a lesson to those who have always opposed the protection and fostering of Australian industries, unless where their own States or interests were concerned. </para>

                    <para>. - The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> referred to the position of the hop-grower, to which the Tariff Board has recently given considerable attention&#39;. The hop-growers are in a position which differs from that of every other producer in Australia, because practically their only customer is the brewing interest. The brewers form, perhaps, the wealthiest Combine that exists in Australia, and a Combine which has been protected by the highest duties which Parliament could impose. This wealthy Combine sweats the growers of hops to the very limit. The price of hops does not affect in the least the selling price of beer, and their cost is infinitesimal compared with the cost of the beer of which they form a part. The brewers do not give the hop-growers a fair deal. They say to the Tasmanian growers, &#34; You must plant out only Kentish varieties. We will not buy Californian clusters from you.&#34; They import the Californian cluster hops, and thus put themselves into an advantageous position to beat down the local growers of varieties which are more costly to produce and very much less productive. </para>

                        <para>- The price of coal rises and falls with the cost of production, but the cost of beer is not affected by the price of hops. Four or. five years ago hops were being carted round Hobart and could not find a market at 5d. or 6d. per lb. To-day nearly  half of last year&#39;s crop is being held in stock, and the brewers will not buy at a reasonable price. During the war hops went up to 4s. 6d. per lb. in some instances; but when the honorable member for Kalgoorlie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Foley)</inline> said to-day that the brewers of Kalgoorlie were giving 10s. per lb. for hops the Leader of the Opposition offered to get for them a contract to supply hops at 2s. 6d. I say that he could buy 2,000 bales to-day at 2s. 6d. per lb. A special cool store is being erected in Hobart at great cost to enable surplus stocks of hops to be held over, because the manufacturers of beer will not pay a living wage to the growers of hops. I do not deny that I opposed the establishment of the Tariff Board; I failed to see of what use it could be. But, since the Board has been brought into being, I agree that it should be clothed with adequate powers. Its twelve months of existence nave proved that the Board has not the power to enable it to be a working entity. I congratulate the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> on the Board which he possesses. </para>

                        <para>- As for the industry itself, the large growers of hops may be counted on the fingers of one&#39;s hands. Ninety per cent. of the growers live on and own their own properties, and the bulk of these are less than 5 acres in extent. It costs practically &#163;100 to plant an acre with hops. Many growers were persuaded to enter the industry by the brewers of the mainland. Now the brewers say they will not give the growers a reasonable price. Two shillings and sixpence per lb. is a low price, but if a wealthy Combine of brewers is determined to knock down prices still further it can succeed. The brewers, particularly of Adelaide, and in Queensland, are deliberately trying to reduce prices. </para>

On behalf of the delegation which came over to the mainland from Tasmania, I wish to express thanks to the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> for the assistance which he gave them in Sydney. The honorable member afforded them every possible help. I received a long telegram only yesterday from the  Chairman  of the Tariff Board in Adelaide; and, from information which I have received first hand, I am able to say that the brewers of Australia are not prepared to give the hop-growers a fair deal.

                    <para>.- The Customs Act is one of those measures which give tremendous powers to the Minister for Trade and Customs. The Statute colloquially known as the Anti-Dumping Act confers still greater powers upon the Minister. Those powers are very arbitrary. Parliament&#39;s only safeguard lies in the fact that the Act lays direct responsibility on the Minister. Thus, the Minister becomes answerable to Parliament; his actions can be called into question. In. the Customs Tariff (Industries Preservation) Act, there is to be found, again and again, the phrase, &#34; If the Minister is satisfied.&#34; I invite the  attention of honorable members to sections 4 and 5. But it is now proposed, under these resolutions, to take the power away from the Minister for Trade and Customs and to vest it almost exclusively in the Tariff Board. </para>

The Minister for Trade and Customs should he prepared to accept the whole of the responsibility, and should not seek to pass it on to the Tariff Board, hut in these resolutions the Government is deliberately seeking to transfer responsibility. Over and over* again, like a refrain, the resolutions repeat the phrase, &#34; As is determined by the Tariff Board.&#34; The powers . contained in our Customs legislation are now about to be considerably &#39; widened, and it is all the more urgently necessary that every safeguard which Parliament has applied, or can apply, shall be maintained or provided. However, all are being swept away, and the Tariff Board is being made the absolute authority. </para>

                <para>I do not propose to deal with the main issue. Unfortunately, Protection is the policy of this country, and, in the circumstances, I do not see why there should not be some form of control over any and every factor which may tend to militate against the success of Australian industries. As for the Anti-Dumping Act itself, it is a necessary adjunct of the Customs Act. I cannot support the resolutions, for the reasons which I have endeavoured very seriously to stress, namely, that they propose to transfer Ministerial responsibility to the Tariff Board. </para>

                    <para>.-The honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wise)</inline> and the honorable member for Nepean <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bowden)</inline> have raised the question of the transfer of Ministerial responsibility. In the parent Act, and right through the Customs Tariff, responsibility is specifically placed on the shoulders of the Minister. That is a policy by which the Government stand firmly to-day. I have always been a strong advocate of Ministerial responsibility. The only occasion on which the Government have departed from that policy, in connexion with Customs laws, is with respect to the particular amendments contained in these resolutions. In ascertaining the proper percentage to be added, a maximum is fixed ; but it is undesirable to have trade held up. As honorable members know, trade and commerce cover hundreds and hundreds of items, and it is particularly desirable that decisions should be arrived at with the utmost despatch, so that the operations of traders may not be held up. In view of the fact that the Minister is not always to be reached with expedition, the Tariff Board was deliberately invested with this particular power in these matters only, the sole object being to avoid delay in releasing goods for commercial purposes. There was no desire to avoid Ministerial responsibility. However.. I am not very keen on the matter, and if it be the general desire of the Committee to restore Ministerial responsibility in these cases I am prepared to accept an amendment in that direction. </para>

The honorable members for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse)</inline> and for Nepean <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bowden)</inline> complain that in order to protect a certain industry the duty has been raised from 5 per cent, to 20 per cent., but we are told by the Minister that even 20 per cent, wall not save the hop industry, and we do not know that some other industry may not be assailed some other day to such an extent that a 20 per cent, duty will not be sufficient to protect it. The Minister has intimated that if there is a consensus of opinion in the Committee that the power, proposed to &#34;be given, to the Tariff Board should rest with the Minister, he is prepared to bow to that opinion, and in the circumstances I see no reason for fixing the limit at 20 per cent. I would be prepared to give the Minister, acting on the advice of the Tariff Board, power to impose an embargo on all importations likely to cripple Australian industries, as we are told the hop-growing industry may be killed. </para>

                        <para>- But that would be nothing, so long as it meant the saving of an Australian industry. Why should the Minister hesitate about affording reasonable protection to the people engaged in an Australian industry? I am sure that the Minister, acting on the advice of the Tariff Board, would not be anxious to play ducks and drakes with the general community. Why should we set up a Tariff Board if we cannot trust them to take a hand in protecting Australian products against the danger of being flooded by imported goods, dumped here for the purpose of knocking out Australian industries? If we pass the motion submitted to-day, and the Tariff Board remains inactive while Parliament, is in recess, or while the elections are being held, it is quite reasonable to anticipate from the abnormal conditions existing in the world to-day that during the interval most important Australian industries could be knocked out. The embargo against the importation of German goods has been removed, and in the absence of German consuls or consular agents we know nothing, of what is taking place in Germany. I have no desire to be always dragging down the British people, but ever since the Armistice was signed &#34;big business&#34; has been going on between Britishers and Germans, and I have no hesitation whatever in saying that long -before the embargo was removed German goods wholly or partly manufactured in Germany were coming into Australia in large quantities in British bottoms. </para>

                        <para>- They may be, but to a very limited extent in comparison with the quantity of goods supplied to Russia in pre-war days. The industries of Germany, with the exception of those upon the slice of territory of which the country has been deprived, remained intact during the war, and the organization of the country is even better to-day than it was in pre-war time. The factories are working at top speed day and night, and where are the goods going? Australia is getting her proportion of them, and that proportion will be larger now that the embargo has been removed. I believe this will spell disaster to Australian industry unless we are1 prepared to give greater power to the Minister for Trade and Customs and the Tariff Board than is proposed to be given in the motion submitted by the Minister to-day. For that reason I would like to see the limit of 20 per cent, omitted until, at any rate, the new Parliament meets. </para>

                    <para>. -  Speaking generally, I agree with the motion submitted by the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers&#34;),</inline> except in regard to the point raised by the honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wise),</inline> upon which I am disposed to think the Minister will favorably entertain an amendment. It is obvious to those who glance at the Tariff Board Act and the Customs Tariff (Industries Preservation) Act that Parliament deliberately declared that the responsibility was not to be shifted from the Minister to the Tariff Board. Nearly every section in the latter St&#39;atute provides for decision by the Minister if he is satisfied after inquiry and report by the Tariff Board. The Board itself is regarded in the light of an advisory Board, and the responsibility is ultimately placed upon the Minister. Obviously this Parliament desired that the responsible party should be in this Chamber. Although the Minister has endeavoured to qualify the position a little, I strongly urge honorable members to adhere to the policy laid down in the Industries Preservation Act, so that we may continue the link of responsibility resting upon the Minister himself. I believe that the honorable member for Gippsland is prepared to submit an amendment to that effect, which will be favorably entertained by the Minister. </para>

                <para>I have glanced through the clauses of the motion, but they are difficult to comprehend without a careful study. . When we passed our anti-dumping legislation we were desirous that it should be effective, but experience has shown it to be completely ineffective by reason of the extraordinary depreciation that has taken place in die currency of Germany and other countries. The Industries Preservation Act when passed through this House was based on an exchange rate of 240 marks to the &#163;1, but the mark has  since  depreciated to something like 7,000 to the &#163;1, and the maximum anti-dumping duty of 75 per cent, has become completely useless. To-day the anti-dumping law is a mere sham. As I understand the motion before the Committee, it will operate in this way: I can make the meaning clear by using an example. If the German invoice price was &#163;100, the f.o.b. charges &#163;5, the freight &#163;10, and the duty at 40 per cent., &#163;44, the total landed cost in Australia would be &#163;159. Suppose that the same class of goods manufactured in Australia cost &#163;200, the difference in price between the imported and the local article would be &#163;41. In order to put the imported and the Australian goods on practically the same level, with a little margin in favour of the local article, it is proposed that the Department shall be at liberty to impose a duty not merely on the &#163;100, the cost at the port of export, but on the &#163;100, plus the difference or dumping duty of &#163;41, so that the duty would be charged on &#163;141. That would give the Australian manufacturer a show, and make our Protectionist policy effective. A duty of 75 per cent, is of no use when  it  is practically wiped out by the depreciation of currency in the country of export. Therefore, some discretion must be allowed to the Minister, and the discretion proposed will permit him to charge as a dumping duty the difference between the landed cost and the fair market wholesale price of the locally-made article. This is one of those elastic provisions which will enable our policy of Protection to be  made effective by having regard to the fluctuations which are daily or monthly taking place in other countries. That it is an extraordinary sort of legislation I admit, but it must be extraordinary in order to deal with the abnormal conditions of trade throughout the world. Anti-dumping legislation is nothing new; it exists in the United States, Canada, and in other countries, but it is useless &#39;to have a nominal anti-dumping duty; if we believe in the principle, we must make it effective. Therefore, I think every true Protectionist will realize that the extraordinary condition of the world&#39;s trade warrants the adoption of this most unusual legislation. </para>

                        <para>- These goods do undercut the locally-produced article. I have used as an illustration foreign goods landed in Australia at a cost of &#163;159. Having regard to Australian working conditions and wages, the same article cannot be produced locally under &#163;200. Of course, in ordinary times there would not be such a vast difference in the costs of production. The disparity is due to the abnormal depreciation of the mark from a par value of 20 to the &#163;1 to a present value of 7,000 for the &#163;1 sterling. We cannot permit German manufacturers with all the advantages of this depreciated currency in their favour to dump their goods into Australia, and so deal a crushing blow at our own industries. This phase is only temporary, and the scheme before the Committee is not cast iron. In that respect it differs from the original legislation submitted last year, which provided for a graduated scale of duties, increasing or decreasing according to the fluctuations of the depreciated currency. The same rigid provisions would not be practicable now because of the abnormal extent to which German and other currency has depreciated. </para>

In other words, if an imported article does not under-cut the local article, what is the need for anti-dumping legislation? </para>

When I was Minister for Customs, innumerable instances came under my notice when, after the local markets in and adjacent to the country of origin had been supplied at ordinary prices, the excess was disposed of to Australia and other countries at prices 20 to 50 per cent. and more lower than the ordinary market price in the country of origin. </para>

                        <para>- Clearly so; and that is what the Minister meant. I therefore, think that it is wise for  the Minister, in view of our experience, to introduce those clauses and make the Anti-dumping Act effective. I have pleasure in supporting the proposals before the Chair, but at the same time I urge that the point raised by the honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wise)</inline> as to the restoration of the responsibility of the Minister should be met by way of amendment. </para>

                    <para>.- Two instances were brought under my notice by a manufacturer of leather goods, which showed that the steps we have taken to preserve our industries have not, so far, been effective. He was shown by a retailer of leather bags an imported article, which evidently was of German origin, but which purported to come from Great Britain. That article cost the  retailer  6s. 6d., and the manufacturer to whom I was speaking told me that that bag could not be made here at less than 8s. 6d. or 9s. The 6s. 6d., of course, included the 35 per cent. preferential duty. The second line that the manufacturer brought under my notice was one of purses, which are coming into the hands of the retailer here from Great Britain at 13s. a dozen, but which, I was assured, it was quite impossible to turn out here at less than 21s. </para>

                    <para>.  - I do not propose following the example of one or two honorable members, who make these proposals the basis of a discussion at large on the question of Protection <inline font-style="italic">versus</inline> Free Trade. I agree with the honorable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mathews),</inline> that when the Government first accepted the principle of anti-dumping we expected, and our expectations have been realized, that an amendment would be necessary to make the legislation effective. I think it is unquestionably true that, as a result of our experience, any duty, whether it be an anti-dumping duty or of another character, if it is imposed indiscriminately in the hope of satisfying the manufacturer, will prove to that extent abortive. A manufacturer, if he is regardless of the price to be paid by the consuming public, as he will be if he gets all the Protection he seeks, is never satisfied, no matter how high the duty may be, and the public, naturally, are not satisfied if they find that the price is unduly inflated as a result of the protective duty. Protection is not everything, either to my party or to me personally. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> says that it is not a question of Protection, but a question of legislation for the prevention of dumping. But in principle it is a question of Protection, and it is Protection superimposed on Protection. I join heartily with those who stand for the preservation of Australian industries against unfair competition from whatever source that competition comes. I must admit that I would not like entirely to be associated with the views expressed by the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse),</inline> though he was good enough to applaud something I had said in the House. </para>

                        <para>- I have heard it argued this afternoon that a . certain industry is threatened, and the Minister himself, in connexion with the hop industry, has declared that he has to admit that the protection which we propose for it is quite inadequate to protect it from American competition. In other words, the Minister says that the position is almost hopeless unless, as it seems to me, it is met by a bold policy of prohibition. The suggestion seems to be that we&#39; must prohibit the consumers of - hops from using any kind of hops except Australian-grown hops. Surely it will not be denied that that clearly is the attitude of some honorable members in this House? I listened to them carefully, and that is .the only meaning that their words will bear. All I can say is that I must not be expected to support a policy of futility of that kind. There must be some kind of self-reliance, some self-respect, in the people of this country to enable them to make or grow an article which will have some qualities to make it stand on its own merits as against commodities from abroad, especially having regard to the well-known fact that We enjoy a great deal of natural protection by reason of our distance from other competing countries. </para>

                        <para>- I am not concerned with the prohibitionists, who would hand the people of this country over to the tender mercies of subsidized manufacturers, or with those friends of mine of the Country party who loudly proclaim their adhesion to the policy of Free Trade until it affects some commodity in which they are interested in the paddock where they happen to have their crops sown. I am favorable to neither of these two sections. I certainly do not overlook the fact that no person can conscientiously demand a reduction in the cost of living and, at the same time, apply subsidies without discrimination to manufacturers in this or any other country. , We have to consider human nature; and so long as the people are subsidized by the State to raise prices, prices will be raised. </para>

                <para>Coming more immediately to the proposal of the Minister, which is directed to the principle of anti-dumping, I accept it, as explained by other honorable members, and particularly by the honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert Best),</inline> who, with some lucidity, went into the whole matter. Whatever the disturbing factors may be on the other side of the world, whether in Germany, or any other country, and I hope we are not at present looking at this question from the point of view that we are dealing with a so-called enemy country, or late enemy country, but merely as an economic problem. I quite accept the principle that if people are enabled to manufacture goods abroad, and dump them into this country in unjust competition with our manufacturers, they should not be permitted to take advantage of such conditions as would probably have the effect of destroying industries which could not be resuscitated in normal times, or, at any rate, not without difficulty and loss. I join with those who think that this should be a Ministerial responsibility, rather than -.a responsibility of the Tariff Board. I ask the Minister, however, and his Board, to see that this anti-dumping legislation is conscientiously applied as against dumping. I have a number of figures before me which seem to suggest that the anti-dumping duty is imposed under circumstances where there is no unjust competition in this country at all. I do not wish to go into details. The Minister has been good enough to hear my representations on the point in a perfectly proper way, and I have also made representations in this House. It seems to me from certain figures with which I have been supplied that in particular oases this duty is superimposed on goods not in unjust competition here, goods which are being sold at a price that could not unjustly compete. The figures in many of the cases, I believe, are before the Tariff Board. I certainly hope that the Act will be administered without any unfriendly feeling against any people. It has to be remembered that if we are going to apply this duty in a spirit of prejudice against other nations, that must re-act on ourselves. I am not pleading the cause of other people, but the cause of those who, believing, and I hope justly, that this legislation will be applied with meticulous justice, have entered into trade relations with other countries, and who, I am sorry to say, complain that, apparently, the duty is not fairly imposed. I do not object to the principle of the proposal, but accept it as proper, and I only hope and trust (that the Board will faithfully carry out its functions, and that the Minister will see that the duties are applied, after the closest investigation only so far as may be necessary to meet abnormal conditions and to prevent unfair competition detrimental to the industries of Australia. </para>

                <para class="block">That is a serious power to give. While we should protect our own&#39; manufacturers, we should also protect the general public. An importer, if he is a good business man, must know the cost of the goods which he is importing, so that he may be able to sell them in advance of arrival, and he needs some guarantee that the duty he will have to pay on them will be at a fixed rate, based on information which he is able to supply, otherwise he will add an amount to cover this risk, and the consumer will have to pay it. If he cannot supply correct information, he must suffer; but if he submits fair and reasonable evidence of cost, he should not be penalized. I do not wish to encourage dumping, but I think that where there is proper, honest, straightforward, business method, the importer should be able to ascertain in advance what duty he will have to pay, and thus be enabled to sell to the public at a reasonable profit. If the Minister cannot satisfy me on this point, I shall move an amendment later. I would substitute for the provision in paragraph 5 of the motion this provision - </para>

The honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mowilliams)</inline> spoke of the brewers as being very highly protected, but he forgot that there are very high Excise duties on beer. A very large revenue comes from the duties on the beer brewed in Australia. </para>

The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> said in his speech, and has just repeated in an interjection, that hops are cheaper to the brewers since the duty waa imposed on imported hops. The honorable member may be right so far as a section  of the brewers is concerned, but what he says does not apply to all of them. </para>

                    <para>Those Tasmanian hop-growers who are interested in what is known as the Tasmanian Hop Pool, finding their sales of hops slow, have started an agitation to secure still further Protection from the Federal Government. Their executive has been in close contact with the authorities. While, so far, nothing definite has been announced, we see that the Minister for Trade and Customs, in answer to a query in the Federal Parliament, said, &#34; The Government are giving consideration to the question of further safeguarding the hop industry.&#34; </para>
                    <para>It, therefore, behoves every brewer in Australia to take active steps to combat a move directly opposed to their interests, and which has no sound economic basis, as the existing duty, plus freight, insurance, and exchange, is quite sufficient protection to the industry. The present move is only being made with a view to obtaining Government aid to maintain a high price at the brewers&#39; expense. </para>

                <para class="block">America has &#34; gone dry.&#34; If all the hops now grown in that country were &#34; dumped &#34; into Australia, the supplies would not last us for a great number of years. Americans will not continue to produce something for which there is not a ready sale. What is the use of our passing temporary laws when American hops will not be importable in a few years? In Tasmania, at present, there is at least one firm which is building storage capacity for the hops which it has not yet sold. It intends not only to house this season&#39;s hops, but some of last year&#39;s also. SinceKalgoorlie brewers are being compelled to pay 10s. to 12s. per lb. for their hops, it is clear that somebody is getting a bit more than he is entitled to earn out of the Australian hop industry. </para>

In every matter with which the Tariff Board has to deal, the Minister for Trade and Customs has the last word. That is, in itself, a safeguard.

                    <para>.- The resolutions provide that when goods are being dumped into Australia at less than the home cost of the commodities, certain action shall be taken. Will not an enormous amount of expensive investigation be involved in ascertaining home consumption cost? How can the Government or the Tariff Board learn whether imported goods are being sold here at less than the cost in the country of production ? </para>

                    <para>.- The Tariff Board has been actively engaged in investigating Australian industries. It has made certain inquiries and presented a number of recommendations. It has been impressed with the fact that some of our industries are in danger owing to the dumping of foreign products. The hop industry is one of those which has been imperilled by the importation of foreign produce. A man who has put his money into land on which to grow hops has as much right to be protected as another who has put his money into machinery. If Tasmanian growers cannot sell last season&#39;s hops because of the dumping into the Commonwealth of American-grown hops, it is the duty of the Government to afford the Australian industry adequate protection. If Australian brewers insist on using American hops, what right have they to look to the Australian market for the consumption of their protected products? Why do they not try to get Americans to drink their beer? I have the utmost confidence in the Tariff Board; but, although its members are practical men in full sympathy with Australian industries, they  have not the power to do anything to help them. After they have investigated anomalies they make a recommendation to the Minister, and, very properly, he must accept the responsibility. I regret the fact that this motion has not been brought on earlier. Tasmanian hop-growers are almost ruined. They cannot get payment for last season&#39;s crop, and do not know whether to put in any further crops. </para>

                    <para>.- In supporting the motion, I take the opportunity of pointing out the unfortunate position in which the brewers have placed the hop-growers. When I spoke last session to the first item of the Tariff, I said that there would be many peculiar divisions : that we would find honorable members voting for duties on items manufactured in their own electorates, and asking for the removal of duties upon raw materials which were produced in other parts of Australia. We all know that this happened. Now we find the brewers, with a highly-protected industry, trying to get their hops at less than a fair value. I am informed by the honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mcwilliams&#39;)</inline> that the brewers are importing from California the very same sort of hops that they are refusing to buy from Tasmania for some reason best known to themselves, and certainly not known to the hop growers. There are many hundreds of people engaged in picking hops during the season, and they find it a most remunerative employment, so that the hop-growing industry is fairly important. I am opposed to any Combine which is acting unfairly. One that will by means of better organization make things easier for . the consumer is a benefit to the community; but I am utterly opposed to any Combine which is out to raise prices. </para>

                        <para>- I quite agree with the honorable member. At any rate, if the brewers persist in their present attitude I would be in favour of prohibiting the importation of hops, in order to show that this Parliament stands for the preservation of Australian industries. We were fortunate enough to succeed in securing a prohibition of the importation of carbide. It meant the saving of an Australian industry. </para>

                        <para>- I am absolutely certain that they do. There has recently been a reduction in the p&#39;rice of carbide manufactured in Tasmania, and the management assure me that before very long there will be a further reduction. They say that very shortly they will not care whether the prohibition is continued or not, so long as there is a fair duty. During the war the price of carbide rose considerably, even as high as &#163;112 per ton. The very day on which the House was discussing the matter imported carbide on which a duty of &#163;10 a ton had been paid was being offered for sale at &#163;23 per ton, whereas the same article was being sold in New Zealand, where it is allowed free entry, at &#163;40 per ton. </para>

                <para class="block">The industry has been stabilized through the action&#39; of the Government in agreeing to place an embargo upon importations, and the people of Australia are getting the best carbide in the world. It is an entirely Australian product, and was one of the first industries to he established in Tasmania after the hydro-electric scheme was installed. It employs 150 men directly at the works, and I believe that in the near future the number will be increased to 250, because at the present time additional plant is being provided. I mention this matter to indicate what might be done if the Government saw fit to prohibit the importation of hops. If it is a question of whether an industry is to survive through the prohibition of imports, I shall vote for it, and I sincerely trust that this Committee will do so, not only in regard to hops, but also in regard to any other industry suffering at the present time from dumping or other unfair tactics. </para>

            <para class="block">The question of the elimination of competition, referred to by the honorable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corser),</inline> does not arise except in the case of Germany and Austria, the only two countries with currencies depreciated beyond the one-twelfth margin provided for in the Act. In fact, of these two we get goods only from Germany. Therefore, beyond the ordinary measure of protection afforded by the Customs Tariff, competition is available from practically every part of the world, subject only to our Tariff, and the added protection which is afforded by sections 4 and 5 of the Industries Preservation Act relating to dumping at reduced prices for export and to dumping below cost, and the provision, in the case of goods on consignment, contained in section 6. Competition is open and free as between Britain and the other Dominions, subject only to these restrictions, and there is nothing real in the argument advanced by the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse)</inline> that we are attempting to prevent competition. The honorable member, who told a most mournful tale, expressed the view that the present proposal was but another &#34; plaster &#34; which was designed to stop up any &#34; holes &#34; through which goods could enter Australia. This country has rightly or wrongly fixed a margin of protection; that is not increased by lie motion I have submitted to-day. The purpose of the motion is simply to safeguard the protection already afforded to meet cases where there is unfair competition, particularly owing to depreciation in the exchange value of the currency of any country. Without these safeguards our national policy of Protection would be rendered of no avail, and if we permitted this, it would be criminal neglect on our part. Exchange dumping provisions will apply only to countries where there is a depreciation of currency. Dumping below costs provisions apply in the case of any country, irrespective of the value of its currency, in the world&#39;s finance. </para>

There should be no long interval during which that condition of affairs might arise, resulting in an inrush of goods in the absence of machinery for the protection of local industry. &#34;We cannot do wrong in making provision for a contingency of that character.

                <para class="block">This motion is necessary to give effect to the announcement made by the Treasurer in his Budget speech relating to the substitution of the payment of a bounty for the duty at present imposed on these iron and steel products. It is quite unnecessary for me to repeat the arguments I used when dealing with the previous measure. The aim is to give to the manufacturers a bounty equal, as far as is mathematically possible, to the duty which has been removed. The matter has been investigated carefully by the Tariff Board after consultation with the representatives of the industries affected. While the substitution of the bounty may not be quite what the manufacturers would like, it is generally agreed, I think, that the measure of protection afforded by the bounty - that is the actual degree of protection - will be equal to that previously enjoyed under the duty. The question as to which may be the preferable was not gone into as between the Board and manufacturers at the recent interview to which I have referred. It was no part of the Board&#39;s business, of course, to examine that phase as the policy had been determined; all that was necessary was to satisfy the manufacturers that the bounty would be at least an equivalent of the duty. </para>

                        <para>- We are not now discussing the policy, but the actual amount of the bounty which is to displace the duty. This is a computation and calculation in which, I take it, honorable members are not as keenly interested as are the manufacturers affected. The Committee is now asked to provide a bounty in place of the duty, and it is for the Tariff Board and the Customs staff to examine the proposals actuarially and provide an equivalent. All that has been done, and I ask the Committee to accept the assurance that the Tariff Board and the officers of the Department have most carefully computed the bounty. </para>

                        <para>- At any rate, it is evident that this proposal is made in view of the forthcoming election, and in order to placate, as far as possible, country interests. That is a fact which it is of no use attempting to disguise. The Minister has assured us that the bounty will be at least an equivalent of the duty now in operation, and a similar assurance has, I understand, been given by the Tariff Board to the industries concerned. However that may be, I do not wish the impression to go forth that the subsidiary industries which depend on iron and steel are satisfied with what is being done, because if I am guided by reports of the meetings of those interested, the contrary is the case. They say that a duty is preferable, because it is fixed, and, stability being thus given, there is some encouragement to enter upon the industry. A bounty is quite a different matter, for it presents no certainty, seeing that it may be removed at any moment. All that can be said in favour of the bounty - and this is why a bounty is proposed - is that it will, perhaps, relieve to a certain extent the people in the country districts and make the general taxpayers bear the burden. </para>

                        <para>- And I repeat it now. All the evidence to be obtained in England goes to show that at the very period when these cheap goods were coming into Australia in large quantities, and our industries began to languish, there were1,000,000 unemployed in Great Britain. The furnaces were out at the works at Home, and very few men were working at the time; and yet more finished iron and steel goods were coming from Great Britain than formerly. Here we haveprima <inline font-style="italic">facie</inline> evidence of something wrong. We are told by people who know that at this particular time, blooms, rods, bars, and so forth, were being imported from Belgium and Germany into Great Britain, where they received the finishing touches. These goods naturally came to us as British goods. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know what the inquiries reveal, and I am stating the position as I understand it from the inquiries I have made. Of course, honorable members are at a considerable disadvantage in not having at their disposal sources of information in different parts of the world, such as are available to the Government. The present Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> when Minister for Customs, told us that he had agencies through which he could obtain information at very short notice from every country in the world. Honorable members on the other hand have to piece together as best they can reports and information which come to hand from time to time, and it would be difficult, indeed impossible, for them to be provided with absolute proof. However, the Minister has assured us that the bounty, whatever it may be, will be at least the equivalent of the duty, and that assurance the House has practically accepted. I do not think that such a policy as that now followed is in the best interests of Australian industry; and, moreover, it is strange that it should be adopted only nine or ten months after we imposed the duty. On the eve of an election the imposition of a duty is found not to be the correct thing, and the bounty is proposed in order that the Government and their supporters may convey the idea that they are helping their country constituents. </para>

                    <para>That, in  accordance  with the  provisions of  the  Commonwealth  Public Works  Committee  Act 1913-21, the  following  work be referred to the  Parliamentary Standing Committee on  Public Works for their  investigation  and report  thereon: - Erection  of  building  in Brisbane for taxation and other  Commonwealth purposes. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">This proposal is to utilize the valuable vacant land situated in the centre of Brisbane, the property of the Commonwealth, by erection thereon of a suitable building to be occupied by local branches of Commonwealth Departments. The utilization of this land was the subject of a report by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works last year. Under that report the Committee recommended donation of a portion of the land towards the formation, in association with the State Government and the municipality of Brisbane, of a soldiers&#39; memorial square; donation of this land has accordingly been effected. In its report the Committee also referred to the necessity for erection of Government offices in Brisbane, and considered that the remainder of the land referred to would be suitable for the purpose of this office building. Similar building projects are in process of being effected in Sydney, Adelaide, and Perth, and possibly also the same will be done in the case of Melbourne. Drawings of a five story building to cover the whole area of the land having frontages to Adelaide and Ann streets and the memorial square are now submitted as required by the Act. The building obviously should be designed upon lines to conveniently provide for future expansion, and the extent to which the initial section of the work should be effected will be reported upon by the Standing Committee after evidence on the subject. The first section of the building provided by the drawings now submitted is intended to provide about  84,000  feet of effective working office space, estimated to cost about  &#163;127,000. </para>
                <para class="block">This space is considerably in excess of initial requirements, but it may be found advisable to provide a structure of this size even if portions of it may have to be let pending expansion of Commonwealth requirements. Further details of the project will be submitted in evidence to the Standing Committee during its investigations. Although it is proposed to erect a five-storied building, the Public Works Committee may consider that it would be sufficient for the present to construct, perhaps, only two-thirds of what is proposed. It is the policy of the Government to own instead of to rent the office accommodation which it requires in the capital cities. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. The building is to be erected primarily for the accommodation of taxation officers, but during the remodelling and reconstruction of the General Post Office it will give ample accommodation for the greater part of the postal operatives. </para>

                    <para>. - As the Minister says, the site on which it is proposed to erect this building is one of the most valuable in Brisbane, and lies opposite the railway station. The Public Works Committee examined it last year, and recommended it as a suitable site for taxation and other Commonwealth offices. The Committee was asked to consider at the same time a scheme for the participation by the Commonwealth in the making of a memorial square in Brisbane in remembrance of those who fell during the war. The land that the Commonwealth owns has not a very big frontage, but it has a great depth, and the Committee recommended that 15 feet should be taken off at each end to allow the streets at the front and back to be widened, and that 60 feet of the whole depth should be contributed towards the memorial square. This, however, was to be done subject to the Queensland Government giving up a block of adjoining land, and to the municipality of Brisbane carrying out the necessary alterations. </para>

                        <para>- There was a certain amount of opposition to the project, and unless we are definitely informed that the conditions have been accepted, I shall oppose it. The making of the memorial square is rather an ambitious thing. It is estimated to cost &#163;250,000, of which I believe only &#163;5,000 or &#163;6,000 is yet in hand. The Government should be careful not to proceed with this work until the State Government and the Brisbane Municipal Council have signified their intention of doing their part under the agreement. </para>

                    <para>.- I am pleased to know that so large a building is about to be erected on one of the finest sites in Brisbane. I have no doubt that the accommodation which it will provide is absolutely needed, and a great city like Brisbane deserves a magnificent public building. But, when a proposal like this is brought before the House, honorable members should have time to study it. I see a number of blue prints on the table. We should have time to study them and to make up our minds about the general suitability of the design - the details, of course, are matters for the architects - before agreeing to the proposal. </para>

                        <para>- That may be so ; but in future more regard should be paid to beauty of design than has been done in the past. I do not suggest that we should copy any ancient buildings, such as the Doges Palace at Venice, or the Cloth Hall at Ypres. Nor do I suggest that we should copy some of the very beautiful modern buildings, although their lines might be studied with advantage. </para>

                        <para>- I hope that by that expression the Minister does not mean merely the largest. I have seen very large buildings in the world which are by no means beautiful. As the Commonwealth has now obtained possession of one of the finest sites in Brisbane, and is going to spend a large sum of money on the erection of a building there, that building should be made &#34; a thing of, beauty and a joy for ever&#34;; and I hope that the honorable member for Melbourne Ports and his fellow members of the Public Works Committee may be able to satisfy the House that that will be the case if we agree to the proposal. </para>

                        <para>- No. But this is an opportunity to draw attention to the extremely unsatisfactory position of matters in connexion with the erection of buildings to be used by the Commonwealth Bank authorities. It is extraordinary that, after the Government had brought forward a proposal, and Parliament had submitted it for the investigation of the Public Works Committee, and after that Committee had reported in favour of it, the Manager of the Commonwealth Bank should be able, without consulting anybody, to put everything on one side, and erect a totally different building than that proposed. </para>

                        <para>- In attempting to prevent political patronage we have opened the way to patronage which is more dangerous and more expensive. I do not think it can be laid at the doors of this Parliament that many of its members have exercised political patronage improperly. At present, the Manager of the Commonwealth Bank has too much power for any one man. He should not be at liberty to put up whatever buildings he likes, employing a staff of architects outside the Public Service to prepare designs for them. That seems to me very improper. </para>

                    <para>. - I can assure the honorable member in that direction. This Bill provides for the payment of bounties in respect of the steel products which have been placed under lower rates of duty, or in some cases made duty free, if of British origin. It further provides that the measure shall operate simultaneously with the removal of duties upon the steel products indicated, so that no advantage may be lost by Australian manufacturers. Special safeguards are included. Manufacturers will be required, for example, to provide evidence that their works have made reasonable efforts to  cope  with the Australian demand, and that they have complied with necessary industrial conditions. These provisions are similar to those contained in the Iron and Steel Bounty Act 1918. Consumers are safeguarded by the specific provision that, if the products are not placed on the market at reasonable prices, the bounty may be withheld. Employees are safeguarded by the provision that, if reasonable conditions with respect to wages and the like are not complied with, the bounty may be withheld. The raw material must be Australian, or the bounty will not be paid. The sole exception in that respect has to do with the possibility of an insufficiency of the supply of the Australian raw material. If the Minister is satisfied that such is the case, and that a partial supply of imported material is required to carry on manufacture, he may grant permission to use imported material for the time being. In all other respects the Bill provides that the bounty shall take the place of the duty. I emphasize that the rights and interests of all parties - manufacturers, employees, and consumers - are protected. </para>

After all, the application of a bounty, as against the imposition of a duty, is only a Free Trade scheme. I have been misled previously in this Parliament with regard to bounties. On the occasion in question honorable members on this side sought to  make legislative provision for the government of wages and. working conditions. We were informed, however, that the Harvester! decision forbade that course; that is to say, that it would be impossible, in an Act of Parliament, to provide specific conditions to deal with wages and working conditions. </para>

                        <para>- While Parliament was considering the application of a bounty to. the iron and steel industry, the proprietors at Lithgow sent down four of their employees to impress on members of this side of the House the fact that the unions themselves would safeguard wages and working conditions, and that there was no fear that the manufacturers would take any action detrimental to their employees. I unwillingly withdrew my opposition to the proposal, because I felt that the men associated with the industry knew their own business best. Some time afterwards, however, trouble arose between the manufacturers and their employees on this very question of wages and working conditions, and a strike resulted. This occurred during the <inline font-style="italic">regime</inline> of the Fisher Government, and the employees approached the then Minister for Trade and Customs with a request that the bounty should be withdrawn. The Minister refused, saying that he had been assured by the workers&#39; representatives that their wages and &#39; working conditions would be safeguarded by their union. Since that period the Constitution has not been altered, and I fear that a somewhat similar state of affairs may develop after this Bill has been passed. A sympathetic Government might take special care to safeguard the interests of the employees but I am not sure that the present Administration will be too keen an that direction. </para>

                        <para>- I would not expect that; but the industrial Courts to-day are &#39;not what they used to be. The viewpoint of the workers towards those tribunals has changed. The honorable member for Darling <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blakeley)</inline> only recently  delivered a strong indictment in this House against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. &#34;Justice</inline> Powers. The workers of Australia are not satisfied with  His  Honour as  President  of the Arbitration Court. I would not trust him to allocate working conditions with respect to the iron and steel industry. The decision given quite recently in the engineers&#39; award is likely to bring about further industrial unrest, and it is quite possible that Justices drawn from the same class may give similar awards. After the next election, if the Government &#39;are returned to power, there may be a very strong desire on their part to fritter away the rights of workers in the Arbitration Court to such an extent that this Tribunal may be useless to them. State Governments are already attacking Arbitration Courts. The State Government in South Australia has made a strong move in this direction. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member gives very good evidence of the support which the Government will receive from the bushrangers in the corner. A still greater attack is being made upon the system of arbitration by the Victorian Government. A strenuous attack is being made, not only with a view to increasing the hours of labour, but also with a view to a.&#39; reduction of wages. A man would be wilfully blind if he could not see this. And now, at the tail end of the session, we are asked to pass this sop to the &#34; bushrangers &#34; in the corner. It is some of the &#34;loot&#34; dropped by the burglar when the gas was turned on.. It is a proposal which has been brought in specially to placate those members in the Country party who misrepresent the farmers, and when I realize that it meets with their approval I can see very readily that it must be a disadvantage to the working section of the community, which I represent. However, although we may look askance at the Bill,  knowing thai the House has determined by a majority that certain Customs duties must go, -we are compelled to accept the measure as the best we can get, although the payment of a bounty cannot establish an industry as well as can duties, which serve to keep out imports. Notwithstanding the provisions of the Industries Preservation Act, certain conditions have arisen which render the measure absolutely inoperative and make it impossible to produce certain -commodities in Australia because of the cheap price at which they can be imported. I am compelled to accept this proposal with reluctance, and also with the knowledge that within the next twelve months the Federal Arbitration Court will be assailed. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> is probably conferring with the Premier of New South Wales a,t the present moment w&#34;ith this end in view. He has already been in consultation with, the Premier of South. Australia upon the same point. Perhaps we ought to accept the Bill, knowing that in time the workers will realize the objects which the Government and those in the corner are seeking to attain, and give them such a whack that they will not know where they are. I want the Government not to assist in the bringing down of wages or in the lengthening of hours, such as may be sought to be achieved under the conditions surrounding the payment of this bounty. </para>

                    <para>. -  I am glad that the Government have brought down this Bill as a. first instalment of a saner policy than has been adopted in the past for helping the industries of Australia, and I would like the Minister to seriously consider the question of adding &#34; sulphuric acid &#34; to the schedule. The manufacture of sulphuric acid is an industry that should be stabilized in Australia, but hitherto the Government have asked 72,000 people of the Commonwealth to bear the sole expense of establishing it. To impose upon 72,000 people out of 5,500,000 the obligation of stabilizing the manufacture of a commodity which is a national necessity is not sound legislation. The only sound policy of stabilizing it would be the payment of a bounty. It is quite an easy matter for the majority of the people to call upon 72,000 to incur the liability in this regard by the payment of a duty upon sulphur, but the others would not be so ready to vote for a heavy protective duty upon this article if they had to pay it. Therefore, I am very sincere when I ask the Government to add sulphuric acid to the schedule, particularly in view of the speech made by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> in Sydney, yesterday, when he said that he waa desirous of meeting the Corner party half-way. The right honorable gentleman is evidently anxious at this opportune time to soften the remarks which he has been accustomed to make, and nothing would show the earnestness of his intentions better than would the adding to this schedule of the words &#34; sulphuric acid.&#34; I am sure that the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> knows well from the deputations that have waited upon him in regard to this matter, and from communications he has received from different States concerning it, that sulphuric acid is a component part of superphosphates which are sp essential, not only for the great wheat-fields of Australia, but also for increasing the grass-bearing capacity of land upon which stock is fattened. It would be a shortsighted policy to impede the progress of national primary industries. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister will recognise the modesty of our request today. If we had thought that there was the slightest hope of success we would have asked him to include in this schedule all implements of production that sixty-one Tariff countries in the world place on the free list. But knowing tha sentiments of this Parliament at the present time, and having no desire to hinder the progress of legislation, we have reduced our request to the very minimum. If sulphuric acid is added to the schedule it will assist the Government very much in the forthcoming election. The Minister will very much appreciate that tip. </para>

                <para>I indorse the attitude adopted by the honorable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mathews)</inline> in regard to the necessity for issuing a regulation to safeguard the interests of those who are working in the benefited industries. If these manufacturers are to receive bounties from the Commonwealth, the Government should insure that proper conditions of labour obtain. The conditions to-day are very unsatisfactory. In regard to galvanized sheets, for instance, Lysaghts established works in the Newcastle district and imported .a number of tradesmen from the Old Country. They occupied houses which Lysaghts had built for them, and were committed to heavy obligations in connexion therewith. Recently, when on account of the closing down of the steel works the galvanized sheet works suffered, Lysaghts&#39; employees were thrown out of employment, and no other work .was obtainable. They had obligations in respect of those houses, and when they were, in a difficult corner the employer endeavoured to break down the conditions of employment and wages. The same thing has happened in regard to the steel works. In the early part of last year an effort was made to reduce wages and working conditions on account of the reduced cost of living, but since that time the cost; of living has increased, and the latest figures available from the Statistician show that in New South Wales and Victoria 32s. has only the purchasing power of &#163;1 in 1911. Queensland, where a Labour Government is in office, is in the best position of any of the States, only 28s. being required to purchase what &#163;1 would purchase in 1911. The employers in the iron industry have been endeavouring to break down the working conditions, and instead of approaching the Arbitration Court, they sought to put pressure upon the employees. I have stated before, and I repeat now, my belief that the steel works were closed down largely for the purpose of breaking down working conditions and wages. The employers thought that, on account of the large number of their employees, they could achieve their purpose quickly by throwing the workers out of employment, but they found their desire not so easy of accomplishment as they expected, and, in consequence, the works had to lie idle. Fancy the big iron and steel corporation, which has made many thousands of pounds out of the industry, immediately the slightest trouble occurred, endeavouring to get men to work for &#163;3 10s. per week when the Court had declared that &#163;4 ls. 6d., exclusive of the cost of clothing, was a living wage. Having regard to our past experience, we must be careful. Public money, in the form of bounties, is to be given, to these people, and I am glad that, in spite of the evidence outside the Chamber - including the statement of the honorable member for Corangamite <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gibson)</inline> to-day that he does not believe in arbitration - that there is a movement to destroy arbitration, the Government have recognised that principle in this measure. Clause 10 reads -  10. (1) The Minister may make application to the  President  of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration for a declaration as to what wages and conditions of employment are fair and reasonable for labour employed in the manufacture of fencing wire, galvanized sheets, traction engine&#39;s, or wire netting. </para>

                <para class="block">That is all very well if the workmen are operating under awards of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, but, so far as I know, all the industries referred to in the Bill are governed by State awards. It will be necessary, therefore, if the Minister desires to protect the workers, to add some such words as &#34; or an award of the State Arbitration Court.&#34; I know that the Broken Hill Proprietary Company has a case before a State tribunal now. That company will not come under the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, but as they are to participate in the bounty, it will be necessary for the Minister to propose some amendment that will safeguard the employees. I do not wish to give bounties to these people if they are going to sweat their employees. </para>

                    <para>.- This Bill represents a step in the right direction, inasmuch as the cost of encouraging the development of these industries will be borne in future by the whole community instead of by only one section, as in the past. I should like some information from the Minister upon one point. In the schedule galvanized sheets and fencing wire are on the same level; a bounty of &#163;2 12s. per ton is to be paid in respect of each, whereas in the Tariff the British preferential duty on wire was 52s. and on galvanized iron 72s. One naturally wonders why the two items are on the same basis in this schedule. </para>

                <para>The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> has suggested that some provision should be made to prevent the employees in these assisted industries from being sweated, and he quoted the remark of one honorable member in regard to the Arbitration Act. It is wrong to suggest that anybody who is opposed to the Arbitration Act must be in favour of sweating the workers. A man having seen the results of arbitration may honestly be opposed to its continuance, and at the same time be just as earnest as the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> in seeking to protect the employees. I hope that something will be done to insure that the employees shall reap an advantage out of this bounty, at least equal to that which will be derived by the employers. </para>

                        <para>- Whether an election is near or far, I have always, from the beginning of my political career, held exactly the same view. If the Commonwealth is to do anything to encourage manufacturers, or anybody else, there should be no distinction whatsoever in the assistance given to the different parties engaged in the industry; all must be treated alike. Therefore I agree with the contention of the Leader of the Opposition that the employees in the industries to be benefited by this Bill should be assured of a fair share of the bounty. The appropriation is not to exceed &#163;250,000. That is not a very large sum, when all is said and done, for the encouragement of industries which are producing articles absolutely necessary for the development of Australia. Fencing wire, galvanized iron, and tractors are three of the essential commodities that Australia should produce, and produce in large quantities, if we are to make the fullest use of this country, which needs development to a far greater extent and much more thoroughly than a great number of people resident in the cities realize. There is no country in the world to-day occupied by white men which is calling more loudly for development; and because this is a measure which will enable us to assist in that work, and remove those restrictions caused by the Tariff, I am personally in favour of it. </para>

                    <para>. -  I hope the Committee will now consider the Bill clause by clause. I desire, however, to refer to the two points raised by the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> and the honorable member for Robertson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fleming),</inline> and also to what was said by the honorable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mathews).</inline> In my view, the honorable member for Hunter takes too limited a view of clause 10. That clause gives the Minister power to apply to the Court for an interpretation as to wages and conditions if he so desires, but it certainly does not limit the Minister in that respect. The Minister may not move a State Wages Board or other tribunal; but he may be quite satisfied that reasonable wages and conditions are observed, and that the men have no occasion&#39; to refer to the Court. This Bill provides the machinery in the event of his requiring a determination by the Court, but, as I say, it does not limit him. </para>

But he may be satisfied, after inquiry by the Tariff Board, that reasonable wages and conditions are already observed, and that, therefore, there is no necessity to go to the Court. Referring to the question as to the rate of bounty on galvanized sheets, I think that the honorable member for Robertson has overlooked the fact that it is proposed to continue the duty of 20s. in the  case of galvanized iron sheets, and that, plus the bounty, provides the full measure of protection. </para>

                        <para>- At any rate, the Minister said that the Minister, under the Bill, was not permitted to apply to a State Court, and, if that be so, I see a great weakness in the measure. Looking over the schedule, I can only find the products of three industries that will be governed by a Federal arbitration award; all the other items being governed by the State Courts. I believe that it is the intention of the Government and the Minister to protect the workers, and to give them an assurance that such a desire exists; but if the amendment suggested by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> is accepted, I believe it will make the measure a better one. I listened with interest to the speech by the honorable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mathews)</inline> on the general question of&#39; arbitration. I may say that I have been twitted with changing my opinions on this question, hut that I have never done. I worked in an industry before arbitration was inaugurated, and I . was a member not only of the committee in Western Australia that framed the first Arbitration Act for that State, but also of the committee that framed amendments to that Act. I am as strong a believer in arbitration to-day as I have ever been. Arbitration has done a great amount of good in certain industries to which it has been applied, but my belief is that the greatest harm to employees and employers alike, so far as the settlement of industrial differences is concerned, has resulted not altogether by reason of faults in the. Court, but by reason of undue interference by both State and Federal Governments. Our idea of arbitration was that those concerned in a dispute should meet at a round-table conference and settle all the points that it was possible for such a conference to settle. We thought that it would then remain only for them to go to the Court for a settlement of the points on which they were still in disagreement, and that on the decision of the Court an award would be given. That was the arbitration we all looted for, and we know that such a system has done much, not only for the settlement, but for the prevention of disputes. There is no monopoly on any side of politics in the desire, not only to settle such troubles, but to prevent them, and, as I say, the greatest harm has been done by the mischievous intervention of Governments. </para>

What is required is a settlement of the question of what are State functions, and what are Federal functions, and then the functions of the State and Federal Courts can be decided. In this Bill, however, the Minister is not giving himself, or any one on his behalf, any right to approach the Courts, in order to see that the workers are protected. </para>

                    <para>. - I am more suspicious than ever of this measure, when I see the Minister receiving, if not the heartiest support of the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse),</inline> at any rate, the blessing of that gentleman. This, apart from any other fact within my knowledge, drives me to The conclusion that while this boun&#39;ty may do a little good in a certain way, it will certainly not be more beneficial than is a protective duty. I have here a quotation from the speech delivered in this House on 9th June, 1921, on the item of wire netting, when the Tariff was being discussed. On that occasion, the honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> said that the industry should be protected by a bounty. The present Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene),</inline> who was then Minister for Trade and Customs, gave rather an extended reply to the honorable member for Dampier, and finished his speech with these words - </para>

                    <para>When an industry has been definitely established I do not think that the payment of a bounty is the right way in which to assist it. Of course, a bounty may sometimes be usefully employed to build up an industry in its earlier stages. The proposal to grant a bounty for this particular purpose would, if the duties were arranged in the manner suggested by the &#39;honorable member, entirely close up the smaller manufacturers of wire-netting. They would find it impossible to operate. I gave careful consideration during the luncheon hour to the question as to whether it would be possible to substitute, either in part or in whole, a bounty for this duty, and have come to the conclusion that it is practically impossible to do so. </para>

The Single Purpose League&#39;s pamphlet has been sent to every member of the Committee, including the Minister in charge of the Bill, and he has also received a copy of his colleague&#39;s speech on the subject of protective duties <inline font-style="italic">versus</inline> bounties, in which it is definitely asserted that bounties are of no use for the purposes for which the Government now proposes to grant them. </para>

                    <para>The Australian Industries Protection League emphatically protests against the proposals of the Commonwealth Government, as announced in the Federal Treasurer&#39;s Budget speech, to substitute bounties for the protective duties recently enacted in respect of certain industries, on the ground that the league believes that a Protective Tariff is essential to the industrial development of Australia, and it considers that, if the dangerous precedent of cancelling protective duties and substituting bounties in the interests of special sections of the community be once established, manufacturers generally will lose that sense of security in the validity of Customs laws which is indispensable, not only to the extension and enlargement of existing industrial establishments, but also to the initiation of new manufacturing enterprises. </para>

                <para>Those are sentiments with which I am in accord. Knowing your&#39; fiscal faith, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> I am sure that were you in my position you would as strongly denounce the attitude of the Minister as I have done. Although I cannot bring the&#39; blush of shame to the cheeks of those who are so inconsistent, I hope that what I have said will draw the attention of people outside to their inconsistency. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not intend now to debate the subject of arbitration, though I hope that the occasion will come when I shall be able to speak on it at considerable length; I propose now to discuss the exception taken by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> to the language of clause 10. I think that the honorable member was justified in much that he said. The clause is anomalous, and it is difficult to say how far it will be effective. It gives the Minister power to apply to the Arbitration Court to obtain a declaration respecting the fairness of wages and conditions, but such an application might mean months of delay, even if the Court were disposed to entertain it, and in any case it would apply only to a very limited number of cases. For the most part, the industries affected by the Bill are governed by State awards. We cannot authorize the Minister to apply to a Wages Board or other State tribunal, where he would have no standing; but I think that the difficulty could be overcome. The Bill purports to say that if the Minister finds that the rates of wages or conditions of employment, or any of them, are unsatisfactory he is not bound to pay the bounty provided for, and I would suggest an additional, subclause to the effect that, should he find that the rates of wages and conditions of employment, or any of them, were below the standard rates and conditions of employment prescribed by the determination of any State Wages Board or other  industrial State tribunal, or below the rates and conditions which he himself might deem fair and reasonable, he need not pay the bounty. If the Minister cannot get any immediate guidance from the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, and if - which will be an extraordinary contingency- there is no State determination regulating wages and conditions in the industry, then, should expedition be necessary, it may be fairly left to him,, as to the best of&#39; my recollection it was left in the Act providing for a bounty on wool tops, to decline to pay the bounty. That measure left it to the Minister to satisfy himself as. to whether fair wages and conditions were being paid in the industry claiming tha bounty. </para>

                        <para>- The Wages Board system has been most successful, and we shall have to resort to it largely to put an end to the litigation which is taking place in the Arbitration Court. The hearings of cases in the Arbitration Courts are virtually trials, hostile litigation between the employer and employed, which is a regrettable state of affairs. Wages Boards, on the other hand, provide for conciliation by means of round-table conferences, and they have proved successful in every way. I think the clause with which the Leader of the Opposition has found fault is anything but satisfactory. </para>

                        <para>- I did not indicate, and had no intention to suggest, that Parliament was about to rob the country.  I  am sure honorable members would not go so far, whatever the title might propose or incorrectly imply. I merely sought to indicate that the purpose of the Bill is not, correctly described by the title. This measure represents  a. belated attempt on the part of the powers behind the throne to make up for a concession about to be granted to certain interests on the eve of an appeal to the people. </para>

                    <para>.- This clause embodies the principle underlying the Bill. It is proposed to remove the duties upon specific articles and to encourage their manufacture by the granting of a bounty. In my view, the alternative will not have the effect of encouraging industry and placing existing activities on a firmer basis. A complete change is apparent in the attitude of certain members with respect to the payment of bounties as against the principle of the imposition of duties. I have in mind, particularly, the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs).</inline> Upon nearly every occasion in the past, when a Tariff measure has been before Parliament, these members have strongly supported the- imposition of duties. Now they are forsaking their old principles, and they are complacently encouraging the Government to remove duties and pay bounties. The industries of Australia are sufficiently important for us to see that nothing  is  done here to interfere with their progress, but it has been clearly shown that the people engaged in thos&#169; industries affected by the recent remission of duties are complaining bitterly of the Government&#39;s action in replacing protective duties by the payment of a bounty. </para>

                        <para>-Like all other taxpayers I am prepared to pay my share, but the difference between honorable members of the Labour party and honorable members of the Country party is that whereas the former do not object to the payment of taxation, the latter certainly do, and, furthermore, cry out for the cheapest goods they can get, while they propose to sell their own products at the highest possible price they can wring out of the consumers of Australia. For instance, there was the attitude taken up by the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse),</inline> when an item in the Tariff affecting his own particular industry came up for discussion. </para>

                        <para>- I am strongly opposed to the principle of encouraging industries by the payment of bounties. It is an unscientific method which has never succeeded in establishing any industry. The successful way employed in all countries is that of imposing Customs duties. In any case, before I would agree to the payment of a bounty, I would, first of all, want to know that the industry was being run properly, and that the employees engaged in it were being given reasonably decent conditions. I would also want to know that the product of the industry to which a bounty was being paid was being sold to the people at a fair and reasonable price. I regret that it is impossible for me to point out these things, but it is, indeed, strange to view the attitude of many honorable members opposite, who so recently called loudly for a high Protective Tariff to save the industries of Australia, and yet are now prepared to throw overboard that policy, and sacrifice these industries for the purpose of getting a good electioneering cry. Where is this bounty to come from? It is to be taken out of the surplus revenue, that is to say, out of the Trust Fund set on one side for the purpose of providing pensions for the old and infirm people in our midst. The Government say that they cannot afford to pay increased invalid and old-age pensions, but evidently they can give  a  bounty to capitalistic firms. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that a bounty should be given in the earlier years of the existence of all these big industries, so that they may have a chance of becoming established. Ever since I have been in this Parliament I have advocated the adoption of the bounty system in preference to the exceedingly high Customs duties. Honorable members will remember when the steel industry was under consideration during the discussion of the Tariff, some of us pointed out that the placing of very high duties upon the introduction of iron and steel was handicapping kindred industries all over Australia. </para>

                        <para>- Very well; but I wish to point out that when the production of these commodities ceased in Australia the Customs duties ceased to be protective in their incidence, and became purely and simply revenue duties. As I believe a bounty system is preferable, I am prepared to give a reasonable bounty to these young industries. </para>

                    <para>.- One of the reasons for this Bill is the fact that the Government have remitted duties which brought in a revenue of &#163;350,000. Now the Government propose to pay a bounty of &#163;250,000. Thus the change of policy involves the taxpayers in a loss of &#163;600,000. Surely this Parliament is not justified in passing a Bounty Bill to keep certain industries going which have been deliberately hit by the Government&#39;s action in taking off certain Customs duties. </para>

                        <para>-  I am directing attention to the serious position from the revenue point of view. It is a big price to pay, and there has been no demand in the country to justify the manipulation of &#163;600,000 of the people&#39;s money in order to suit the Government at the forthcoming election. It is lowering to the dignity of this Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- The best way to make Australia self-contained is to impose Customs duties. Industries engaged in the manufacture of wire, wire netting, and galvanized iron cannot live under a Free Trade Tariff. It is all very well for my honorable friends in the Country party to say that the Government&#39;s proposal will give them cheap wire and cheap wire netting, but if the farmers of New Zealand wanted to get their produce into Australia in times of scarcity here my honorable friends would be up against such a proposal. Unlike honorable members of the Country party, I want a fair deal for all, for the farmer as well as for the manufacturer. I regret that the Government are proposing this step, which will be so costly to the taxpayers. </para>

                    <para>.- It amuses me to hear honorable members say, &#34; We have built up industries by Protective duties,&#34; whereas, as a matter of fact, they have been built up by the persons who have bought the machinery and other commodities produced. All that honorable members can claim is that they voted for the imposition of the duties, and they commence to object now that they are to be called upon to contribute something towards the building up of these industries. The payment of a bounty will distribute the cost of establishing an industry more evenly over the shoulders of the people of Australia, and will not confine it to one section only. </para>

                    <para>. -  I am very disappointed at the introduction of this Bounty Bill. Last week I protested against the payment of a bounty to one section of the community. I cannot see any justice in picking out sections for special treatment in this way. There is only one straightforward and legitimate method of building up industries in Australia, and that is by imposing a Tariff. When the question of affording protection to our industries was under consideration in this Parliament, a most excellent case was made out for the protection of the very industries with which we are now dealing, and I am not yet convinced that any alteration in that policy should be made. At any rate,I do not see why the taxpayers should be called upon to provide &#163;250,000 for one industry while other industries are penalized, as the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse)</inline> claims they are, by the necessity for paying Tariff duties. However, personally, I do not regard the payment of a duty as penalizing an industry. I consider that it is simply a matter of distributing the cost of building up an industry evenly over the whole community. I am not sure that a Bill which proposes to give a bounty to one section of the community while other sections have to seek their protection through the Customs Tariff is in the best interests of the community, and so long as I am a member of this Parliament I shall always endeavour to see that my attitude upon this question is consistent.. </para>

                        <para>- I am quite satisfied that if this Parliament had twelve months longer to live this Bill would never have appeared. It arises directly out of the Budget speech. &#39;Nobody can show that there has been an agitation outside of Parliament for the substitution of bounties for protective duties. This proposal is in the interests of a certain section - the outcome of a Coalition Government - and not of the general community. Nobody can deny that fencing wire was produced cheaper in Australia during the war under a Protective Tariff than anywhere else. </para>

                        <para>.- . The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> has said that if the wages and conditions are not up to the standard he thinks necessary, he may apply to the Arbitration Court for a declaration. My own opinion is that the Minister has no standing at all in the Court. We may give him authority to apply to the Court, but the Act, as administered by the Judges, will not recognise him, because he is not a party to a dispute, seeing that he is not an employer who is carrying on an industry. In my opinion, the Arbitration Act will have to be amended to give him any standing in the Court, because it speaks distinctly of a dispute between employees and an employer. Under the circumstances, ,1 do not see how the Court can be compelled to give any direction, though, of course, it may do so as an act of courtesy. This Bill cannot override the Arbitration Act. </para>

                        <para>-  Clause 10 does not apply in that case. The Minister may be satisfied with the award of a State Court. He is not compelled to go to the Arbitration Court for a declaration unless there are circumstances with which he is not satisfied. No doubt the Minister will accept a State award as the basis of .the wages and conditions. If there is no State award there will likely be an Arbitration. Court award; and if there be -neither, he will ask for a declaration from the  President  as to the fair wages and conditions. </para>

                    <para>.- I realize the difficulty that confronts the Minister in this particular clause in his endeavour to protect the interests of the men employed, seeing that at the present time none of them come under the jurisdiction of the Federal Court so far as awards are concerned. I think that the clause does give the  President  power, at the request of the Minister, to make a declaration. If there is no Federal award the  President  will satisfy himself from documents at his disposal that there is a State Wages Board or State Arbitration Court award, and in that case will declare that the conditions are right and proper. I suggest, however, that words might be inserted to provide that the Minister may apply, not only to the Federal Court, but to any State Wages Board or Arbitration Court for the information required. I do not think that the  chairman  of a State Board or Court would ever refuse such information if it were asked for. I take it that we all desire to give this protection to the workers, and we all see the difficulty that the Minister will have in going to State tribunals to get the necessary information. On second thoughts I fancy that such an amendment as I have suggested would be valueless, seeing that it would only enable us to make a request to somebody over whom we have no control in any shape or form. The clause will, I think, be a protection to employees, because I cannot assume that any  President  of the Court would not satisfy himself from official documents that the wages and conditions in any particular industry were fair and reasonable. If the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> can suggest some amendment that would give the Minister the power to go to the State Courts, I will support him, but I do not see how it can be done. </para>

                <para class="block">These provisions as set out do not limit the Minister; he may inform himself in other respects; but they determine a definite course of action that he may take. As the honorable member for Adelaide points out, most of these industries are carried on under State Wages Board awards, and the Minister may be satisfied, without reference to the  President  of the Court, with the findings of a State Tribunal. I suggest that the honorable member for Adelaide should not seek to load the clause by the addition of words he suggested, for that would give the Minister power to go to a Court which takes no cognisance of this Parliament, and over which this Parliament has no control. I submit that the clause amply provides for the information of the Minister as to wages and conditions. </para>

                        <para>- I have never said so; but the Minister wishes it to be left with the Minister who administers the Bill, without inserting words providing that State awards shall be taken into consideration. There are certain industries to-day in which, without appeal to either Federal or State Courts, conditions are imposed on the workers, because of the limitation of employment, which amounts to a reduction of existing rates of wages. The men have been compelled to &#39; accept those conditions, notwithstanding that they do not provide a living wage, and are below what have been prescribed by a State tribunal or an Arbitration Court award. But because they are working under them, the Minister, who knows nothing of the facts, may think it a sufficient reason for paying the bounty. However, it is not the desire of the people of this country that the bounty should be paid to those who are sweating their employees. I should like to see paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> made -to provide that the rates and conditions must not be below the standard rates and conditions of employment prescribed by the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, or the award of a State tribunal. The adoption of some such provision will not make it necessary for the Minister, when he wishes to inform his mind upon this subject, to apply to the Arbitration Court or to a State tribunal for a declaration; all that he will have to do will be to ascertain whether there is a State or Federal award governing the industry, and, if so, whether effect is being given to it. It will be his duty to say to applicants for the bounty, &#34; Unless you conform to the conditions, and pay the rates set out in the award governing your industry, you cannot have the bounty.&#34;  </para>

                    <para>.- The amendment does not go as far as I would like it to go, because it still leaves the discretionary power of the Minister? practically unlimited. He will be under no obligation to ascertain through the  President  of the Arbitration Court, or  from any State authority, -what are the rates of wages and conditions of employment ruling in. -an industry which makes application for the bounty. The clause says, &#34; the Minister may make application,&#34; and &#34; the Minister may withhold the whole or any part of the bounty payable.&#34; These words give the Minister a free hand to do as he pleases in the granting or withholding of a bounty. </para>

                        <para>- I have no desire to transgress, but I do wish to express the views I hold, because I do not desire my position in this matter to be misunderstood. I was saying there is a tendency on the part of certain sections of the community to repudiate and discard the system of arbitration. The Employers Federation and Chambers of Commerce throughout Australia have declared against compulsory arbitration. I share, with ether honorable members on this side, the concern and apprehension they have expressed in regard to the future of tribunals responsible for determining wages and conditions of those employed, not only in the industries covered by this Bill, but in other industries also. In South Australia we have already had an illustration of what is likely to occur. An anti-Labour Government in that State, the leader of whom is <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Newman Barwell, the coloured labour advocate, has repudiated the promise made to the people in regard to arbitration, and has grossly betrayed the workers of that State, especially the Government employees. A similar circumstance has been proven in New South Wales since the return of a Nationalist Government, and there is every reason to believe that this Nationalist Government possessing an equal desire to serve the interests of the captains of industry, will be prepared to subordinate the interests of the workers. There are two features associated with this section that must not be overlooked - firstly, the full and free discretionary powers afforded the Minister; secondly, the insecure position of industrial arbitration legislation. A very significant factor is the recent appointment of two  Deputy  Presidents to the Commonwealth Arbitration Court for two years only and not for the usual term. There should be some provision in this clause making it compulsory for the Minister to accept as the minimum wages and conditions justifying the payment of the bounty those fixed by an Arbitration Court or other tribunal. I cannot countenance such an indefinite provision as clause 10, giving the Minister such wide discretionary powers, knowing that he must be a partisan and be influenced by the political colour of those who are concerned in this measure. There are supporters of the Government who desire to abolish compulsory arbitration and return to a system of direct action. These capitalistic interests are the real fomenters of industrial unrest and dissatisfaction. </para>

                        <para>- But there is no guarantee that the same may be said iri the future. What justification can the Minister offer for refusing to accept the safeguard which I propose? I may mention that, as an outcome of certain legislation in South Australia, which was expressed as loosely as this clause, many of the workers in Government employ in that State have been actually deprived of their rights; that is to say, because the word &#34;may&#34; appears in such legislation instead of the word &#34; shall.&#34; The Minister for Trade and Customs should not be given these wide discretionary powers to determine wages and working conditions. This is a low-wage Government. Parliament should insure that the remuneration and conditions in connexion with the industries to which the proposed bounty shall apply are such&#39; as have been established by the Arbitration Court, or similar tribunals. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Makin)</inline> contends that the bounty should not be withheld if the Federal Arbitration Court or some Wages Board has decided wages and working conditions in respect of the industry which is about to enjoy this bounty. I am opposed to the distribution .of the bounty, whether awards exist or not. The position of the workers will not be improved by the addition of the words suggested by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton),</inline> or by making it mandatory on the part of the Government to take a certain course of action. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> laid emphasis on the fact that it will not be obligatory for him to take any of the steps indicated in this clause. In such circumstances its verbiage amounts to a mere overloading of the Bill, seeing that the Minister may please himself concerning what he shall do. </para>

                        <para>- The clause specifically says that the Minister &#34;may&#34; withhold the bounty. There is not one word in clause 10 which makes it obligatory for him to do anything. The Minister is only trying to catch the Leader of the Opposition with guile when he offers a concession which is &#39;no concession at all. Even if the amendment suggested by the Leader of&#39; the Opposition were adopted, the Minister would still be under no obligation to inform himself upon anything. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. i am very easily satisfied. If I had anything to do with the framing&#39; of a Bill to give bounties to people in industries, instead of requiring a certificate from the Arbitration Court or a Wages Board, I would require a certificate from the officials of the workers&#39; organization to the effect that the men employed in that business were satisfied with the conditions under which they were working. That seems to be a matter for laughter for honorable members opposite, but it surely does not appear any more ludicrous in their minds than does the suggestion to me that men should be content to work under wages and conditions dictated at the sweet will of any one who knows nothing about the industry, and has never worked in it.

The honorable member knows that a contract was signed by one of the leading lights of his party in Great Britain, Leslie Urquhart, by which &#163;50,000,000 of British capital was invested in the Caucasian Mountains. They found that it was worth while to conform to Soviet hours and conditions in order to get some return from their capital. </para>

I am not going to do what I was finding, fault with the legal fraternity for doing. I am not going to prescribe for an industry of which I know nothing. I object to members of the legal fraternity prescribing conditions for miners in Broken Hill. I would much prefer to meet the employers of any particular industry around a table, and discuss wages and conditions with them, than go into an Arbitration Court or before a Wages Board.

                        <para>- It is not &#34;pacifism,&#34; and I have never claimed to be a pacifist. My pacifism comes to light when the boss wants me to do something. When he wants me to fight, I do not want to fight with him, but against him. That is the extent of my pacifism. The whole of the paragraph is a mere camouflage. It is merely loading up the Bill with language the object of which is. to conceal or cover up the present that is being made to the Broken Hill Proprietary. Everybody knows that the Broken Hill Proprietary, who will be the particular gainers under the Act, do not pay decent wages or work their men reasonable hours. We know that they are a sweating concern, and we know also, if we pay any attention to the drift of affairs in this country, that the principal power behind the throne in governmental concerns is the steel crowd. It is the same in America, where the steel corporations are becoming such a power in the land that control by politicians is only nominal. These gentlemen in Australia are not going to be hampered by anything the Minister puts in the Bill. The Minister, if he was frank enough to admit it, would say that no Minister would do anything that would interfere with the steel works. </para>

It is rather disconcerting when a Minister who is in charge of a Bill interrupts my discourse for the purpose of asking for an explanation of an allegation, and, when I give him the information, I am pulled up. I have no wish to delay the Minister, and neither have I any wish to transgress the Standing Orders  at the present stage. Therefore, in order to &#39;allow the Minister to proceed and give his Christmas-box to his friends, I will resume my seat. </para>
