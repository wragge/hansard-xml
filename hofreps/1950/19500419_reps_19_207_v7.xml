                        <para>- I direct a question to the Minister for Health in relation to the epidemic of poliomyelitis, and the conference that was to be called of the Commonwealth And State authorities to devise means to combat that epidemic. Have arrangements yet been  made  for the conference to be held? If not will the right honorable gentleman expedite them because the epidemic is still prevalent in New South Wales and, I understand, to some degree, also in South Australia? Secondly, will he cause an authoritative statement to be issued by the Health Department in relation to suggestions made by the department that are affecting the immunization campaign against diphtheria which is commencing in New South Wales, to the effect that immunization against diphtheria makes the onset of poliomyelitis more probable? That statements is causing very great confusion, especially among parents of children who desire to have their children immunized against diphtheria. </para>

                        <para>- It has not yet been possible to arrange the conference to which the right honorable gentleman has referred, but a great deal of information has been supplied by the States, which have undertaken research in connexion with this matter, especially by South Australia and Victoria. In reply to the second part of the right honorable gentleman's question, I shall make arrangements for the issue of a statement in relation to the effects of immunization against diphtheria. Unfortunately, such a statement cannot be very authoritative as a good deal of doubt exists in relation to the matter. What the Director-General of Health said was that insofar as immunization with anti-diphtheric serum was concerned there was no question of  deletenous effects but that insofar as the mixture of anti-diphtheric and whoop.ingcought serum was concerned some question had been raised. That suggestion has been made on certain observations. I shall prepare a complete statement on the subject. </para>

                        <para>- In explanation of this question, which I address to the Minister for External Territories, I wish to state that I am aware that many exservicemen, because of the knowledge they gained whilst with the forces in New Guinea, are anxious to return to that territory in order to assist in its development. They have been prevented from doing so by lack of finance and by governmental restrictions. In view of those facts, will the Minister consider, in the light of his recent visit to New Guinea, what encouragement and assistance may be extended to exservicemen and others who wish to go to New Guinea, particularly to engage in primary production? </para>

                        <para>- As the result of my discussions and personal observations in New Guinea I came to the conclusion that there is ample scope for encouraging people, particularly returned soldiers, to go to New Guinea and engage in primary production. While I was in New Guinea I received a number of suggestions on how this should be done. I propose to take up this question with the Minister for Repatriation. I believe that certain action can be taken to develop the idea. I am satisfied that it will be a very good scheme from every point of view to encourage as many Australians as possible to go there. It will assist us to discharge our responsibilities to the natives and to maintain this area as a strategic zone. </para>

                        <para>- Will the Prime Minister state whether it is correct, as reported, that the Government intends to import coal from South Africa and India? If that report is correct, has the Government considered obtaining additional coal supplies from Queensland? The Minister for Mines has stated that Queensland can supply all the coal required or that would be imported from overseas and that the Queensland coal would not be inferior in quality to that which it is proposed to import and would be landed in southern States at no greater cost than that which would be imported from India and South Africa. Does the Prime Minister not consider that, in the interests of the Queensland coal-mining industry, it would be better to obtain coal from that State than from overseas? </para>

                        <para>- The importation of coal from overseas is being arranged by joint action by the Commonwealth and the States, particularly South Australia and Victoria. That importation is designed to secure prompt additional supplies of coal. It is in no way intended to limit the development of coal production in Australia. The Government believes .that the best coal, from Australia's point of view, is the coal that can be obtained in our own country. It is desired to obtain coal not only from New South Wales but also from every other State in the Commonwealth including Queensland. The possibility of obtaining further supplies from Queensland has not been overlooked. My relevant colleagues in the Cabinet have been in consultation on that subject and have conducted certain investigations with the Queensland authorities. Importation of coal is designed, not as a long-range policy, but as a short-range means of securing urgently needed supplies. It should not be assumed that the Government's policy is to import rather than to produce. The Government's policy, in all such matters, has been to bring about the highest possible level of production inside Australia and to resort to importation only to supplement local production when it is below the desired mark. </para>

                        <para>- I invite the attention of the Minister for National Development to the fact that severe dislocation has taken place in the shipment of apples from southern Tasmania. Two and a half million cases of fruit have been ordered from Tasmania by the United Kingdom but shipment must be effected before the 31st May. Waterside workers are making every effort that is humanly possible to handle the cargoes, but it seems that a very considerable portion of the order may be left behind. The problem is a very complex one and involves wharfs, storage sheds and other factors. Little can be done this season. It is principally a State matter, but will the right honorable gentleman, perhaps in consultation with the Minister for Fuel, Shipping and Transport, consider the situation in Tasmania with a view to his department offering advice and, if necessary, assistance before the next apple season? </para>

                        <para>- I am sure that a project of that sort would be given every possible consideration if it were referred to this Government by the Government of Tasmania, but it would be quite improper in the present constitutional situation for this Government to make the first move. I am sure that the Tasmanian Government is seised of the importance of the matter, and if it approached me I should immediately consider the problem in consultation with the Primp Minister and the Minister for Fuel, Shipping and Transport. </para>

In view of the continued added pressure of Communist organizations against British Empire interests, including the interests of the State of Pakistan, I ask whether any permit was issued by the Australian Government to allow of Thornton's visit? If so, is it not time that our national interests were protected by preventing, as far as possible, Australian traitors from attending enemy conferences overseas to our detriment? </para>

The issuing of passports is not a matter for the Department of External Affairs, but I have already had discussions with the Minister for Immigration and we are now considering the whole question of the limitations that can be imposed upon overseas visits hy Communists whom we know to be going overseas in order to advance conspiracy against this country. I am satisfied that the full extent of our powers will be used to prevent people from going overseas to engage in Communist conspiracies. </para>

Will the Minister inform the House whether his department issued a passport to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thornton?</inline> If so, in view of the many protests by members of the present Government parties when they sat in opposition against the issue of a passport to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thornton</inline> to enable him to travel overseas, did the Minister take those protests into consideration when deciding the matter? Does he consider that passports should be issued to persons who wish to go overseas in order to engage in Communist party activities, and later to use the knowledge gained while abroad to further Communist work in this country? </para>

The Minister is right in saying that a passport has a currency, but I point out that every person who wishes to leave Australia has to submit an application every time he desires to do so. He has to get his wife's permission, and, in addition, the permission of the Minister's officers, to leave the country. </para>

                        <para>- I did read an account of an explosion in an aircraft in Britain, which seemed to contain all the elements of a diabolical crime. Apparently the union believes that Communists in that organization were responsible, and it desires their expulsion. That is a most laudable desire and is something that this Government stands for, and will surely endeavour to carry out. As for communism in the Royal Australian Air Force, I do not think it exists. The morale of that organization is high, and in the only case of sabotage which has been discovered in recent months a man was tried, sentenced to two years' imprisonment, and dismissed from the Service. We have the matter always under scrutiny both in the service and on the civil side. </para>

I know of a person in Melbourne who has secured treatment for his wife, who is suffering from arthritis, at the Rockefeller Presbyterian Hospital in New York. She was given five injections of the new drug, cortisone, and has apparently been cured, after having been bedridden for more than two years. A statement has beenmade that this drug would be released in Australia after March this year through a manufacturing chemist in Sydney. Does the right honorable gentleman know anything of such a proposal? In view of the fact that many sufferers from rheumatoid arthritis are interested in the claims about the effectiveness of this drug, will the Minister make full inquiries and issue a considered statement on the subject as early as possible? </para>

In explanation of my question, I inform the right honorable gentleman that these members of the doctors' trade union have joined together by direct action substantially to increase their fees to as much as a guinea a visit, and are refusing to work except at the new rates. Whilst I recognize that the Minister cannot tolerate this will he take into account the fact that the doctors have doubtlessly been misled by a small minority of trouble-makers at their head? Before invoking the Crimes Act against them, will he point out that this Government will not allow ally sections of the workers to take the law into their own hands and only as a last resort will it gaol or deport their leaders and so allow the rank and file to regain control of their organization? </para>

That is purely a domestic matter between the members of the British Medical Association and their patients. </para>

Also, in view of the anticipated good crop, especially in Queensland, and the comparative price of wheat and grain sorghum on the local market, does the Minister consider that there will be any relaxation of the conditions whereby export licences can be granted for 60 per cent of stock while the balance of 40 per cent, must be retained for the home market? </para>

That policy still stands. Authority has been granted for the issue of a number of licences. I cannot say the exact number, nor can I say without inquiry whether licences have been issued in every State, but I shall obtain the information and supply it to the honorable member. The percentages of 60 per cent, for export and 40 per cent, for home consumption were considered to be appropriate before complete knowledge of the volume of the crop was available. When complete figures are available, I shall review those percentages and, as the honorable member suggests, it may be possible to vary them. </para>

                        <para>- I was proposing to say something about that matter after question time, but I may conveniently deal with it in answer to the question by the honorable member for St. George. Some time before Easter, I announced to the House that a proclamation had been issued under the Crimes Act having regard to events on the waterfront in Queensland. Since the issue of that proclamation, the process of work on the waterfront has been restored. There has been continuity of operations, and, in point of fact on the matters which immediately gave rise to the dispute, the Waterside Workers Federation has gone back, to the judge, and certain proceedings before him are now pending. In other words, the industrial disturbance which provoked the proclamation has terminated, and, in those circumstances, the Government has decided to revoke it. As I indicated to honorable members when I made my announcement to the House some time before Easter, the position is that, under the Crimes Act, a proclamation, once issued, continues until it is revoked. It will be revoked this afternoon. It is not desirable that emergency measures of that kind should continue after the expiration of the emergency, and, therefore, we propose to revoke the proclamation. Should any disturbance in future require corresponding action, the Government of course will know what to do. </para>

Is he aware that a move has originated with the Communistcontrolled federal executive of the Waterside Workers Federation to swamp the anti-Communist Melbourne branch of the federation, and that the Permanent and Casual Wharf Labourers Union is the weapon to be used for this purpose? As part of the Communist plan is to increase the numerical strength of the "scab " union, will the Minister instruct the Australian Stevedoring Industry Board to refuse to grant a current application by the Permanent and Casual Wharf Labourers Union for permission to increase its membership? </para>

We have had some discussion in this Parliament of its activities over recent years, and I have watched with interest the apparent transformation that has taken place in its character over the same period. I have had discussions recently with the secretary of the Victorian branch of the Waterside Workers Federation along the lines that have just been covered by the honorable member's questions. Those representations are being examined, and I shall also take into consideration the suggestion that the honorable member has made. </para>

Is it a fact that many miners and retired miners have had their homes wrecked, in many instances beyond repair, and have lost their whole life savings? Is it also a fact that a committee appointed by the Government is at present going around assessing the damage done to the property of farmers as a result of the recent floods, with a view to granting farmers financial assistance to repair the damage? Will the Prime Minister consider the advisability of extending the scope of the committee's functions to take in the industrial area of Scarborough and to provide for an assessment to be made of the damage there, with a view to financial aid being granted to the miners and retired miners on the same basis as the assistance to be granted to farmers? </para>

In the case of flood damage in both New South Wales and Victoria, I received applications from the Premiers of those States, who drew attention to the nature of the losses that had occurred. The Government agreed to co-operate with those States in taking some action in the matter - not to repair all the damage done to individual citizens, but to deal with cases of genuine personal hardship that might have arisen. I do not know that I have had any communication from the Premier of New South Wales about the matter to which the honorable member has referred, but if the honorable member would be so good as to give me any papers that he may have on the matter I shall be very glad to examine it. </para>

                        <para>- I have not had the opportunity nor the time to study the speeches that have been delivered in Australia by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Hewlett</inline> Johnson; but I have no doubt in my own mind about the real character of the so-called Australian peace congress. In common with similar gatherings that have been held in other parts of the world the Australian peace congress, using the language of peace, has become part of the new Communist technique for the new Communist front. We have no doubt that this method is being employed to further the propaganda and techniques of communism. The honorable member has asked whether I shall have the immigration laws reviewed to see whether it is possible to prevent people from coming to Australia to state views which might encourage Communist propaganda. I see very great practical difficulties in attempting to adopt the course which the honorable member has proposed, particularly as it would necessitate officers of my department making themselves familiar with the views of all sorts of people who may desire to come to this country. The practice which I have adopted in this instance, and would adopt in similar appropriate cases, was to inquire of the Security Service whether any security objection was taken to the Dean's visit to Australia. The Dean possesses a British passport. I was assured by the officers of the Security Service that no security objection was raised to his mission in Australia. They said that his pro-Soviet views were so widely known that his presence here would merely focus attention on the real character of the congress which he is attending. </para>

If these reports are correct, in view of the fact that the Australian Labour party has declared the congress to be a Communist front, is the Prime Minister of the opinion that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Morrow's</inline> support of this congress indicates that his connexions with the Communist party are closer than has generally been realized, that his connexion with the Australian Labour party is less close than has been generally realized, or that the opposition of the Labour party to communism is merely a policy of expediency which may be relaxed in certain circumstances? </para>

                        <para>- I direct a question to the Prime Minister concerning the resurrection of the purchasing power of the £1. I do not know whether the right honorable gentleman has had a chance to read this morning's press, so I ask him whether he has been advised that the Registrar of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court yesterday announced that the basic wage would rise by 3s. in Melbourne and 2s. in Sydney because of increases of the cost of living during the last quarter? If so, does he agree that this is the second cost-of-living increase since this Government took office and that, in the case of workers in some capital cities, it brings the increases to 8s.? If this is so, is it evidence of the Government's efforts to put more value into the £1, or, as it would appear logical to suggest, is it evidence of the vanishing value of the £1? If the latter is the case, what does the Prime Minister propose to do in order to give effect to his election promise to make the £1 worth of goods to the value of £1? </para>

                        <para>- I appreciate the honorable member's interest in this matter. If he would devote his talents to encouraging an increase of production in Australia he would be serving a very useful purpose. If he does not know it already, the Leader of the Opposition will soon tell him, that that is a basic condition upon which money will buy more. In his question, the honorable member has omitted reference to one significant fact. The price-level began to rise at the rate of about 10 per cent, per annum in 1947, when the honorable gentleman had a seat on the treasury bench. It continued to rise at the same rate during 1948. </para>

                            <para>- Unfortunately for the honorable gentleman, it was before the referendum. The rise in price levels began a clear eighteen months before the prices referendum was held. Prices rose at the rate of from 10 to 12 per cent, per annum in 1947, 1948, in the middle of which year the referendum occurred, and in 1949. Such an alarming rise in the cost of living cannot be arrested overnight. I am, therefore, not surprised to know that the continuation of that momentum has produced the result referred to by the honorable gentleman, but with his co-operation, and the co-operation of the trade union movement and of all those concerned with production in this country, we shall hope to slow down that process, then to arrest it, and then to start a movement in the opposite direction? </para>

Is it true that the Prime Minister told a meeting at Launceston recently that more value could not be put into the £1 by an act of the Government? Does the present attitude of the right honorable gentleman constitute repudiation of the solemn promise he made to the Australian people that, if elected, he would put value back into the £1 ? </para>

I should like to inform the honorable member for Hindmarsh that on the occasion to which he referred to in his question I indicated that Governments could and should do certain things which concerned economic policy and which bore on that great problem which concerns everybody - the problem of arresting inflation. But the Government cannot do all about it because no government can do everything on that matter unless it is backed by the resolute efforts of all individual members of the community. When honorable members of the Opposition realize that they, as well as other people, have a task of leadership on this matter, we shall progress more rapidly. </para>

                        <para>- The Government is aware of the shortage of wheaten mill offals and its effect on the various industries mentioned by the honorable member. As I told the House on another occasion, I have consulted the Australian Wheat Board, and also specialist members of the Flour Millers Association, and officials of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture, and we have examined every possible way of stimulating the export of flour for the purpose, amongst other things, of securing more wheaten mill offals. Obviously, this is not a matter which is finally within the control of the Australian Government. It is a matter of finding markets for the sale of flour. Since this problem became acute we have succeeded in concluding several transactions in respect of flour produced from some millions of bushels of wheat. The Government is not relaxing its efforts to expand the sale of Australian flour in order to meet this emergency condition. </para>

Is a chest X-ray included in this examination? If so, is the film of the chest X-ray forwarded to Australia with a medical report? Is it a fact that some applicants for admission to this country have previously suffered from malnutrition and that this has been responsible for evident signs of lung trouble being overlooked by the medical officers? Are large numbers of immigrants now inmates of tuberculosis institutions in Australia? </para>

I have no reason to believe and, on the information in my possession, I would repudiate the suggestion that medical officers overlook obvious evidence of the character mentioned by the honorable member. I have no reason to believe that any great proportion of people who come to Australia are suffering in the manner indicated by the honorable gentleman. After being examined overseas, some immigrants do show evidence of tuberculosis infection upon reaching this country and they are given adequate treatment. I shall endeavour to obtain a full statement on this question for the information of honorable members. </para>

                            certain information concerning the alleged inadequacy of the air service to Flinders Island. I have now obtained the required information and present it to the House. The matter of air services to Flinders Island has been discussed with Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, the regular operator of the service to that island, and also with

Prior to September, 1948, Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited operated between Launceston and Flinders Island thrice weekly, on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, but, owing to the poor loadings on the whole service, the Wednesday service was discontinued in that month. The prospects of re-introducing the Wednesday service have been discussed with the company, which has advised that during the six months ended the 31st December, 1949, the loadings on the twice-weekly service were -

                        <para>- And that is about the only thing that I have in common with the former Minister! For that reason, my incursion" into this debate will be of the briefest nature. I rise because, like other honorable members on this side, I see in this bill the embodiment of some of the very first principles on which the Government parties went to the people during the election campaign last December. We on this side of the House are intensely gratified to see some of the Government's electoral promises being put into tangible form so early in its history. I do not want to deal in detail with any of the component parts of the bill, and I propose to refer principally to its main objectives which are, first, the expansion of the activities of the Commonwealth Bank ; and, secondly, the establishment of a board to control the conduct of the bank in the soundest and best possible way.. I am sure that there is no disagreement anywhere in this House concerning the desirability of the first objective. All of us are equally agreed that it is most important that the people's bank should be encouraged in every way to expand in such a manner as will enable it to meet the growing demands upon it. Earlier in this debate, certain members of the Opposition were pleased to say that members of this Government had never believed in the Commonwealth  Bank, but they must have known that  their statements were very far from the truth. I am sorry that the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> lent some force to the totally specious argument that the Government intended to hamper the activities of the Commonwealth Bank. Such talk, as the honorable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beazley)</inline> observed in his speech, adds nothing to the debate; it merely unjustly caricatures the arguments of Opposition members. I dismiss it as so much political propaganda in the narrowest sense for we are in complete agreement that the expansion of the bank is a good thing. It is on the proposition to set up a board of governors to control the policy of this bank that the House is divided. </para>

                <para>The Government believes that this great bank, upon which the efficient functioning of the whole financial policy of this country depends, can be efficiently, continuously and properly run, only by a properly constituted board. It does not believe that one person can do the job. The Government has embodied that belief in this bill. The Opposition pretends that it is opposed to the setting up of a board, but I have yet to hear one honorable member opposite advance one good reason against such a proposal. The Opposition pretends that it is opposed to boards in general, but boards were made use of in nearly every government instrumentality that the previous Government set up. There has always been a military board to conduct the affairs of the Army, and a Naval Board to conduct the affairs of the Royal Australian Navy. We also have an Apple and Pear Marketing Board, an Australian Wool Board, and many other boards. Many boards were set up by the previous Government because it knew that great Commonwealth undertakings could be best and most easily administered over a period of years by a board. In the course of ite own legislative programme last year the Chifley Government brought in a hill to set up and regulate the shipping industry. The instrumentality chosen to implement that legislation was, in fact, the Australian Shipping Board. This Government says that as it is with shipping, marketing, and the armed services, so also it should be with the very important operation of banking. </para>
                <para>I can understand, but I can see no justification for, the resolute opposition to the setting up of a Commonwealth Bank Board. I ask myself, as other honorable members and citizens have asked themselves, what prompts the Opposition so bitterly to oppose the setting up of the board. The Leader of the Opposition said that he feared the setting up of boards because persons appointed to them could not be independent. To use his own words, he said - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>I have never yet known any one appointed to a bank board to be an independent person. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">Why should any one so appointed be an independent person? Appointees to other boards are not independent persons. On the Australian Wool Board there are representatives of growers, of the Government, of taxpayers and of the consumers. The same principle applies to the Australian Shipping Board. The marketing boards of this country also embrace a diversity of representation. The Commonwealth Bank Board will be possibly the most important body in Australia excepting this Parliament and the High Court. In its hands will lie the financial well-being and stability of this country. It will also administer the broad policy covering the activities of the trading banks. That being so, surely it is reasonable that the governing body of the bank should be composed of representatives who will be able to put the views of all those sections of the people vitally interested in the functions of the bank. Therefore, it is only natural that we should find on this board representatives, for example, of the banks, of the citizens, and of labour. They should all be represented on the bank because they are vitally interested. The proposition advanced by the Opposition is that the only people on this board should be Commonwealth civil servants. If that is so then no one will have any share in the financial administration of this country other than permanent civil servants and the Government itself. Such a point of view is fantastic. For this great bank to be run efficiently there should be the widest possible representation on the board. </para>
                <para>The Leader of the Opposition made great play of his fear that those appointed to the board would not necessarily be independent. It does not matter twopence if they are not independent as long as the representation is wide enough to cover all sections of the community. If the Leader of the Opposition is so keen on independent representation why did he not carry out that policy when he was in office? A look at some of the appointments made by the previous Government will show whether independence of politics or interests guided the Government in making such appointments. We need look no further than the appointment of the head of the instrumentality in question, the Commonwealth Bank. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Coombs</inline> was appointed to that position. I have not made it a practice to attack public servants in this House and I do not wish to do so in this instance because I know <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Coombs,</inline> and what I know of him I like. I greatly respect him as does everybody who knows anything about him. He is a man of the highest integrity and of great capacity. However, it is absolutely ridiculous to pretend, and never have I heard it pretended, that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Coombs</inline> is any other than a doctrinaire socialist, and that he was put in control of the Commonwealth Bank because he was one of the few men in the country capable of doing the job that the Government required to be done. That was the nationalizing and socializing of the trading banks. There was not the faintest pretence of disinterestedness or independence in the last Government's appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Coombs.</inline> It appointed a straight out fellow-traveller of its own political philosophy, and for any member of tie Opposition to talk about the necessity for obtaining independent people for this board is the veriest piece of humbug, because when the Opposition was in power its only desire was to appoint a man who would do exactly what he was told, not because he did not have the courage to stand up to the Government, but because his own political socialist philosophy was identical with that of those who appointed him. </para>

As he knows, this Government intends to retain <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Coombs</inline> as  Chairman  of the Commonwealth Bank Board. I have already said what I think of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Coombs.</inline> I have said that he is a most capable and most upright officer. However, since honorable members opposite have made such scathing attacks upon those whom they guess will be appointed to the board, it is only fair to say that, while I do not disagree with the proposal to appoint <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Coombs</inline> as  Chairman  of the Commonwealth Bank Board, I believe that he will find it very difficult, as a doctrinaire socialist, to reconcile his duties with his beliefs. I shall be interested to see how the matter turns out. The attitude of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Coombs</inline> to the trading banks is the attitude of the lion to the lamb. The banks are there to be gobbled up and to be made part of the socialist system. I shall be very interested to see how a man who holds that belief can effectively operate the Commonwealth Bank in the way this Government intends it to be operated, and so that the trading banks may stay in existence. </para>

                <para>I cannot help commenting on the manner in which honorable members opposite have conducted themselves in this debate. To hear them talk, one would thing that the subject of banking and the relation between the Commonwealth Bank and the trading banks, were matters completely new to this Parliament. One would certainly not believe that only a little more than a year ago we were debating these very matters in the House, or that, on the 10th December, the people of Australia delivered a verdict on the issue so emphatic that even honorable members opposite can hardly have forgotten it. In their hearts, they know that what the Government is doing now is what <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> people of Australia wish them to do, and that the proposals which the Labour party are advancing are the very proposals which brought destruction upon it. When this House last considered banking legislation just about eighteen months ago, the position of the parties was almost exactly reversed. The present Opposition was in office, with a record majority, and the proposal that the Labour Government put to the House, and ultimately to the people, was that the trading banks should be nationalized, and that one supreme national banking authority should be set up. Upon those proposals the people delivered their verdict, as a result of which the Opposition is where we see it to-day. The Labour party is out of office, and is represented in this House by a truncated remnant. The Labour party's banking legislation was the rock upon which the last Government foundered, and the foundation stone upon which the fortunes of the present Government are being built. It is evident, therefore, that honorable members opposite, in opposing the present bill, are engaging in bogus political manoeuvring. They know the will of the people. They also know that the Labour party has a majority in the Senate. If they truly believe that the Government's banking proposals, including the appointment of a Commonwealth Bank Board, are not in the best interests of the people they have their remedy. By using their majority in the Senate they can at any time force the Government to go to the country. I hope they will do so, because I am sure that what happened to the Labour party on the 10th December last was a small thing compared with what will happen to it if it invites the decision of the people a second time on this issue. Therefore, I say, let us have less posturing and time-wasting, less talk about the last depression, and less putting up of straw men to be knocked down again. If honorable members opposite are sincere, let them arrange with their colleagues in the Senate to throw the bill out. Let them go to the country, and see what will happen. The Government's banking proposals are based upon first principles, and upon issues that we took to the country. This Government was elected upon an issue that rang a bell in the hearts of the people. Therefore, I support this bill, confident that it has the support of the people. I trust that honorable members opposite will not waste further time in this debate, and I am confident that they will not give the people another opportunity to vote on the issue. </para>

                    challenged the Labour party to throw the bill out when it came before the Senate. I assure the honorable member that the Labour party will adopt that course. The Government has introduced this measure with indecent haste. As a matter of fact, the banking screw is already being tightened. Credit is being restricted, and higher interest rates are in the offing. In this movement, the Commonwealth Bank is playing its part with the trading banks. Advances for home-building are being curtailed. Cooperative societies that have been in existence for years are being refused accommodation by the Commonwealth Bank, as well as by the trading banks and insurance companies. It is not suggested that there is not plenty of money available for investment. The recent Commonwealth loan shows exactly the amount that the insurance companies had available for subscription, but there is no money for building or developmental works, because it is the intention of the Government to take action to increase interest rates in the near future, and the wealthy financial institutions want to be in for the kill.
                </para>
                <para>The Government should have considered other matters bef ore it introduced this bill. The basic wage has increased by 8s. a week in some of the major States since this Government assumed office, and the high cost of living is inflicting severe hardship upon those unfortunate people who are trying to exist upon their meagre pensions. Their dire plight should have been given priority by the Government in its legislative programme, but it has made the big financial interests its main concern. A fortnight after the Government was elected to office, the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, which is one of the great allies of the Liberal party  and the Australian Country party increased the price of steel by £2 a ton, and I am led to believe that that increase will yield to that wealthy organization a profit of £2,000,000 a year. The Government was not satisfied with rendering that service to one of its supporters before it gave some consideration to the dire plight of pensioners, and it proceeded hastily to introduce legislation to re-establish the Commonwealth Bank Board. The Government desires to repay its debts to the private banks which provided the antiLabour parties with funds for the recent election campaign. Bank managers wrote articles in local newspapers, and special scare letters were sent to depositors about the intentions of the Labour party. I had believed prior to that time that one of the fundamental points of policy of a bank was to preserve secrecy about its deposits. However, the banks employed canvassers who disseminated the lies about which the Leader of the Opposition has spoken so indignantly. They had polling booth workers in considerable numbers, outside and inside, approaching people to vote against the Labour party candidates. Such circumstances had never before been heard of. The Labour party believes that the assistance which the Liberal party and the Australian Country party received during the election campaign has prompted and even forced the Government to introduce this bill as a means of paying off those people who were responsible for its return to office. </para>
                <para>The Labour party is opposed to the re-appointment of a Commonwealth Bank Board. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> and the Government possess all the authority that they require to control the Commonwealth Bank, and the Labour party will not allow this or any other government to shackle the people, or impede the progress of this nation for an indefinite period. The national development will be retarded if the control of the Commonwealth Bank is vested in the board which will act in the interests of the private banks. This Government has no mandate to attempt to govern in perpetuity, or to set in motion any financial machinery that would place the people in thrall for an indefinite period. </para>
                <para class="block">If the control of the Commonwealth Bank were vested in a board, the Labour party would need to win a majority of Senate seats in every State in successive elections in order to change that form of control of banking. I realize that the Government desires to bring about circumstances under which the Labour party would be forced into that position before it could undo the damage that the bank board could do. Indeed, I venture to say that it would be impossible for a Labour government to remain in office for more than one term. Honorable members opposite have referred to the Australian Shipping Board, the Military Board, and similar authorities in somewhat derogatory terms, yet they are most anxious to reconstitute the Commonwealth Bank Board. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reginald</inline> McKenna, a former Chancellor of the British Exchequer and  chairman  of the Midland Bank emphasized the importance of the control of credit when he said - </para>

Government supporters have referred, somewhat belatedly, to the excellent achievements of the Commonwealth Bank, but I think that it will be advisable if I refresh their memories. I cannot do better than read a passage from a speech by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> in which he described the great work of the Commonwealth Bank and showed how it had saved the people of Australia vast sums of money. He said that the institution had stopped the rake-off and huge profits which anti-Labour governments had been so anxious to pass on to their numerous wealthy friends, the financial institutions.

                <quote>
                    <para>I enumerate some of the things that the Commonwealth Bank has clone, many of them under the provisions of the 1945 Act. The Commonwealth Bank has controlled interest rates and has prevented primary producers and other persons from being robbed. It has provided short-dated treasury bills at very low rates of interest  ranging  from 1 per cent, down to, I think, a half of 1 per cent, at present. Whenever the Government required temporary advances to carry on the administration of the country it did not have to go to the private banks and pay, as it did when <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Earle</inline> Page  was Treasurer, interest of per cent, on three-month treasury bills. </para>
                    <para>At the peak period of borrowing, the Australian Government owed the Commonwealth Bank £343,000,000 on treasury bills. That sum had been advanced by the Commonwealth Bank at low rates of interest to carry on the war and the business of this country. The private banks would have made millions of pounds profit if they had supplied that money. During the period when I was Treasurer the debt of £343.000,000 was reduced to £105,000.000. </para>
                    <para>During and since the war, the Commonwealth Bank assisted the Treasury to float loans. Not one penny was subscribed by a private bank, because the Labour Government would not allow private banks to contribute to a national loan. </para>

The Commonwealth Bank then made advances totalling no less than £812,000,000 under the various financial arrangements covering such primary products as wheat, meat, butter and cheese, eggs, apples and pears, barley, rabbit skins, peas, and products like tea and coffee and wool sheepskins. That shows the magnitude of the achievements of the Commonwealth Bank during the war years. </para>

                <para class="block">What a great rake-off for the private banks if they had lent that money. We shall advise the people of Australia of the system honorable members on the Government benches desire to see operating. On behalf of their numerous friends in the financial world and a3 a repayment for the great work that those friends did to secure the return of the present Government parties during the last general election campaign, honorable gentlemen opposite intend to re-establish a system under which private financial institutions would have made huge profits. The Banking Act 1945 give the Commonwealth Bank general jurisdiction over the advances policy of the private banks and also the power to decide whether their lending should be restricted or increased in the public interest. It also gave the Commonwealth Bank the power to determine what rates of interest the private banks are to pay and receive. Under that act the Commonwealth Bank also regulates the surplus investable funds of the private banks and authorizes the payment of a very low rate of interest on the large sum that it at present holds for the private banks. I know that the 1945 act will not be altered so far as its actual wording is concerned, hut if the means of effective control of the bank are removed the private banks can regain their former position. </para>
                <para>The people of this country are not likely to be deluded by the Government's statements to the effect that the 1945 act will not be altered, because they are aware of what lies behind the Government's present moves. They know that the Government intends to place the people of this country once more in pawn to the private banks and to thu people who have so shackled this country with huge interest burdens over a period of years. It was stated in the last election campaign that the women of Australia were the camels of this country because of the huge burdens that they had to carry. Such burdens will be nothing to the financial burdens that the people will have to carry if the Government has its way. I shall show how much this country is in pawn through high interest rates. In 1888 the New South Wales </para>
                <para class="block">Government raised a loan of £16,000,000 for railway construction. In 1944, when repayment of the loan fell due, the State had paid £26,000,000 in interest charges alone. An amount of £800 has to be paid in interest every day on the capital cost of building the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The same position occurs in relation to concerns like the Sydney County Council, which has to pay 15s. from every £1 that it earns from the supply of electricity as interest on the capital cost of the council's generating plant. The people of Australia would have been saved those tremendous burdens if there had been a properly controlled financial system i1 Australia in days gone by. It is th? desire of the Labour party to ensure that never again shall such methods of financing public utilities operate in this country. On that basis Labour is prepared to carry on this fight on behalf of the people of Australia and to expose the Government's proposals for what they are worth. We shall do that also because we do not consider that the people gave the Government a mandate, at the last general election, on this particular issue. A combination of factors was responsible for a change of government at that election, but on this particular issue alone, we hold that the Government has no mandate and consider that at this particular stage of Australia's development, when co-operation between all sections of the community is so urgently required, it is doing the country a disservice by introducing a measure that will set class against class. I believe that that is an action which the people of Australia will not countenance. </para>
                <para>At present the Minister for National Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> is attempting to persuade American " big business " to invest in Australian Government loans for national development. In th;&gt; same newspapers that contain news of that fact we find also items concerning  the huge unemployed army of America, which has grown to such a degree that President Truman has sent an urgent message to Congress asking it to enact legislation to give relief benefits to about 6,000,000 people. We believe that these conditions could come here, because unemployment can grow with great momentum and we are not  unmind-  ful of the circumstances that operated from 1929 almost up to the beginning of World War II. We believe that it is our responsibility to the people of Australia to see that the economic conditions of those years never recur. We know that they will not recur while a Labour government is in office, provided that such a government is not shackled by outside interests as Labour governments have been in days gone by. A Labour government, remembering the past, would never allow any form of organization to operate in this country so as to hamper national activities. That is why we shall fight to the death any proposal by the Government that would, in our opinion, lead to a recurrence of the conditions that existed in the pre-waT years. </para>
                <para>Some people might be led to believe that the Commonwealth Bank, as it is functioning at present, is almost a failure, but the facts show otherwise. Reference to the balance-sheet  issued  on the 30th June, 1949, shows that although the bank was originally established with an advance from the Treasury of only £10,000, it was able to produce a balancesheet last year that showed assets of more than £468,000,000. Last year the bank's aggregate net profit derived from its activities, including the Note Issue Department and the Commonwealth Savings Bank Department after making provision, for contingencies was, in round figures, £7,683,000, which represented an increase of £508,000 over the previous year's profit of £7,175,000. In such circumstances one might well consider that there would be hardly any need to interfere with an organization doing such a magnificent job for this country. The figure represented in that increased profit would be a magnificent amount to place in the hands of the people who finance and support the parties opposite, and whose mouthpiece the present Government is. I repeat that, despite all threats offered by the Government, the Labour party accepts the challenge .contained in the present measure and will fight against the re-establishment of the Commonwealth Bank Board in the form in which the Government proposes to constitute it. The people of Australia recognize that the Labour party is fighting for their protection in this matter, and, in the event of an election, on this issue, will realize that the labour party, in fighting for their protection, has done a magnificent job for Australia as a whole. </para>

The history of the activities of the earlier board has been presented by Opposition members in a distorted fashion. We have been told that the board which controlled the Commonwealth Bank during the early 'thirties was responsible for the financial and economic depression, In a very moderate and convincing speech, the honorable member for Bendigo <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Clarey)</inline> told us what the board should have done in 1929 and in 1930 to meet the financial diificulties  that then confronted this country. It has been suggested by honorable members opposite that had the board agreed to the proposal of the .Scullin Government to issue approximately £18,000,000 worth of fiduciary notes the troubles and horrors of the depression would have been avoided. </para>

                        <para>- I hold in my hand a fiduciary note which was issued by the German Government in 1923. It has a face value of 100,000 marks, which at one time would have purchased 5,000 British sovereigns. To-day, it is valueless. It is not even worth a cigarette unless one wants it as a souvenir. As a means of relieving the effects of the depression, the printing of notes in Australia, once started, might have reached the proportions experienced in Germany. It is all very well for Opposition members to be wise after the event. Many people went to race meetings during the Easter holidays. To-day all of them could tell us what horses they should have backed. They know now, but they did not know them. It is all very well to say that the Commonwealth Bank Board should have done this or that in the past. Let us consider the achievements of the earlier board. Australia, which was one of the last countries to feel the effects of the financial and economic depression, was the second country to extricate itself from the difficulties that resulted from that depression. I remind the honorable member for Bendigo that in 193'7 he used the splendid recovery that Australia had made from the effects of the depression as the basis for an application to the Commonwealth Arbitration Court for a prosperity loading on wages. The Commonwealth Bank Board was responsible for maintaining our financial structure and for so rapidly extricating this country from the effects of the depression. </para>

                <para>As the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pearce)</inline> has said, the board is being treated as a scapegoat. I know that many members of this House suffered greatly during the depression years, but I do not agree that all of them are seated on the Opposition benches. One Opposition member told us that he was on the dole for eight years. Another has said that he existed on the dole for six years. We all agree that those who were forced to accept the dole suffered a most distressing experience and are deserving of our sympathy. Adversity usually has one of two effects on people. It either mellows them and makes them more considerate, or it embitters them and engenders a hatred in their minds against those whom they regard as having been responsible for their plight. I am inclined to think, from the utterances of those Opposition members who have recounted their experiences while they were on the dole that it has embittered their minds and clouded their judgment, with the result that they are looking for a scapegoat which they can blame for their adversity. They want to blame either the Commonwealth Bank Board or the trading banks. I have demonstrated that the earlier Commonwealth Bank Board considerably helped Australia to extricate itself from the effects of the depression. It guided our finances through a most difficult period and it did an excellent job. Its efforts have been commended by some Opposition members. </para>
                <para>In 1945, as most honorable members know, two measures were passed by this Parliament, one being the Commonwealth Bank Act which dealt with the management of the Commonwealth Bank and provided for the appointment of a Governor of the Bank whom it clothed with dictatorial powers, and the other being the Banking Act 1945 which gave to the Commonwealth Bank almost complete control over the trading banks. Under the Commonwealth Bank Act 1945 the Commonwealth Bank was placed completely under the control of one man, who was said to be an acknowledged socialist, a product of the London School of Economics and a student of Professor Laski. We do not object to that and the Government does not propose in this measure that he shall be removed from office. The purpose of this bill is merely to strengthen the Commonwealth Bank by the establishment of a board consisting of members whose interests will be so diverse as to enable the outside, or non-banking, view to be represented. It has been said by some Opposition members that the Commonwealth Bank Board should consist wholly of hankers. If this Parliament, whose duty it is to make laws, were composed solely of lawyers, it would be a dreadful institution. We need a diversity of representation in this Parliament so that a little common sense may be brought to hear on the problems that confront us. If only bankers and civil servants were appointed to the Commonwealth Bank Board, there would be on it no representative with an independent outlook who would ensure that its decisions were not arrived at merely by rule of thumb. This bill would be considerably improved if it contained a provision that would ensure free and fair competition between the Commonwealth Bank and the trading banks. I am not an advocate of the trading banks because I, like many other people, owe money to them; but I believe in free and fair competition. The Commonwealth Bank is a better bank because it conducts its business in competition with the trading banks. Similarly, the trading banks are better than they otherwise would be because of the competition of the Commonwealth Bank. It ils important, however, to ensure that the competition between the private banks and the Commonwealth Bank shall be fair. </para>
                <para>Opposition members have spoken of the wonderful success that has been achieved by the Commonwealth Bank. </para>

Out of those profits the Commonwealth Treasury received £15,502,104. During that period the net profits of the Commonwealth Bank, including the Commonwealth Savings Bank, but excluding the profit from the note issue, was £4,178,296. </para>

That was not bad, either! In addition, the tax on dividends paid to shareholders returned further moneys to the Treasury. So, during the period of three years that I have mentioned, the Treasury received as much from the operations of the trading banks as it did from the Commonwealth Bank. The point I make is that if we are to have fair and free competition in the sphere of banking, the Commonwealth Bank should pay taxes on the same basis as are those imposed on the trading banks. It might be said that all the profits earned by the Commonwealth Bank go to the Commonwealth Treasury. That is so ; but if we are to measure the efficiency of government trading, all government trading enterprises should be liable to taxation on the same basis as that imposed on private enterprise. If such a course were followed it would tend to promote efficiency in government trading concerns and would give the people of Australia an opportunity to see exactly whether government or private trading concerns were the more profitable for the community. I urge the Government to give serious consideration to the adoption of such a principle. Only if that be done can free and fair competition between government and private trading concerns be assured. If we take two racehorses and put a heavy weight on one and a light weight on the other and race them, they do not compete on even terms. Only if government enterprise be placed on thE same footing as is private enterprise can fair competition be assured. </para>

                <para>Mention has been made of the difficulty of selecting for appointment to the Commonwealth Bank Board a person who will take an objective view of the problems that are placed before him. The honorable member for Darebin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Andrews)</inline> has said that when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce,</inline> now Lord Bruce, accepted the portfolio of Prime Minister of Australia, he resigned from the directorates of all the companies with which he was then associated, but that immediately after he had relinquished office he resumed those directorships. That is true, but there was an inference in the honorable member's remarks that I should like to clear up. During the period when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> was in the Ministry, first as Treasurer, and later as Prime Minister, he completely dissociated himself from the companies with which he had been formerly connected. Although I took no interest in politics at that time, I knew that he had completely cut himself off from his former associates. At that time I was doing business with one of the companies with which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> had been associated, and I learned the facts. One of its directors complained that he was unable to get advice of any kind from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> while <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> held office in the Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> is not the only Australian who could be relied upon to abandon his personal interests if he were appointed to a board such as the Commonwealth Bank Board. </para>
                <para>It is the duty of the Government to protect the people from dictators, whether they be political, financial or industrial dictators. Under the Commonwealth Bank Act 1945 the Chifley Government appointed a dictator to control the Commonwealth Bank. Admittedly the Governor of the bank is answerable to the Treasurer, but he could do things which could wreck the finances of this country before the Treasurer even knew anything about them. It has been said that the Commonwealth Bank Board which is to be established under the measure now before us will meet only once a month. What authority is there for such a statement? The hoard will undoubtedly meet whenever it is necessary for it to do so, and I am sure that its members will not be divided into groups as is feared by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley).</inline> The right honorable gentleman is so imbued with party politics that he seems to think that the civil servants who are to be appointed to the board will aline themselves against the remaining five appointees. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> in his wisdom will see that those whom he appoints to the board may be depended upon to state their honest opinions on all matters that come before them and will be capable of judging the value of the advice given by experts in the field of banking and finance. </para>

                        <para>- The Opposition has said that it will oppose this bill and use its majority in the Senate to reject it. I hope that before the Government takes that threat up and seeks a double dissolution it will proceed with a referendum to alter the method of electing the Senate and the number of senators to be elected. The honorable member for Mackellar <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wentworth)</inline> pointed out the position that obtains under proportional representation and the present method of electing the Senate and has suggested that nine senators should be elected from each State instead of ten. I suggest that instead of nine senators for each State there should be seven. If members in another place act as has been indicated here, that chamber will become so unpopular that the people will be very pleased to vote for a reduction of their number. I hope that members of the Opposition will remember that and will also realize that a referendum bill can be put to the people after a certain time has elapsed without prior reference to the Senate. I hope that the Government will bear that in mind and will consider reducing the number of senators so that if it becomes necessary to have a double dissolution a stalemate will not eventuate by the parties being evenly divided and so that the Government's legislation and the administration of this country will not be frustrated. </para>

                <para>The Leader of the Opposition argued that as the bill repeals the 1947 banking act that legislation is a dead horse in the track and need not be considered. It may be a dead horse but in the minds of the socialists on the Opposition benches it can still be used to their advantage. To-day we can call those honorable gentlemen socialists and they do not blush. They were very upset about being called socialists during the general election campaign but the Leader of the Opposition has now announced that he is a socialist and, consequently, his members are socialistically minded and can be called socialists without their taking a point of order and claiming that they have been insulted. Honorable members opposite wish to bring about the downfall of the trading banks. They want to monopolize the finances of this country and have them controlled by one man - the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank - whose decisions may be altered at the whim of the Treasurer. It would be totally unnecessary for them to introduce an act of parliament to do that. They have learned that since the High Court and the Privy Council declared to be invalid certain provisions of their legislation. They could attain their objective by slow strangulation. If the terms of the 1945 banking act were enforced the trading banks could be squeezed out of business very easily by resumption of their properties or in other ways. I am certain that it is in the minds of Opposition members that when they get on to the Government benches again they will not bother with acts of Parliament. They will proceed to squeeze out all competition by resumptions and every other little trick that the present legislation allows. </para>
                <para>I hope that the Government, when framing its referendum proposals, will include a provision that will enable the people of this country to continue to manage their affairs and to have sufficient power to tell a government that it cannot go any further, and, if possible to revoke legislation, because that dead horse to which the Leader of the Opposition referred is in the track of Australian progress and is causing people overseas to lose confidence in us. Although it does not come within the ambit of this bill, I hope that the Government will see that the referendum proposals will be designed to protect the people against another raid on their savings and on the private trading interests of this country. </para>

                    <para>.- When the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> was introducing this bill he stated that measures of such great importance should not be approached in a partisan spirit and that the primary principle was that legislation affecting the Commonwealth Bank should not be subject to frequent or violent change. I desire to examine the reasons which have animated the Government and those which have caused the Opposition to consider that this bill is not in the interests of the national economy. The honorable member for Gwydir <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Treloar),</inline> who has just resumed his seat, expressed the desirability of approaching this matter in a nonpartisan spirit. Yet the fears to which the Treasurer gave utterance and the statements that he made on this subject were the highlight of partisanship. , Honorable members supporting the Government apparently regard it as their priceless privilege in life to refer to such things as "Raids upon trading banks ", " Raids upon other types of banks ", and " The inculcation of socialistic doctrines " as a good argument. I should have thought that in order to be correct, logical and precise they should have shown that the present administration of the Commonwealth Bank had done something inimical to the Commonwealth's interest; that it had failed to justify its existence and that as at present constituted, it had committed errors in administration or policy which had made it due for such a violent and summary overhaul as this measure represents. No reasons of that nature have been produced, so I say that there is no justification for the bill. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>Violent change is connoted in this legislation and it means another deviation from the character given to the Commonwealth Bank when it was founded in 1911. There is no justification for that violent change. The Commonwealth Bank, in its present form, is strictly a continuation of the original institution, which was born in the Commonwealth Parliament in 1911. Despite its vicissitudes over the years, the Commonwealth </para>
                <para class="block">Bank has become a symbol in the minds of the people. At times its operations have been adverse to the interests of the great majority of the people but, in the main, it has retained the vital principle of being operated and controlled by the people except for the period that commenced in 1924, when its complexion was changed. In order to justify the introduction of this bill, the Treasurer should have shown that since 1945, when the bank reverted almost to its original character, it had done something which had not been justified in the interests of the working people and all other people of this Commonwealth. Such proof cannot be and has not been produced because the record of the Commonwealth Bank since 1945 has been a truly magnificent one. Its record from 1911 to 1924 also was a magnificent one, but from 1924, when it lost its original identity and became a bank which was at variance with the people's interests, it was one which it may not be desirable to inject into this debate. I agree with the statement of the Treasurer that the determination of monetary policy should be a collective responsibility but contest his contention that this bill gives full effect to that principle. It does not, but on the contrary takes away from an efficient authority its right to make a decision, subject to consideration by the government of the day. There is nothing in this bill which gives to the Parliament the right to alter, amend, or reject any of the decisions which the board to be constituted might make. The mere laying on the table of this House of an Executive Council minute does not give that right to this Parliament of the people. A hypocritical argument is engendered in this discussion when it is asserted that the bill contains something that it lacks. I affirm the negative proposition and say positively that there is no such thing in this bill, which merely provides for a reversion to the old type of board which functioned in this Commonwealth from 1924 until 1945 and which did not give a very great service to the people of this country. </para>
                <para>I can quite understand why honorable members now supporting the {government endeavour to ascribe to my party a great deal of personal opposition to the trading banks. I consider that that opposition is justified. The Commonwealth Bank exists, in principle, for the good of the people generally; but the trading banks, which will be the motivating force behind the newly constituted Bank Board, observe an entirely different principle, namely the pursuit of private gain. I submit to honorable members that the passage of this bill will be inimical to the welfare of the Commonwealth. The Labour party makes no secret of its opposition to it and to the private trading banks. </para>
                <para>Reference has been made during the course of the debate to the attitude of the trading banks to the elected representatives of the people in the recent election campaign. Evidence has been submitted to show that large sums of money were expended in order that the representatives of the working people might be displaced from their honoured positions in this House. The campaign was directed against me just as it was directed against every other Labour candidate. We expect such opposition and rejoice in it, yet the level to which our enemies sank during the election campaign was something to be wondered at and despised. Even though the Labour party's strength in this House was reduced, it still constitutes a vigorous Opposition and will continue to defend the rights of the people during the life of this Parliament. Considering the alliance of the trading banks with the non-Labour parties, one would not expect to receive from a Liberal member of Parliament a testimonial to the activities of the banks in opposition to those who disagree with their policy of alliance with non-Labour parties. Yet I received such a communication from a Liberal party member of a State parliament, and I take great pleasure in reading it to the House. I received the letter recently from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Lech te, the Liberal member for Oakleigh in the Victorian Legislative Assembly. </para>

                    <para>Subject to adequate and equitable reductions in all wages, salaries and allowances, pensions, social benefits of all kinds, interest and other factors which affect the cost of living, the Commonwealth Bank Board will actively cooperate with the trading banks and the Governments of Australia in sustaining industry and restoring employment. </para>
                </quote><para class="block">The truth was that an outside body was able to dictate the policy of the Government of the day. By refusing to grant the financial accommodation that the Government sought, the Commonwealth Bank Board considerably accentuated the most drastic effects of the economic depression. I live in an industrial suburb and represent people who work for their living and, therefore, would be subject to the first and most severe effects of any policy of financial strangulation. I submit most earnestly to this House that any reversion to the old system of board control of the Commonwealth Bank would be inimical to the interests of those people and others like them who constitute a great majority of the population. The board proposed in the hill will be almost identical with the board that functioned so disastrously for the working people during the years of depression. </para><para>It is all very well for members of the Government and their supporters to say, as did the honorable member for Gwydir, that the depression was an act of God and that it would have occurred in any case. The fact is that the worst  effects  of the depression would never have reached Australia if the Commonwealth Bank Board had done its duty. My mind recalls the pitiful daily tramp of unemployed men and women in search of work from factory to factory, from office to office and from door to door. If this Government persists with the bill and the same chain of events ia repeated, it will pave the way for the introduction in Australia of communism on a large scale. A return to the conditions of the economic depression would cause many men who have no deep rooted faith to adopt the tenets of communism. The Government will do a grave disservice to the people of Australia if it alters in any way the present system of management and control of the Commonwealth Bank. What is wrong with the present system? Has it failed in any way that would justify the proposed change? The Treasurer declared that the object of the bill is to prevent violent changes. The truth is that the enactment of this legislation will cause a violent change. In 1911 the Commonwealth Bank was managed by a Governor and a  Deputy  Governor. It functioned successfully then. It wass able to finance war loans during World War I. at the rate of "&gt;s. 7d. per cent, when the supposedly charitably disposed private banking institutions were prepared to do so at the rate of £2 3s. 6d. per cent. In that way it saved the nation many millions of pounds. During World War II., the Commonwealth Bank, operating almost in its present circumstances, was a bulwark that guaranteed the financial safety of the country. No sound reason has been advanced for the change in the constitution of the bank management that the Government now proposes. I honestly believe that the bill represents an effort on the part of the Government to pay off the debt that it owes to the private banks for the support that they gave to it during the election campaign last year; </para><para>The honorable member for Gwydir said that the depression was an act of God. I remind him of the following passage in paragraph 565 of the report of the royal commission that inquired into monetary and banking systems : - </para><quote>
                    <para>Along with other parts of the system, the trading banks must bear some responsibility for the extent of the depression. </para>
                    <para>In the more prosperous times preceding the depression, they went with the tide and expanded credit. There was then no central bank to guide their policy, but, even in its absence, the banks might have taken concerted action which would have helped to check the boom, and thereby lessened the extent of the depression. At the outset of the depression the trading banks, in the interest of their depositors and of their own solvency, were forced by the general conditions and by the reduction of their London funds, due to the fall in export values and the cessation of overseas borrowing, to adopt a policy of contraction which intensified the depression. </para>
                </quote><para class="block">That view can be supported by reference to another authoritative source. I direct attention to the following statement that, was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Herbert</inline> Holden, director of the Bank of England, in a speech at, Oxford University not many years ago - </para><quote>
                    <para>Every one knows what caused the depression. The banks caused the depression by following the time honoured custom of refusing advances and calling up overdrafts. </para>
                </quote><para class="block">The Commonwealth Bank Board for which this bill provides would he but a pale shadow of the trading banks and, should any recession occur overseas, the,  same  sequence of events that occurred during the financial depression would be repeated in this country. I reject the Government's proposals most emphatically. The scheme has not been designed for the  good  of the great majority of the people. It is a political pay-off to the trading banks, which subscribed wholeheartedly to the cause . of the Liberal and Australian Country parties during the recent general election. I believe that the people of Australia, when they have an opportunity in the future to express their opinion on this matter, will express it unmistakably. </para><interjection>

Card, general secretary of the United Bank Officers' Association of New South Wales, to gain Liberal selection for the new federal seat of Evans. Here is the amazing inside story for Card's failure.

                    <para>.- This is a bill to amend the Commonwealth Bank Act, as amended by legislation passed in 1945 and 1947. We have been told by .the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden),</inline> and by various Government spokesmen, that the purpose of the bill is to give effect to certain proposals to give effect to which the Government received a mandate from the people at the last general election. Because of what they claim to be a mandate from the people, Government supporters claim that the Opposition should accept this bill in its present form. The Commonwealth Bank Act 1945 was passed through this Parliament, and was submitted to the people - as an accomplished fact, it is true - at the general election in 1946. The people returned the Labour Government to power, .thus endorsing its action in amending the Commonwealth Bank Act. The parties that support the present Government told the people before the last general election that, if returned to power, they would introduce legislation to amend the Commonwealth Bank Act 1945, and to repeal the Banking Act. It may be debated whether they did, in fact, receive a mandate from the people to do what the Government now proposes, because the present bill does not square with the promises made to the people before the election. Let us assume, however, that the bill does propose to give effect to those promises. Even then, honours are even. The people have given two mandates, one to the Labour Government endorsing the Commonwealth Bank Act 1945, and another to this Government endorsing the present bill. We say to the Government, deliberately and finally, that before this proposed legislation is passed into law, the Government should again consult the people so that, in the time-honoured Australian way, the issue would be decided by two out of three. After the Government's proposals had been explained to the people from every political platform throughout the country, the people could then give their final verdict. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, in a boom time in which the 'financial and economic conditions were somewhat less buoyant than they are at the present time. The Government added £30,000,000 a year to Australia's' indebtedness overseas during the years that preceded the depression. Speaking at the Ottawa Conference, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. S.</inline> M. Bruce, now Lord Bruce, said that Australia was borrowing in London £30,000,000 a year, roughly the. amount of Australia's annual interest bill at the time. That was the stupid method of finance that brought about the worst effects of the depression, yet the non-Labour parties in this House have continuously advocated during the last three years that Australia should revert to those unsound practices. It is true that all countries experienced the depression in some degree, but it is not true, as has been claimed by honorable members opposite, that the depression wasshorter and less severe in Australia than in any other country. The truth is that, it was longer and worse in Australia than in most other industrialized countries. Again I quote <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. S.</inline> M. Bruce as having said that the measures taken to counter the effects of the depression could not he much longer sustained in Australia, where they had been greater than in any other country. That statement is recorded in the book, <inline font-style="italic">The Australian Price Structure,</inline> written by Shann and Copland in 1932. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                </continue>
                <para>The economic history of all industrialized countries, including Australia, has been marked by a succession of booms and depressions. In boom times, the banks have expanded credits, thus further accentuating the boom. In time of depression they have hurriedly contracted credit, thus accentuating the effects of depression. During modern times, the tendency has been for the intervals between boom and depression to become shorter and shorter, and foi the depressions to become worse and worse, due largely to the ever-extending use of bank credit. It was for tha* reason that the Labour Government, in 1945, introduced its amending banking legislation. In .part, that legislation wa.« designed to perpetuate controls introduced by the present Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden),</inline> when he was Treasurer in the previous Menzies Government. The fact that those  controls were imposed by regulations which required the trading hanks to open special accounts with the Commonwealth Bank shows that the activities of the trading banks needed to be regulated. If the trading banks had been themselves capable of dealing with the situation, there would have been no need to introduce regulations, the only purpose of which was to ensure that the trading banks did not bring about a state of secondary inflation by extending credits. The banks themselves could have applied a policy of restriction in order to ensure that credit should not be unduly expanded, but the banks could not trust one another to adhere to such a policy. Therefore, fearful of what might happen if they were left to their own devices, the banks asked the Treasurer to take action, thus demonstrating that government action is necessary to control the banking system, and to prevent the recurrence of booms and depressions, with their ruinous effect upon the people. </para>
                <para>The history of banking is an interesting study. Step by step throughout the years, the various functions of the private banks have had to be taken over by governments, either by the imposition of controls, oi by direct acquisition. The first bankers in Britain were the goldsmiths, who issued notes against their gold holdings. They expanded credit in boom times, and contracted it in times of financial stringency, with ruinous effect upon the community. The right to issue coins was taken over by governments, and in England the business of the goldsmiths was eventually taken over hy the Bank of England. Until fairly recent times, the banks had authority to issue their own bank notes, and they used that power to expand credit in good times, and to contract it in bad times, thus accentuating the recurring cycle of boom and depression. Eventually, governments had to intervene, and assume authority for the issue of bank notes in every modern industrial country. However, by the time that action was taken in Australia, the importance of the note issue had largely disappeared so far as its effect upon the general economic life of the community was concerned. By 1924, the expansion and contraction of credit was effected, not by the issue or withdrawal of bank notes, but by the expansion or contraction of bank credit, a process which achieved the same results as had formerly been achieved by the manipulation of the note issue. Therefore, it is clearly proved that, as in the early stages, certain functions of the private banks had to be taken over or closely and firmly regulated by governments, so to-day the control of bank credit must be taken over by governments, either by nationalization, as we proposed, or by stringent regulation such as was proposed in the Banking Act 1945. That act, which this bill proposes to amend, sought to achieve the purposes of the Labour party in two major ways. The first was by a degree of controlled expansion of advances. Of course, no provision was made, and in my view, it could not have been made, against a contraction of bank advances. </para>
                <para class="block">However, an endeavour was made to prevent an over-expansion of bank credit in Australia, and, with the Commonwealth Bank guaranteeing deposit accounts in all the trading banks in Australia, we hoped to prevent a contraction of bank credit. </para>
                <para>The Chifley Government also encouraged the Commonwealth Bank to expand its activi ties along two natural lines. Thi: first was by taking over the banking business of State government and semigovernmental authorities. That is inherent in central banking practice. It is accepted by all experts and writers, and. indeed, by bankers throughout the world that a central bank that is operated by a central government should have control of the accounts of State governments and semi-governmental bodies. An authority much closer to home - the Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systems - indicates clearly that that system should be adopted in Australia. The royal commission submitted a questionnaire to the Commonwealth BankBoard on that matter. "We must remember that the members of that board had been nominated by the Lyons Government, a non-Labour administration, and were the representatives of various interests throughout Australia. The royal commission asked the board whether it considered .that the Commonwealth Bank should control the accounts of the State governments. The reply, which was not inspired, I believe, by any political motives whatsoever, was that the Commonwealth Bank should, as a part of its central banking machinery, hold the accounts of all State governments. The board added, of its own volition, the view that the 'Commonwealth Bank should also hold the accounts of semigovernmental bodies and other authorities that had been established by Act of Parliament or under municipal law. The board pointed out that such power was vital to its functioning as a central bank. However, that section of the Banking Act 1945 was invalidated by a decision of the High Court of Australia, on test, but. the remaining sections remain in operation. </para>
                <para>Members of the Labour party say to the people of Australia, quite deliberately, that the purpose of the Government in introducing this bill is to ensure that the </para>
                <para class="block">Commonwealth Bank Act 1945 shall never be operated while it remains in office. Honorable members opposite have claimed that a bank board provides a more democratic approach to the control of banking. They appear to believe that a bank board must be more responsible, and expert, and better capable of ensuring continuity of banking policy than is possible under the system of control by a governor who is appointed for a term of seven years. But none of those views is borne out by the speeches that have been delivered by the Treasurer and his supporters on this bill. Unless all the members of the proposed board are financial experts or authorities on statistics and treasury practice, the board will not be an expert authority, no matter how great the ability of the members may be in other spheres. The fact that members of the board will retire from time to time will not provide for the same continuity of policy as does the present system of control by a governor. Therefore, none of the requirements of the test that the Government has posed is answered by the provisions of the bill. We are told that, in the final analysis, banking control will be vested in the Parliament. Of course, that will be so. The bill merely provides that, in certain circumstances, a statement setting out the details of a dispute between the board and the Treasurer shall be laid on the table of the Senate and the House of Representatives ; but, so far as I am aware, neither of the two chambers will be empowered to disallow the decision of the Treasurer. That, in my view, does not fulfil the promise that was made to the people of Australia by the present Prime Minister during the recent general election campaign, and does not provide any control of the Commonwealth Bank that does not exist under the Commonwealth Bank Act and the Banking Act 1945. </para>
                <para>Therefore, I look for the reason that has caused the Government to introduce this bill. Every banking measure that has been introduced into the Parliament has been violently opposed by the trading banks. The original proposals for the control of the note issue were strongly resisted by the protagonists of the private banks and the political parties that are now known as the Liberal party and the Australian Country party. The establishment of the Commonwealth Bank itself was fiercely opposed. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Alfred</inline> Deakin moved that the original Commonwealth Bank Bill be referred to a select committee for investigation and report, his motive clearly being to defeat that legislation. According to the evidence of the Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systems, an amendment of the Commonwealth Bank Act in 1920 was strongly opposed by private financial interests. The minutes of evidence of that commission also disclose that the amending legislation that was introduced in 1924 by the then Treasurer, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Earle</inline> Page, was fiercely opposed by the banking interests of the day. Indeed, one provision of that act has never been proclaimed, apparently because it was opposed so vigorously by the trading banks. I need hardly remind honorable members of the strong opposition that was advanced by the private banks to the Commonwealth Bank Act and the Banking Act 1945. The only hanking legislation in Australian political history that has not been fiercely assailed by the trading banks is the present bill, but, significantly enough, it has been criticized by branches of the Liberal party in various States, whilst the proposal to re-establish the Commonwealth Bank Board was condemned by the Wheat Growers' Federation conference in Western Australia only last week. The trading banks apparently accept this bill as a complete pay-off for the part that they played in supporting the non-Labour parties during the recent general election campaign. Honorable members opposite were irate when the honorable member for Hoddle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Cremean)</inline> declared that in a large measure they owed their election to the Parliament to the activities of the trading banks against the Labour party. Recently, I addressed a comprehensive question to the Treasurer about the activities of the trading banks during that campaign, and I shall read to the House a part of it - </para>

The question that I addressed to the Treasurer appeared to me to be a grave indictment of the banking System. If the private banks had done any or all of those things to which I referred, they probably exceeded the powers that have been given to them in their memorandum and articles of association. The Treasurer, in his reply, did not say that the trading banks had not done any of those things, but, by implication, he agreed that they had done all the things to which I had referred.

                        <para>- If the honorable member has no better defence than that, he had better go back to the trading banks. In the United States of America, which is the home of private enterprise, the trading banks are not permitted to subscribe either directly or indirectly to the funds of any political party. A similar position exists in Belgium. The same is true in Canada and the United Kingdom, in fact though not in law. Therefore, the statement that was made by the honorable member for Hoddle does not admit of argument. It is true beyond dispute, and, in addition, it is a challenge to democracy in this country. The trading banks may exert enormous coercive power. They have an immense power for good if they are willing to be regulated by some authority which has only the interests of Australia at heart. If they refuse to be regulated in the same way as private banks are in other countries, they become an enormous power for harm. They not only do great harm, but also subvert, in my view, the democratic institutions of the country. </para>

                <para>I pass to another matter that was mentioned by the Treasurer. The right honorable gentleman told us that the trading bank activities of the Commonwealth Bank would be continued. What we desire him to tell us is whether the trading bank activities of the Commonwealth Bank will be expanded. Under the Commonwealth Bank Act 1945, a clear instruction was given to the management to expand its trading hank activities. The Labour party regards that expansion of business as vital to the public interest, and as a controlling factor, if rigorous control should ever again be required in the Australian economic sphere. I believe that it will be. The Labour party also considers that a foolish and uneconomic practice has been carried out in certain sections of banking in this country. A large measure of the financing of the capital works of farmers and business men on overdraft is stupid and even suicidal. The mortgage bank department of the </para>
                <para class="block">Commonwealth Bank should be pressed to the limit in the fiercest competition, if need he, with the trading banks. Farmers should not be operating upon overdraft, which may be called up at any particular moment that the management of a private bank decides, and, in respect of which interest rates are variable from day to day. We demand that the Treasurer tell us whether the trading bank activities of the Commonwealth Bank are to be not merely maintained but actually expanded in vigorous competition with the trading banks. In addition, we desire to know the steps that are to be taken in respect of a number of important items. I believe that the Commonwealth Bank Board will be merely a facade behind which the Treasurer of the present nonLabour Government will implement his policy without having the responsibility of taking a deliberate action. Certain decisions of major importance must be made shortly by some authority, or the government. I refer, first, to the Australian exchange rate which is of vital interest at the present time. Incidentally, it has been responsible for attracting many millions of pounds to Australia, if the financial pages of the newspapers can be taken as a guide. Speculators throughout the world are seeking to earn the benefit of the possible appreciation of the Australian  £1.  We want to know whether this proposed Commonwealth Bank Board will have the power to alter that exchange rate without the Government taking action. It is as simple as that. If all that the Commonwealth Bank has to do is to say-- </para>

                    <para>. -  When the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> opened the debate on this bill I listened to his speech with very keen interest, because he is regarded by the Labour party as the greatest Labour authority on the subject of banking and its ramifications. I hoped to hear the voice of an oracle, but I must confess that I was very disappointed.  His  speech left me with two impressions. The first was that the bone of contention over this bill would be the proposal to reconstruct the Commonwealth Bank Board; and the second was that he thinks that he is the only authority in Australia who really understands the intricacies of banking. Under the existing banking legislation the honorable  member who holds the position of Treasurer of the Commonwealth exercises dictatorial powers over the financial policy of the Commonwealth. The Advisory Council of the Commonwealth Bank is composed of men who hold office only at the pleasure of the Treasurer of the Commonwealth. When the office of Treasurer is combined with that of Prime Minister, the occupant of that office has complete and utter dictatorial powers over the central banking system of Australia. Under the 1945 banking legislation all those who occupy the office of Treasurer of the Commonwealth are given the same dictatorial powers over the financial policy of the Commonwealth Bank and of the Commonwealth itself until this new legislation is passed. Control was placed in the hands of one man. It was to remedy that state of affairs that the present bill was introduced by this Government. To illustrate how in one respect the possession of such dictatorial powers could be inimical to the interests of this country I point out that although the former Treasurer, who is the present Leader of the Opposition, must have known in 1947, from the advice tendered to him by the Advisory Council, that an inflationary trend was commencing, he did nothing about it. Although he had complete control of the financial policy of the Commonwealth, he did nothing to stop that inflationary trend. What credence can be placed on the suggestions of the right honorable gentleman that it is not possible to find throughout the length and breadth of Australia a man competent to be appointed to the proposed Commonwealth Bank Board? Is it seriously suggested that it is impossible to obtain men of the requisite ability and integrity to undertake such a task? </para>

                <para>The Leader of the Opposition and ether honorable members opposite, including the honorable member for Hoddle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Cremean),</inline> have attacked the members of the Bank Officers Association for their opposition to Labour's banking policy. It is common knowledge that that association is purely a voluntary body and that during the election campaign its members used funds which they themselves had sub scribed to combat the Chifley Government's proposals. Not only one Labour spokesman, but many honorable members opposite have characterized the members of that association as the tools of the private banks. Let us examine the facts. It is common knowledge that many bank employees, principally the junior officers, were strong supporters of the Labour party. Many of the older employees supported the Labour party in their youth, but as they grew up and gained experience, they realized that they should change their political views. All honorable members on this side of the House are aware of the fact that in the past bank employees in large numbers voted for Labour candidates. Yet from the time that the nationalization of banking was first mooted in 1947 until to-day not one word was said about undue pressure being exerted by the private banks on their employees. We all know how the Labour propaganda machine works. Do honorable members think that during the last three years we should not have heard of undue pressure being exerted on. the employees of private banks if in fact pressure had been put up on them? Honorable members opposite would not have lost the opportunity to draw attention to such a state of affairs if in fact it had existed. To-day, for the first time, such a suggestion was made by the honorable member for Hoddle, who quoted a letter which he had received from one of his political friends. For what purpose did the employees of the private banks form themselves into a voluntary association ? They are engaged in the business of banking and although many of them may not be experts in central banking and the higher forms of banking, they see the trading banks in operation and they realize that the interests of the community are strengthened by the competition between those banks. Honorable members opposite in the speeches they make on the hustings and also in their maiden speeches in this House have grossly distorted the facts about the Bank Officers Association. During the general election campaign the association followed only one line of propaganda - anti-socialism. Were they right? Of course they were. Did not the present Leader of the Opposition say that the election was being fought on the basis of socialism versus capitalism. The right honorable gentleman admitted that the Labour party was playing for big stakes. Yet the employees of the banks have been attacked because they said that the Labour party intended to bring about the socialization of the banks. That same charge was levelled by honorable members opposite against every member on this side of the House. </para>
                <para>The private banks have also been attacked by honorable members opposite on the grounds that they favour the establishment of pools of unemployed and that they caused the financial and economic depression that visited this country in the thirties. Those charges were levelled against the banks as a part of  Labour's  propaganda of fear. The statement that the Leader of the Opposition made at a meeting of the Macquarie Electoral Council on that subject will have a profound effect on politics in Australia during the next few years. In the future, all Labour members will have to come out into the open. They will have to admit that they are members of the socialist party. </para>

                        <para>- I have introduced these matters into my speech to demonstrate the real motive behind the opposition to this bill. It is that honorable members opposite see in the existing set-up of the Commonwealth Bank the possibility of furthering their own socialistic aims. Right through the debate it will he found that the main objective behind their opposition to this bill is to preserve the present position. Let us examine some of the reasons why this Government wants to reconstitute the Commonwealth Bank Board. It was given a mandate to do so by the people and it is acting on that mandate. It was prompted to make this change because under the present system the Treasurer of the Commonwealth has complete dictatorial powers over the Commonwealth Bank and the central banking system. The Opposition wants to retain that power in the hands of one man. Who wields that power at present ? </para>

                        <para>- Then they are wrong. I foresee that they will remain in Opposition for a very long time. In a recent tour of my electorate I found that many strong supporters of the Labour party are not at all pleased with the conduct of the representatives of that party in this Parliament. Honorable members opposite will remain in Opposition for a very long time; but notwithstanding that, they are prepared to place in the hands of a man whom they do not trust complete power over the financial policy of this country. Their attitude does not make sense. Is it dictated by .the fact that my leader has so often been proved to be right that they have changed their opinion of him and that they now have confidence in him? It must be remembered that he was right on the subject of petrol supplies, just as he was right on so many occasions when he has criticized the budgets brought down by the previous Government. Although the previous Government invariably rejected his suggestions they frequently took advantage of them. The right honorable gentleman has an uncanny faculty of always being right. Honorable members opposite in furtherance of their own political interests are prepared to sacrifice the national interests. </para>

                <para>Another charge made against the Liberal party and the Australian Country party is that they are trying to kill the Commonwealth Bank. That charge has been levelled against them on several occasions. I have taken the trouble to look up the figures relating to deposits and advances. I find that in 1930 deposits in the Commonwealth Bank amounted to approximately £43,000,000 and advances to £13,000,000. In 1942 deposits amounted to £129,000,000 and advances to £35,000,000. That is an extraordinary way to kill a bank! Another fatuous charge that has been made by honorable members opposite is that the Commonwealth Bank Board engineered .the financial and economic depression of the thirties. The private banks have also been continually charged with being responsible for the depression. The honorable member' for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Clyde Cameron)</inline> was particularly bitter in his attack on the private banks. I do not need to champion the cause of the private banks for they are well able to look after themselves. For some considerable time honorable members opposite have adopted towards the private banks the sort of ugly tactics that one associates with our friends the " Commos ". They have adopted a smear campaign. They believe in the principle that if a thing is given a bad name for long enough the people are likely to believe that it should have a bad name. "What had the private banks to do with the depression? They had nothing to do with it whatsoever. The depression began in Europe long before it began in this country. The depression in Australia was caused by the fall of export prices. Have honorable members opposite ever taken time to examine the profits of the private banks? I have taken the trouble to do so, and I have found that since 1926 bank shares have yielded a return of not more than 3^ per cent, to 4 per cent., which is approximately 1 per cent, greater than the present yield from Government bonds. A great deal of the talk against the private banks, which are supposed to be making vast sums of money at the expense of the people, is due entirely to the adoption of a false view of their activities. Oan a bank make money in a depression? Oan a man who is unemployed exercise purchasing power? Of course not. The object of the banks is to maintain prosperity. The profits of banks fell during the depression. </para>
                <para>The depression is coming up in every speech in every session of this Parliament. It has an ugly note. A depression may never come again. Constant talk about depressions causes an unhealthy attitude to the future. "We now know how to deal with depressions and they should not be brought into arguments in a country with a future such as Australia has before it. During the depression the banks increased their advances although there were falls in their securities. This country owes a tremendous lot to private banks. During the depression there were a few people that went to the wall, but in all branches of commerce there arts some bad risks and if some people suffered by having mortgages foreclosed they were bad security risks and no bank was entitled to take a bad risk with public money. "What guarantee is there that if there had been one central bank there would have been any improvement ? "What guarantee is there that if we had only had one bank the depression could have been avoided? None at all. The peculiar thing is that all the experts on depressions say that if there had 'been a socialized bank they would have been able to handle the depression better; but the whole world of banking fell down during the depression. I think it was the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tom Burke)</inline> who said that the depression was worse in Australia than anywhere else in the world. That is not true. In 1934, at the International Labour Conference in Geneva, it was reported that Australia had recovered more completely and more quickly than any other country in the world. </para>

                <para>I think that Professor Copland has been an adviser of the Labour party on many occasions. Where do all the trade unions bank? Why cannot they bank with the Commonwealth Bank? When the funds of certain unions were frozen it was found that those funds were in private banks. One honorable member of the Opposition even had a safe deposit in the Bank of New South Wales. It has been said that these banks treated people harshly during the depression, yet people still bank with them. Lest honorable members should think that I am biased in favour of the private banks I should like .to say that all my own personal business is done with the Commonwealth Bank. </para>
                <para>Throughout this debate and throughout the election campaign and in fact, ever since the passage of the legislation to nationalize the banks went through .this House, we have heard the same scurrilous attacks on the private banks. None of those attacks have been substantiated in any way. They all arise from one motive, which is the socialization of all banks. That is the sole motive that I see behind the opposition to this bill. The honorable member for Port Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thompson)</inline> said that when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scullin</inline> was Prime Minister he could not make use of the resources of the Commonwealth Bank because the institution was controlled by a board. But there were ways in which the government of that time could have used the resources of the bank. Behind the attack by honorable members opposite on this bill is the fact that they see in the new bank board, as distinct from the present advisory counil, an obstacle in the way of attaining socialization. </para>

                    <para>In 1945 we foreshadowed that, when ie-elected to the Treasury benches, we would regard ourselves as being obliged to review the working of the 1945 Banking Legislation, and that we would reconstitute a Commonwealth Bank Board. In 1947 we left no doubt whatever of our intention to defeat the nationalization proposals by every constitutional means at our command. </para>

Distasteful as it is to honorable members, this is a pay-off to the interests that supported them in the recent federal election and spent huge funds in an effort to unseat the Chifley Government. It is just another step in the efforts of honorable members opposite to destroy completely the Commonwealth Bank as we know it. If one studies the attitude of honorable members opposite and their predecessors in relation to the Commonwealth Bank one finds that from the time of its inception in 1911, they viciously opposed its creation and its continued existence. </para>

                <para>In 1924, the Treasurer of the day, the present Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page)</inline> brought in legislation to set up the bank board. In 1945 and 1947, honorable members opposite, or their counterparts, lined up in an endeavour to destroy legislation in relation to the Commonwealth Bank that was designed to benefit the people. The Treasurer knows that the 1945 legislation is effective. He admitted that in his speech, and the only reason that this move has been made to change the administration of the Commonwealth Bank is that he wants to satisfy those private banks which gave funds to his party to defeat the Labour Government - the people's government. Those banks paid their employees to work for the defeat of the previous Government. </para>

The Treasurer knows that the 1945 legislation is effective. In his speech on this measure, he said that the 1945 legislation was perfect and did not need to be overhauled except for the purpose of the establishment of a bank board. He said that the Labour government intended the banking  legislation of 1945 to be the first step towards the socialization of the means of provision for production, distribution and exchange, and that the issue was socialization versus free enterprise. He said that the legislation would affect our standing abroad and that the special deposits amounted to confiscation without compensation. . He criticized the note issue provisions of the 1945 legislation, paid lip service to the statements of the Prime Minister, and told the people what would happen if th? 1945 legislation was implemented. These views were also expressed by honorable members opposite who are the principal supporters of the private banking interests. Having shown what honorable gentlemen opposite thought at that time of the Chifley Government's legislation, I repeat the words that the Treasurer used when he introduced this measure a few day? ago. He said - </para>

                        <para>- That gets under the skin of the honorable member for Macarthur. He is one, no doubt, who bounced around the country and told the people that dreadful effects would come from the 1945 legislation. He cannot " take it " when the falsity of the charges against the Labour party that gained his election to this Parliament is exposed on the authority of no less a person than the Treasurer.  His  misleading statements will ultimately come home to roost and he will have to face up to his responsibilities on this issue. The Government has executed a complete somersault in relation to the 1945 hanking legislation. Its present attitude betrays the falsity of the charges that it made against the Labour Government. </para>

                <para>I have already discussed the Government's change of front in relation to the sections of the 1945 legislation that deal with competition, special deposits, the note issue, and the establishment of a bank board. Broadly speaking, it has accepted the socialist legislation of a Labour government as the basis of its tanking reform. To use the words of the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett),</inline> it proposes to leave in control of the Commonwealth Bank a doctrinaire socialist in the person of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Coombs,</inline> who will be the  chairman  of the proposed board. The people should realize that the Government intends to leave <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Coombs</inline> in that position only because, with the establishment of the proposed board, he will be bereft of power and will be at the mercy of the representatives of private interests who will be appointed to the board. At present <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Coombs,</inline> as Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, is responsible only to the Treasurer in the event of any great difference of opinion arising in relation to financial policy. He has for his guidance an Advisory Council consisting of specialists in finance who ought to know everything that there is to be known about banking policy. But the Government seeks to leave <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Coombs</inline> only nominally in control of the bank. Under its proposal he will be without power to act because he will be outvoted, by the Government's nominees on the board. The Government will do what anti-Labour governments did in years gone by when they appointed bedstead manufacturers and polo players to the former Commonwealth Bank Board. </para>
                <para>The members of the present Opposition risked everything in order to give effect to their enlightened policy on banking. They willingly placed their Government in1 jeopardy in order that the people of Australia might be protected from private financial interests. Supporters of the Government may laugh as much as they like and declare that we aTe only making a sham-fight on this issue, but I warn them that, if they press on with this measure, the Opposition, acting according to its principles, will ensure that they face up to their responsibilities before the electors. </para>
                <para>We know what will happen if the bill  becomes  law. The Government will choose individuals from the general community, in addition to a few financial specialists, in order to complete the proposed board. It has announced that it will find people who are not associated in any way with private financial institutions. Perhaps it will choose the honorable member for Wannon <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mackinnon),</inline> because he has just sold his shares in private banks. .That is the sort of thing that was done by anti-Labour governments when the former Commonwealth Bank Board was in existence. It might even choose somebody like the honorable -member for Mackellar <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wentworth),</inline> who is not connected with banking. How tragic that would be for the nation ! The Opposition has resolved that it will not fall for the Government's proposition. As the Leader of the Opposition has said, we intend to oppose every clause in the bill relating to the establishment of a Commonwealth Bank board. We want to retain the existing system of control that was established by the 1945 legislation, under which the Governor, aided by the Advisory Council, whose members know all that there is to be known about finance, is responsible to the Treasurer and the Parliament. The history of anti-Labour activities in relation to banking is a sorry story. The Labour party believes that the effect of banking and financial policy generally is so great that it intimately concerns the life of every citizen and therefore that huge instrumentalities that control financial policy should be governed by the elected representatives of the people. In other words, we believe that the Parliament should decide financial policy, irrespective of the political complexion of the parties that command a majority in it. </para>
                <para>We have had bitter experience of the control of hanking policy by private interests. The honorable member for Hume <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charles Anderson)</inline> declared that the trading banks had nothing to do with the onset of the depression, but I refer him to the report of the royal commission that was appointed by a tory government to inquire into monetary and banking systems. This is what the commission reported about those benevolent institutions that are known as the private trading banks - </para>

                <para class="block">The re-establishment of a Commonwealth Bank board along the lines proposed by the Government will lead to a renewal of the financial policy that was largely responsible for the sufferings of many thousands of Australians during the depression. The honorable member for Hume said that the private banks did not make profits during that period of stress and hardship. The royal commission reported that the secret reserves of the trading banks at that time exceeded £50,000,000, notwithstanding disbursement of dividends at the rate of 4 per cent, mentioned by the honorable member for Hume. It is interesting to note that the profits of the trading banks between 1893 and 1946 amounted to £128,000,000. During two depressions and two wars, when most of the people were struggling against adverse conditions, those masters of finance still maintained their profits. They continued to prosper while the people suffered. I mention these facts in order to show why the </para>
                <para>Labour party is viciously opposed to any scheme for the placing of control of the nation's financial resources in the hands of any body other than the elected representatives of the people. </para>
                <para>Do supporters of the Government, who speak glibly of what the private banks did for Australian industries, realize that during the worst period of the depression there were about <inline font-style="italic">480,000</inline> persons unemployed in Australia ? The number of Australians in receipt of a miserable dole at the 30th June, 1932, was 783,000. There were many bankruptcies at that period, which involved a. total of £7,000,000 worth of assets. At that time, a single unemployed man was granted 5s. 8½d. a week sustenance, and a married man was supposed to maintain his family on £1 a week. That pitiful situation was aggravated by the financial policy of the private banking interests which dominated the Commonwealth Bank.  The Commonwealth Bank was powerless to do anything because it was controlled by people who placed profit before the welfare of the people. We believe that a bank board, to which, no doubt, such people as polo players and bedstead manufacturers will be appointed, as happened years ago, would hold governments to ransom. </para>
                <para>I need not refer back to the depression in order to provide an illustration of the lengths to which financial interests will go in order to gain their ends. Instead I remind honorable members of something that happened in Victoria not long ago. When the Chifley Government introduced its progressive banking legislation, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frank</inline> Clarke, vice-chairman of the National Bank of Australasia Limited, and a member of the Legislative Council of Victoria, decided, at the dictate of a bank with assets worth over £70,000,000, that he would prostitute his duty as a citizen and a representative of the people and serve the interests of the bankers by wrecking a government. The interests that ha represented used the power of finance to destroy the Labour Government in Victoria. That was a typical example of what we may expect if private finance gains control of the Commonwealth Bank. I hope that the people of Victoria will read the circular in which the then </para>
                <para class="block">Leader of the Opposition in the Victorian Parliament, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McDonald,</inline> and the man who later became Premier, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hollway,</inline> received from <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frank</inline> Clarke their instructions to wreck the elected Labour Government of Victoria. That is the sort of thing that the representatives of financial interests will do and that is why the Labour party opposes the establishment of a Commonwealth Bank Board and will not allow the Government to putback into power those who seek to destroy the influence of the people's bank. </para>
                <para>I also remind the House of the occasion when the  chairman  of the former Commonwealth Bank Board, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Gibson, dictated to the elected Government of Australia the terms and conditions upon which the board would provide for the people, through their own bank, sufficient finance to enable them to throw back the tide of depression. This story will bear repetition over and over again as a warning to the present generation of Australians of the tactics that will be used by financial interests in order to gain their own ends. On the 13th February, 1931, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Gibson wrote to the Treasurer of the day, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Theodore,</inline> in the following terms : - </para>

                </quote>
                <para class="block">Every honorable member who believes that banks and other financial institutions exist for the purpose of serving the ordinary man and woman should bear in mind the attitude that they adopted towards the people on that occasion. The Commonwealth Bank Board should have been the servant of the people and should have been subservient to the will of the Parliament acting in accordance with the mandate of the people. Therefore, it should have provided the finance that was needed to prevent nation-wide suffering. It should not have been necessary for the government of the day to appeal to the board. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Theodore,</inline> to his credit, replied to the  chairman  of the board in the following terms : - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>The attitude of the board throughout the recent negotiations, and as disclosed in the letter now referred to, can only be regarded by the Commonwealth Government as an attempt on the part of the bank to arrogate to itself a supremacy over the Government in the determination of the financial policy of the Commonwealth, a supremacy which, I am sure, was never contemplated by the framers of the Australian Constitution, and has never been sanctioned by the Australian people. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">That occurrence stiffened the opposition of the Labour party to the Commonwealth Bank Board. We say that governments, no matter what their political colour, should obtain the finance to provide for all the people, and should carry out their policies and implement the mandates given to them. The days have gone when governments could be dictated to, as was the Scullin Government and the Lang Government, by financiers and other interested groups. . We shall not again see a case such as occurred in Victoria; where one man, because of his financial power and his desire to serve financial interests, was able to wreck a government elected by the people. The 1945 banking legislation gave to the people of this country a bank managed in their own interests and subject to the Parliament of the day. No honorable member on the Government side, including the Treasurer, can point to one failing in that banking system. Political control, and domination of the bank by the government of the day to implement its own policy, cannot be shown at any point. Tribute has been paid by all members of the community to the benefits of the 1945 legislation. That being so, why should change be sought? If the bank is being managed in the interests of Communists, and if it is being brought under political control and if the officers are not efficient, why does the Treasurer not say so? He well knows that this hill is only to fulfil the Government's obligations to interested parties in the banking field in order to give them complete control of the Commonwealth Bank, as they had prior to 1932. Every honorable member in this House realizes the significance of banking in the community. They realize that the salvation of this country during the war and at other times, particularly during the present time, depended to a considerable degree upon the financial stability brought about by the Commonwealth Bank. If the Government is  sincere and honest why does it not carry out its policy by selling these great socialistic institutions? It is a shocking thing that honorable members on the Government side, who have bitterly assailed and tried to destroy this bank are not honest and frank enough to show the people clearly their intention, without using this back-door method of removing control from the Government and placing it in the hands of private interests. Why do they not say that they mean to destroy it? If they do so they will get their answer from the people who have learned the value of the bank. The Government may think that the Opposition is opposing this bill for political purposes. Nothing is further from the truth. We oppose banking proposals such as this because we realize the profound effect that financial policy has on the live and welfare of the people of this country. We realize the bitterness of the depression years, although I am not going to dwell on that. We realize that in more recent times our legislation has been attacked by private financial interests. We fully understand the power of finance, as was shown in the recent election, and we realize how it can work under false banners. Above all else, we have the cardinal responsibility, apart from expediency or anything else, of retaining the Commonwealth Bank as the people's bank which holds the people's money and should therefore be controlled by the people's representatives. Only when this Parliament controls the bank, through men such as the previous Government appointed to its staff shall be have full control of the financial structure in the interests of the people of Australia. This sell-out the Labour party will vigorously oppose. The Government's move to destroy the bank will not stand investigation, and whatever the consequences may be the Opposition will do its best to ensure that the legislation introduced in 1945, in the face of great opposition, shall be preserved. That legislation, even to-day, has won the commendation of the Treasurer who introduced this hill. </para>

                    <para>.- I rise to support this bill but before dis cussing the merits of the measure I should like to make passing reference to two small matters which were raised during the debate by Opposition speakers. The first concerns the references made to the part taken by bank employees in the recent general election. I should like to make it plain that I am speaking not of banks but of hank employees. I do not speak about the banks because I have no qualification to do so. I know nothing about the banks. I have no connexion at all with them. I am not aware that in my election campaign I had any contact with a banker, using the term in the sense of one who directs the policy of a bank, or even any conversation with bankers unless there were by chance some bankers among the interjectors who occasionally interrupted my meetings. I desire to speak only about things of which I know. I was  chairman  of my own campaign committee. I directed that organization and I know who worked for me and who did not. I know what money was spent on my behalf in the campaign. I am aware of the existence of a bank employees antisocialization committee. That committee did not work as a part of my own campaign organization ; but it did work in the electorate, and I concede that the work it did contributed to my success. Whatever that organization did was done of its own volition and by its own enterprise and not as part of a campaign organized by me. What I wish to speak of more particularly concerns the charges made against individual bank employees. On my own committee there were men who were employed in banks. They voluntarily offered their services to me, a fact which I appreciated. In some cases they were men that I hai' known since boyhood and who had grown up in my community. On their behalf I rather resent that they should be attacked simply because they exercised that privilege as citizens to take part in an election campaign. They were all entitled, as adult Australians, to exercise their privilege according to their own consciences. I make no apology or excuse for them. On the contrary, I am proud that such men, as individuals, were associated with me in my election campaign and that as Australian citizens they were  ready to accept their individual responsibility to share in the political life of Australia. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>The second point I wish to mention concerns the statements by the honorable member for Grayndler <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Daly)</inline> on the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank. He referred to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Coombs</inline> in a way that suggested there, was some deep plot behind the decision of tie Government to retain him' as Governor. He referred to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Coombs</inline> as a doctrinaire socialist, and he referred to him in such a way as to suggest that in his own mind he regarded <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Coombs</inline> as having been appointed for political reasons and as having some sort of political function as governor of the bank. I suggest that the truth of the situation is that this Government hae perhaps a higher estimate of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Coombs</inline> than has the Opposition. It is prepared to accept him as a man competent in his own particular branch of finance whose services are of value to Australia. On those terms we are prepared to continue him in that office. That reflects a soundness of judgment on the part of the Government and a sense of fairness rather than indicating that there is a deep laid plot to outwit some fancied and mysterious move by people of a different political persuasion. The retention of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Coombs</inline> is a tribute to his eminence in his own field of study, and to the Government's readiness to accept a man on his merits until he proves that such confidence is unwarranted. </para>
                <para>Turning now to the bill itself it has seemed to me that a great deal of the debate on it has been a mixture of ancient and very much perverted history, and of imagination.  Speaker  after  speaker  on the Opposition side has indicated that in his own imagination he has already appointed the bank board. The Opposition members have already decided what policies that board will adopt, and in their own imaginations have worked out certain consequences that arp sure to follow. But have they at any point dealing with anything that is substantial or anything that is within the terms of the hill? I suggest not. They have worried themselves into a state of  excitement over the figments of their own imagination and over their own incomplete and very faulty reading of the history of this country. Their account of Australia that history does not do credit to their sources of information. </para>

                        <para>- I have not heard it quoted with any exactness by the Opposition. Let us look now at the bill itself. The reason I support the bill is because of its contents. First of all, provision is made for the repeal of the Banking Act 1945. Secondly, there is provision for the establishment of a Commonwealth Bank board. Thirdly, there are three amendments of the 1945 act which will allow considerable scope for the activities of the Commonwealth Bank in the Rural Credits Department, the Mortgage Bank Department and the Industrial Finance Department. The Opposition attack on the repeal of the legislation specified in the bill has been very much of the order of the remark made by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> when he said, " Why should we remove the dead horse from the track". He overlooked that dead horses can very soon become a potent smell. </para>

                        <para>- I know who has been crying " stinking fish " in this House most assiduously. The main opposition was made to the provisions of the bill relating to the bank board. I listened with amazement, perhaps because I am a new member of this House, to the way the Leader of the Opposition developed his arguments against the proposal to re-establish the Commonwealth Bank Board. My amazement was due to the discovery that behind his air of benignity and homespun honesty there lurked as considerable a mental arrogance as one could encounter in many a day's march. There was a certainty that he alone in this country was aware of all the implications of financial policy and that he alone was competent to say what was in the best interests of Australia. That mental arrogance extended to his remarks about experts. He spoke of his reliance on experts, and their value, but it became more and more evident, although it was not explicitly stated, that his definition of an expert was a man who thought exactly the same way as he did. And that mental arrogance seemed to reach its peak when he turned to speak in defence of the provisions of the 1947 act for the control of the financial policy of Australia. At one stage, the Leader of the Opposition said that decisions on financial policy should rest with the Government. At that point the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> interjected, "And not with the Parliament ? " The honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rosevear)</inline> replied with another interjection, " It is the same thing". The original remark and the interjection seemed to me to disclose that members of the Opposition have completely ignored the lessons of the last election, when the people clearly declared their desire that they, through the Parliament, wished to retain control over the actions of the Government. They are not prepared to hand over to governments authority to act in complete disregard of the interests of minorities. They are prepared to recognize executive authority in the' Government, but they are not prepared to abandon their right, exercised through their elected representatives, to set a safeguard upon the Government. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                </continue>
                <para>The Leader of the Opposition said something to the effect that no one was better qualified to conduct the financial policy of the country than the Treasurer, or better informed as to how it should be done. He made that statement in support of the legislative provision which enabled the Treasurer of the Commonwealth to exercise what was virtually a financial dictatorship. The point which the Leader of the Opposition missed was that it is not a question of expertness or knowledge or information in the possession of the Treasurer that matters ; it is the question of dictatorship. That is what we object to. Our objection to the Treasurer exercising sole control rests, not on the ground that he is incompetent or insufficiently informed, but on the democratic ground that we disapprove of dictatorship, and a financial dictatorship is just as objectionable as any other kind. There is a close analogy between what the Leader of the Opposition said, and the sort of argument that used to be advanced in defence of fascism in Italy. There, the common argument was that at least Mussolini did make the trains run, and that his government was efficient. The whole justification for a financial dictatorship as advocated by the Leader of the Opposition was that it would be efficient, that it would be expert and knowledgeable. That same argument has been used to justify every dictatorship. </para>
                <para>Apart from the speech of the Leader of the Opposition, the speeches of most honorable members on the other side have dealt with the experiences of the financial and economic depression of the 'thirties. The argument was developed in its most concise way by the honorable member for Bendigo <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Clarey),</inline> who reviewed the history of the Commonwealth Bank and its alleged failure to act effectively in 1930. However, the criticisms of the honorable member for Bendigo, and of other members of the Opposition, was not criticism of the form of bank control exercised in 1930 ; it was criticism of the policies that were applied in 1930. For my own part, I admit frankly that the policies applied in 1930 were unwise, but those policies did not arise out of the form of control of the Commonwealth Bank, nor did they arise out of viciousness in any section of the community. I think we ought to learn a little humility from history, and to realize that a good deal of error arose out of sheer ignorance. That ignorance was not peculiar to one side of politics, but was common throughout the political and economic life of this and other countries. A good deal of the trouble in 1930 was due, not to any particular system of banking control, but to sheer economic ignorance of what to do in the circumstances that existed. </para>
                <para>Proceeding from that point, I suggest that honorable members opposite should remember that this proposed legislation of 1950 constitutes a very considerable advance over any legislation that a government of the political complexion of the present Government would have been prepared to introduce twenty years ago. Political thought has not remained stationary. We are not living in 1930. The non-Labour Government in power to-day is not the government that was in power in 1929. or in 1932. We have moved with the times. The ignorance that prevailed in 1930 has, in a large measure, been dissipated. Just as we are prepared to credit members of the Opposition with having grown up politically since 1930, so it ought to have entered into the liberality of their thought that we, too, have learned something since 1930. If this hill be examined objectively, not in the light of twenty years ago, hut in the light of circumstances as they exist in 1950, it will be recognized as a moderate, well-intentioned measure designed to provide efficient control of the Commonwealth Bank, and to give ample opportunity for that bank to play an effective part in the financial and economic life of the country. </para>
                <para>Therefore, I commend the bill to the House. The arguments advanced against it ave rooted in a condition of affairs that no longer exists. Those who oppose the bill are trying to interpret present events in the light of twenty years ago. Actually, this bill sets out to do three things. First, it removes the danger of nationalization. That is a matter upon which the mind of the people has been made abundantly clear. Secondly, the bill institutes a form of control of thi Commonwealth Bank which pays due deference to the need for expert guidance and judgment, but which also pays deference to the need for some sort of representative or democratic membership of a body the decisions of which will have 30 important an effect on the lives and well-being of a great many people. Thirdly, it retains from the 1945 act those provisions which give the Commonwealth Bank ample opportunity to do the work it was intended to do. </para>

                    <para>.- On the face of it, this bill appears, as the honorable member for Curtin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hasluck)</inline> has said, to be a liberal measure. It sets up what purports to be a democratic form of control of the Commonwealth Bank, so that responsibility for decisions will be spread among a number of persons. It even purports to grant additional capital for the bank to enable it to enlarge its activities. On the face of it, the bill appears to be designed to strengthen the Commonwealth Bank. However, we on this side of the House, are vigorously opposed to the bill, and we have very  good reasons for our opposition. The honorable member for Curtin suggested that we discovered our reasons by delving into ancient history. As a matter of fact, we can learn many lessons from history, and we should be unwise not to profit from them. Being one of those unfortunate lawyers who are so much maligned in this House and elsewhere, I believe that there is advantage in looking back over similar cases in search of knowledge and of precedents by which we may bc guided. A glance back over the history of the Commonwealth Bank is well worth while if we would realize the inherent clangers of the measure now before the House. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>When the Commonwealth Bank waa founded by Andrew Fisher in 1911, it was placed under the control of a governor. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison</inline> Miller was appointed the first Governor, and under his wise guidance the bank progressed. He was Governor from 1911 to .1923, and during that period the Commonwealth Bank assisted the government of the day, particularly during the 1914-18 war, when it saved the people of this country many hundreds of thousands of pounds. A savings bank branch was developed, and gradually the Commonwealth Bank entered more actively into the sphere of general banking business in competition with the private banks. It became apparent that the private banks did not like this new competitor, and they decided that the progress of the Commonwealth Bank should be impeded. I have been interested as a newcomer to this House to note how honorable members opposite are sometimes in favour of free competition and sometimes, but not always are critical of monopolies. During the last election campaign, we heard much about a particular form of monopoly, but nothing about the monopoly known as Australian Consolidated Industries Limited and the Australian Glass Manufacturers Company Proprietary Limited, which I regard as a vicious and ruthless monopoly. It has a firm grip of the glass manufacturing business in Australia, and exploits the people by forcing up the cost of living. Every time a person buys a bottle of milk or a bottle of jam he i3 compelled to pay tribute to the glass monopoly, but honorable members opposite have never criticized it. They extol the virtues of free competition, but when the Commonwealth Bank attempted to become a serious competitor of the private banks, its efforts were not appreciated, and steps were taken to reduce the competition. A plot was hatched to curb the activities of the Commonwealth Bank. It could not be destroyed altogether, because it was too well established, but it was to be rendered ineffective. "What was the method applied in order to render it ineffective? The method was to place it under .the control of a board. In 1924, the Bruce-Page Government appointed a board of eight to take over control of the bank from the Governor. It is interesting to note the similarity between the board which was set up in 1924, and the board which it is now proposed to appoint. In 1924, the board of eight included two <inline font-style="italic">ex officio</inline> members, the Secretary to the Treasury, and the Governor of the bank. The present bill .provides for the establishment of a board of ten members, ineluding three <inline font-style="italic">ex officio</inline> members, the secretary to the Treasury, the Governor and the Deputy Governor of the Commonwealth Bank. In 1924, the members of the board were chosen from persons who were actively engaged in agriculture, commerce, finance and industry, and I should like to hear honorable members opposite dispute the fact that those persons did actually represent the private banks. </para>
                <para>It is interesting to recall what the original bank board did, because I think that we should bear it in mind when assessing the likely results of the restoration of the bank board. I direct the attention of the House to three activities that the board set about achieving, after it was established in 1924, in order to strangle the Commonwealth Bank. First, the board set out deliberately to curtail the trading activities of the bank by refusing new business. That policy ensured that there would be no more competition with the trading banks. That fact was well established by evidence before the Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systems in Australia. It is probably within the personal knowledge of most honorable members that the Commonwealth Bank in those days refused to accept new business if that business would have been taken from the private banks. The result was that there was no more active competition from the Commonwealth Bank, so the trading banks achieved their objective in that way. </para>
                <para>The second way in which the activities of the Commonwealth Bank were curtailed was by separating the savings bank section from the general activities of that institution. That subtle move was most effective, because the Commonwealth Bank had succeeded in establishing a large savings bank business. By 1927, the deposits with the Savings Bank section of the Commonwealth Bank amounted to £47,000,000. When the savings bank section was separated from the rest of the bank, all the revenue and the profits arising from that side of the business and all the big financial resources that gave the Commonwealth Bank strength and stability, were taken away from that institution, so that its general structure was weakened. That was the second way in which, after the establishment of the board, the Commonwealth Bank was being strangled. It is interesting to note that the separation of the savings bank activities from the general banking activities of the Commonwealth Bank was made on the recommendation of a titled gentleman from abroad, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Ernest</inline> Harvey, the Comptroller of the Bank of England. The Commonwealth Bank was then developed as a central bank, but not in the sense in which we understand central banking to-day, whereby the central bank exercises some control over the activities of the general financial and monetary policy of the country in the interests of the people. It functioned largely as a clearing house for the benefit of the private banks, without exercising any real or effective control over them. The Commonwealth Bank, operating in that way, was of benefit to the private banks and served their purposes, yet it had no control over them in the interests of the people. </para>
                <para>That statement leads me to the third method by which, after the bank board was established, the activities of the Commonwealth Bank were curtailed. Actually, everything had been done but destroy the bank completely. However, it would not have been expedient for the government of the day to make a straight-out proposal to sell the bank, and, therefore, it did the next best thing. In 1938, after the Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systems in Australia had made its report, the then Treasurer in the Lyons Government, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Casey,</inline> introduced a bill, the effect of which would have been to sell the assets of the Commonwealth Bank to the private financial institutions of this country. At this point, I pause to remark that a number of the leading members of the present Government were also members of the Lyons Government at the time to which I refer. The bill, which was introduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Casey,</inline> provided that the capital of the Commonwealth Bank should be increased by the issue of debentures to a maximum amount of £34,000,000. It was quite unnecessary to increase the capital of the bank in that manner. The Commonwealth Bank had commenced with a capital of £10,000, a loan that had been made by the Treasury, yet it had not been necessary at any time for the bank to raise more money. The institution established its own reserves and capital from its profits. However, the Lyons Government proposed that £34,000,000 worth of debentures should be issued to provide capital for the bank, and the interest on them would have been paid out of its profits. Furthermore, those debentures would have been available to the public and the private banks for purchase. 1 emphasize that the private banks would have been able to buy the debentures, and, in that way, would have gained control of the capital of the Commonwealth Bank. </para>
                <para>I put it to the House that those are three good and substantial reasons why honorable members on this side of the chamber have grave suspicions about the proposal to revive the Commonwealth </para>
                <para class="block">Bank Board. I remind the House again that when the board was appointed in 1924, it curtailed the trading activities of the Commonwealth Bank and separated the savings bank activities from the general banking activities, thus weakening the general banking structure of the institution. By the proposal to issue debentures which, fortunately, was withdrawn because of the outcry from the people, the government of the day would have transferred the bank completely from the control of the people to the private financial institutions. </para>
                <para>There is another reason why we suspect this effort to restore the Commonwealth Bank Board. Despite statements by honorable members opposite, we cannot dismiss the lessons of the depression in the airy words that were used by the honorable member for Curtin <inline font-style="italic">Q/Lt.</inline> Hasluck), who said that the mistakes that were made iri those years were due to sheer ignorance and not to the method of control that was exercised over the bank. The honorable member for Hume <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charles Anderson)</inline> went further than that, and said that none of the attacks by members of the Opposition on the private banks had been substantiated in any way. I do not propose to say much about the depression, but I may sum up in a few words by stating that it is not true to say that the private banks were responsible for the depression, or that they caused it. There was a general collapse of overseas markets and prices, and, in addition, the gross extravagance of the Bruce-Page Government would have brought any country, however prosperous, to its knees, and reduced it to bankruptcy. But it is equally untrue to say that the banks had no part in the depression and that many of the attendant evils could not have been averted if a  wise and enlightened monetary and banking policy had been adopted. I challenge honorable members opposite to deny that, during the years of the depression, the banks called in their advances. During the boom years they had lent bigger amounts than they should have, and when the bubble burst and deflationary conditions set in. they called in their advances. </para>
                <para>According to figures that I have obtained, the advances of the private  banks between December,  1929,  and March,  1932,  were reduced by approximately  £45,000,000.  In those years the depth of the depression was reached, and the trading banks called in  £45,000,000  worth of advances. They did precisely the reverse of what they should have done. If they had lent another  £45,000,000  during those years, they would have done much to alleviate the misfortunes that were associated with the depression. I challenge honorable members opposite to deny that those figures are correct, and that the private banks, by calling in  £45,000,000  worth of advances, contributed to the miseries and misfortunes that were associated with the years of depression. Furthermore, we cannot forget that the Commonwealth Bank Board allied itself with the disastrous policy of the trading banks. It refused to grant a fiduciary note issue of  £18,000,000  that the then Treasurer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Theodore,</inline> had requested. That additional money would have reduced unemployment and alleviated the miseries of the people who were suffering from the depression. I have given that cursory sketch of the background of the Commonwealth Bank because we should bear those facts in mind when we are considering this bill. </para>
                <para>The Chifley Government made a great advance in banking legislation in  1945.  In my opinion, the Banking Act and the Commonwealth Bank Act, which were passed in that year, constitute the most important legislation that has been enacted by this Parliament since its establishment at the beginning of the century. The Commonwealth Bank Act placed beyond all doubt that the Commonwealth Bank should operate as a central bank and should continue with its general banking activities. I was interested to note that the Government does not propose to repeal section  12  of that act, and I shall be interested to see how it is operated in future if the bank board should be appointed. Section  12 (2.)  provides - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>The Bank, through the General Banking Division, shall not refuse to conduct hanking business for any person, by reason only of the fact that to conduct that business would have the effect of taking away business from another bank. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>That provision ensures that the disgraceful policy that was pursued by the Commonwealth Bank when it was controlled by a board after  1924  shall not be repeated. The Commonwealth Bank  Act 1945  also provided for the establishment of other departments of the bank to cater for branches of banking business, such as the industrial finance department and the mortgage bank department, 'which were not adequately catered for by the private banks. The Banking Act  1945,  which is complementary to the Commonwealth Bank Act, made provision for the two matters that are the crux of this debate, namely, the establishment of special accounts for lodgment by the private banks, and the control of interest rates by the Commonwealth Bank. Some Opposition speakers have stated that the trading banks, which contributed so heavily to the election expenses of the Liberal party and the Australian Country party, were waiting for the pay-off. Whether the private banks made payments to individuals, or made a big fund available generally to those two political parties I do not know; but there is no doubt that the trading banks did contribute a substantial sum of money to the electoral expenses of the Government parties. I know that in my electorate there were teams of from  30  to  40  men out canvassing every day for weeks on end, working in the interest of the Liberal candidate. I have no complaint against those men as individuals. They were sent out, of course, as economic conscripts. They had to do as they were told by their employers. Their wages were being paid by the banks, and that very important contribution was being made to the Liberal party propaganda in the election campaign. It is only reasonable that the private trading hanks, which made such a big and valuable contribution to the propaganda of the parties opposite during that election campaign, must get their pay-off, their rake-off. It is common talk round the country that the pay-off that the banks are to get is twofold. In the first place they want the special accounts system abolished. That system was established originally by members of the present Government when they were previously in office, for a very good purpose. As the Commonwealth Bank has stated in its last report - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>The Central Bank has been able, by making calls to banks' Special Accounts, to draw off from the banking system a considerable part of the additional cash arising from war-time finance and the growth of overseas funds, and to immobilize it, thus preventing its use as a base for a secondary inflation. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">If those special accounts were released, the results would be a huge flow of new money on to the market, a great expansion of credit, more impetus to the inflationary spiral and a further disastrous rise in prices. I put it to honorable members that that is one of the prices being demanded from this Government by the interests that supported it during the last general election campaign, and that it is one of the things that will happen if this proposed board is established. If the board system is re-established the new board will, by administrative action, release those special accounts, and all that frozen money will flow on to the market. The people will suffer the consequences by having to pay higher prices and because inflation will get further and further out of hand. </para>
                <para>The second thing that will happen if the board system is restored is that interest rates will be increased. It is common knowledge that the private banks are now objecting to the present control of interest rates that was established by the 1945 banking legislation which provided- that the Commonwealth Bank should control such rates in the interests of the people as a whole and so as to maintain a stable financial and economic structure. The interest rate on money lent by overdraft is pegged at <inline font-style="italic">4{</inline> per cent., but propaganda has now commenced to flow from the banks setting out specious reasons why it should be increased. It is common knowledge, as I have said, that if the board system is restored the interest rate will be increased to 4f per cent, and then to 5 per cent. Of course the people will pay the price - the ordinary people, such as people who have bought homes and have borrowed by way of a bank overdraft to do so. They will have to meet extra interest. In my opinion there are not enough people buying their own homes, but those who wish to do so in the future by borrowing on overdraft will have to pay an increased interest rate if the Government has its way. Instead of exposing such people to the iniquitous results that will flow from the restoration of the Commonwealth Bank Board and the consequent increase of interest rates the Government, if it were genuine in its protestations that it has the interests of all the people at heart, would be telling this House and the people that it proposed to reduce the interest rate for home purchasers and that it would use the great financial powers that it possesses through the Commonwealth Bank, to provide home purchase loans foi people at a rate of interest of not mon* than 2 per cent. But it is evident that, far from that happening, one of the prices that the trading banks have demanded and that they will receive as a <inline font-style="italic">quid pro quo</inline> for their help to the parties opposite during the last general election campaign, is that interest rates will he restored to what they were before. We believe that interest rates should not be raised. It is one of the achievements of the Curtin and Chifley Administrations that they were responsible for the era of cheap money in this country. That is an achievement of which they have reason to be proud. We ave opposing this measure because we believe that interest rates should not be increased and that these special accounts should not be wiped out: because we do not want the inflationary spiral to get out of hand; because we believe that inflation must be kept in check, that the money power in this country should not be the master of the people and should not exact such a toll as is inherent in the Government's proposal, at the expense of the people ; and because we believe that the money power should be the servant of the people. We shall fight against this proposed restoration of the Commonwealth Bank Board because, if it is reestablished, the effects that I have indicated will follow. We are opposed to a recurrence of such conditions in this country, and we are determined to fight the restoration of the board system at all costs., </para>

                    <para>. - If the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> were honest he would have described this bill as a bill to hand over the people's bank a second time to the representatives of private interests, because that is what happened in 1924 when the Commonwealth Bank Board was established, without any warrant from the people or any authority from the democracy. In fact, its establishment came as a surprise to  the members of the government party of the day as well as to members of the then Opposition. I shall examine briefly what happened in 1924 and in the preceding general election in 1922. At that election the Leader of the Nationalist party, under which name the present Liberal party then existed, was the present right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes).</inline> The Leader of the Australian Country party at that time was the present right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page).</inline> Immediately after the election the Leader of the Australian Country party delivered his ultimatum to the Nationalist party. He said, " We refuse to serve under <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> any longer ". Unfortunately, for him at any rate, the defeat of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Walter</inline> Massy-Greene, in the electorate of Richmond, by another man of the same name, robbed that gentleman of the chance to succeed to the Prime Ministership and the choice went to the next in line, the then honorable member for Flinders, who is now Viscount Bruce The right honorable member for North <inline font-style="italic">Sydney</inline> did not mention in his policy speech any .proposal for the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank Board, nor was such a proposal mentioned in the Australian Country party's policy speech. As a matter of fact, when the legislation providing for the establishment of the board was before this House, the right honorable member for North Sydney voted against it. The whole proposal was forced upon the Parliament of Australia without any authority from the people, and the Commonwealth Bank, which had been established by a Labour government in 1911 as a. people's bank, became, by virtue of the 1924 legislation, a banker's bank. The 1924 legislation established a Central Reserve Bank for the first time, but associated with it were the original functions of the trading bank known as the Commonwealth Bank. The Central Reserve Bank set out to destroy the competitive capacity of the Commonwealth Bank in relation to the private trading banks. The Labour party at that time opposed the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank Board and from the very time that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Charlton,</inline> the then Leader of the Labour party, who was the honorable member for Hunter, first expressed the view of the Labour party, we have been intransigently opposed to any board controlling the destinies of the Commonwealth Bank. We have strong reasons for our attitude. Let us consider the milestones in the banking history of this country. In 1893, during a depression period, many banks in Victoria, and some in New South Wales and Queensland, collapsed. There were suicides, destitution on all hands, broken homes, broken hearts and broken fortunes. Some of the wealthiest families in Australia went bankrupt during that period. They included the Bailleaus  and the Finks. The Bailleaus paid  1/4 d.  in £1. The head of the Fink interests 'became known as " Farthing Fink ", but afterwards he paid all the money that he owed. </para>

It paid 3 per cent, interest on the stock, but not until 1945 did it repay to the heirs of some of the original holders and to the other people who had received the scrip one penny of the principal- </para>

                        <para>- The Labour party put the legislation through. Will the honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bowden)</inline> ever wake up? The Labour party passed the legislation and the people who opposed it were those who thought as the honorable member for Gippsland thinks to-day. The Fisher Government established the note issue in 1911 and the same opposition was expressed to the Australian Government issuing its own notes. Before that time the private banks had issued their notes and had made a lot of profit out of doing so. The Australian Government taxed the notes issued by the private banks and so made it no longer profitable for them to carry on that line of business. What was the reaction of the press, the tories and their ilk of the day? They joined in one long chorus of denunciation. The honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bird)</inline> referred to the fact that the tories of that time said that "Fisher's flimsies", as the Commonwealth Bank's notes were then called, would not be worth 5s. on any street corner before six months had passed. To-day, 40 years afterwards, nobody in Australia can say that an Australian note was ever offered anywhere in Australia for less than its equivalent value in goods. The people who were making money out of the note issue were the people who complained about Labour's legislation. We established the Commonwealth Bank; we established the note issue; and we established the Commonwealth Savings Bank. Out of the activities of all these functions of government a profit of £86,000,000 was made between 1911 and 1949. If there had never been a Commonwealth Bank - and there never would have been such a bank if there had not been a Labour party - and if there had never been a Commonwealth note issue, every penny of that profit of £86,000,000 would have gone to the shareholders of the private banking institutions. That profit was made, not for the shareholders of private banking institutions, but for the people of Australia. It has been paid to the credit of the Government and has been used to expand the capital of some of the departments of the Commonwealth Bank and, in earlier years for the reduction of our indebtedness. All the profits from the Commonwealth note issue are expended by a committee of which the Treasurer of the day is the  chairman  and the Chief Justice of Australia is a member. We claim all the credit for the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank. We claim all the credit for taking the issue of notes from the private trading banks and placing whatever profit is derived from them, which has so far amounted to £55,000,000, to the use of the nation. By the Banking Act 1945 we restored the Commonwealth Bank to the position which it had occupied before it was mauled in 1924. There was nothing wrong with the Commonwealth Bank between 1911- and 1924 under the governorship of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison</inline> Miller. It grew and expanded its activities. It financed Australia in World War I. at a nominal rate of interest. It saved the country millions of pounds which otherwise would have had to be paid to the private banking institutions. It also helped to finance the construction of the East- West railway and many other undertakings. But between 1924 and 1945 it was stultified because of the activities of the Commonwealth Bank Board. Who were the men who constituted that board? They were estimable gentleman and good citizens, but none of them knew anything about banking. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Gibson became  chairman  of the Commonwealth Bank Board in his sixties. He had been a very successful businessman. He had made a  lot of beds. He made large profits out of making beds, but he will be remembered in history as the man who made a hard bed for 700,000 Australians to lie on during the depression years. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> Mackenzie Lees was another member of the board. He had been  chairman  of .the Associated Banks of Queensland and manager of the Bank of Queensland, an institution which was pretty " rocky " at one stage. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. A.</inline> F. Bell, the  chairman  of the Union Trustee Company, was a member of the board of the National Bank of Australasia Limited immediately prior to his appointment to the Commonwealth Bank Board. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Olive</inline> McPherson was also a member of the board of the National Bank of Australasia Limited before he became a member of the Commonwealth Bank Board. Does anybody believe that those men, no matter how worthy they may have seemed, could possibly have divested themselves of their interests in the private financial concerns of Australia and have given their attention wholly to the promotion of the interests of the Commonwealth Bank? Of course, they could not. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lees</inline> died while he was a member of the Commonwealth Bank Board. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell</inline> also died while he was a member of the hoard. </para>

                        <para>- That is true. It is the effect and not the enumeration that matters. At all events those investments were to have been free of Federal and State tax. Although the government of the day had sweeping majorities in both Houses of the Parliament the proposition was so hot that it was dropped. The banking legislation of 1924 and 1931 has been referred to by several speakers on the Opposition side of the House. We have dealt with the legislation introduced by the Scullin Government. I have referred to the motion made by the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture in 1934 which led to the establishment of the Royal Commission on Banking and Monetary Systems. I have also referred to the bill that was introduced in 1938 by the present right honorable member for La Trobe. There was also the Banking Act  1  945 and the banking legislation of 1947 which were introduced by the present Leader of the Opposition. Now there is the 1950 bill which is as still-born as was the measure that was introduced by the present right honorable member for La Trobe in 1938. The mental gymnastics in which members of the Australian Country party have engaged on the subject of banking amaze me. The Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anthony)</inline> has participated in this debate. In a speech which the honorable gentleman delivered in this Bouse on the 26th May, 1938, he told us of the plight of the dairy fanners of Queensland, which, he said, was due to the fact that they were heavily indebted to the private banking institutions of that State.

                        <para>- They and the party to which they belonged had not discovered the advantages to be obtained from a socialistic institution like the Commonwealth Bank. At that time less than 100 dairy farmers out of 12,000 had incomes of more than £5 a week. How any member of the Australian Country party can rise in defence of the private banking institutions passes my comprehension. In 1934 the Gepp Commission which was appointed to inquire into the state of the wheat industry found that the wheat farmers of Australia owed the private banks £154,000,000. Notwithstanding that, the representatives of the Australian Country party in the Senate in 1931 voted against the proposal of the Scullin Government to issue fiduciary notes which would have enabled that government to guarantee the farmers 5s. a bushel for their wheat. </para>

If he did so and were frank he would admit that, of the proposed fiduciary issue of £18,000,000, the Scullin Government proposed to set aside £6,000,000 in order to enable it to guarantee the farmers 5s. a bushel for their wheat. The representatives of the Liberal and Australian Country parties in the Senate defeated thi. measure with the result that farmers on ihe Horsham plains in Victoria took ls. 7d. a bushel for their wheat. That is the truth. Private banks have crushed the primary producers of this country. The Australian people have nothing to thank the private banks for. </para>

                    <para>In 1914 the surplus of assets over liabilities of the banks of Australia was £5,071,000. After three years of human misery, tragedy and misfortune, during which thousands and thousands of our people suffered indescribably, the surplus of assets over liabilities of these banks had increased to £26,447,000. That was in 1917. In the post-war period, when chickens were coming home to roost and when every industry in Australia was floundering in a morass of difficulty because of the sharp ascent of prices, what happened to the banks? The Leader of the Opposition quoted certain figures to show what the assets and liabilities of the banks were on the 20th March last. I took his figures and by the simple process of subtraction found that the surplus of liabilities over assets at that date was £7fi.792,000. </para>

                <para class="block">The misery of the depression had not affected the banks. Their assets had risen and their surplus of assets over liabilities was £76,000,000 in 1931 as compared with £5,000,000 in 1914. The banks did well out of the depression. They always do well out of human misery, and from 1914, they had planted, in addition to the £13,000,000 in reserve funds, amounts to bring those reserve funds up to £33,000,000 in 1928. No wonder honorable members opposite speak with guilty consciences when they try to defend the priva.te banks of this country. The private banking institutions are a collection of traders who have monopolized the credit of the nation for the purpose of making profit for themselves and their shareholders. The private banking institutions have bought governments and politicians, and honorable members opposite largely owe their positions in this Parliament to the fact that the private banks spent large sums of money on their behalf at the general election. Is any honorable member opposite prepared to say he has not taken donations from private trading banks? </para>
                <para>Government Members. - Yes .' </para>

                    <para>- Of course they took them. The honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bowden)</inline> is not a leader of his party. How does he know what was done? It is the people at the top who take the donations, and they allow them to percolate down to the people in the lower strata. There are people in this Parliament who have had a lot to do with private trading banks. The honorable member for Wannon <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mackinnon)</inline> left a bank board when he got into this Parliament, but the press did not announce that until this bank bill had been introduced. I challenge his right to speak here because of his interest in a private bank and I challenge the right of the honorable member for Evans <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Osborne)</inline> to speak or to vote on this issue because he is the head of a legal firm which is the legal adviser to the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney Limited. He is financially interested.  His  brother is managing director of that bank. It happens, by chance, that a gentleman named Card, who is associated with a bank employees' organization, and who was to be elected as Liberal candidate for the electorate of Evans, had to move from that seat so that somebody else could take his place. </para>

                    <para>. - We have just heard a characteristic speech by the honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell)</inline> on a favourite subject. I made a note of his text, which was for once, accidentally I think, on the beam. It was, "We are now handing over the Commonwealth Bank to private interests". The title of the bill declares that its purpose is to repeal the Banking Act 1947-1948 and to amend the Commonwealth Bank Act 1945-1948. The honorable gentleman was right insofar as the object of the bill is to make the Commonwealth Bank a people's bank and no longer a politicians' bank, which it became under the Labour party. Finance is a popular subject with socialists, Communists and all demagogues. Their theme is that they have only to nationalize the Commonwealth Bank and they acquire great wealth and prosperity in some magical way. They will not leave finance to the people who understand how to manage banks. The theme is familiar and threadbare. The honorable member for Melbourne began his speech with a flourish and started to repeat the old story that we have heard so often about the banks robbing the people. When I interjected that they had repaid their debts and had paid interest as well, he made a gallant endeavour to extricate himself from an awkward situation, but had to admit that they had done so. However, he said that they had taken a long time about it and had finally discharged their responsibilities to the heirs of the original depositors. I am reminded of what happened to the Government Savings </para>

                <para class="block">Bank of New South Wales during the depression, when a Labour government was in power in that State. One saw many advertisements in the Sydney newspapers offering bank books at 10s. in the £1, and many people sold them at that rate. The only bank of importance in Australia that closed its doors was the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales, operating under a Labour regime. </para>
                <para>The so-called wizards of finance in opposition want to tell the nation how to conduct its financial affairs. They believe in socialization of everything. Banking is only a part of the pattern of their whole scheme. I have here a copy of the Labour party's handbook, the <inline font-style="italic">Constitution and Platform of the Australian Labour Party,</inline> about which members of the Opposition do not talk in this Parliament. The first principle of action stated in the booklet is socialization of industry, the old Marxist idea. In parenthesis, the nationalization of banking and insurance appeal's at the head of the list. </para>

                        <para>- I respect the honorable member's opinion. He, at least, is frank.  His  leaders try to make us believe that they can do the job of banking better than it could be done by a bank board. It is rather pathetic that the Labour party should continue to flog this ancient and sorry theme, the fallacy of which was exploded long ago. The people have shown that they want to reject socialism. They have taken power away from the Labour party. They have done the Herculean job of cleaning the Augean stable, but the Labour party still has a dead horse there that it believes will gallop. This pathetic situation arises from what has become an obsession in the mind of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> . The right honorable gentleman was appointed to a royal commission that was set up by an anti-Labour government to inquire into monetary and banking systems.- Our purpose in establishing the commission was to have a fair inquiry made into the subject of finance, and therefore we appointed a Labour representative to that body. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, a very fair representation of public opinion in my view. I accept some blame for that appointment, because I was a member of the government of the day. We chose a man whom we thought would have sensible views, but we were soon disillusioned. The honorable member for Melbourne has claimed that the Leader of the Opposition was the sole democrat on the commission. He merely followed the line that was used by the Labour party during the general election campaign in referring to the right honorable gentleman as an Abraham Lincoln type who had been God-sent suddenly to the Australian people. </para>

                <para>The present Leader of the Opposition travelled round Australia with the perambulating royal commission that I have mentioned. Anybody who studies the voluminous report that it produced will find that the honorable member for Melbourne was quite right. It shows that only one member of the commission could think along certain lines. Only one man was in step! The present Leader of the Opposition was the author of the minority report in almost every instance. But he discovered one truth, a fact of which the honorable member for Melbourne does not seem to be aware. That truth was that the trading banks did not exploit the people. The right honorable gentleman reported that the amount of their profits was moderate. He was a signatory to that portion of the commission's report. </para>

                        <para>- We heard the honorable gentleman speak at length, and I am now answering some of the fallacious statements that he has disseminated over the years in this Parliament and else where. It is time that these claims were exploded for all time. Does not the honorable member realize that the sort of nonsense that he has been uttering has exiled the Labour party into the political wilderness, and that, through the present Leader of the Opposition becoming obsessed with the belief that he should be a financial dictator and bringing down legislation to give effect to that obsession, the Labour party has been reduced to its now depleted size in opposition? Does he not know that the Victorian State elections that were fought at the time of the hanking issue in this Parliament were won by the anti-Labour parties because an indignant people was not impressed by the slogan " Let  Chif  do it " ? People who had bank accounts or who owned houses admitted that socialism might be a good thing but said, " We are not ready for it. We happen to have something and we are not going to divide it with other people ". </para>

                <para>Socialism is a grand idea to the Communist who has no personal possessions and thus finds it profitable to urge the division of the world's goods equally amongst the people of the world.

                        <para>- The honorable member has never given anything away. I bought this copy for myself. The price was one shilling. Probably the banks financed its publication, because it is the best piece of propaganda for our side that could 'possibly have been produced. I remind the Parliament that when the Labour party was in power it brought down an unwanted, wasteful and almost totalitarian piece of legislation, not only to extend the activities of the Commonwealth Bank, but also to liquidate all private banks and forcibly to conscript industrially the 20,000 men who worked in those institutions. If those men had the spirit to fight the Labour machine, good luck to them! The Labour party offered them higher wages in the Commonwealth Bank, but they preferred their freedom, which is a British trait that we should admire. If they helped us to gain victory over the Labour party, good luck to them! That ruthless and dictatorial legislation provided for the liquidation of the private banks in the matter of a few days. They were to be sold up. Tremendous penalties were provided for managers who resisted the plan. That legislation was passed through this Parliament only a, few years ago, and now members of the Labour party bleat from the Opposition benches that the banks were responsible for their defeat. The truth is that their defeat was brought about by an indignant people that was tired of their socialist shibboleths and decided to get back to democratic government again. "What is the great bone of contention in the bill before the House ? What is the <inline font-style="italic">piece de resistance'1.</inline> Members of the Opposition have tried very hard to mask their real intention to socialize banking. They have found the proposal to be unpopular and they will not talk about it in this Parliament now. Therefore, they are attacking the proposal to establish a Commonwealth Bank Board. What objection can there be to the appointment of a board within the bank in order to give financial advice to the Government? </para>

The main pretence of the Opposition now is that it objects to the proposal to establish a Commonwealth Bank Board. There has been no objection over the years to the Tariff Board. Who in this Parliament or elsewhere will say that it has not facilitated the economic development of Australia? It holds public inquiries and gives advice to governments on rates of tariff and on ways of helping certain industries. It has done great good over the years. Yet members of the Opposition object because this Government has decided that there shall be a board to advise it on financial matters whose members will know something about trading banks instead of the Yarra bank! They declare that the members of the board will not be the right people and will work for self-interest instead of for the nation. </para>

                <para>Members of the Opposition tell tales of misery in the depression, but they do not remind us that the Labour party was in power when unemployment was at its greatest flood. These so-called wizards of finance held the reins of office and, had they wanted a double dissolution of this Parliament, they could have brought it about at any time. But they did not dare to seek a new election and, when the time came, the people swept them from office and elected a government that believed in decent commercial principles. That has happened again. We are now repealing a socialist error, an infamy that was put upon the people, an act of ill-intent that the Labour Government committed in order to destroy a British tradition. The Labour party's banking legislation is in line with the Russian ideal. Lenin's great fiat of 1917 was that, if a. Government wanted complete control of the people, it must first seize the banks. Even the Dean of Canterbury says that socialism is the half-way house on the road to communism, and he knows something about both creeds. Yet this dejected and shattered party in opposition still adheres to its socialistic shibboleths. Why does it not take its courage in both hands and say, " Yes, we were wrong in the past. We followed a pied piper in the person of our leader, who thought that he was a financial wizard, but he only led us into the wilderness ". Members of the </para>
                <para class="block">Opposition should realize that a bank board consisting of reputable citizens and presided over by the present Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, who was appointed by the Labour party, will ensure that the interests of the people of Australia shall be protected. Under the Labour party's system the Treasurer was undoubtedly the financial dictator of Australia. He held in his hands the destinies of every industry and business and every citizen. Had he had his way, the competition which exists at present between the trading banks would have disappeared. If a man cannot get an advance at one bank now he can try another. </para>

                        <para>- If that has been the honorable member's experience it has not been mine. Whether an advance is granted or not depends upon the applicant's credit. It is the financial and the commercial enterprise of the British people that has placed them in such a high position as they occupy among the nations of the world. Following an alien belief, the Australian Labour party adopted in 1921 a policy for the socialization of the means of production, distribution and exchange. A Labour Prime Minister did not attempt to carry out that policy until recently. When it became apparent that the policy was to be implemented the people emphatically rejected it. The Commonwealth Bank will now return to a management that will give the whole of Australia greater prosperity and ensure the welfare of its people. </para>

                        <para>.-! rise to direct attention to the failure of the Prime Minister ( <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Menzies)</inline> at question time to-day to give a straightforward reply to a question I had asked with reference to the statement appearing in the press that the Government contemplated certain activities in connexion with the Malayan campaign. There has .been a great deal of press comment about the possibility of Australia becoming an active participant in operations in that area. I think it is a very serious and important matter for the Australian people, about which they desire some definite information. I therefore directed a question to the Prime Minister to-day seeking some advice as to whether the Government contemplated involving this country in active participation in that campaign. I also asked what were the vital Australian interests referred to in the press articles. In one newspaper the statement regarding vital Australian interests was attributed to the Prime Minister himself. If it be a matter of defending private investments, I believe that they are not worth the loss of one Australian life. Therefore, this Government should state exactly what it proposes to do. According to the press, the Government is not only considering active participation in the Malayan campaign, but also thinks it should become involved in all the Asian campaigns. There is some suggestion that the Government should do something about straightening out the position in Burma. These are very serious matters which are not affected by the fact that people may volunteer for service. From the viewpoint of the nation the important thing is whether Australia should become involved. I believe, myself, that the Australian people would take a very dim view  of any action by the Government which would involve them once again in active warfare. It is of the utmost importance to Australia that our people should live at peace with their neighbours. If the matter be one of defending investments, the British or the Americans or any other people who have interests in those areas, if they find the campaign going against them, can retire. They do not have to live in such close proximity to Asia as Australians do. When members of the Opposition direct questions to the Government upon important matters they do not want to be brushed aside by replies which are not answers to the questions. I want the Government to say plainly, and in unmistakable language, whether it is contemplating .any participation in these various campaigns. Any such participation would be a grave mistake from the point of view of the people of this country. The Australian Government would be held up to strong criticism from a large section of the Australian people. This nation which is now short of man-power cannot 'afford to become involved in any of these overseas adventures. Therefore I ask the Government to state specifically whether any approach has been made to it for the provision of forces for operations in these areas, and if so what attitude it is adopting. I should prefer from an Australian viewpoint, that the Government should say unequivocally that in no circumstances will Australian forces be used in those areas. </para>

                        <para>. - 1 direct the attention of the House to the condition of affairs in the eastern States following the floods that occurred prior to the Easter vacation and which continued in many parts during the vacation. The damage done during those floods has assumed the proportions of a national calamity. I appreciate that the position is largely one to be dealt with by the States, but so grave is it in many parts of the country that I consider it to be worthy of mention here. There are many phases of this damage. In my electorate I heard with much grief that lives were lost. The damage to roads is considerable. Unfortunately it is not possible at .the present time fully to estimate the damage, but in the Shire of Coonabarabran the estimated damage is of the order of £50,000. The Municipality of Mudgee has supplied me with a figure of £1,455 worth of damage in that town, and I expect that .throughout the whole of the electorate of Lawson the damage will be of similar degree. The Castlereagh River, which is one of the streams in flood, is a swift running river and practically all the bridges or the approaches to the bridges over that river have been swept away. Fencing has been extensively damaged. It has not been just rolled over as is the case in flat country, but entire fences have been washed away from both sides of the river. I have a telegram from the Coonabarabran Pastures Protection Board - only one of such boards in my electorate - which reads as follows : " Estimate flood damage loss Coonabarabran Board £150,000. Five hundred miles fencing lost". The fencing problem is not one that stands alone because when fences are lost rabbits, which are controlled to some extent by fences, are free to run over the pastures. Moreover, fly-blown sheep present many difficulties because in that area the pasture is  pratically  one large paddock. </para>

                    <para>The damage to agricultural land through soil erosion is extensive. That damage is noticed at seeding time, because the ground is so moist that it is impossible to get machinery on it to proceed with the sowing. Ultimately we shall unfortunately have to reap the wild oats through not having the normal wheat crop in. The damage to wool is considerable, apart from fly strike, and is estimated at 25 per cent, in some parts of the area. The stock losses have not been computed because as so much fencing has been lost it i3 impossible to muster, nor is it desirable, because of the flies. As far as domestic damage is concerned, houses have been swept away and people have lost all their possessions. In some cases whilst the dwelling still remains the furniture and personal belongings have been lost. In one small village of 30 houses 25 were affected by flood, fifteen having nothing left in them that was not completely ruined by flood waters., All that adds up to a sum total which is in the nature of a national calamity. .State activities through the medium of the Flood Belief Committee have been very satisfactory. </para>
                    <para class="block">The committee has given immediate personal assistance by way of food, blankets and clothing, but it is hampered to some extent by lack of funds. I suggest to the responsible Minister that he should urge the federal representative on the committee to see that any distribution of supplies in the nature of fencing materials shall be made on an equitable basis. If it were sent in bulk then the position would be " first come best dressed ", which would be a most unfortunate state of affairs. The supply of fencing material is a matter for the States, but it is deplorable that at this time, when such material is so urgently needed, it is in such short supply on account of the recent dislocation of industry. I believe that we are still feeling the effects of the coal strike of last year, and that the manufacture of fencing wire, steel posts and wire netting is still being delayed. Every effort should be made by the Government to increase the production of those commodities, which are so urgently needed for the repair of flood damage. I suggest to the Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Francis)</inline> that army engineering units might be used to assist shires in the reconstruction of roads. It is physically impossible for local bodies to do this work with the materials and labour at their disposal. Monetary assistance, not by way of gift, but by way of loan, is necessary to enable land-owners and tenant farmers to get back into production. This is necessary, not so much for their own sake, as for the sake of the nation. The recent floods hit poor and rich alike, without discrimination. Many persons who could ill afford the loss were deprived of everything, and they are deserving of help. Even if money were made available, it would be impossible to repair all the damage immediately, because materials are not available. If the work could be done before the end of June, farmers would be able to claim a reduction of income tax. During the war, sections 53a and 53c of the Income Tax Assessment Act was invoked to allow taxpayers, who were prevented by shortage of materials from carrying out immediate repairs, to deposit the cost with the Treasury, and thus become eligible to claim <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> tax rebate. I suggest that the provision should now be applied to those. who have suffered from the floods, because the circumstances are similar to those which prevailed during the war. In my district, the damage caused by the flood was very great, and I believe that some other honorable members have even worse tales to tell. I am convinced that the Government will co-operate to ti: fullest extent with the States in alleviating distress. I ask that the Government be not parsimonious, and that it arrange to raise a special loan for the purpose if that is considered necessary. </para>

                        It seems incredible to me that in a country which has just passed through one of the worst wars in the history of the world we should have a government that is doing its utmost to invite other nations to engage in another bloody conflict.

                            <para>- I give that assurance. This Government is hellbent on another war with some one, for the obvious reason that it represents the persons who always profit from wars. The Government represents those who become millionaires overnight from war. The Government was put into power by those who profit while others die. What the honorable member for East Sydney said about Malaya is true. If this invitation by the British Government to Australia to participate in the conflict is merely an invitation to assist in defending some millionaire's capital in Malaya, then the whole of the capital involved is not worth one Australian life. Let us look at the position in Malaya, and con sider the circumstances that brought about the present conflict. It was brought about by British Imperialism. The cold, hard fact is that the persons whom this Government represents are interested only in the exploitation of raw materials and the people of Malaya. Now the Government is doing its very best to persuade the British Government to permit it to intervene in the dispute in order that good Labour men may be shot in the defence of British capital, and so that the capitalists of Australia, whom the Government represents, can make a few more millions, as they did during the last war, and during every other war. This Government claims to be democratic, and to represent the ordinary people. Well, the ordinary people do not want war. The ordinary people do not want to fight in Malaya. The Malays have as much right to be allowed to mind their own business as we have to mind ours. What is happening in Malaya has nothing to do with this Government, or with any other government. It is a tragedy that there should be in office in Australia at this time a government that is bent upon making another war, and that it should be going out of its way to invite the British Government to permit it to send decent Labour men to defend the capital invested in Malaya by British, Australian and American millionaires. </para>

                        <para>. - I propose to discuss a matter that affects the Department of the Interior. It relates to charges made in government hostels, and I have been informed that representations made to departmental officials on this point have been unsuccessful. The practice is to grant a rebate of board to residents of hostels who take advantage of holiday week-ends to absent themselves from Canberra in order to visit Sydney or Melbourne or places in other States. This practice has been followed for many years, but within the last few weeks an alteration has been made which limits the period of time for which a rebate may be claimed. I am quarrelling, not with that, but with the way in which the provision is applied. The present situation appears to be Gilbertian, and I am sure that it will be corrected by the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McBride)</inline> now that it has been brought to his notice. Over the Easter week-end, the stipulation was made that a rebate of board would be allowed to those who were absent from the hostels over the holiday period, but only on the condition that they appeared in the dining-room of their hostel on Tuesday morning for 'breakfast. It is impossible, so far as I can ascertain, to find a reason for this curious stipulation. Nevertheless, representations made to departmental officials by residents of the hostels have been unsuccessful, and the only course open to me, therefore, is to bring the matter to the notice of the Minister. It is important to the residents since an absence of four days may involve a rebate of £1 15s., which in these days of high and rising costs means much to the men and the women who live in government hostels. In one case that was brought to my notice a resident, having been absent for four days over Easter, paid £5 5s. as board for a fortnight. That was accepted, because it was recognized that he had been absent for four days. However, on the following day, he was informed that he must pay an additional £1 15s. because he had not appeared in the dining-room for breakfast on Tuesday morning. Apart from other considerations, many people do not eat breakfast, and it may be that after a holiday period some persons might regard breakfast with particular aversion. If it is necessary to restrict the period of absence for which a rebate may be claimed, it should be done without making it a condition that the claimant shall partake of breakfast on Tuesday morning. The rebate could be limited to the actual days of the holiday week-end. If a guest were absent for more than those days he should, perhaps, be not allowed to claim a rebate for the extra period of absence. That there should be any physical necessity for him to partake of breakfast on Tuesday morning in order to obtain the benefit of the rebate for the period during which he had been absent from the hostel, appears to me to be entirely absurd. I commend the matter to the Minister for the Interior and trust that, upon investigation, he will have  thi9  apparent anomaly corrected. </para>

                        <para>.- I cannot allow to pass without comment the accusations of warmongering that have been made by the honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> and the honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Clyde Cameron)</inline> against honorable members on this side of the chamber. I find it incredible that the honorable member for East Sydney should even consider, on the basis of a report in some newspaper that he did not name, that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> had made a statement that might commit this Government and the country to an act of war. The minds of the people of Australia should be set at rest on this matter, and I believe that unless the Government makes a specific announcement, they should disregard any mention of war that has been made by the honorable member for East Sydney and the honorable member for Hindmarsh. The majority of honorable members on this side of the chamber have known the horrors of war, and only those who are in that position realize the futility of it and the necessity of preserving this country from further conflict. I feel certain that the Government will do everything that it possibly can to prevent this nation from being embroiled in further hostilities. The two honorable members to whom I have referred have, without just cause and on the flimsy basis of a press report about which we know nothing, accused Government supporters of warmongering. If such accusations are to be made, they should be levelled against those two honorable members. For the peace of mind of the people of Australia, this House should treat those statements with the utmost contempt. An honorable member should not speak of such a catastrophe as another war without having some firm basis for his remarks, or in the absence of an authentic statement by the Prime Minister. In all sincerity, I urge honorable members to dismiss from their minds anything that they may read in the newspapers about the matter to which the honorable member for East Sydney and the honorable member for Hindmarsh have referred, because I believe that if such a decision involving Australia were made, this House would be aware of it before any newspaper could publish it. </para>

Lest honorable members opposite are not aware of the position, thousands of rats have invaded various country towns following the recent floods. Even the near suburban areas and the metropolitan area of Sydney itself are suffering from an invasion by those rodents. The Randwick Council and the Botany Council desire, in co-operation with the Bathurst Municipal Council, to assist to exterminate the pests, and for that purpose it will be necessary to employ a considerable number of rodent exterminators and to purchase a considerable quantity of rat poison. I earnestly request the Minister for Supply <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beale)</inline> to refer this matter to Cabinet, and to treat it with expedition and not in the usual manner. We have become accustomed to making requests and being informed, two or three weeks later, that we cannot be given replies because the matters involve Government policy. The extermination of the rats is necessary in the interests of national health, and I ask the Minister, in all sincerity, to endeavour to persuade Cabinet to comply with the requests of those municipal councils and to subsidize the employment of rodent exterminators and the purchase of rat poison. </para>

                        <para>.- The matter of  rat  killing will receive the attention of the Government; but with what success I do not know, because it does occur to me that we are reaching a most extraordinary state of affairs when an appeal is made to the Parliament of the Commonwealth in order that rats may be killed in the suburbs and country towns of a particular State. Apparently, it is because somebody concerned has no faith in the particular State government to do something that is obviously a State responsibility. I do not share that lack of faith.

The honorable member believes that the extermination of rats in country towns and the suburbs of the large cities is a matter to which the Australian Government should devote its time and energies. I believe that State governments and municipal councils are not only able but also willing to undertake the responsibility of killing rats.

                            <para>- One implication arising from a statement by the honorable member for Hindmarsh requires comment. The honorable member made an attack, by implication, to my way of thinking, upon the British Government for its action in defending itself and its citizens in Malaya. Let us consider what is really happening in that part of the world. Everybody knows that the red tide is flowing down the Malay peninsula. Everybody who has any brains knows that the constituted Government in Malaya is fighting to preserve, not the property but the established institutions of that country. The British Government; - the British socialist Labour Government, by the way - is sending its troops there to defend what it regards as the right. I assume that every honorable member, with the exception of two odd persons opposite, agrees with that decision. It does not lie in the mouth of the honorable member for Hindmarsh or the honorable member for East Sydney to make such snarling and disreputable attacks on the British Government and its troops in Malaya. If we keep our noses out of that sort of thing, we shall do more to establish the reputation of this Parliament and this country than will the comments of those two . honorable members. I believe that what has been happening in Malaya is of profound importance to Australia, and that the action that the British Government has taken in attempting to defend the existing condition of affairs there should have our sympathy and blessing. </para>

He said that the honorable member was wasting the time of the House in referring to the necessity to exterminate rats - a matter that vitally concerns national health - because this Parliament has more important matters to engage its attention. All I desire to say is that if the honorable member for Watson is asked by two representative bodies in his electorate to make representations in the House on their behalf, he is entitled to do so. In the three previous parliaments of which I have been a member, I have heard all kinds of matters raised, and the Minister himself wasted time on two occasions on the motion for the adjournment when he told us about a chemist who had not been able to obtain certain drugs from the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories in Melbourne. On those occasions the honorable gentleman told an extraordinary story which, of course, was not substantiated. The chemist took the honorable gentleman for a ride. He kept plugging away at that particular subject regarding one chemist, one supply of serum and the payment that was demanded by the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories c.o.d. in consequence of some disfavour in which the chemist found himself. </para>

There are other honorable members here who have talked on night after night about extermination of rabbits. The honorable member for Mallee <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Turnbull),</inline> who was the honorable member for Wimmera in the last Parliament, is an authority on that matter. Nobody denies his right to raise it.

He is entitled to speak about the buffalo fly. Every honorable member is entitled to raise any point that he likes to raise and it ill becomes any Minister, when he rises in his place to give what should be a considered reply to the representations put to his as Minister, to attack an honorable member. </para>

                        <para>.- I desire to raise a matter that may come under the jurisdiction of the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McBride).</inline> I am not quite sure whether the Department of the Interior still controls the Commonwealth Railways, so I wish the matter to be considered by whatever Minister is responsible. It is only incidental to the operations of the Commonwealth Railways. I refer to the aborigines at Ooldea in South Australia. Recently, for the first time in four years, I came east on the Commonwealth Railway. When the train stopped at Ooldea we were, as on the previous occasion, approached in the dining car where we happened to be, by a number of aborigines. It has been customary for passengers to hand fruit to aborigines at Ooldea and for the cooks on the train to do the same thing. The aborigines were in a very poor physical condition, especially the old ones, and some of them had white growths over their eyes, which I understand to be one of the symptoms of dietary dificiency over a long period. It would not seem to be a very difficult thing that the Commonwealth, which operates the transcontinental railways, should put on board the train some sacks of fruits, such as oranges or any other fruit that scientific advisers state has the necessary vitamin content, to be off-loaded at Ooldea for those aborigines. If it is desired that they should make some payment for it, there are enough museums all over the world to buy specimens of aboriginal work such as boomerangs and other implements to recoup the Government for the cost entailed. I am quite sure that there would be no demoralization involved if  the Commonwealth Railways distributed this sort of largess to the aborigines. Fruit could be placed aboard at Kalgoorlie when the train was going east and at Port Pirie when the train was going west. I am aware that the natives at Ooldea are not a responsibility of the Australian Government but are under State jurisdiction, and I believe that the States are not permitting the Australian Government to enter into the matter of aboriginal welfare whilst at the same time they are not themselves doing a decent job. At successive conferences of Commonwealth and State Ministers they jealously keep the Australian Government out of this matter. I am not suggesting any large measure of reform of aboriginal policy. This is only a relatively minor matter but it might do something for the well-being of these people. I therefore ask the Minister in charge of the Commonwealth Railways to determine whether or not it would be possible to make this fruit available to supplement the diet of the aborigines, using the trans-continental train as the medium of supply. </para>

                        <para>On the 9th December, 1940, the General Assembly restated its intention that Jerusalem should be placed under a permanent international regime which should envisage appropriate guarantees for the protection of the Holy Places, and requested the Trusteeship Council to complete the preparation of the Statute of Jerusalem, to approve the statute, and proceed immediately with putting it into operation. The draft statute had been drawn up by the Trusteeship Council in 1948 at the direction of the General Assembly. During its present session which began in Geneva, on the 19th January, the Trusteeship Council has been engaged in the first part of its assignment, namely, the revision of the Statute of Jerusalem. The Australian representative has taken full part in the council's discussions. Our latest reports indicate that the revision of individual articles of the statute is almost completed. When the Trusteeship Council has finally approved the revised statute it will probably forward the statute tothe governments most directly concerned, namely, the Governments of Israel and Jordan, with a request for co-operation in its implementation. It is true that, although both the Israel and Jordanian Governments have said they are willing to protect the Holy Places and give guarantees of freedom of access thereto, they have expressed strong opposition to the General Assembly's decision regarding the internationalization of Jerusalem. However, the stage at which they will formally be asked to carry out the Assembly's decision by helping to put into effect the revised statute, has not yetbeen reached. </para>

                        <para>Although until the 30th June, 1951, the annual grant to the Australian National University is subject to the Treasurer's approval and any additional funds for the erection or purchase of buildings it requires are subject to parliamentary approval and the usual Treasury procedures, the university is, nevertheless, a statutory authority, and responsibility for its action lies with the interim council appointed to manage its affairs. I am, however, satisfied that the activities of the university in buying houses in the Australian Capital Territory are not such as would have any appreciable effect on property values and I can assure the honorable member that the university keeps closely in touch with the appropriate Commonwealth departments on this matter. </para>

                        <para>- On the 28th March the honorable member for Moore <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Leslie)</inline> referred to the disastrous fires which had occurred in Western Australia, and asked whether I would consult with the appropriate State authorities to ensure that adequate relief was available to settlers under the War Service Land Settlement Scheme who may have suffered losses. As promised, I have had inquiries made and find that only one settler under the War Service Land Settlement Scheme lost farm buildings during the recent fires in Western Australia. These buildings were insured and arrangements are in train to have them replaced. No settlers suffered loss of hay-stacks, but some lost green feed.  The State Settlement Authority has ample reserves of hay available for soldier settlers in need and can also make available to private farmers at cost approximately 100 tons. I am assured that the position of settlers under the War Service Land Settlement Scheme is satisfactory. </para>

I have investigated this matter, and I find that at the present time hand towels are issued to all personnel in Citizen Military Forces camps of training. Toilet soap is also provided. They are not, however, issued for week-end bivouacs. With regard to toothbrushes and toothpaste, these are personal items which the member uses in civil life, and he can readily bring them to camp with him. There is, therefore, no necessity for an official issue tobe made. </para>
