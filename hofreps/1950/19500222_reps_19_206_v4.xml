                    said  I assure the House that this is the first occasion in my political career on which I have been elected to an office without opposition. At the same time I desire to thank the House for, at worst, its lack of opposition to my election, and, at best, its unanimous confidence in my ability to fulfil this duty. Henceforth, for as long as I retain this office, I shall be a servant of the House of Representatives. It is to be expected, perhaps, that the House will find me, as King Charles I. found Montrose, a rather proud servant. When I look at the forest of faces I see here to-day, my mind goes back to the ninth chapter of the Book of Judges, wherein it is recorded that a gentleman named Jotham found himself in a somewhat similar position. He tells the story of how the trees assembled together to select one to rule over them. Their first attempt was to secure the services of the olive, but the olive declined to give up his fatness and preside over the trees. On this occasion there is no doubt that, had we an olive in this House, he may have been called upon to wave his branch over us to preserve the peace. The second choice was of the fig, but the fig refused to give up his sweetness and his good fruit in order to undertake the duty.

                <para>There are one or two things that I wish ro say to the House before I take my seat in the chair. I shall be brief. It has been my belief for a long time past that the Speakership of the House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Australia should rank equally with the Speakership of the House of Commons in Great Britain. I have expressed that view time and time again. I hope that that will, in due course, eventuate. As  Speaker,  I do not propose to take any part in debates. Therefore I extend my thanks to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> for his willingness to give me full access to Ministers so that my electorate will not suffer from my silence. The next thing I wish to tell the House is that, while I occupy the Speaker's chair, I shall not, in any circumstances, attend party meetings. I believe that the honorable member who presides over our deliberations should come into the chamber with his mind uninfluenced by the decisions of any political party. I assure honorable members that only after long deliberation did I agree to accept nomination for this post. From my own point of view there are many things against it. I assure the House that a situation might easily arise in which it will be much easier for me to relinquish my duties as  Speaker  than to continue to administer them. I merely say that " Auld Gillespie " will take the chair, and I sincerely pray that the good Lord will have mercy on all of you. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> on behalf of the Government and of honorable members generally, I should like to offer our congratulations to you on your occupancy of the chair. In spite of the faint hint of an uncommon doubt that had entered your mind just before you sat down, we believe that you will be a great success in the chair. You have had an immense experi ence both in the Parliament of South Australia and in the Parliament of the Commonwealth. You are extremely familiar - sometimes embarrassingly familiar - with the Standing Orders. In fact, in order to get on to some terms of equality with you, we propose to take early steps to change the Standing Orders so that, at least to some degree, we may start from "scratch". We know that, although you have always had your full part in political controversy, your abilities and your high character are universally recognized in this House, and, therefore, you will receive great personal respect as well as the respect that is held for your office. </para>

                <para>The only other thing that I should like to say to you, sir, is that those of us who belong to that growing group of members who have been suspended from the service of the House take great comfort from the fact that you know what it feels like, and, therefore, we anticipate with great confidence that you will do your disciplining gently. </para>

                    <para>- On behalf of members of the Opposition, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> I take this opportunity to congratulate you very sincerely and, indeed, it gives me great pleasure to do so apart from the more formal congratulations that the occasion requires, on your elevation to the high office of  Speaker  of this House. Regardless of differences of opinion that may have existed between us while you occupied a position on the floor of this House, my colleagues and I have the highest regard for your personal honesty and integrity. Those are great qualifications for the position which you will occupy, and I feel confident, and I hope that this confidence will be completely justified, that you will dispense even-handed justice as the custodian of the rights, privileges and procedures of this House. The Prime Minister has referred to your experience as a member of the Parliament of South Australia and the Parliament of the Commonwealth, and that leads me to believe that you will make au excellent presiding officer. There have been occasions when you have differed very strongly from rulings that have been given by the occupant of the chair. Who was right or who was wrong only time will prove, but you, sir, do know where the holes in the fences are, and  I  feel sure that, because you have the knowledge, you will be a worthy custodian of the rights of the House. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>I should like to make one appeal to you. I listened with great interest to your announcement that while you held the position of Speaker, you did not propose to take any part in debates or to attend any party meetings. I assume that, in adopting that course, you will he following the practice of successive Speakers of the House of Commons. However, I have some feelings of regret because we shall no longer be treated to orations such as you have delivered in your picturesque language in the past.  1  have differed very strongly from some of the views that you have expressed from time to time but I feel that the House will be the loser as the result of your decision not to take part in debates and it was with regret that we learned that you would not entertain us in debate as you had done in the past. "When I heard your statement about your decision to raise yourself so far above party politics  I  recalled a book by Anatole France in which he described a sinner who turned saint. Now that you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> have reached this stage of saintliness which all of us hope to reach and about which some of us are not so sure at the moment,  I  point out to you that some of the members of the Opposition may incur your wrath or venture to disagree with your rulings. May I suggest to you that, in dispensing justice even-handedly, as I know you will do, you will remember the saintly quality of mercy. When I listened to your concluding remarks, I felt a cold shiver, but I recall the high standards that you have set for yourself, and I hope that you will have some regard for the sinners whom you have left behind on the floor of the House. </para>

                    <para>- May I be permitted, as your immediate predecessor, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> to congratulate you on being successful in catching the eye of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies).</inline> At the same time,  I  congratulate the Prime Minister on his great wisdom in placing you in the chair. </para>

                <para class="block">I do not know whether you hinted to him that if you became <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> you would not take part in debates; but I think that, from his point of view, it is safer to have you in the chair rather than on his flank. </para>
                <para>Another reason why  I  take this opportunity to congratulate you is that on the first occasion on which  I  was elected Speaker, you, as a private member, were good enough to congratulate me, and to make a prophecy that I would not occupy the chair for long. I do not propose to make any prophecies on this occasion, but  I  am fairly certain that if you had taken your place on the floor of the House, and not in the safe haven of the chair, the 'Government's expectation of life would have been considerably shortened. However, the  Speaker  of the House of Representatives has much to learn. He must study the ways and habits of honorable members, and learn the Standing Orders.  I  have to admit that you, sir, had a great advantage over any other aspirant on the Government side of the chamber for the office of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,'</inline> because I do not think that any member of the Opposition in the last Parliament raised so many points of order as you did, and was so consistently incorrect as you were. By the process of trial and error, you have had a remarkable opportunity to learn how to interpret the Standing Orders correctly. What you do in future will depend upon your own interpretations of the Standing Orders. However, putting that matter aside, I believe that a wiser choice for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> could not have been made. I consider that you are thoroughly honest in your convictions, and that any ruling which you may give will he a well-considered and honest one. I believe also that, at all times, you will be capable of meting out justice impartially to members of all parties. I attach considerable importance to that personal quality. I do not desire to express the wish that you will occupy the office of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> for a long period. Of course, the expression of such a hope by a member of the Opposition would hardly be natural, but while you are the presiding officer here  I  am thoroughly convinced, by the independence of thought that you have displayed as  a  private member, that you will give justice to every one, and that this House  will  have reason to be proud of the fact  that  it has chosen you to preside over  it.  I regret that you will not take part in party meetings, because I believe that  if  you were to attend them, you would  at  least stir things up for the Government and perhaps make a contribution  to  the shortening of its life. I heartily congratulate you again on the honour  that  has been conferred on you. I believe  that  you are thoroughly competent to perform the duties of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline> I believe also that you are completely fair minded and are prepared to give every  one  a fair " go ". No one can expect more than that. </para>

I again thank the Prime Minister,  the  right honorable member for Macquarie and the honorable member for Dalley for their kind personal references  to  me.

I am sure that we shall all co-operate well in the conduct  of  business in committee and that the attitude of honorable members to the  Chairman  of Committees will aid me in the discharge of my duties. I thank the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> and the Leader of the Opposition' <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> for their congratulations. I noted the remarks that were made by you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> this morning, when you expressed a desire that the conduct of this House should be maintained on the highest level of British tradition. I assure honorable members that, to the degree that committee work enters into the conduct of parliamentary business and to the utmost of my ability, I shall endeavour to satisfy that desire. </para>

                    <para>We, the House of Representatives of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia, in Parliament assembled, desire to express our loyalty to our Most Gracious Sovereign, and to thank Your  Excellency  for the speech which you have been pleased to address to Parliament. </para>

                <para class="block">Because of the responsibility involved, I move the Address-in-Reply with a sense of some diffidence. I have also a feeling of inspiration and of admiration at the wide scope of  His  Excellency's Speech. That scope covers the future planning and development of Australia. I shall deal with some of its objectives, and some of the ideas that have appealed to me, as a new member of this House. </para>
                <para>It is a source of great satisfaction and pleasure to us to know that His Majesty the King, Queen Elizabeth and Princess Margaret intend to visit Australia. A fact that is worthy of great admiration is that His Majesty, after passing through an illness which might have given him every reason to take life very easily for some time to come, is still fulfilling his public engagements in England and has also indicated his intention to visit Australia. We hope that his heavy duties in England will not prevent that visit from being made. I believe that Australians, despite the fact that they are not effusive or emotional people, have a very strong regard for the Mother Country and will manifest that feeling by their attitude during His Majesty's visit in 1952. </para>
                <para>One of the outstanding matters dealt with by  His Excellency  was the development of rural industry. We all know that our secondary industries have achieved magnificent results and have contributed largely to Australia's development. During the war that development was due to the great demand for war materials, and since the termination of the conflict it has been promoted by the keen demand for materials to speed our return to civilian life. No doubt the increase of population by about 1,000,000 has also contributed to our development. In many cases that expansion has been at the expense of the rural industries, which are of such great value to this country and produce much of its revenue. The rural man goes on the land because he belongs to it. He has a feeling for the land and lacks the normal outlook of the city man on hours and industrial conditions. He fights the vagaries of the weather and generally carries on his business in a way that merits the admiration of all Australian citizens. However, we find that even in these days he lacks the amenities which are an ordinary part of city life. Sometimes the attractions of the city are a lure to young people, because in many parts of the country electric light is not available, nor is electric power to drive the many machines that make life more bearable to country dwellers. Those young people have their normal country outlook diverted citywards. It is quite apparent, therefore, that it is out of regard for the future of Australia that the emphasis in the Governor-General's Speech has been placed on the development of the rural industries. The present bank accounts of the farmers must not be regarded as an indication of their continuing financial status because, being wise men and looking ahead, they must invest in fencing and other installations to provide greater efficiency in times of lower income. They desire to provide in the seven years of plenty for the seven lean years. Therefore, the constitution of a Ministry of National Development will place a proper emphasis on the rural side of Australian progress. </para>
                <para>In this visualization of prosperity it is essential to think of those who have been left behind during our progressive years. Many of our citizens have been through the ups and downs of Australian commercial history during depression and war and are now in the twilight of their lives. They find that they are falling behind when it is too late for them to adapt themselves to rising costs and changing conditions. I refer to people who are on fixed incomes, such as those that are derived from superannuation and pensions of various kinds. For those people life is very difficult. When I heard  His Excellency  refer to the anomalies that are caused by the means test I recalled the pathetic cases in my electorate of some people who throughout their lives have tried to make provision for their  old age but have now been left with practically nothing. They will see in that reference in the Speech of the Governor-General a prospect of some alleviation of the austerity of their present plight. </para>
                <para>There is another section of the community to whom we owe a tremendous debt of gratitude. I am glad that I have the opportunity in this, my maiden speech in the House, to refer to those whose efforts and sacrifices have enabled us to live in peace and security to-day. I refer, of course, to the members of the three armed services; to all those who served their country in the forces, and to the many who came hack broken and maimed and nerve-shattered. I saw amongst those who joined the forces fresh-faced boys, strong in their loyalty, not knowing what lay ahead of them, but prepared to face it. I saw also mature, family men, who realized what war meant, but who were prepared to sacrifice themselves, and who did, in fact, sacrifice themselves, for the defence of Australia. It is good to learn that the Government proposes to look after the interests of ex-servicemen. There should be no economic penalty for disablement. Disillusionment should not be the reward of those who have suffered for their country. Just as war widows and their dependants are to be looked after, so also those who suffer disabilities as the result of their war service may take heart, realizing that they will be treated with sympathy and consideration. </para>
                <para>However, the ability of the Government to deal generously with these deserving sections of the community is dependent upon Australia being prosperous and progressive, and Australia's prosperity and progression depend on production. Markets not yet fully supplied are waiting to receive our products. Production has fallen behind since the war, and if additional money is distributed throughout the community while the supply of/ goods remains inadequate it will not be possible to avoid black marketing and inflation. The solution is in our own hands, and in the hands of the workers. I believe that the workers of Australia to-day are more conscious than ever of the important part they play in making it possible for their fellow-Australians to balance the budget. The more production falls behind in one industry the harder it will be on those working in other industries. More production and more competition mean cheaper goods, and in that way it will be possible to put more value into the pound. </para>
                <para>Out of the war there has developed a certain cynicism of outlook. No one actually wins a war. Even if a nation emerges from war apparently prosperous, its people have suffered a corrosion of spirit, and have developed an outlook wholly foreign to them in times of normal living. That condition must be broken down. As the war recedes into the past it will be possible to establish a better understanding between the various sections of the community, between those who are engaged in industrial, commercial and professional occupations. Time after time during the last few months, I have had the privilege of speaking to Australian workers. I believe that the Australian worker is a thinker. He is not easily swayed by his emotions, and he is capable of working things out for himself. If he believes that he is getting fair and equitable treatment he will respond in kind. That, I am convinced, is the belief of the Government, too. It is evident from the Speech of the Governor-General that the Government proposes to do everything it can to promote understanding and tolerance between employers and employees so that they will form a team for the better development of Australia. If the Australian worker really believes that he is getting a fair and equitable return for his labour, he will bring a different outlook to the job. Being a sportsman, he knows that the best results can be obtained only under capable leadership. He knows that he cannot be just an independent, a man out on his own. There must be some one at the top to direct affairs, and it is in that conviction that we look forward confidently to the future. If the various sections of the community are pulling in different directions it will not be possible to provide proper amenities for workers and ex-servicemen, and for those engaged in rural industries. The Australian worker knows that in sport the best results are obtained by consistency in preparation and by competition. If the score does not go on the board the opportunity ie lost for ever. The workers are realizing now that when there are industrial stoppages, no money goes in their pay envelopes, and neither they nor Australia as a whole can benefit. "We are still feeling the repercussions of the coal strike, even though it took place a considerable time ago. The effects are being felt in shortages of coal and steel, and these shortages are, in turn, affecting production in rural industries. </para>
                <para>In the wide and varied pattern of legislation forecast in the Governor-General's Speech we see the prospect of a safe and stable existence. The democratic system, of course, allows for dissentient voices. It is a part of the set-up, and it is right that it should be so. However, if dissentient voices be raised, and if criticism be offered of the Government's plan of legislation, all I ask is that the critics should be moved by a desire to promote the best interests of Australia, and not by considerations of political strategy. </para>
                <para>I thank honorable members for the traditional tolerance which has been extended to me. It will be a great comfort to those of my colleagues, and my opposite numbers on the other side of the chamber, who have yet to go through this ordeal. "We who are present in this Parliament for the first time have a deep sense of the solemn responsibility which rests upon us in being called upon to legislate on behalf of the people. Australia is a marvellous country, and I have had the privilege of being able to compare it with other countries. Because of its geographical features, the fertility of its soil, and the work of the pioneers, we have something that is the envy of the rest of the world. We new members feel that it is a wonderful thing for us to be here at the opening of the Nineteenth Parliament. We know that many honorable members have had wider experience and greater length of service. The influence that those honorable members will have on us new members, even though we may have our own independence and our own sense of individuality, must, to a great extent, mould our outlook and our ideas. I know that, just as the juvenile admires the champion, walks like him, acts like him, and follows his example, so we, in our malleable condition will be fashioned by the example set us by the older members of this House. Perhaps those honorable members have become, to some extent, a little blase and cynical in the political arena. As time goes on and we draw from the storehouse of their knowledge, our freshness may cause a softening of their political hardness. I believe that in this Nineteenth Parliament the future of Australia can be made more secure, greater and grander than ever. I appreciate the privilege of being selected to reply to the Speech of  His Excellency  the Governor-General, and I thank the House for that privilege. </para>

                    <para>.- I rise to second the motion. Good fortune and the electors of the division of Riverina have favoured me in my election to this Nineteenth Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia, and I am profoundly grateful for that fact - or was until a few moments ago. Good fortune and the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies),</inline> together with the Leader of the Australian Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden),</inline> have favoured me in my selection to second the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply. I am not without a deep sense of appreciation, although all the evidence might be against it. Good; fortune and the eloquence of the honorable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Opperman)</inline> have made my task comparatively simple. But there, I am afraid, and for the time being, by good fortune has come to an end.. I now go down to my disaster, and I must suffer the anguish that seems to be inseparable from every maiden speech. It is noconsolation to me to know that honorable members who have to listen to me must share this agony. I hope, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,,</inline> that we can bear it with Christian fortitude. I should like to draw the attention, of the House to the fact that the honorable member for Corio is not the only man in this place who has engaged in athletics. I myself at one time tossed the caber.. That I did not toss it very far was entirely due to the fact that it was a very largecaber and that I was only a little fellow at that time. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>I listened with a great deal of interest to the Speech that was delivered by HisExcellency the Governor-General when heopened the Parliament this afternoon. I. must express my personal satisfaction and I am sure, the satisfaction of every good Australian man and woman, at the feeling references that were made to the grave illness that afflicted our beloved King and prevented him from visiting us last year with Her Majesty the Queen and Princess Margaret; also at the feeling references that were made to His Majesty's almost miraculous recovery, because of which their Majesties hope to visit us in 1952 when, if I may be permitted to quote His Excellency's own words, " They may be assured of a loving welcome from our loyal and British community". If I never say anything else in this House, may I be permitted to repeat that statement. They may be assured of a loving welcome from our loyal and British community. </para>
                <para>One of the saddest features of the insidious attacks that have been made on our democratic systems and institutions is that the British monarchy has never been excluded entirely from these attacks. There is only one way to defend a good King, and throughout our history British men and women have always been willing to take that way. We are not likely to neglect that duty. So I was very proud to note the reference of the Governor-General to the great affection that goes out from the hearts of the people of Australia towards Their Most Gracious Majesties the King and Queen. </para>
                <para>There is no great merit in being loyal to a good King unless we can be loyal to his entire kingdom, and there is no merit in being loyal to the Empire unless we are willing to accept' our fair share of imperial responsibilities. Therefore, it was with considerable satisfaction that I heard the Governor-General state the intention of the new Government to establish a parliamentary standing committee on foreign affairs. That intention must give satisfaction to those of us who have been seriously concerned at the trend of current events. During the last few years we have become estranged from our relations and have failed to choose our friends with discrimination. That, I think, is a very serious position which can only excite the cupidity of our enemies. That position, in my humble -opinion, is due to the folly of leaving the foreign policy of this important country to one man or a particular group of men. We must get back into the Empire and be prepared to play our part within it. We must go right out into the world and find an affinity with those people who believe in the same things as we do. If the future of this great country is to be confined to affinity with the native races of the countries of SouthEast Asia, then the outlook is very grim, not only for us, but also for them. We alone have very little to offer them and they alone have very little to offer us; but within the British Empire we can play our part, the full part of nationhood, and we can be of some use in South-East Asia, apart altogether from exclusive affinity with the native races of that area. I was pleased to hear His Excellency say that a parliamentary standing committee on foreign affairs is to be established for that purpose. </para>
                <para>I was also pleased to note that it is the intention of the Government to reintroduce a form of service training that will provide for the Navy, the Army, and the Air Force. On that point I have something to say that I should give a great deal not to have cause to say. With some experience in two world wars it is my mournful conviction that if we ever engage in a third world war, and if the political confusion that obtained during the recent war is allowed to continue, we shall lose the third world war. We must restore to our people a sense of individual patriotism which, in my opinion, was destroyed by the political confusion that existed during the last war, particularly during the years from 1941 to the end of the conflict. That political confusion caused us, a single people, a single country, to have two armies, one allegedly to fight abroad when it was permitted to stay in battle, and the other to fight at home. Notwithstanding that our kith and kin were incarcerated in prison camps in a number of places throughout all those years, we did nothing to advance their liberation. If it be reasonable to expect one man to do his duty, or one woman to do her duty, it is also reasonable to expect that all men and women shall do their duty now that this Government proposes to give them the opportunity to do so. Having restored our loyalty to, and our good relationship with, not only the Empire, but also the rest of the world, and having revived our patriotic intention to defend our country against aggression, the next step seems to be the restoration of true democracy. The Governor-General's speech, in my opinion, was a manifestation of the Government's intention to do that, if of nothing else. </para>
                <para>I noted that  His Excellency  made reference of the drift of population to the cities. That drift may be alternatively described as the general exodus from the bush which is the most serious social disaster that has afflicted this country up to this point in our history. There is, however, a complete and simple explanation and solution of this problem. The cause of the drift to the cities is that right from the beginning our primary industries have been tied to the chariot wheels of export parity prices and have been required to go wheresoever those chariot wheels dragged them. That is the cause of our land disaster. It brought ruin to much of our best arable land and to many of our finest country people. Because I myself experienced' from day to day this descent to the depths, I remember very vividly making representations to a previous government for the adoption of all sorts of palliatives and expedients that might be expected to meet this desperate situation. All that was ever attempted and all that was ever done was the depreciation of our currency and of sterling and it was of material assistance. Since then, of course, our primary industries have been rebuilt from the ruins on a depreciated currency. But just when the primary industries were recovering, and the chariot wheels were taking us from a condition of desperation to a condition of comparative prosperity, we were cut down from the chariot wheels and tied to an entirely different arrangement - an international scheme of things - and to the introduction of practices that had never before been attempted in this or any other country. A variety of prices was determined to suit a variety of political purposes. I want to see this country, if it does nothing else, close the gap that exists between the standard of living which is conceded to the secondary and tertiary industries and the urban population so that the same standard will be enjoyed by the valiant men and women who go out into thearable and pastoral areas of this country and bring them to production. That, in my opinion, is the complete answer to the problem of the drift of population to the cities. If the standard of living available to our country people were on the level that is available in the urban areas, I have no doubt that instead of there being a drift to the cities there would be a drift away from the cities back to a better land. As a primary producer and as a member of the Australian Country party it gives me pride to know that democracy had its genesis in the ownership of production, particularly primary production. That is frequently forgotten in exalted places such as this. When there was no ownership of production there was no production, and there was no democracy. When the ownership of production was in dispute or in confusion there was still no production and still no democracy. When the ownership of production was vested in the wrong people, production was negligible, and there was still no democracy. It was not until the ownership of production was vested in the producers that production came into its own and democracy was fashioned. It is a democratic fact that up to this point whenever a man or woman goes out on to the land and brings it to production they stand possessed of their production. Some time ago, in order to serve a different purpose, I stated the matter this way: The produce of' the land should belong in its entirety to the producers, subject only to the discharge of their lawful obligations, but during the last few years we have seen serious departures from that fundamental principle of democratic production even though such a procedure was not considered to be in keeping with democratic government. Governments imagined that they stood possessed of the production of the country and disposed of that production to the prejudice of the producers. </para>
                <para>Thus, I was happy to hear the Governor-General say when referring to the conferences that are being held in London to devise a wool stabilization scheme, that this Government was taking cognizance of the fact that it stood possessed of no' wool. If every government could have viewed the matter in that light a lot of what has happened might have been avoided. The only chance that this Government has of getting wheat is either to grow it or buy it; and should it buy it, it must pay for it on just terms. That is provided under the Constitution. This Government stands possessed of no wool and the only way in which it can get any wool is for the Prime Minister or some of his colleagues to grow it or for the Government to buy it. Again, if it buys it, it must settle for it on just terms. The High Court, which is the last court of appeal in this country, has interpreted " just terms " to mean the value of that which is acquired at the date of acquisition. When we hear governments talking of agreements such as the meat agreement with the United Kingdom in terms of fifteen years, unless we have confidence in such governments we can only feel concerned because no government has any meat for sale. If the Government wants to obtain meat for sale it must buy it, and pay for it on just terms. So, it is necessary to recognize that in the final analysis the decision in regard to all the proposals mentioned by the Governor-General this afternoon in relation to marketing schemes must rest with the producer and with no one else. I am aware that it is the intention of this Government to submit these proposals to the growers before any final decision is made. To me, that is entirely satisfactory. </para>
                <para>It was satisfactory to me, too, to hear the Governor-General say that it was the intention of the Government to introduce a bill to prevent any industry from being nationalized unless power be given to it to do so by referendum expressing the consent of the people. I must confess to a sense of weariness when I hear the charges that are constantly being levelled against our democratic systems and institutions. These systems and institutions with all their failures have brought us thus far along the road of social, political and economic progress farther, and in a shorter period of time, tiran the systems and institutions of any other country have brought any other people since the dawn of human history. Yet, time and time again, these systems and institutions are being attacked not only for their individual destruction but also for the destruction of democracy itself. I have tried, so far as I have been able to do so, to make an intensive study of these democratic systems and institutions. Long ago I reached the conclusion, in spite of all that is said to the contrary, that at no stage have they ever been fixed institutions. They have been designed by ordinary men and women to serve ordinary men and women and there their functions begin and end. At no time have they been fixed. They have always been in a constant state of flux and change and they have always sent out a challenge to the intelligence and experience of the people whom they were designed to serve. For 150 years we in this country have accepted that challenge and for hundreds of years the peoples of the British Empire have accepted it. If, at any time, these systems and institutions - and banking is only one of the minor ones - have revealed in actual practice any faults, flaws or frailties the people have always taken the necessary legislative action to correct the flaws, amend the faults, and alter the systems and institutions until they measured up to the changing circumstances of modern society. I believe with all that I have and am that that is still the position among the relatively fittest of the Australian community, that they are anxious and willing to accept that challenge. If there are any excesses, or abuses, the solution is not an ignominious surrender to the abstract political philosophy of that poor old German Jew, Karl Marx, who was driven out of Germany, France and Belgium to find the only sanctuary that he ever knew in the democracy of Great Britain, where he died nearly 70 years ago. That is not the solution; the solution is to correct excesses and abuses until our democratic systems and institutions measure up to what we desire of them. So far as I am in a position to judge the Governor-General's message to us this afternoon can only be interpreted as a reaffirmation of faith in ourselves as a free people, in our country as a component part of the British Commonwealth of Nations and in. our future as a democratic community anxious to do justice to every section and to offer a good and splendid life to every man, woman and child, free from the bitter prejudices of the past, the desperate pressure groups of the present and the fears of the future. </para>
