<TITLE>Travelling Post Office Service</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That we protest most strongly against the Australian Postal Commission's decision to phase out the Travelling Post Office (T.P.O.) in N.S.W.</PARA>
<PARA> The T.P.O. service has given the country people of N.S.W. a reliable and efficient service for many years. To replace this service with a road system would be a backward step which we believe would result in long delays in mail going to and from country centres.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Government will look favourably on our petition to retain the T.P.O. service in N.S.W.</PARA>

<PARA> There is a definite limit to the quantity of Australia's mineral resources.</PARA>

<TITLE>Sale of Publicly Owned Enterprises</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> There is a limit to the capacity of Australia's drug manufacturing industry in Australian hands.</PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly our resources should be managed and developed under Australian ownership and control.</PARA>
<PARA> Publicly owned trading enterprises and corporations have been established and operated for the benefit of Australians since Federation.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, Commonwealth Banking Corporation, Trans Australia Airlines, Qantas, Housing Loans Insurance Corporation, Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation, Australian Wheat Board, were all designed to operate to the benefit of our Nation as a whole under public ownership.</PARA>
<PARA> The Fraser government's irresponsible proposals to sell off our Nation's interest in the Ranger Uranium Mine, the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation, and to dispose of other successful statutory corporations such as Trans Australia Airlines and the Fawnmac group of drug companies would be contrary to the Nation's interests. Fawnmac still makes a profit of about half the proposed sale price in a year and cost the Australian government several times the proposed sale price. It provides the Pharmaceutical Benefits pricing negotiators within the Health Department with inside information on drug manufacturing costs and so prevents collusive monopolistic pricing by major transnational drug firms. It complements the resources of the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories to make both Government owned drug firms more efficient and competitive by co-operation.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House of Representatives will reject outright proposals of the Fraser government to sell the Ranger Uranium Mine, the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation, Trans Australia Airlines and the Fawnmac group of companies.</PARA>

<TITLE>Aid to Ethiopia</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in the Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That we request a review of the Australian food aid to Ethiopia for the following reasons:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Ethiopian involvement in four war fronts resulting in massive exodus of refugees out of the country-from supposed famine affected areas.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Well documented atrocities committed by the Ethiopian Government against its own people and the people of neighbouring countries.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Clear evidence of such aid being diverted for military purposes, away from the areas of greatest need.</PARA>
<PARA> That we request that the Australian Government provide aid to victims of the Ethiopian disaster in Somalia, Djibouti and the Sudan, through their Governments and through the Eritrean Relief Association in Eritrea.</PARA>
<PARA> That we request that the Australian Government sends economic aid as well as food aid to allow the indigenous governments of Somalia, Djibouti and the Sudan to implement relief work, i.e. transportation, health infrastructure etc.</PARA>
<PARA> That we object to Australia giving aid to Ethiopia and the Sudan, whilst failing to give substantial aid to the refugee victims of the war.</PARA>
<PARA> That Australia's involvement appears, to us, to be purely political-influenced by Australia's alliance with the United States-and consequently, we request that Australia restricts this aid to the war victims in Eritrea and those refugees in Somalia, Djibouti and the Sudan and that such aid exist on a substantial level.</PARA>

<TITLE>Foreign Bases in Australia</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. We, the undersigned, believe it is the duty of our government to promote peace.</PARA>
<PARA> We believe the greatest threat to peace lies in the division of the world into two blocs grouped around the United States and the Soviet Union. These two blocs are locked into an escalating arms race. Unless this can be halted, it will inevitably destroy people of both sides. We therefore call upon our politicians to work towards:</PARA>
<PARA> a non-aligned foreign policy</PARA>
<PARA> non-nuclear Indian and Pacific Oceans</PARA>
<PARA> the nuclear disarmament of the two major power blocs</PARA>
<PARA> the development of exchanges of people, information and ideas between the two blocks;</PARA>

<TITLE>Arbitration Determination 503 of 1980</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. That the Government's move in attempting to disallow Determination 503 of 1980 which was granted by the full bench of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission has (a) placed in jeopardy the future viability of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, (b) and has created a dangerous precedent for trade unions in general, by refusing to accept the umpire's decision.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. That the Government has acted in complicity with the Public Service Board in attempting to disallow Determination 503 of 1980 and is thereby attempting to deny Government employees a fair hearing on matters related to redundancy and retrenchment.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House will (a) reject any moves to disallow Determination 503 of 1980 and to exclude arbitral jurisdiction over any aspect of redundancy redeployment, retrenchment and retirement.

<TITLE>Plant Breeders' Rights</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned showeth that your petitioners are gravely concerned at the prospect of the proposed Plant Breeders' Rights legislation. The reasons are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) We believe it will eventually lead to the restriction of sales of many varieties of seed.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) We believe it will cause the disappearance of many useful plant varieties as evidenced by similar legislation in Europe.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) We believe that it will cause the Australian seed industry to become foreign controlled.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) We believe that a full public debate has not taken place and should take place before any laws are passed on the patenting of a life form.</PARA>

<TITLE>Mr Kim Dae Jung</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That the question of basic human rights in the Republic of Korea is a matter of widespread and increasing concern. Since the assassination of the late President Park Chung Hee and the accession to power of Lt. General Chun Du Hwan the situation, already serious, has deteriorated rapidly.</PARA>
<PARA> That the issue is not simply one of basic human rights. The Korean Peninsula is one of the most explosive areas in the world. The collapse of the last vestiges of democracy in the Republic of Korea, the emergence of a military-police regime of unparallelled brutality, has convinced many moderate Korean reformers that peaceful political change is no longer possible. Renewed civil conflict in Korea would bring with it the terrifying prospect of Great Power involvement. Great Power involvement could precipitate a nuclear holocaust.</PARA>
<PARA> That Australia has a direct interest in what happens in Korea. The Australian Government, as a matter of urgency, should work positively towards a peaceful, long-term and just settlement of the problems of the Korean Peninsula by:</PARA>
<PARA> using its good offices in Seoul, Washington, Tokyo and other capitals to secure the release of the South Korean Opposition Leader, Mr Kim Dae Jung, and all other political prisoners, and withdrawal of charges against them;</PARA>
<PARA> urging the speedy restoration of democratic political process in the Republic;</PARA>
<PARA> continually reviewing the economic, political and strategic implications of Australia's extensive trade with the Republic of Korea;</PARA>
<PARA> suspending Australia's uranium contracts with the Republic of Korea. The character of Lt. General Chun Du Hwan's Government suggests that it might not, given the opportunity, abide by either the letter or the spirit of the Nuclear Weapons Non-Proliferation Treaty, to which Australia is signatory. It has been estimated that within the next five years South Korea could be in a position to construct 36 plutonium bombs annually from the waste products of its civilian nuclear reactors;</PARA>
<PARA> working positively, both independently and in co-operation with other powers, to bring about conditions conducive to a peaceful, negotiated re-unification of the two halves of the Peninsula;</PARA>

<TITLE>Liquefied Petroleum Gas</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: that the price of LPG in Victoria has risen by $80 per tonne since November 1978 as a result of Federal Government policy thereby causing hardship to country consumers using LPG for cooking, heating and hot water and to decentralized industries using LPG for industrial purposes.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore pray:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. that the Federal Government should abolish its so called 'export parity' pricing policy for LPG consumed in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. that the price of Bass Strait LPG sold on the Australian market should be related to the true cost of production plus a fair margin of profit for the producers;</PARA>
<PARA> 3. that all LPG ex Bass Strait consumed on the Australian market should be free of excise levy;</PARA>
<PARA> 4. that there should be no restriction on availability of LPG ex. Bass Strait to meet the requirements of the Australian market;</PARA>
<PARA> 5. that the price of LPG ex oil refineries should be established by the PJT at parity with Bass Strait LPG consumed on the Australian market;</PARA>
<PARA> 6. that pending the establishment of a fair price in accordance with Clause 2 above and to provide some immediate relief to country consumers:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the existing excise on Bass Strait LPG consumed in Australia be abolished forthwith, thus providing a reduction in price of $27.60 per tonne for propane,</PARA>
<PARA> (b) that the windfall profit that Esso/BHP is enjoying as a result of the increase in price of LPG from $110 to $147 per tonne be directed to Australian consumers rather than the Federal Treasury through excise, thus providing an additional decrease in the present price of $37.00 per tonne.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AV4">Mr HURFORD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Industry and Commerce. Is it a fact that the latest Industries Assistance Commission motor vehicle industry recommendations will lead, on the IAC's own admission, to plants closing and thousands of jobs being lost? Is it a fact that the IAC has followed the Government's own rhetoric in pursuing a so-called market-free enterprise approach which will devastate certain regions of this country? Will the Government immediately heed the warnings of State governments, employers and unions, as well as the Labor Opposition, reject the report and its market only approach and swiftly end the uncertainty and insecurity by announcing a plan which will stimulate the motor vehicle manufacturing industry at the same time as leading to better value for consumers?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can certainly understand the concern of the honourable member over the implications for employment in the automotive industry if the Industries Assistance Commission's draft recommendations were to be embodied in its final report and accepted by the Government. The honourable gentleman has referred to the IAC's assessment, subject to certain qualifications, of the significant loss of employment opportunities which the adoption of that report, in fact, would create. I think it is fair to say that this is one of the largest engineering concerns in the country which underpins very significantly much of Australia's engineering capability, its skills and technology, and provides-as the House would be very much aware-thousands of employment opportunities, particularly in Victoria, New South Wales and also South Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government's recognition of the importance of the industry and its desire that there should be greater competitiveness within the industry and also that necessary changes in the industry should take place at a rate which would avoid undue disruption were clearly stated in the terms of reference which were given by the Government to the IAC. The Government, in making its decision, of course, will need to reach a judgment which takes fully into account the competing and competitive representations by the vehicle manufacturers, the component producers, the importers and the service and dealership sector, as well as the consumers, and to pay significant regard to the employment implications of the recommendations. But I am sure the honourable gentleman would understand that this is not the time for the responsible Minister to respond to the views put by any honourable member of this House or indeed by any of the parties concerned.</PARA>
<PARA> Neither I, nor any other Government Minister, intends to be drawn into any debate at this time because, after all, the report is a draft interim report which is designed to provide an early exposure of the recommendations of the IAC and, in the process which has been long established, to enable the respective parties to respond to those recommendations at a public hearing before the final recommendations come to the Government. I think the honourable gentleman would agree with me, given the normal IAC process, that it is an important part of decision making in areas of Government assistance to particular industries that the public inquiry process be properly followed and enabled to operate. Beyond that the Government's decision will be handed down after the final recommendations are before it and after the views of all the parties concerned, which I mentioned in the course of this answer, have been received.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I preface my question to the Prime Minister by reminding him that I was appointed by the Leader of the Opposition as a director of the Bicentennial Authority. Now that the decisions have been made not to proceed with either Expo 88 or the application for the 1988 Olympic Games in Melbourne-I do not intend to canvass either of those issues-will the Prime Minister, in consultation with the Premiers, give consideration to introducing a States Grants (Bicentennial) Bill that would provide for funding on a $1 for $2 basis, or something similar, with State and local government, to enable the various regions and communities in Australia to start planning with the Bicentennial Authority specific projects for 1988? I have in mind such projects as cultural centres, art galleries, sporting facilities, historic restorations, creation of parks and gardens, and the protection of Australian flora and fauna. Will the Prime Minister also determine a reasonable figure for Commonwealth commitment to ensure that such an act is not just tokenism? Does the Prime Minister realise the frustration of the 17 directors of the Authority and its officers and their fear that 1988 will finish up as a fireworks and marching girls only celebration rather than a unique opportunity, which most believe 1988 can become, to rediscover our heritage and plan our future?</PARA></TALK.START>

One of the problems in relation to both Expo 88, although I think the Premier and I had a common view of priorities on that, and the Olympic Games is: If we are to have a single project of such vast proportions and on out-turn prices costing many hundreds of millions of dollars, what then will we do for other capital cities and country towns?</PARA></TALK.START>

It is not good enough just to say that we can have a 1988 celebration but that the Commonwealth has to find all the money over and above that provided by other levels of government. One of the things all levels of government will have to do is see where they will fit that year within their own priorities and make room for it in a meaningful way.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question to the Prime Minister concerns the announcement that the Commonwealth Government will not support the Victorian Government's bid to stage the 1988 Olympic Games in Melbourne. What were the factors that were instrumental in the Commonwealth Government's decision? In particular, what would have been the likely cost of any Commonwealth involvement?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="122" SPEAKER="Fraser The Rt Hon J.M." NAMEID="QS4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="WANNON" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QS4">Mr MALCOLM FRASER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Some months ago, as a result of discussions with the Victorian Government, we indicated that we would be prepared to go forward with Victoria on a 50-50 basis if the matter were to proceed, and a working party of officials had to work out the costs in greater detail. It was hoped that that would enable us to come to a judgment on the matter, and we have done so. Most of the figures that have been given in the media and most of the figures that have come out of Victoria have been based on 1980 prices, which of course makes everyone think that the whole project would cost very much less than it would in fact cost. The officials' report indicated that, allowing for a 30 per cent cost over-run-a 30 per cent delay factor, if you like-in all the construction projects, the out-turn price, the dollars actually spent, would be $1,750m.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is worth noting that for the Expo project in Sydney, on which in the end the New South Wales Government and the Commonwealth shared a common view on priorities and what should be done, the New South Wales Treasury worked on a 50 per cent cost over-run, if my recollection is right. The Victorian Olympic Games figure was worked on a 30 per cent cost over-run. When one takes into account the fact that major public works, major building structures, in Victoria are experiencing an 80 to 85 per cent delay factor-in other words, about 15 to 20 of every 100 days are worked, but generally not more than that-it makes one think that a 30 per cent cost over-run for the Olympic Games proposal was very modest indeed. The figure could be significantly more than that unless there was a revolution in attitudes to construction projects, which of course the Government is working to try to bring about at the moment. To take that into account would be to anticipate results that we have not yet fully achieved. The total cost would be $1,750m.</PARA>
<PARA> Apart from interest charges it was plain that Victoria wanted to fund its share virtually solely through the Loan Council as a net addition to its total borrowings through the Loan Council. Obviously there are some implications in that. It is all very well to say at the end of the day that the estimates are that the loss will be only $125m or $200m in 1980 prices, but governments would have to find the money in the meantime because the returns that come in from the Olympic Games for the city that mounts them come in over the last year or 18 months before they are held. In the meantime the money has to be found or raised. Very substantial additional borrowing would be required through the Loan Council.</PARA>
<PARA> The Chairman of the Loan Council approached the members of the Council in the course of last week for the purpose of assessing what priority, if any, the States were prepared to accord borrowings for the Olympic Games, especially so since certain Premiers had come out publicly in support of Victoria's application. In the event, it was very plain that no State, including Victoria, was prepared to give the Olympic Games any priority whatsoever over other programs. In other words, it would go to the bottom of the list of requirements. The funds to be raised were to be totally and absolutely in addition to all other requirements. An example of the kind of question asked is whether the holding of the Games in Melbourne would mean that the Loan Council could encompass in a responsible way a larger overall borrowing program than it would have if the Games were not held in Melbourne.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QS4">Mr MALCOLM FRASER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a slight difference between the funds for the World Trade Centre and $1,750m. It is very plain that no Premier was prepared to give priority to the Olympic Games in the borrowing program of the Loan Council. It was also very plain that the Commonwealth would be faced with the argument that we have to raise the maximum for all other programs and then raise money for the Olympic Games over and above the other programs. Some Premiers were prepared to say that the Games were important but would give funds for the Games absolutely no priority over funds for building roads, houses or whatever. There are funds for those purposes in the programs of the States, but the Olympic Games would not be given any priority at all. Against that background, the Commonwealth could only come to the view that it would have been irresponsible to commit itself to the support of the Games. After all, if the Loan Council were to allow Victoria to find its share through the medium of the Loan Council, it would have been good enough for the Commonwealth to find its share through the Loan Council instead of through the taxpayers of Australia. If we looked at it from that point of view the additional requirements through the Loan Council would be about $1,700m. That puts the whole business into perspective. If the Premiers had been prepared to give the staging of the Olympic Games priority it might have been another matter; but they were not. If honourable gentlemen in the Australian Labor Party want to support raising that sum for the Olympic Games and the $1,200m for Expo they will only confirm the attitude that the Australian public has of them, that is, that they are a group of utter spendthrifts.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister for Health: As the audit of nursing homes in South Australia has uncovered incorrect claims to the extent of $1.9m, and as South Australia has a little under 10 per cent of the nursing home beds in Australia, is it a reasonable expectation that this latest health bungle has cost nationally approximately $20m?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a fact that the almost completed audit in South Australia has uncovered an amount of about $1.9m. Ongoing audits are taking place in other States. Some of them are nearing completion. It is not correct to extrapolate the South Australian situation throughout the Australian continent. In fact, the situation varies very greatly from State to State. I am sorry to hear the honourable member say 'yet another health bungle'. It was the Department of Health which became aware of the problem. It has moved over some time to recover moneys incorrectly paid. The Department of Health relies upon the information given to it by proprietors of nursing homes and acts on that information in good faith. Rather than this being a bungle, I think that the Department of Health is to be congratulated on its good administration in finding out about this problem and recovering the money incorrectly paid.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As members of the House will be aware, part of the aim of the round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations was to come to an agreement with the EEC on matters including a global quota of 60,000 tonnes of beef. Unfortunately, the EEC had not honoured that settlement and, as a result, I went to Brussels last September to try to resolve the issue. I reached an agreement with the then Minister for Agriculture, Mr Gundelach, that he would put to the Council of Ministers a recommendation that that undertaking be honoured. Unfortunately, because of his death and other delays the matter was not looked at until this morning. I have unofficial word that the Council of Ministers agreed by a nine to one majority that the package of commodities submitted to it, which included the beef quota, was acceptable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that the one country that voted against the package of commodities was Italy, and it voted not against the beef issue but against a matter relating to sugar within the EEC. The situation is most encouraging. It looks as though this matter is now able to be settled. I hope that trade relations between Australia and the EEC can get back to a more amicable basis.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I mentioned in response to an earlier question from the Opposition, the Government and the Department of Health have become aware of payments incorrectly made. Those payments were made on the advice of nursing home proprietors. It is up to the nursing home proprietors to provide the correct advice to the Government. When that audit has been com- pleted, recovery action, which, as the honourable member suggests, is due to commence in March of this year, will proceed. The response that registered health insurance organisations make to claims made upon them by nursing home proprietors is, of course, a matter for them, but I am confident that they will accept their obligations, which are clearly outstanding. I have no reason to believe that they will not accept those obligations. The Government is very concerned to ensure that no nursing home is badly affected because of this matter. It is consulting individual proprietors to make certain that the recovery procedures will be such as not to disadvantage seriously individual nursing homes; but the recovery procedures will go ahead.</PARA></TALK.START>

Has the Commonwealth recently held discussions with State Ministers responsible for water resources within the Murray basin?

Is there a problem concerning industrial pollution criteria and is this the only, or major, factor holding up final agreement?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BU4">Mr ANTHONY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member, rightly, has been very concerned about the water quality and salinity of the Murray River. The Commonwealth also has been concerned. As a result of the Maunsell report, it provided last year $6m to each of the States concerned, on a dollar for dollar basis, to see that work was undertaken in an effort to improve water quality in the Murray River. The Government has also amended the income tax laws to permit tax deductions to be made for expenditures upon drainage and salinity control measures. Those have been major areas of assistance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government now seeks to amend the legislation governing the River Murray Commission so that the Commission can take account of water quality. The Minister for National Development and Energy called a meeting on the subject on 12 February at which very good progress was made. For the first time all of the States recognised that co-operation was needed and that the Commission should be given extra powers to try to do something about the problem. The Commonwealth does not wish to intrude upon, or interfere with, the rights of the States, as far as the tributaries are concerned-that is a matter for them-but it does want co-operation. At that meeting, the representatives of the States all agreed to take certain recommendations back to their governments and I hope that in the very near future the relevant legislation can be amended.</PARA>

In other words, sufficient money has been made available to maintain the services. It is, of course, up to individual boards of hospitals and State administrations to ensure that individual hospitals adhere to their budgets. That is not the Commonwealth's responsibility.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As it happens, in the past few days some statistics have been released which I think bear emphasis in this House, particularly as all honourable members on this side of the House are concerned about a healthy level of private sector investment. The figures for the September quarter of 1980 indicate that expenditure was no less than 36.7 per cent above the level of the September quarter of 1979. Furthermore, the investment in prospect of the private sector in capital expenditure for the December quarter shows a continuation of the same strong growth. These figures are the latest in a long line of statistics which indicate with increasing strength the pace and momentum of the economic recovery which is taking place in Australia at present and demonstrate the contribution which is being made to economic growth via the private sector. They underline the continuing need to restrain the growth of the public sector to make room for that private sector development. They also remind us how wrong were some statements made after the last Budget. I am reminded of a statement made on an Australian Broadcasting Commission radio station on 19 August last year when this was said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Retail sales are flat, production's been pretty disastrous, motor car sales have been dreadful, unemployment is starting to climb again and inflation's taking off. I would argue that it will be in excess of 12 per cent by the end of the year.</PARA>
<PARA>The author of that piece of economic perspicacity was the Leader of the Opposition. We all know what level inflation reached by the end of the year. He was not to be left alone. He was joined by the honourable member for Gellibrand, who is the alternative Treasurer of this country. On 21 September last year-in the middle of the quarter to which I have just referred, the quarter he was talking about-he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Considerable doubt is cast over Government claims that business investment is likely to expand rapidly this year . . .</PARA>
<PARA>He said this in the middle of a quarter which produced a 36.7 per cent increase in the volume of fixed capital investment in the Australian community. Not content with that, four days later he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Figures released today confirm basic weaknesses in the Australian economy and show that production has stagnated during the last twelve months.</PARA>
<PARA>The statistics on fixed capital investment demonstrate the contribution to economic recovery of the private sector. They also demonstrate the wisdom of this Government in saying that restraint of public sector expenditure was needed to make room for private sector expenditure. It will remain the policy of this Government to restrain and reduce the size of the public sector because by so doing it will facilitate economic recovery from the private sector, which is the only sound basis of economic recovery in this country.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My attention has not been drawn to the report referred to by the honourable member. However, I would draw his attention to the fact that the matters he raised are in the first instance the responsibility of the State authorities. I realise that towards the end of his question he asked whether certain funds could be made available by the Federal Government to allow this school to be relocated. For the information of both the honourable member and the House, I indicate that the Commonwealth contributes to the cost of maintaining government schools, both on the recurrent and on the capital side. Those sums are made available on an annual basis. They are made available on a block grant basis. It is a matter for the State governments to determine the priority in relation to the expenditure of that money.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QK5">Mr GROOM</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct a question to the Prime Minister. It is now just over three weeks since the disastrous bushfire swept through Zeehan in Tasmania destroying some 40 homes and the possessions of 40 families living in that area. With winter fast approaching, those families are anxious to know where they stand so far as financial help from the Government is concerned. Is the Prime Minister able to inform the House of the precise nature of financial help to be provided to homeless families in Zeehan?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QS4">Mr MALCOLM FRASER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Commonwealth is still awaiting substantive proposals from the Premier of Tasmania in relation to rehousing the people of Zeehan who lost their homes in a most tragic fire. I am advised that the Premier has formed a committee of officials to examine this particular matter. I have suggested to the Premier that there is a need for the citizens concerned to be represented on that committee. I have also suggested that a State member of Parliament should be represented on it and that, because of our concern with national disasters and national disaster relief, the Federal Parliament also ought to be represented. The honourable member for Braddon is the person who I have suggested should be the representative of the Federal Parliament. I hope that, if the Premier is prepared to accept that proposal, decisions will be made as speedily as possible in relation to rehousing these people. I know that in the early days a proposal was made to group in a different suburb in one particular locality all those who were burnt out. I was concerned at that time that decisions made immediately in the aftermath of the fire might catch people on the rebound and they might make decisions that they would not want to stay with in the longer term. That time has now passed. I hope that decisions can be made quickly and that proposals can be put to us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Meanwhile, of course, in accordance with the national disaster arrangements the Federal Government contributes on a $1 for $1 basis with the State towards the provision of any emergency assistance and accommodation that the people concerned need. In addition, a major public facility in Zeehan which has been used by many groups in the community was burnt. I refer to the scout hall. We have agreed, irrespective of the normal financial arrangements, to provide $3 for every $1 to assist in the rebuilding of that hall. There is no reason why that should not proceed as quickly as possible and as quickly as people can get the matter moving. I hope that that proposal will be taken as evidence of the Commonwealth's concern in this particular matter. The Government is awaiting firm and positive proposals from Mr Lowe. As soon as such proposals are in my hands, they will be processed as speedily and as sympathetically as is possible. I hope that the Premier will pick up the suggestion that I have made and place the honourable member for Braddon on that committee so that any delays may be minimised.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Prime Minister whether he recalls stating with conviction in his 1975 policy speech:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We will fully index personal income tax for inflation over three years . . . It will make government more honest with your money.</PARA>
<PARA>As full indexation has never been provided in spite of the opportunities presented by five Budgets, and in view of his statement on Monday morning that the Government does not intend to go beyond half tax indexation, which allowing for discounting is much less than that, can we conclude from his 1975 statement of principle that at best the Government is now prepared to be only much less than half honest with the public's money?</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="126" SPEAKER="Fraser The Rt Hon J.M." NAMEID="QS4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="WANNON" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QS4">Mr MALCOLM FRASER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable gentleman was probably busy and probably did not read the 1980 policy speech. I suggest that he do so because it had something to say on the subject of indexation. If he has listened to the remarks that I have made and the Treasurer has made in recent times he will also understand that it has been difficult for the people of Australia to understand the benefits of indexation in terms of a policy of tax reductions. Therefore, for a government that is concerned about reducing taxes, there is a very real question as to whether the policy of tax indexation should be maintained as such or whether a government should reduce taxes as and when it can in terms of the best interests of the taxpayers of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In addition, let me provide a further argument. A policy of tax indexation tends to freeze the tax structure in one particular pattern. If taxes are reduced as and when possible through the budgetary processes, there is a greater opportunity to make certain adjustments to relieve the hardship on people on lower incomes within the total tax framework than if there is a rigid policy of tax indexation. That, again, indicates that in the tax area there are legitimate arguments on both sides of the question. But in relation to tax indexation, I suggest that the honourable gentleman read the 1980 policy speech.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To assist them in their road programs over the next five years. I repeat that $3,650m is being made available over the five-year period. That amount took into account an inflation expectation of 11.14 per cent in this financial year, 9 per cent in the next financial year, 7 per cent in the following financial year and 6 per cent in the next two successive years. These figures were calculated by the Treasury and by the Department of Finance taking into account the responsible economic policies that the Fraser Government is pursuing. To have allowed for a greater expansion over those years would have been nothing short of being irresponsible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We expect the State road making authorities and local government authorities to make the most of the productivity that has been achieved in earth movement and road construction. Naturally, if they improve their efficiencies in road construction, they would expect to more than meet those anticipated inflationary levels. I might say that the States have not yet committed themselves to the levels of finance that they are prepared to make available over the five-year period. But the Commonwealth has; it has made a very sizable contribution to the road needs of this country.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Bradfield for his question. I make it clear at the outset that, generally speaking, the Government takes the view that investment and commercial decisions as to how companies are operated and how they are structured-providing they comply with the law-are matters for the individual judgment of people who run those companies. I have noted, as I am sure have all honourable members, the announcement made by Caltex Oil (Aust.) Pty Ltd regarding a proposed acquisition of an interest in H. C. Sleigh Ltd. Of course, that proposal will need to be examined by the Foreign Investment Review Board. I think I would be interpreting the views of honourable members on this side of the House and, indeed, of a large number of honourable members, in saying that the Government welcomes the indication by that company that share issues are to be made available to the Australian public. It would represent the first occasion on which a multinational oil company would make equity available to Australian investors. That is a trend which the Government welcomes and I wish to make that point quite clear without in any way implying that the rules of the game will be changed to make it necessary for people to do that. Nonetheless, it is a development that the Government welcomes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australianisation rules within the foreign investment policy which were brought in in 1978 have now been in operation for a considerable period.

While the inquiry was still going on we had the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Treasurer closing off options which still were the subject of that inquiry. We have had the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony), no less, declaring his opposition to any of the options which were being examined. We have had Cabinet members publicly at each other's throats on the tax issue. We have had one of the coalition parties campaigning on a tax policy completely contrary to government policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Under those circumstances the public is entitled to wonder just what is going on, to wonder whether this Government knows what it is about or whether it has completely lost its sense of direction. Of course, the answer is that the Government has no idea where it is going. It is in a state of near panic because of its total failure to achieve its tax objectives and the realisation that the Government came within a hair's breadth of losing the last general election. If 6,523 votes in the right places had gone the other way-that is, only 0.08 per cent of the total number of votes-the Government parties would now be in opposition. All Government members know that unless they can get their act together, particularly in the crucial area of taxation, they will not survive the next election. </PARA>
<PARA> There can be no doubting the enormity of the Government's failure in the tax area. In that regard it must be recalled that this is a government which came to office proclaiming itself to be a low tax coalition, a coalition which would reduce taxes, reduce the size of the public sector and let people decide for themselves how their money should be spent. It was, therefore, very much the language that marks the new President of the United States of America, but Ronald Reagan would not draw any comfort from analysing the antipodean experiments. What we see now, after five years of supposedly low tax government, is a situation in which taxes are higher than ever, not just in money terms but in terms of the proportion of the incomes of people that now go in tax. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to income tax, the irrefutable fact is that under the tax schedules applying this financial year 80 per cent of taxpayers-that is, four out of every five taxpayers-are paying a higher proportion of their incomes in income tax than was the case when Labor was in office. Furthermore, that 80 per cent come from the lower and middle income groups: The lower the income the greater the rise in the tax burden. It is only the higher income earners who have been awarded real tax cuts. Thus, the equity of the tax system has been deliberately reduced by this Government. The Goverment's promises of tax cuts ring hollow to the great majority of the people who are paying more not less of their incomes in income tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite that undeniable situation, the Government persists with the language of tax cuts and low taxes as though none of that had happened. We thus have an ever growing credibility gap between the reality of what is happening to people and the Government's portrayal of itself, so much so that rather than speak of a credibility gap on this issue it is more appropriate to speak of a credibility chasm. Even now, when it is patently obvious to most Government members what has happened and when the Government is in disarray on this issue, we have witnessed the Governor-General in his opening address to this new Parliament being made to repeat the inanities about taxpayers being given freedom of choice in spending their incomes. Likewise, as recently as last night, we had the Treasurer extolling the virtues of his Government as a low tax government. </PARA>
<PARA> That is either self-delusion or, more likely, a desperate attempt to convince the public that the reality of increased taxes which they see reflected in their pay packets does not exist. Given the untenable nature of such an exercise by even the most gifted fiscal Houdini, the Treasurer is in danger of becoming an object of public derision. He deservedly should be known as the Minister for phantom tax cuts. He keeps telling us about tax cuts but when we attempt to find them they are not there. In fact, unless one is receiving quite a high income one is worse off now than before. </PARA>
<PARA> What makes that situation even more aggravating to the great majority of taxpayers is that, while they are paying more tax, a relatively small but growing group of high and especially very high income earners is paying little or no tax. This has come about because of the Government's complete failure to prevent a continuing explosion in tax avoidance, which has now reached the stage at which, according to Professor Matthews of the Australian National University, up to $3 billion a year in potential tax revenue is being lost through tax avoidance and evasion. There can be no refuting the fact that tax avoidance is now far greater than it was when this Government took office. For last financial year, 1979-80, the Commissioner of Taxation reported that the number of identified participants in tax avoidance schemes was 20 times greater than was the case in the last year of the Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's failure to prevent the proliferation of tax avoidance has resulted in its increasing the tax burden on the rest of the taxpayers, or most of them, in order to maintain revenue. That in turn has resulted not only in an increase in the tax burden of most taxpayers but also in a massive reduction in the equity and fairness of the tax system. The impact of tax avoidance in that regard is best illustrated by the fact that between 1975-76 and 1979-80 the incomes of all pay-as-you-earn taxpayers-that is, all wages and salaries paid-went up by 49 per cent but total income tax payments on those incomes went up by 73 per cent. However, for non pay-as-you-earn taxpayers-that is, recipients of business, property and farm income-total incomes increased by 79 per cent but total income tax payments went up by only 31 per cent. Such inequity is quite indefensible. </PARA>
<PARA> A further factor compounding the Government's failure in regard to taxation and extending its credibility chasm in that area is the extraordinary increase in the oil tax revenue. Between 1975-76 and 1980-81, the present financial year, the oil tax revenue has gone from $257m to a budgeted figure of $3,054m, which apparently will come out at more like $3,100m-an increase of over 1,100 per cent in that period of five years. As well as representing an extraordinary increase in taxation, this development has reduced the equity of the tax system as it is a patently regressive tax. The combined effect of all these factors has been to bring about an overall tax level which is substantially greater than that which applied when Labor was in office. For three years of Labor government, total Commonwealth tax receipts averaged 22.5 per cent of gross domestic product, whereas for the five years of the Fraser Government they have averaged 23.8 per cent. In the last year-that is, this year-they have reached a record 24.6 per cent. The overall tax burden therefore has undeniably increased under this Government. When one takes into account as well the much less equitable distribution of that burden so that most taxpayers are paying much more of their incomes in tax, this Government's total lack of credibility in regard to tax is fully exposed. </PARA>
<PARA> In these circumstances of the Government's abject failure to fulfil its original taxation objectives, it is not surprising to find the Government in total disarray on this issue. Thus, we have the desperate search for pseudo-solutions, such as a new broad-based indirect tax which the Treasurer has twice put to Cabinet and each time has had rejected on exactly the same grounds, that is, that it would be inflationary, which it certainly would be. It should be added, of course, that in any case it would have been no real solution to the Government's taxation dilemma as the overall level of taxation would have remained the same. The advantage for the Government, however, would have been that such a tax would have reduced the visibility of tax. In the event, the Government decided that it could not afford to pay for this piece of deception. </PARA>
<PARA> Another pseudo-solution put forward was the flat rate tax. Although the Treasurer and the Prime Minister have totally opposed it, we have had various other Government members publicly supporting it, such as the Deputy Prime Minister, who, as recently as three days ago, reiterated his support for the concept. Other members of the National Country Party, such as the five members of its self-styled Taxation committee of inquiry, about which we have heard little since its formation was announced, have also expressed their support for this concept. So, too, did the honourable member for Calare (Mr MacKenzie) and former Senator Sheil during the recent McPherson by-election. Senator-elect Bjelke-Petersen campaigned in the last general election on a platform of flat rate taxes and high rise scones. The absurdity of this proposal is demonstrated by the bewildering variety of forms in which it is proposed by its advocates and its gross inequity. As proposed by Mrs Bjelke-Petersen in the last election campaign, it would have involved losses of revenue of up to $9 billion or $10 billion, whilst in the form proposed by ex-Senator Sheil it would have involved much higher taxation for the majority of taxpayers. That is hardly a solution for them. </PARA>
<PARA> In a remarkable turnaround the scheme proposed by ex-Senator Sheil on behalf of the National Party in the recent by-election even involved taxation of capital gains, a proposal to which all coalition members, including the flat taxers, had expressed their total opposition only a few months before. More importantly, in whatever form it would involve a massive reduction in the equity of the tax system. It therefore remains a matter of concern to the Opposition that Cabinet members as highly placed as the Deputy Prime Minister are in open support of a flat rate of tax. In such circumstances and with the propensity of the Treasurer to be rolled in Cabinet on important tax issues, it is possible that a government desperate on the taxation issue could reach for such a crackpot pseudo solution at some future date. </PARA>
<PARA> Further evidence of the Government's desperation on the tax issue is its reconstitution, after the last election, of the Cabinet committee to review government expenditure. The Treasurer made it clear only two days ago that with the demise of his broad-based indirect tax scheme he placed his hopes for reductions in income tax on this committee's activities. However, on the same day the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) made it clear in a television interview that, as distinct from the Treasurer, he did not see much scope for tax reductions being created by this committee's activities. Doubtless, the Prime Minister was influenced by the fact that, despite the existence of such a Cabinet committee for several years, under his Cabinet expenditure in the public sector is greater by 2 per cent of gross domestic product than it was when the Labor Government was in office. </PARA>
<PARA> For all these reasons-the rising burden of income tax, the oil tax, rampant tax avoidance and a failure to reduce the public sector-the Fraser Government's credibility chasm continues to grow. Hence the disarray within the Government at present as to what should be done about it. There is every reason to expect this disarray to continue. The open differences in Cabinet and the government parties as to what tax reforms should be implemented are not likely to be resolved in the near future, if at all. The prospect of a reduced burden of personal income tax is clearly more remote now that the Prime Minister has asserted that the Government is committed only to half tax indexation, thereby implying a continuing increase in the tax burden as taxpayers move up the tax scale with inflation. The Prime Minister's indication that significant tax cuts cannot be expected from the Lynch Committee's activities closes off another potential source of tax cuts. The Government's refusal to adopt a resource rent tax which would tax the super profits of mining companies also makes personal tax cuts less possible. It closes off a sensible alternative source of revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> Likewise, the Government's absolutely scandalous decision not to apply a crude oil levy to the Fortescue oil field in the Bass Strait on the ground that it is new oil closes off a very lucrative source of alternative revenue. This decision by the Government means that it has turned its back on $3.5 billion of tax revenue at current prices. That enormous sum is the net additional tax it would gain over and above what would otherwise be paid in company tax over the 10 years following the commencement of production from this field, which is scheduled to be mid-1982, if the crude oil levy were applied to this field. In other words, $3.5 billion extra could be gained by applying the Government's own tax policy in respect of other oil fields to Fortescue. The Government has refused to do so. In the process, $3.5 billion will be paid out to the shareholders of Esso-BHP and will not be available to be used for the benefit of the Australian people. This is an absolutely scandalous decision for which the Government should be condemned. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, if the tax burden on ordinary Australians is to be reduced, a determination by government is required to ensure that areas of taxable capacity which are not now being adequately exploited are so exploited. This means that we must have, firstly, a resource rent tax. There is a crying need at the outset of a resources boom or increasing resource development for a resource rent tax. There is no doubt that super profits will be made in a number of projects. They are already being made in Bass Strait and by the Utah company. They will be made in various other projects. It is scandalous that such projects are not to be taxed appropriately and that those super profits will flow to a relatively small group of Australians and to foreigners. It is also important that Fortescue be brought in to that resource rent tax area which it would be by a Labor government. </PARA>
<PARA> We need a comprehensive attack on tax avoidance. We have not yet had it. I say in passing-time does not permit an elaboration-that section 260 of the Income Tax Assessment Act is not enough. Many of the other actions suggested by the Labor Party in its policy are required. The abolition of wasteful tax concessions such as the investment allowance is required. The investment allowance is doing little for investment. It is being paid to resources companies which will develop projects in this country with or without that concession. Finally, a faster rate of economic growth, which would come from the Labor Party's policies, would enable tax revenue to be increased without increasing tax rates. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the discussion of this matter of public importance because it provides me with an opportunity to say something about the background to the Government's decision which I announced on Monday about possible moves towards a broad-based indirect tax. I also inform the House that I will be taking advantage of an opportunity in the very near future to make a more detailed statement to the Parliament about taxation matters. That will provide to the Opposition and to Government members interested in this very important subject the opportunity to engage in a full and detailed debate on aspects of taxation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not suppose there is any economic matter on which it is more difficult to obtain a consensus in the Australian community than the question of taxation. None of us likes paying taxes and everybody believes in general in the idea of paying lower taxes although very few people are prepared to face the consequences in terms of reducing the size of government expenditure. That comment goes right across the spectrum because some of the strongest advocates of lower taxation in the community refuse to accept the very simple proposition that the only government that can effectively and responsibly reduce taxation is a government which is prepared to reduce the size of its own operations. Any government or any group of people in government who believe it is possible to increase expenditure and reduce taxation at the same time do not understand the economic experience of the Western world in the last 20 or 30 years. </PARA>
<PARA> There are, in essence, two issues to be looked at when one is looking at the overall taxation situation in Australia. Firstly, we have to look at the overall level of taxation in the Australian community. Secondly, we have to look at the combination or mix of taxation that provides the revenue for the ongoing needs of government. It has been said before but it ought to be repeated in the context of this debate that as a percentage of gross domestic product-I think most people would agree that this is the fairest measure-Australian taxation levels are not high by the standards of the industrialised world. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development average is about 36.5 per cent. The Australian level is about 28.8 per cent which is significantly lower. In the United Kingdom the figure is about 36 or 37 per cent and in Western Germany it is about the same. In Scandinavia and socialist Sweden the figure is as high as 52 or 53 per cent. That indicates that the overall level of taxation in the Australian community is not high by the standards of the industrial world. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Robert Brown" NAMEID="5A5">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Those figures are comparable. I say with great respect to my honourable colleague that the figures and comparisons are used on a basis that has been employed by the OECD for a number of years. To my knowledge they have not been the subject of serious criticism as a measure by economic opinion and the opinion of people interested in taxation over the time that they have been used. Although the overall level of taxation in the Australian community is not high by the standards of the industrial world, unlike many other countries in the OECD we rely more heavily on personal taxation as a source of revenue. We rely much more heavily upon it than, for example, do most of the countries of western and northern Europe, although the countries of northern Europe rely heavily on all forms of taxation because of the requirement to support such a huge public expenditure program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Because of our heavier reliance upon personal taxation, it was only natural that the Government should turn its mind to the mix of taxation in the Australian community. In doing so, it recognised that there were very powerful arguments both for and against a change in that taxation mix. I do not pretend that all of the arguments as to whether a broad-based indirect tax ought to be introduced are on one side. There are very powerful arguments as to why it ought to be. There is no doubt that in straight economic terms, personal income tax, depending upon the levels, can have an effect on incentive. There is no doubt that over the years the impact of a progressive taxation scale in a time of inflation produces even more progressive effects and even greater disincentives. Twenty-five years ago average weekly earnings had to be exceeded some 17 or 18 times before one reached the upper marginal rate in the income tax scale. Now the level is down to 2.5 to 3 times average weekly earnings, which gives an idea of the impact of inflation under a progressive taxation scale. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, after the last election, the Government decided to conduct an examination to see whether the time was right to make a change. Essentially, three forms of broad-based indirect tax were available. They have been identified by the Asprey Committee. There was no secret about them. I think there was general agreement that if a broad-based indirect tax were to be introduced, it would be a value added tax, a retail turnover tax on goods and services or the wholesale tax base would be expanded and a tax on selected services would be introduced. A value added tax is applied widely in Europe but is very cumbersome and costly and may not be as self-policing as many of its protagonists argue. In reality, a value added tax was never a serious option before the Government. That was made clear by both the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and me before Christmas. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that of all broad-based indirect taxes, a retail turnover tax has more appealing features in that it is a tidier system and is more even and equitable than are other forms of indirect tax. I should point out that the advice available to the Government indicated a lead time of some two years before a retail turnover tax could be implemented in respect of both goods and services. The wholesale tax base can be expanded with relative ease because there is already in operation an administrative structure. In fact, some years ago the base of wholesale tax collection in Australia was very much broader than it is now. It was contracted in the early 1950s by a previous government, but even in that respect and in respect of the introduction of a tax on services, considerable lead times were involved. The arguments against the introduction of either a retail turnover tax or a broadening of the wholesale tax base and the introduction of a tax on selected services ultimately, in the opinion of the Government, outweighed the benefits that could be gained in effecting a change of the tax base. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) says that the Government has twice rejected a move towards a retail turnover tax because of its inflationary consequences. I would say to the honourable gentleman that he is correct, that the inflationary consideration was dominant in 1979 and was dominant on this occasion also. Honourable members ought to know that although there is an understanding in the community of perhaps some of the advantages of a change in the mix of taxation towards a greater reliance on indirect taxation, there is perhaps a misunderstanding of the arithmetic of that change. For example, to reduce each of the three steps in the present tax rate scale by one cent, that is, from 60c to 59c, from 46c to 45c and from 32c to 31c, would cost the Government, in this current financial year, no less than $600m. It has been calculated that to raise about the same amount of revenue from a broadly-based indirect tax would require the imposition of a tax of one per cent. Thus, to reduce the tax rate scale by one cent, it is necessary to introduce an indirect tax of about one per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Those who argue that the correct course of action is to bring about a major reduction in personal income tax, financed by the introduction of a broad-based indirect tax, are in effect arguing that we should introduce a tax which would add 5 per cent, 6 per cent or even 7 per cent to the rate of inflation. To reduce the present income tax scales in a noticeable fashion-for example, to reduce the 32c step to about 25c-would involve raising some $3,500m to $4,000m by way of indirect taxes. The effect on the consumer price index would be very significant. Those who have argued in favour of reform have claimed, quite properly in my view, that if there were to be a change in the mix of taxation, it ought to be one that would be seen as such by the tax paying community-that in compensation for an increase in direct tax there ought to be noticeable reductions in the level of personal tax. Many people felt that unless such noticeable reductions could be achieved, the value of bringing about the change would be lost and, in terms of creating a greater incentive it would be seen by perhaps an increasing number of people in the community as nothing more than the imposition of a new tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, in the final analysis, and conscious that there were then, and remain, arguments for a change in the mix of taxation in the Australian community, this Government decided last Monday that principally, but not exclusively, because of the inflationary consequences and, indeed, the implications of the arithmetic of a change-such as I have tried to sketch in the brief time available to me-the benefits would be outweighed by the costs, in particular in terms of inflationary consequences. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to refer to two other matters before concluding. First, I refer to the comments that are made by the Opposition about tax avoidance. I do not suppose that there is any more tiresome, invalid or irrelevant charge made by the Opposition concerning taxation than that this Government has done very little to counter tax avoidance. I have said before, and I repeat, that the record of this Government in fighting and reducing tax avoidance in the Australian community is without parallel since the end of World War II. This Government has introduced more legislation and has been prepared to go further in identifying tax avoidance schemes than has any other government. What it has done over the last five years compares more than favourably with the utter failure of the Opposition party to act when it was in government, despite the evidence that tax avoidance really took off in the 1970s when inflation took off. The impact of the very high ratio of inflation on the progressive taxation scale in 1974 represented the beginning of real tax avoidance in the Australian community. The failure of the then Labor Treasurer to do anything as a consequence of the decision of the High Court in the Curran case was the beginning of the heyday of the tax avoidance industry in this community. Let that never be forgotten. Let no member of the Australian Labor Party come into this House parading as the protector of the small, wage earning, tax paying member of the community and claiming that the Government has done nothing about tax avoidance. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, I would like to remind honourable members, as I said at the beginning of my remarks, that ultimately the overall level of taxation in the Australian community, or in any community, will depend upon the size of government and upon how big a share of the nation's resources government wishes to take unto itself, because government has no resources of its own. There can be no argument, ambiguity or equivocation as to which party in this House stands for bigger government. It is the Opposition. The Opposition stands for bigger government; it always has and it always will because it has a doctrinaire commitment to the belief that governments know better than individuals. I will again remind the honourable members for Gellibrand of the remarks he made to the Labor Economist and he will never be allowed to forget them. I will remind the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) of what he said in his Chamberlain lecture and I will remind other members of the Opposition that their party, by its programs, doctrines and its own work and commitments, stands without qualification for bigger government and therefore it is the party of high taxation in this Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It does not take a great deal of intelligence to refute the rather emotional remarks we have just heard from the Treasurer (Mr Howard). The argument within the Australian community about taxation is essentially an argument about priorities. It is quite clear where this Government's priorities have been with regard to taxation. When it wanted to get elected in 1975, again in 1977 and, no doubt, in 1980, it said that it wanted to reduce taxation. However, I ask the House: For whom did the Government want to reduce taxation? Certainly it was not for the ordinary wage and salary earners of this country because by any count those people are paying considerably more tax now than they have paid at any time in the history of this country. Certainly it is considerably more than they paid in 1975.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer particularly to income taxes, but that situation is true even if one does not take account of what has happened in relation to petrol taxes. The shadow Treasurer referred to a figure in this year's Budget of more than $3 billion-more than 10 per cent of the Government's revenue-which will come from this source alone. No more inequitable system of taxation could be devised by a government than one that loaded this kind of impost on the ordinary motorist. No moves have been taken by this Government to deal with the questions of equity involved in that system of taxation. It is very clear that that is because the Government has as a priority the negative redistribution of taxation. This Government is concerned with redistributing taxes so that the ordinary wage and salary earners pay more either directly or indirectly. The Government is worried about inflation at the moment but it will come back to value added and retail taxes-indirect taxes-because that is what it is concerned about doing. It wants to increase the impost on the ordinary wage and salary earner. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at what this Government has been on about on the other side of the ledger. I believe that if we look at that we will see where its real interests are and who it is responding to in regard to its taxation policies. I believe I can establish that what might be described as the corporate capital of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), or the robber baron, has come into an alliance with this Government to ensure that this negative redistribution occurs. Over the period that this Government has been in power less and less tax has been paid by the corporate sector and more and more has been paid by ordinary wage and salary earners. Let us look at some examples, and I challenge someone to refute them. First of all, it has abolished all forms of capital taxes. This is the only country in the Western world that has no form of capital tax. A great deal was made of this issue during the election campaign. There was a great deal of emotion and mud slinging but the reality is that this Government would never face up to a commission of inquiry into the distribution of wealth, as proposed by the Opposition, because one of the first things that inquiry would establish would be that any reasonable, civilised society needs some form of capital transfer taxation. But, in 1978 this Government was responsible for abolishing estate and gift duties. They are highly minimal forms of capital taxation but nevertheless they are significant in terms of taxation equity. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, this Government is responsible, as perhaps no other government has been, for introducing a series of schemes which are designed to enable large scale corporate capital to legitimately avoid tax. These schemes include investment allowances, depreciation allowances, stock valuation adjustments and so on which have amounted to more than $2.5 billion since the Government has been in office. So the big boys of the corporate world have some more money to invest according to their priorities. Thirdly, as the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) has pointed out, despite the Government's five years in office it has allowed tax avoidance to be a growth industry. It is all very well for the Treasurer to say that no one has done more than he has, but if there are 20 times as many people avoiding tax now as there were in 1975, what kind of success is that? It is no kind of success at all. The reason this Government has not been successful in relation to tax avoidance is that it is not serious. Ultimately it is not serious because too many mates of the Treasurer are into it. In the end, too many friends of this Government are involved in that business for it to take the drastic action required. I do not want to go any further into that, but the record speaks for itself. The Treasurer is well aware of it and he ought to come clean with the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, in relation to what is happening with the economy and what opportunities might have arisen, one becomes aware that more and more the economy is being built around resource-based industries. The Opposition repeatedly has made proposals with regard to a resource rent tax. It is well known that Australia is a bit of a joke in international circles because in areas such as the mining and processing of bauxite it is quite clear that the royalties being extracted by the State governments-for example, it is no more than $1 or $2 a tonne for bauxite-are quite laughable when compared with those of other bauxite producing countries. Jamaica gets $16 by way of royalties for every tonne of bauxite that it exports. Australia has welched on the International Bauxite Association by failing to force up the royalties and therefore the price of Australian bauxite so that we get a genuine return on our national resources. We are simply more interested in having a friendly relationship with some of the international resource countries than we are in achieving either justice for Australia's limited resources or a fair price for other countries which are dependent on these resources perhaps as their only major asset. </PARA>
<PARA> Fifthly, the Government has looked after international capital by failing to ensure that international companies with operations in Australia do not escape taxation via transfer pricing. Let us take another example from the aluminium industry. Where operations run at a higher than average cost, these costs are not passed on at the next stage. In this way operations can run at a loss in high tax countries and make their profits in low tax countries. Of course, this occurred in Jamaica in 1974, and that prompted the establishment of the IBA. In Australia a firm selling aluminium to Japan could sell the aluminium to a wholly-owned subsidiary in Hong Kong at a price so that the firm paid no tax in Australia. The price from the firm in Hong Kong for aluminium sold to Japan will realise a profit that is taxed in Hong Kong, where tax is lower. Accordingly, this scheme resulted, as was revealed in a recent case involving Comalco Ltd, in achieving $4m for that company because of tax avoidance. I refer to today's Age newspaper. One might ask why the Taxation Office is not being directly represented at the inquiry into aluminium by the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources. The reason it will not be directly represented is that the Treasurer is very concerned about the revelations that would occur in relation to international resource industries such as the aluminium industry if a full investigation were made into transfer pricing. This particular industry is dominated in all of its phases by the six sisters of the world industry. They are powerful and sophisticated firms. Does anyone seriously believe that this Government will be concerned to ensure that they pay an effective or equitable rate of taxation?</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I refer to a paper from the Parliamentary Library which looks at the tax record of resource companies in this regard. During the financial period 1973-79 the companies mentioned in the paper earned a before tax consolidated operating profit of $1,000m but paid only $188m in company tax-tax at the rate of only 35.76 per cent. That is what is happening in this country. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the table accompanying this paper. I have shown it to the Treasurer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In all these areas we can see the way in which this Government is biased towards the interests of corporate capital. On the one hand, the Government is increasing the burden on the ordinary wage and salary earner and, on the other, it is doing everything it can to decrease the burden on these major companies. In terms of having an economy restructured around resource-based industries, if we are not going to have a fair taxation system we ought not to be involved in these industries at all because involvement will mean negative redistribution on a massive scale.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that the reliance that the House can place on the remarks of the honourable member for Batman (Mr Howe) can be gauged by considering one simple point, that is, that this financial year the Government brought about a reduction in taxation, dating from 1 July last year, which concentrated on the single income family, and which amounted to the order of $600m given effect, via a significant increase in the spouse allowance. So much for many of the remarks of the honourable member for Batman about negative redistribution. In general, the opportunism, the insincerity and, I might say, the hypocrisy of the Australian Labor Party in bringing forward this matter for discussion today knows no bounds. The Labor Party alleges that there is confusion in the Government's policy on taxation. There is no confusion about the central objective of the tax policy of this Government, which is to contain and to reduce in a responsible manner the total paid in taxation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Does anyone doubt that it is the Labor Party, which is the socialist big spending, high inflation, big taxing party? The honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) made reference to certain percentage figures for taxation in relation to the gross domestic product. They are worth looking at closely but time does not permit too close an inspection. If one looks at page 273 of the Budget Papers one will see that over the three years of office of the Labor Government the total receipts as a proportion of GDP went from 22.2 per cent to 25.1 per cent. They went up three percentage points from 22 per cent over three short years. </PARA>
<PARA> Between the first Budget of this Government, 1976-77, and the last complete one, 1979-80, they went from 25.7 per cent to 26.1 per cent. There was a very small increase but it was associated with some very significant but basic factors which are occurring in our society and which I think are worth emphasising. For example, over the last 10 years the number of age pensioners has increased from 181 per 1,000 of the working population to 339. In that context there has been this fractional increase over the whole period of office of this Government and, at the same time, a decrease in the total spending from 30 per cent to 28 per cent, which shows how we have got hold of things. I ask honourable members to reflect on that upsurge of three percentage points in three short years of Labor and to ask themselves which is the big spending, the big taxing and the high inflation party. The Australian people gave a very clear answer to that in the election of last October. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point I wish to make is that it is right to say that there has been debate-a very different thing from confusion-within the Government and the public sphere about taxation. It has not been about increasing the total taxation. It has been about changing the mix of taxes, to use the expression that the Treasurer (Mr Howard) used. The problem is whether we should raise more taxes in one way and less in another way always with a view to reducing the total of taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me get that point clear. The debate has been about changing the mix of taxation to foster better the criteria which apply to any tax system. On the one hand it is necessary for it to give incentives or to minimise disincentive effects and on the other it has to be equitable and be seen to be equitable. Under both heads there are strong arguments for changing the mix of taxation. To have a debate about these matters was a very right and proper thing. There are very strong arguments for a substantial reduction in personal income tax, initially concentrated at low income levels, and for its replacement by a broad-based indirect tax. Under debate was a package which would at the same time increase the indirect tax, reduce the income tax and compensate those, in particular pensioners, who are not paying tax and who would be adversely affected. </PARA>
<PARA> There are strong arguments for this change in the mix and the Government has been looking at those arguments. One of those arguments is the very matter of tax avoidance and evasion, about which the honourable member for Gellibrand had so much to say. In that regard I am referring not only to sophisticated schemes of tax avoidance but also to the magnitude and incidence of the so-called cash economy-such as payment for work done on a cash basis that never goes into the books and never comes to the attention of the Commissioner of Taxation. People who earn or acquire money in this way get caught by an indirect tax at the point where they spend it. That is a very important argument for a broad-based tax. The honourable member for Gellibrand and the honourable member for Batman talk a lot about doing something concerning tax avoidance and evasion but the Labor Party did nothing when it was in government-and if this tax decision had gone the other way, the Labor Party would have done its best to undermine it and not make it work. </PARA>
<PARA> The overriding consideration on the other side of this argument is the impact on inflation of the introduction of such a broad-based tax, of changing the mix in that way. It is the Government's efforts in getting hold of inflation-the level of inflation last year was 9.3 per cent compared with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development average of 12.4 per cent-which has led to the recovery in the economy which we are witnessing and which led to the growth in new jobs of the order of 150,000 to 200,000 last year. It is because the Government has got hold of inflation in this way that we have had this recovery and this strong growth in the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the opportunism and insincerity of the Opposition comes to the fore on this point. There would be an initial effect on inflation of such a change in the mix of tax. There would be no increase in the total; no one is suggesting that. The problem is that there would be secondary effects through flow on and wage indexation. Do honourable members opposite think that the Labor Party would try to assist in that particular respect? The sort of proposal that could be considered if in fact it could be supported, particularly by honourable members on the other side of the House, would be one in which, as I have said, there would be a simultaneous and equal reduction in the income tax and the corresponding introduction of the indirect tax. The later tax shows up in the price index. The reduction in income tax which can be contemplated and has been authoritatively estimated as putting into the average taxpayer's hands the same sort of money as he would be required to spend through the initial rise in prices of goods and services would not enter the price index and would not be taken into account. Do honourable members opposite think we would get any support from them in trying, for instance, to make that point clear to the Australian public?</PARA>

<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to the Government's decision to extend the operation of the Bounty (Polyester-Cotton Yarn) Act 1978 until 31 December 1981. The existing Act expires on 31 August 1981. The Bounty (Polyester-Cotton Yarn) Act 1978 provides assistance to the manufacture in Australia of polyester-cotton yarn by means of a bounty scheme. The scheme provides for the payment of a bounty to eligible manufacturers at a rate of $1.15 per kilogram on the bountiable yarn which, during the period to which the Act applies, is spun at registered premises for use in the knitting or weaving of textiles in Australia. There is a current annual limit of $600,000 on the amount available for payment of bounty. </PARA>
<PARA> The extension of the operation of this scheme is being made as an interim measure pending commencement on 1 January 1982 of new bounty arrangements for polyester cotton yarns. The new arrangements form part of the Government's proposed program of assistance for the textiles, clothing and footwear industries beyond 1981. From 1 January 1982 the bounty rate for polyester-cotton yarns will be calculated as 52 per cent of factory cost value added. The amount available for payment of bounty during the extended period of the current scheme will be $200,000. I commend the Bill to honourable members. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to the Government's decision to provide temporary assistance to the industry in Australia producing non-adjustable wrenches. This assistance arrangement follows the Government's consideration of the advice and recommendations by the Temporary Assistance Authority contained in its report No. 50 of 14 August 1980 entitled: 'Non-Adjustable Spanners'. The Government has accepted the Temporary Assistance Authority's recommendation that temporary assistance, in the form of a production bounty, be accorded to this industry in Australia. The Bill provides for the bounty to be payable at the rate of 11c on each bountiable implement having a local content exceeding 50 per cent. This scheme is to operate for a period of one year and bounty payments during that period are limited to a maximum of $620,000. </PARA>
<PARA> During its inquiry the Temporary Assistance Authority found that the local industry's overall activity has declined over the past 4 or 5 years while imports of competing products has increased. In the past 3 years the total domestic market share held by the major Australian manufacturer, Siddons Industries Ltd, has declined from 25 per cent to 16 per cent. However in this same period the local market for the tools increased from 16.5 million to 20 million units and imports also increased from 12.5 million to 16 million units. In recommending the bounty assistance for this industry the Temporary Assistance Authority was concerned to ensure that the assistance provided will have an immediate effect but will only affect those areas of the market supplied by the local industry. The Government expects that the assistance as proposed by this Bill will restore previous activity levels and thus enable the local industry to compete more adequately against the imported products. An assessment of the need for the continuation of the bounty assistance beyond 12 months will be undertaken by the Industries Assistance Commission as part of its report on cutlery, industrial knives and hand tools due to be submitted to the Government by 30 June 1981. I commend the Bill to honourable members. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Coal Excise Act 1949. The amendment will extend to 28 days the period within which entries for home consumption may be made for coal removed from a coal mine during a period approved by a collector of customs. The Coal Excise Act 1949 contains machinery provisions to enforce the collection of excise duties imposed on coal for the purposes of financing long service leave benefits granted to certain employees in the coal mining industry and for the funding of the Coal Research Trust Account. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 24 (2) of this Act permits coal to be removed from a coal mine during a period, usually a calendar month, approved by the collector of customs without entry if a deposit of money, or if a guarantee in respect of the duty on the coal has been given by the coal producer. However, section 24 (4) provides that the entry in respect of the coal removed from the coal mine during the approved period shall be made not later than seven working days after the expiration of the period. The Government has decided to extend the period to 28 days as seven days has proven to be unnecessarily restrictive. This is particularly so in cases where coal producers do not possess their own weighing facilities and need to obtain their production figures from accumulated weighbridge certificates issued by State railway authorities. Unavoidable delays also occur when centralised payments of duty are made by parent companies which have widespread subsidiary collieries. I commend the Bill to honourable members. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In 1969 Professor Russell Mathews of the Australian National University who was the first Chairman of the Advisory Council for Inter-government Relations and is currently Director of the Centre for Research on Federal Financial Relations wrote the following:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Federal system was conceived in the 1890s as a means of unifying the six colonies, but by the 1960s it had become the most divisive force in Australian society and the chief factor responsible for economic inefficiency and inadequacy in the public sector. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on:</PARA>
<PARA> The continuing crisis in Commonwealth-State finance must be seen as an unnecessary yoke around the necks of the Australian people. It is as disadvantageous to the Commonwealth as to the States, and as the dominant partner it is the Commonwealth which must take the initiative in resolving the crisis. If the Australian economy is not to be wrecked by the impasse in intergovernmental relations, a new kind of federal system must be devised, one which provides a clear division of administrative responsibility and financial viability for each level of government. </PARA>
<PARA>Professor Mathews also wrote:</PARA>
<PARA> Planning for national development can proceed effectively only if it is based on workable machinery for resource allocation throughout the public sector. </PARA>
<PARA>The tragedy for Australia is that those words are as true now as they have been at any time over the last 12 years. As the Bill before the House puts us a little closer to creating the necessary mechanisms with which we can come to grips quickly, efficiently and imaginatively with the economic and social upheavals that face all Australians during the 1980s and beyond, I state that the Opposition welcomes this Bill, has no objection to it and, indeed, supports it. </PARA>
<PARA> As we know, this is a Bill for an Act to amend the Advisory Council for Inter-government Relations Act 1976. It is not a major Bill. It is more of a machinery Bill. But it does not give us an opportunity, under the heading of sins of omission in this whole area of inter-governmental relations to discuss those relations in this country. But first of all I would like to draw some attention to details of the Bill. Section 4 (1) of that principal Act states that the Council was established with the object of improving inter-governmental co-operation and that it shall, in accordance with directions given at Premiers Conferences, inquire into, keep under consideration and review matters relating to inter-governmental co-operation. This Bill leaves the substantive provisions of the principal Act as I have quoted it to the House untouched. The Minister for Education (Mr Fife) in his second reading speech said:</PARA>
<PARA> These amendments--</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the amendments which are contained in this Bill-</PARA>
<PARA>are aimed principally at reinforcing the Council's independence in the performance of its functions by providing for the Council to become a body corporate with its own bank account, to have control over its staffing arrangements, exempting the Council from Commonwealth and State taxation laws and by making it clear that the Council is not subject to direction by or on behalf of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA>If we are to have a proper council, even though it is only of an advisory nature, made up of people representing all three tiers of government plus people from the community generally, of course we must have a council with such independence. </PARA>
<PARA> The changes that I have listed and that are in this Bill do require consequential amendments to other parts of the Bill to ensure appropriate financial accountability in relation to auditing, accounting procedures and financial reporting. The amendments are of themselves neither extraordinary sources of controversy nor the type of matter likely to rekindle fervent States-righters' passions. However, as a representative from this Parliament on the Advisory Council for Inter-government Relations I know that these amendments are necessary for the proper functioning of that Advisory Council. </PARA>
<PARA> What is significant about these essentially bread and butter provisions is that they have taken so long to be brought into even draft form. Although I was not a member of the first Advisory Council, I have been attending since the first Hobart meeting of that Advisory Council as a proxy for others. I have not been able to attend every meeting of the Advisory Council in the intervening five years or so but I have either been a proxy or a substantive member of the Advisory Council during those five years. I know for how long it has been clear that these amendments were necessary and how long it has taken to bring them to this House. All of this shows up how difficult it is to run this cumbersome federation of ours. </PARA>
<PARA> Centralists will no doubt note with some degree of amusement that the relatively minor changes embodied in the Bill have had to be agreed to by the Federal Government, the State Premiers, the Australian Council of Local Government Associations and the Advisory Council itself. The fact that this is the main reason why it has taken five years for these important provisions to come as close as this to being inserted in the Act-we cannot say they are yet in the Act; not only does the Bill have to pass through this chamber but, of course, it also has to pass through the other one-in itself is hardly a shining example of the efficiency of co-operative federalism. I wish the wheels ran more smoothly so that it did not take so long for these things to happen. </PARA>
<PARA> I assert that had the present Government's actions matched its rhetoric in being seriously concerned with reforming the state of intergovernmental relations in Australia, the provisions now being inserted in the Act by way of this Bill would have been so inserted a long time ago. Admittedly we are concerning ourselves here only with an advisory council. But if we cannot get this Advisory Council's house in order efficiently and quickly, how can we expect something meaningful to be done about the substance of the subject of intergovernmental relations?</PARA>
<PARA> Before making some more general observations about the development of federalism in Australia-and this is pertinent when we are referring to this Advisory Council which has a wide charter-I draw the attention of the House to one section of the Bill about which I feel uneasy. I refer to clause 6 of the Bill which states:</PARA>
<PARA> Section 4 of the Principal Act is amended by inserting after sub-section (1) the following sub-section:</PARA>
<PARA> '(1A) In the performance of its function, the Council shall not be subject to any directions other than directions referred to in sub-section (1).'</PARA>
<PARA>This refers particularly to the meaning of 'direction' as amplified by section 4 (2) of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> It is necessary for me to state what sub-section 2 is all about. Sub-section (2) states:</PARA>
<PARA> The reference in sub-section (1) to directions given at the Premiers Conference shall be read as a reference to directions given by the Prime Minister and the Premiers of the participating States, or their representatives, at a conference known as the Premiers Conference. </PARA>
<PARA>From this one can see that the Commonwealth and the States have an advantage over the third level of government-that is, local government-which is not represented at the Premiers Conference. The Australian Local Government Association could have been given the right, in my view, to place matters before the Council directly or could have been given the right to make suggestions as to what should be placed before the Council. That not having been done, it can be said that local government is at a disadvantage, is not on all fours with and is not equal to the other tiers of government in matters concerning the working of this Advisory Council. However, I recognise that this would have had its difficulties and would have been frankly more of a token than a matter of substance because representatives of local government, as, indeed, other members of the Council, have their opportunity of placing issues to be pursued before the Council. However, tokens such as the Australian Local Government Association being able to at least make suggestions directly to the Council rather than through its local government representatives on the Council are important and should not be overlooked. </PARA>
<PARA> It should not be ignored that my political opponents in the Liberal and National Country parties are continually reluctant to give the consideration and status to local government which that important area deserves. This is not the only example where that situation applies. Of course, in the 1970s we had debates in this Parliament and elsewhere in the community concerning firstly giving local government a voice in Loan Council meetings. The Labor Party has been in favour of that but the Liberal and National Country parties, in their conservative moulds, have not been in favour of that. I repeat that this is just another example of the Labor Party championing local government to give it greater status in our federation than has been done to date. </PARA>
<PARA> Put quite bluntly the Fraser Government has little interest at all in the development of local or regional government and is concerned only with State governments out of fear. In a paper entitled 'Federalism and Efficiency' A. J. Robinson of the Centre for Research on Federal Financial Relations at the Australian National University set out four criteria for evaluating the success of federal systems. I suggest that these are criteria which the Advisory Council for Inter-government Relations should always bear in mind. As set out by Mr Robinson they are: Firstly, independence; secondly, financial viability; thirdly, accountability; and, fourthly, economic efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> If the record of the Fraser Government is assessed on these criteria then we can see very clearly just what a mess our federation is in. I will give a few examples. Let us take the subject of resources which is one of the subjects at which the Advisory Council easily could be looking; the division of functions between the three tiers of government in relation to the great issue of resources-it was a great issue of the 1980s-about which everyone in public life is talking. If one merely mentions the words 'aluminium' and 'coal' one immediately has in one's mind a picture of relative chaos because of a lack of leadership and co-ordination on the part of the present national government. There was enormous controversy in Victoria over Portland. There was controversy in the Hunter River about the prices of power being charged to the various aluminium projects which are in the pipeline. These are areas where, in my view, the national Government should have a role. It is the sort of thing in which the Advisory Council for Inter-governmental Relations will be interested when it gets round to it. It is in chaos now. </PARA>
<PARA> A similar situation applies in relation to immigration. The Commonwealth has sole constitutional authority in this area but it still needs to co-operate with the States and local governments to integrate migrants into our community. This has always been recognised at all levels of government. Honourable members should pause for a moment to consider the present refugee settlement problems in areas such as Fairfield in New South Wales and the disgraceful facilities to be found at Pennington in my State. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will be aware that my State is South Australia but that needs to be put into the record. These are all intergovernmental relations problems needing the attention of the Advisory Council. </PARA>
<PARA> The salinity of the water in the Murray River was raised in the House today during Question Time. The South Australian State Liberal Government is crying out for a Commonwealth lead in this matter. So far there has been no response. It is another example of chaos in the field of intergovernmental relations. For so long this great river of our nation has become silted and has greater and greater salinity problems. Honourable members might ask why. It is because of the intergovernmental relations problems. Failure to exercise clear constitutional power by one arm of government often leads to these problems. Need one go further than merely mention the phrase: 'Aboriginal rights in Queensland and Western Australia'? One might ask from time to time when problems like Noonkanbah are raised why we had a referendum in 1967. What clearer indication could we have of the nation wanting this Commonwealth Parliament to take a lead? I hope that the Advisory Council for Inter-government Relations will bring light where there is darkness over these questions. It is most important that we should have a Bill such as this one improving its mechanisms. </PARA>
<PARA> Companies and securities legislation is another area where there is chaos between the various tiers of government. As stated so clearly last night by the shadow Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, Mr John Brown, the circuitous route taken by the Government in enacting this legislation is totally inefficient and has left Australian shareholders open to the same abuses that damaged the reputation of our stock exchanges with both local and overseas investors in the late 1970s. We have waited for years for satisfactory legislation and the excuse that we have been given as to why we have not had it, is, of course, because of this snarl up in intergovernmental relations. This is another area where I think the legislation that is going through this House will not be satisfactory. The methods of amendment certainly will not be satisfactory. Indeed we are hopeful that the Advisory Council for Inter-government Relations eventually will be able to bring light and more sense to bear on these problems than hitherto has happened. </PARA>
<PARA> I will end this list of the sorts of problems that will be-if they are not already-before this Advisory Council with the whole matter of Commonwealth-State-local government financial relations. Mr Deputy Speaker, I might just interpose there, in case you think I am getting a little wide of the Bill, that we have right now before the Advisory Council for Inter-government Relations an enormous reference known as the relationships reference. This involves the relationship between those three tiers of government and, of course, financial relationships are at the heart of that problem. Total grants to States and local government have not kept pace with inflation. In other words they decline substantially in real terms. So-called 'new federalism', of course, has not been carried through and the whole area is presently in a mess. In the past few days we have had new announcements as to when the next Premiers Conference will be to seek yet another solution to this very complex problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The country is still seeking a formula to replace the Whitlam one of six years ago. What is the result? Grants to States have not kept pace with increases in the federal Government's own expenditure. State governments and, in particular, local governments have been forced to increase borrowings at times of high interest rates. Therefore, increased grants have been eroded both by inflation and the need to make higher interest payments. In addition, there has been the need to make increased repayments on the debts themselves. So residents of this country have suffered increased State government charges and local government rates because of the unsatisfactory state of intergovernmental financial arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> The difficulties of our federation, of our intergovernmental relations, are great. I have made mention of only some of those difficulties but the Advisory Council is bringing some light-I repeat a phrase that I used earlier-where there has been darkness. I am glad that there is some activity however modest. The Advisory Council's first reference was about the interchangeability of staff between the three tiers of government. That report has been well received. I wish there were more action in that direction following from the report because a closer working relationship between the administrations of the three tiers of government would be of great benefit to us all. Mr Deputy Speaker, I have already commented upon the next reference. The look in your eye was such that I thought you were just about to tell me that my remarks were not close enough to the Bill. But I have saved you from doing so and I showed you just how pertinent my remarks were when I referred to that reference on the relationship between the three tiers of government. It is an enormous one. Many discussion papers of great quality have been commissioned and published leading up to recommendations which will be made under this wide heading. At last we now have more people thinking about these grave problems. </PARA>
<PARA> I notice that the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson) will probably follow me in this debate. He has been a member of the Advisory Council for Inter-government Relations as has another honourable member from this Parliament. I might say quickly that, whilst the honourable member is from South Australia, the whole of the membership of the Advisory Council for Inter-government Relations is not from South Australia, although a lot of the quality is from that State. I have been pleased to be a representative on the Council. We have a good staff and I pay tribute to their work. I believe that there is a genuine attempt to address the serious problems before the Council on the part of all members. Inevitably, progress has been slow. One of the reasons for this has been the administrative difficulties caused by the inadequacies of the Act under which we have been working, and those inadequacies are addressed in the legislation before us. However, let no one think that this legislation will address itself to improving intergovernmental relations other than in the most indirect way. For that improvement, much more good will and far less emotional rhetoric is required from many elected leaders and others in this country. The recent wranglings between the Liberal Party and the National Country Party in Queensland testify that, if anything, these issues have been getting worse, not better, in recent years. The challenges of the resources boom, of technological advances and structural change demand that our federal system further the interests of all Australians, not fetter them. I repeat that this requires good will built on knowledge, and at least the Advisory Council for Inter-government Relations is increasing that body of knowledge. </PARA>
<PARA> The approach of the Labor Party will continue to be pragmatic. We scorn such labels as centralist or States' righters. We genuinely believe in co-operative federalism and will facilitate all means of making it work, means such as getting advice from the Advisory Council for Inter-government Relations. We want administration to be carried out as close to the people as possible. We shall facilitate this being done, wherever it is viable and generally feasible, close to the people and even at local government level. We also believe in one Australia; not seven or eight separate, jealous little kingdoms. We believe in planning and co-ordination, and this means a lean, active, sensitive Federal Government working in co-operation with State, Territory and local governments to fulfil people's needs. Inefficient, flabby administrations are of interest to no one. Overbearing, authorative, removed, out of touch, centralist bureaucracies similarly are not supported by us in the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> I come back to the words I used earlier. We believe in the pragmatic approach to co-operative federalism. We seek better ways to bring about this co-operation. We support the work of the Advisory Council for Inter-government Relations in researching those better ways. On behalf of the Opposition I support this Bill, which will improve the administration of the ACIR so that it can achieve its purposes more readily. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a member representing this Parliament on the Advisory Council for Inter-government Relations, I want to take just a few minutes of the time of the House to support the Advisory Council for Inter-government Relations Amendment Bill. I believe that, as was manifest in much of what the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) had to say, the Opposition has taken a genuine role within the Advisory Council in seeking to fulfil the objectives for which that Council was established of enabling the relationships between the three spheres of government in this country to be improved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I guess that there would be some difference between myself and the honourable member for Adelaide in our understandings and definitions of federalism. In his concluding remarks in this debate he talked about his desire to see decentralised administration. He wants administration close to the people. My understanding of federalism goes one step further. I want to see government, the decision-making process, taken closer to the people. It is no good having all the policies determined by a central government here in Canberra and having a few delegates out on the ground administering those policies at the local level. In many instances, the people want the legislative decisions to be taken at the local level. That is why I am a great supporter of a three-sphered system of government within this country, with each sphere having discrete and sometimes overlapping legislative responsibility, so that wherever possible the laws governing a community or a State can be determined as close as possible to the people affected by those laws. </PARA>
<PARA> We have come a long way since 1901. Under our system of government, in a federation that came about by the decision of six separate colonies to ask the United Kingdom Government to form them into one nation circumstances have changed. The relationships between State and Federal governments have altered, as have the very role and essence of local government. In the early 1970s there were severe and substantial tensions between the spheres of government. As a result of observing those tensions from a position on the Opposition benches of this House, the present Government parties examined this whole question and presented to the Australian people what is known as the Government's federalism policy. An essential element of that policy was the establishment of the Advisory Council for Inter-government Relations. The legislation now before us is merely to assist in the proper workings of that Council. As the honourable member for Adelaide has pointed out, the Council's functions and role really have not been prejudiced too severely by the problems that are addressed in this legislation. Certainly it will be easier for the Council properly to discharge its functions with an Act in a form more suited to the fundamental and underlying objectives of the Council. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Adelaide drew attention to the fact that references go to the Advisory Council in a variety of ways, the principal method being through the Premiers Conference, which is a conference comprised of the Prime Minister and the six State Premiers. When the Premiers Conference refers to the Advisory Council for examination the relationships which should exist between Federal, State and local governments and leaves it then to the Advisory Council-established with a degree of independence comprising as it does representatives of the Parliaments of the six States, of this Parliament, of local government in each of the six States, and of the citizens through five citizen members-it seems to me that the Council has it within its power to take up any subject which any of its members are able to bring to its attention and persuade it to examine. As I have pointed out, its members represent each sphere of government as well as the general citizenry. </PARA>
<PARA> In the early stages of its work the Council has concentrated, as requested by the Premiers Conference, on an examination of the relationships that exist between Commonwealth and State governments, with local government. I was interested to hear the honourable member for Adelaide try to claim that the members of his party had a rather unique relationship with local government. I believe that history will record that local government has advanced most in maturing as a sphere of government, with a degree of autonomy and independence, during the term of office of the Fraser Government. During that period not only has local government achieved a share of income tax at a very high level-a 2 per cent share which has underpinned the resource base of local government-but also, as a result in part of the work of the Advisory Council, local government's aspirations and involvement in government within Australia have increased quite significantly. Because of what has occurred over the last five years, that process will continue in the future as the stature of local governments increases. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to refer to two matters. One arises out of the second reading speech made by the Minister for Education and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister in Federal Affairs (Mr Fife) on introducing the legislation into the House. He drew the attention of the House to the fact that, although the Northern Territory does not at present have representation on the Advisory Council for Inter-government Relations, it has sought admission as a full member of the Council on the same basis as that of each of the six States. As the Minister pointed out, the Commonwealth supports this change, which will require a future amendment to the Advisory Council for Inter-government Relations Act. The Minister pointed out also that the Government is actively seeking the agreement of all States to this measure. I hope it will not be long before that agreement is achieved because the Northern Territory has been set by this Government on a road of constitutional development which at some time will lead to its becoming Australia's seventh State. </PARA>
<PARA> The Northern Territory was granted the form of self-government it now has and it has responded to the challenge of that responsibility in the way that it has. As each year goes by it becomes increasingly difficult, in a political sense, for the powers conferred on the elected Assembly of the Northern Territory to be withdrawn by this Parliament. I know that in a technical sense the Northern Territory legislation, the Act which gave it self-government, could be repealed. But in a practical sense the capacity of this Parliament to withdraw that authority becomes less and less as time goes by. As time elapses, it will become more appropriate to give serious consideration to creating the Northern Territory into a State on a partnership basis with the original States of the Commonwealth. That raises some major problems. It may well be that it is the sort of issue which the Advisory Council on its own initiative should take up one day, or maybe it should be taken up at the request of the Premiers Conference. </PARA>
<PARA> The issues to which I refer relate to the circumstances in which a Territory, such as the Northern Territory, can become a State of the Commonwealth. I draw the attention of the House to the Constitution for a moment. Under section 7 of the Constitution the Senate is established. It is to be composed of senators, chosen by the people, from each State. I emphasise the words 'chosen by the people'. The section requires also that there shall be equal representation of the several original States. The Northern Territory, if it becomes a State, will not be an original State. Section 24 of the Constitution provides that the members of this House, if coming from an original State, must be chosen by the people. Their numbers must be, as nearly as practicable, twice the number of senators. The members allocated to each State must be allocated in proportion to the respective population of the State. But the section does not stop there. It contains a guarantee in respect of the original States. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> But notwithstanding anything in this section, five members at least shall be chosen in each original State. </PARA>
<PARA> The Northern Territory is not, nor can it ever become, an original State. The question arises of the terms and conditions under which the Northern Territory could be admitted as a State of the Commonwealth. At present the Northern Territory has representation in this House and in the Senate by virtue of the provisions of section 122. That section confers on this Parliament the right to confer the representation of a Territory in either House of the Parliament. There are two significant features of that section and of section 121, which confers on this Parliament the capacity to confer on a new State representation in both Houses of this Parliament. The first distinguishing feature is that the representatives of a Territory need not be chosen by the people. At present they are chosen by the people and they choose very good members. But there is no constitutional guarantee that the members representing a Territory or a new State shall be chosen by the people. The fact that that is the case will be a sticking point when States are invited to consider whether they agree to the idea of the Northern Territory at some time in the future becoming a State. We need to look at the desirability of amending the Constitution to require that members from Territories and new States shall be chosen by the people. </PARA>
<PARA> The second distinguishing feature is that neither of those sections limits the representation in this House or in the Senate in the same way as the representation from the original States is limited; that is, the numbers in the House of Representatives are to be as nearly as practicable, twice the number in the Senate and the number of senators from each original State are to be the same. One is faced with this difficulty: Should a new State have the same number of senators as the original States?</PARA>
<PARA> I think that will be a problem to the original States. Should the ratio of senators to members from a new State be one senator to two members of the House of Representatives, the numbers from the House of Representatives being determined by the population of the new State? My view is that the guarantee given to the original States-that is, that there shall be no fewer than five members in the House of Representatives and an equal number of senators-should not apply to a new State. I say that in the interest of prospective new States, and in particular the Northern Territory, because I believe that if they press for the same rights as the original States they will never be granted statehood. If their representation in this House and in the Senate is related, firstly, to population and, secondly, to the nexus between the number of members in the Senate and in the House of Representatives, I think there is greater opportunity for the Northern Territory to become a new State and, by virtue of that if not by virtue of earlier admission, to become a full member of the Advisory Council for Inter-government Relations. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter to which I wish to refer in the remaining minutes available to me is section 92 of the Constitution. We all know what section 92 is about. It is the section which guarantees that trade between the States shall be absolutely free. I also wish to draw the attention of the House to section 90 of the Constitution which provides that on the imposition of uniform duties of customs the power of the Parliament to impose duties of customs and excise and to grant bounties on the production or export of goods shall become exclusive. That exclusiveness puts a prohibition on the States' granting bounties on the production or export of goods. This is dealt with further in section 91 of the Constitution. One of the purposes of the founding fathers of the Constitution was to create within Australia a common market. But over the 80 years since Federation the States have become great entrepeneurs. They have granted State preferences. In that process they are distorting the elements of the common market within Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that as the years go by towards the next century it will become essential that in any examination of the relationships that should exist between the three spheres of government and between governments at the State level we should examine the effect and the desirability of the distorting interstate preferences that now apply. Sometimes they are applied because cheap land or power is made available. Sometimes they are applied because a State government will not purchase from another State except by imposing in effect some sort of indirect tariff. A State may say that it will not purchase goods from another State unless they are priced at, say, 20 per cent less than the goods produced in the State purchasing them. I do not believe that we can tolerate the circumstances in which the Australian economy is balkanised by State governments while the Commonwealth Government is trying to make the Australian economy competitive in world terms. Time does not permit me to enlarge upon that issue except to point to the fact that I believe that it is a matter which one day should be carefully examined by the Advisory Council on Inter-government Relations, either on its own initiative or by reference from the Premiers' Conference, whichever is appropriate, so that these issues can be examined and the relationships within the spheres of government in Australia improved. This legislation will go a long way to establishing permanently the Advisory Council, making its operations more effective and enabling it to achieve even more than it has achieved so far. What it has achieved already is noteworthy. It needs to be examined carefully by all members of this House and the Parliament who are interested in improving the relationships among the spheres of government in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Advisory Council for Inter-government Relations represents Commonwealth, State and local governments. It is an advisory body which undertakes research studies, analyses submissions and so on. Given the deteriorating state of relations between the Federal Government and the States, particularly with regard to the sharing of finance and the handling of the so-called resources boom, there is certainly scope for such an authority and the streamlining of its procedures. Inasmuch as the amendments to this Bill seek to improve the Council's ability to perform its functions by the provision of improved staffing arrangements, exemptions from Commonwealth and State tax laws and the strengthening of its independent role, the Opposition does not oppose the legislation. But it must be said that the Government's new federalism has been a failure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The means of providing Commonwealth funding to the States is through the general tax sharing agreement-at present the formula is 39.87 per cent of total tax receipts-through specific purpose grants involving payments and loans for purposes such as housing, hospitals, roads and so on, through general purpose capital funds which comprise the approved Loan Council program and through capital grants to the States and to their statutory authorities. Those elements make up the package. Of course, in addition, there is now a special infrastructure borrowing program to allow the States access to extra funds to provide the ports, railways and power stations necessary to service the so-called resource development boom. Under this Government's new federalism, or should I say new feudalism, it has sought to force the States to impose their own income taxes by the gloriously simple tactic of reducing specific purpose grants. This has occurred despite the explosion in income tax receipts and the revenue from the Government's misguided oil policy. As a percentage of total revenue receipts, income tax receipts have risen from 38 per cent of total receipts in 1975 to 50 per cent of total receipts in 1980. This has occurred during the term of the so-called low tax government. Oil revenue this financial year will be $3.25 billion. The Government says it recognises that income tax is too high and that the oil levy will eventually decline. Yet all we have seen is continued indecision, plenty of papers, leaked policies and proposals which are looked at, discussed and inevitably rolled. </PARA>

I thank you for your latitude, Mr Deputy Speaker, but it was my understanding that a wide ranging discussion of these matters would be allowed in the debate on this Bill. The Government and the States need plenty of advice from the Advisory Council on all these matters. I will keep what you say in mind, Mr Deputy Speaker. I will now discuss the possible formula in the future and what sorts of taxes will be involved. I ask the Minister for Education (Mr Fife), who is at the table, to bear with me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1978 the Government flirted with a resources tax to tap the super profits of various mining companies and the exploitation and export of non-renewable minerals and energy. It then renounced such a policy on numerous occasions. Now the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) emphasises the benefits of the new surge of resource development which, he says, should be shared with the Australian people, the States, the community and local government but he refuses to explain how it will occur. The Treasurer (Mr Howard) and the Treasury endorse the concept of regressive and inflationary indirect taxes such as increased wholesale or turnover tax and are then rolled by the Prime Minister. Over all this-this is very important for the new formula that the States will adopt-hang the rantings of the National Party supporting flat rate taxes. Under this policy, with such a tremendous decline in taxation revenue, how will the States fare with their share of 39.87 per cent?</PARA>
<PARA> The truth is that this Government is caught in its own short sightedness. Indigenous oil currently provides $3.2 billion or 9.3 per cent of total revenue. But as this revenue declines as oil reserves decline the Government will be forced to examine tax restructuring and increases, not decreases, in personal income tax. It is the inevitable result of the Government's oil pricing rip-off which it will not share with the States. I ask the Advisory Council take note of that. On the one hand, we can examine imposing taxes on unearned wealth-capital gains taxes-although not on family homes and a resources rent tax. On the other hand, we as a Federal Parliament can choose, as the Government has perhaps considered, imposing increased indirect taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition does not favour the imposition of increased indirect taxation. Perhaps we should look again at the situation of new oil fields such as Fortescue in Bass Strait. As a result of the Government's classifying its product as new oil, a loss of at least $3.5 billion in revenue has been incurred-revenue in which the States might have shared. But the Government has renounced all of these options now. I ask the States, as they line up for the next Premiers Conference, to remember that. The Government is against resources taxes or any extension of its oil levy to include Fortescue. It has denounced taxes on unearned wealth and yesterday closed the option of imposing indirect taxation. What will the Government do? No wonder the States are confused, as they come to the April Premiers Conference, as to which tax sharing formula they should support. </PARA>
<PARA> Should they support a formula which gives them a percentage of local income tax revenue or one which gives them a percentage of total tax revenue? If a resources rent tax, and alternative taxes to increased income taxes were to be imposed, the States should opt for a percentage of the total tax base. But since the Government has closed off all options other than increased income taxes the government of New South Wales is probably right. In this confusing situation, a percentage of total income taxes may best suit the States. Whatever the Government says, we may expect that the income tax base will expand. It has ruled out all the other options. However, if the Government intends to cut income taxes it must also cut further specific purpose payments to the States. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XJ4">Mr WEST</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for your understanding of what this Bill is about. The Minister does not seem to understand it. We are talking about problems that will arise in Commonwealth-State relations and how this Advisory Council can help in that regard. I understand that it is able to act on its own initiative in some of these matters. When I was interrupted, I was saying that if the Government having ruled out all of the options that seem to be available to it-other than that of increasing income taxes-in fact cut income taxes we could also expect further cuts in specific purpose payments to the States. That is what the Opposition is worried about. I think, to be fair, that the problem could be compounded by the States' lack of perception of the long term consequences of greatly accelerating the development of minerals and minerals processing. In my view, the States should understand that those who presently control the Treasury will certainly advise this Government to cut even further funds for health, housing and public transport, in order to permit Loan Council borrowing programs to provide for infrastructure development to service the resources boom-if they should go down that track too far.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Although private capital expenditure on resources development in the next six or seven years may not be as high as the $33 billion outlined by the Department of Industry and Commerce, it will certainly be considerable. For instance, some $4 billion in private capital expenditure is expected in respect of the North West Shelf. The Government's report envisages expenditures of $6.4 billion for coal development in New South Wales and Queensland and approximately $6.3 billion for the aluminium smelting industry. The bauxite and aluminium smelting proposals will probably amount to a total of $8 billion, if one includes the expenditure of $300m upon a new smelter at Bundaberg and $1,300m in Western Australia. All of this development requires infrastructure, including power stations constructed by the States at public expense. The majority of the funds for this will be provided by the Loan Council. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the special program, provision has already been made for State borrowing of $5,000m over the next 10 years for infrastructure purposes, but this figure does not even begin to state the total requirement during that period. For instance, three States only-Queensland, Victoria and New South Wales-are committed to an expenditure of $11.2 billion in order to provide 16,000 extra megawatts of power, of which 3,200 megawatts or 20 per cent will be used for aluminium smelting. This, according to the Department of National Development and Energy, will cost $3.2 billion. Given that Western Australia will be exporting the majority of its natural gas from the North West Shelf in the foreseeable future, that State will be looking towards either coal fired power generation or nuclear power for aluminium smelting. The pity of it all-and the Opposition is not against development, merely seeking its rationalisation-is that the States, in insisting on their right to police their own development, are indulging in demeaning and anti-Australian competition to provide infrastructure and power on the cheap to these foreign multinational mineral and energy companies. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government, through the Loan Council program, must give approval to the financing of this infrastructure development. What I am saying is highly relevant to the work of this Advisory Council. For instance, the Victorian public should not be asked to subsidise Alcoa to the extent of $2 billion in the provision of power over the next 25 or 30 years, nor should the New South Wales Government be providing power in the Hunter Valley for some 1.6c a kilowatt hour, which is one-third less than the charge to other major industrial, continuous consumers such as Australian Iron and Steel Pty Ltd. Since the Commonwealth provides and integrates Loan Council finance, this Government, at least, should be demanding to know what the State Electricity Commissions are charging for their power. I was appalled to hear, during the recent inquiry into these matters by the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources, the representatives of the relevant Departments of Trade and Resources, National Development and Energy and Industry and Commerce informed the Committee that they had no idea what these power prices were to be. This was the case, despite the fact that the Commonwealth will have to authorise a great deal of the money through Loan Council borrowing programs for the construction of these stations. One has to say that the Government is completely remiss in not imposing a national rationalisation of resource development in the public infrastructure, for which the States come here seeking money. How many aluminium smelters should there be? That is the question that we should be asking in relation to this aspect of resource development and the provision of infrastructure. What type should they be? Where should they be and how much of the infrastructure can this nation afford to provide, through the Budget in August or the Premiers Conference, without damaging other areas of resource allocation? If the States can afford to provide coal at $14 a tonne to State Electricity Commissions, then borrow from the Commonwealth and hawk power at absurdly cheap rates by world standards, surely there is a case for federal intervention, for a federal resources tax or an aluminium export tax in which the States could then share with the Commonwealth through an appropriate sharing arrangement. Other people, in addition to members of the Opposition, are aware of this. Even some very strong sections of the Australian business community would support what I am saying. As today's Australian Financial Review states:</PARA>
<PARA>There is no reason why the Federal Government should not collect that element of excess profits which the State Governments forego in the process of competing for progress. </PARA>
<PARA>But in the end, as the Queensland Government has already demonstrated, if the Federal Government leaves a vacuum by, for instance, reducing coal export levies or refusing to introduce a resources tax eventually the States, if it suits them, may impose their own less efficient and narrowly based charges. For the first time, Queensland collections for State revenues from the rail freighting of coal exceeded the revenue from federal coal levies in Queensland from the Utah project. No wonder Mr Bjelke-Petersen got out on the stump during the McPherson by-election campaign and said that there were no resource taxes in Queensland. As soon as we make the vacuum by cutting coal levies and by not imposing resource taxes, he moves in, takes the cream in increased freight charges and then comes here and cries poor mouth. </PARA>
<PARA> The point is that the whole approach by the States and by this Federal Government to resources management is too ad hoc and allows for interstate rivalry and problems between Commonwealth and State. The Commonwealth is torn between ideological commitments to unrestrained, unrationalised development and the Treasury knowledge that the whole situation is now out of hand. I can refer to the situation in Tasmania regarding power supply. A statutory authority, the Hydro Electric Commission, has opposed the elected government of the day, the State Government of Tasmania, and has promoted an alternative, more expensive hydro-electric scheme that is environmentally damaging to the famous south west wilderness of Tasmania. If the Hydro Electric Commission has its way the State Government will have to come here and ask for $1.3 billion, or a large percentage of it, for a scheme which will produce a miserly 340 megawatts of power and in the process will destroy Tasmania's last wild river, the Franklin. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand the Tasmanian Government's dilemma of how to promote a State's own development and employment and yet save the wilderness and provide future power. Coal could be the answer if Tasmania can buy it from New South Wales at the right price. The Australian Institute of Engineers' proposal for a $750m interstate power grid-it is cheap at the price-to service Tasmania, South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales would also solve the problem. But-here is the rub-the State Electricity Commission of Victoria dismisses this concept. It wants to build its own empire on Loy Yang power. Then it wants another Loy Yang-which will be funded by the Commonwealth to a great degree-to provide power for aluminium smelting at Portland. But it does not want to supply power to assist Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA> Where do we stand, as a Federal Parliament? Are we not the anchor that alone can force Australia to act as a nation and not as six or seven independent nation States? I am afraid that all we shall see from this Government is a squeeze on specific purpose grants as this fiasco proceeds. Already the amount for public housing has been reduced to $75m in real terms, this financial year. How will the States provide the public housing needed in the Latrobe and Hunter valleys, at Gladstone and in Western Australia? Will they allow bank and building society interest rates to be dragged up further by semi-government authority loans which currently average 13.5 per cent? What is the future of the State hospital system? What will the Government tell the Premiers when they come here in April regarding the future of recurrent expenditure for State hospitals? Will this be in the interests of allowing further finance to be raised for the construction of power stations?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-For the record I need to say at this stage, as the debate closes, that we have been debating an amendment to the Advisory Council for Inter-government Relations Act 1976. I say that because there was very little relevance to that in the remarks of the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West). However, I thank all honourable members who have contributed to this debate for indicating their support for the measure before the House. There is very little that I need to say at this stage. The Council for Inter-government Relations was set up following the 1976 legislation and it is therefore an initiative of this Government. The Council was established by the Government to help bring about a better relationship between the three spheres of government in Australia. I believe that although the Council is still in its infancy it has played a major role in helping to overcome many of the difficulties that exist between the three spheres of government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to dismiss at once the assertion made by members of the Opposition that the present Government is not a friend of local government. Indeed, the decision of the Government to introduce tax sharing with local government-2 per cent of income tax now goes automatically to local government-has provided a financial shot in the arm to that section of government activity in Australia. That, together with the decision to establish the Advisory Council for Inter-government Relations and a number of other measures that have been the initiative of this Government, signals the importance that it places on the local government sphere. I invite members of the Opposition who are in the House and who are not from New South Wales to look at what the New South Wales Government is doing at present in relation to local government. There is wholesale amalgamation taking place and, in short, the Labor Government in New South Wales is taking the word 'local' out of local government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the two Bills we are debating is to provide for the compulsory transfer of Commonwealth Teaching Service employees now working in the Northern Territory to the teaching service of the Northern Territory. From July 1979 the Northern Territory Government has been responsible for education in the Territory. However, the teachers have been employed by the Commonwealth Teaching Service. Except for the Commonwealth Teaching Service administration in the Northern Territory, the Northern Territory Government has met the cost of the teachers in the schools and it has powers to determine the education policy within the schools. It is now the wish of the Northern Territory Government that there should be a separate teaching service established in the Northern Territory and the employees now there as employees of the Commonwealth Teaching Service will be transferred to it. Following the establishment of the teaching service of the Northern Territory and the passage of this legislation, that transfer will take place. It is envisaged that some financial settlement in the Northern Territory Government's favour will be necessary to cover those costs which are now borne by the Commonwealth in relation to the administrative overheads associated with the Northern Territory operations of the Commonwealth Teaching Service. As far as I know those financial arrangements are yet to be finalised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Teaching Service Amendment Bill provides for certain safeguards to ensure that the current employees of the Commonwealth Teaching Service will not be disadvantaged by the transfer. Before the transfer can take effect the Minister for Education (Mr Fife) must be satisfied that the laws of the Northern Territory preserve the rights of the transferred employees in such matters as salaries, recreation leave, sick leave and long service leave. However, if an officer claims to have been disadvantaged and if a special reappointments review committee supports the claim, the disadvantaged officer has a right to transfer back to the Commonwealth Teaching Service and a position would have to be found for him. The position of the officer would have to be maintained. As well as this, the transferred officers will retain the right to apply for Commonwealth Teaching Service positions as though they were still employees of the Commonwealth Teaching Service. </PARA>
<PARA> The Long Service Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Amendment Bill deals with long service leave not only for the transferred officers but also for others in the Northern Territory. At present, staff employed by authorities of the Northern Territory, other than the Northern Territory Public Service, derive long service leave entitlements from the Long Service Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1976. It has now been agreed that the staff of Northern Territory authorities should be covered by Northern Territory long service leave provisions. The amendments will ensure that the Commonwealth Teaching Service officers who are transferred to the teaching service of the Northern Territory will be subject to the Northern Territory long service leave provisions, which in turn must have benefits to employees at least as generous as those provided for Commonwealth employees. The Bill also provides that service with the teaching service of the Northern Territory will be recognised in any instance where an officer transfers to Commonwealth employment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition does not oppose either of these two measures. I understand that they have the support of the Northern Territory Teachers Federation. Indeed, I understand that the legislation which is before the Northern Territory legislature is not being opposed by the Opposition there. However, I take the opportunity to make a few observations about the proposals. As yet we do not know the final shape of the teaching service of the Northern Territory as the Northern Territory Government has yet to legislate finally. I understand that that process has commenced and is likely to be completed fairly soon. For this reason the Bill before this House provides for the transfer to take place only when the Federal Minister is satisfied that the teaching service of the Northern Territory is providing adequate conditions and opportunities for the Commonwealth Teaching Service transferees. This is obviously a sensible approach. However, it raises the question of when the transfer will take place. I would be grateful if the Minister, in his reply to this debate, could inform us when that transfer date is likely to be finalised. The prospective date at the moment is, I understand, July 1981. However, there is some suggestion that it will be delayed until January 1982. Clearly, the Commonwealth Teaching Service officers are anxious to know but have been unable to get a commitment in relation to the date on which the transfer will take place. Both the Commonwealth Government and the Northern Territory government claim that the setting of the date for the transfer is up to the other. I hope that the Minister will be able to clarify the situation. </PARA>
<PARA> In sponsoring the territorianisation of the teaching service, the Northern Territory Government is partly responding to, or encouraging, a bit of Northern Territory chauvinism but it is also partly seeking to assume full control over its schools. It has substantial control now but, as has been said before, it is not the direct employer of the teachers who work in those schools. Whether this is necessary in terms of the quality of education in the Northern Territory schools is debatable, but I suspect that it will not have much effect one way or the other. I would have thought that there was some merit in facilitating an easy transfer between the Northern Territory and other places where the Commonwealth Teaching Service operates, such as the Australian Capital Territory and Christmas Island. At the moment nearly 63 per cent of the Commonwealth Teaching Service employees are employed in the Australian Capital Territory and about 36 per cent of them are employed in the Northern Territory. Although there has been only a very small number of transfers between the two Territories in recent times, I think it is very desirable that arrangements be maintained to facilitate the easy transfer between the two Territories. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for transfer from the proposed teaching service of the Northern Territory to the Commonwealth Teaching Service. I suggest that the Minister should ensure that the legislation being passed by the Northern Territory Government should provide for similar reciprocal arrangements. I also think that the Minister ought to give some consideration to the future of the bilingual program. This was established as a result of a Commonwealth initiative in the days when the Commonwealth had direct responsibility for education in the Northern Territory. However, as a result of the control being passed to the Northern Territory in the last couple of years some problems seem to be emerging. For instance, it has been the practice for Aboriginal assistants who work in the schools in relation to the bilingual program to go to Batchelor College for part of their training. I understand that there are about 80 trainees at Batchelor College at any one time. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the problems is that in recent times as the Aboriginal assistants have left the schools to complete or continue their training they have not been replaced. This has placed extra stress on the teachers and the Aboriginal assistants who remain in the schools. I ask the Minister to give consideration to how the Commonwealth can continue to have some oversight of the bilingual program because this deals not only with the question of education in the Northern Territory but also with matters which are very important to Aboriginal development. That is an area in which the Commonwealth ought to retain a very close commitment. Although there are already arrangements for the Commonwealth to participate, both through the Department of Education and the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, in relation to the operation of the bilingual program, I think that the Minister ought to ensure that this sort of contact is continued after the transfer of the Commonwealth Teaching Service employees takes place. </PARA>
<PARA> There is very little else that one can add to these measures at this moment. As I have said, the Opposition does not oppose the Bills. I think it is important, however, to keep the operation of these procedures under close review because it is one thing to provide in legislation for safeguards to the transferred employees and it is another to see that those safeguards work in practice. The Northern Territory is a long way from Canberra and the people we are seeking to safeguard and who are likely to be disadvantaged are those in the Northern Territory who are being compulsorily transferred. It is important to ensure that the opportunities for them are rigorously kept under review so that they can take advantage of the provisions of this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Education is something in which all Territorians naturally have a very vital interest. It is something to which, naturally, all families are close. The proposed Northern Territory teaching service is of personal interest to about 3,000 government employees, including approximately 1,900 employees directly affected by the provisions of this legislation. The Northern Territory Government assumed responsibility for education on 1 July 1979. I think it is important to appreciate that the Bills we are considering relate to aspects of the teaching service and not to the education function which was transferred and which had been operating successfully since that transfer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When we look at the timing and priority given to this legislation it is easy for us to see that it has been very difficult for the Government to follow the transfer right through. Self-government was achieved in the Northern Territory in 1978 yet education as a function was not transferred until a year later. We are still debating and looking at the way in which the personnel of the Commonwealth Teaching Service are to be transferred. Maybe that is a comment on the fact that teachers are a peculiar breed. Maybe we should look very carefully at some of the reasons why it has taken so long for this remnant to be added to most of the State-like functions that have been transferred. Obviously there has been a need for a great deal of negotiation and consultation on this issue between the respective governments and their agencies, the Teachers Federation, other professionals and their interest groups, the parent organisations and various industry and commerce groups that are vitally affected by the resulting graduates from the schools and, of course, many private individuals who have taken a close interest in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The provisions of the legislation provide for and facilitate the transition from the Commonwealth Teaching Service to a separate independent Northern Territory Teaching Service. They seek to preserve the rights and entitlements of those people affected. Complementary legislation which has been introduced in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly-I understand it was debated yesterday-creates the Northern Territory Teaching Service. It provides for an independent commissioner who will have various functions and responsibilities. It seeks to protect the teachers' rights and interests. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the various details have been well canvassed. If we look at the peculiar situation of the Northern Territory I think that we should take into consideration the fact that this is the last of the major functions which are to go across to the Northern Territory Government. I was interested in some of the comments made by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins). He seemed to take the rather quaint attitude that paternalism should be maintained by the Federal Government in a number of areas. I believe that the remote control of education services-that has been the position for so long-has made it difficult for this transfer to happen. Education as a function in the Northern Territory has been very successful. It has been administered by the Northern Territory Government in most recent times, by Commonwealth agencies since 1972 and previously by many other groups and agencies. My own family involvement with education in the Northern Territory goes back to 1924 when my father went to the Territory as a pioneer itinerant teacher. He rode a pushbike from Darwin to Katherine. Over the years I have become very familiar with the unusual and peculiar needs of education in the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the situation today, it is important to recognise that the clients are some 30,000 students in Territory institutions. Of those students, 22,000 are enrolled in urban schools and the further 8,000 are enrolled in predominantly Aboriginal community schools. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, the number of staff employed is approximately 3,000, 1,900 of whom are employed by the Commonwealth Teaching Service. More than 2,500 of the administrative and teaching staff in the Territory are actually engaged in duties in the classroom and in the schools. Approximately 450 staff are engaged in various office, professional and support capacities. The number of schools in the Northern Territory naturally has grown over the years to the stage today where there are approximately 140. Again if we look at the detailed statistics we find there are 53 schools in the general urban situation, some 74 schools in predominantly Aboriginal communities and a further 13 institutions serving different needs throughout the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Fremantle referred to some problems with regard to Aboriginal education. Let us not delude ourselves; there will, of course, be problems. But I believe the education services in the Northern Territory are now meeting the peculiar and particular needs of the Aboriginal population. The Federal Government has been most innovative in the way in which it has stimulated and created many of the programs for these services. I do not share the fears of the honourable member for Fremantle with regard to the bilingual program. I believe that the Northern Territory Government is well aware of the problems in this area and is responding to them very well. Mention was made of the teacher training program at Batchelor. The honourable member for Fremantle seemed to raise this as the major issue. I think he said that 80 teacher trainees had been extricated but were not replaced in classroom situations. I believe that 72 students at Batchelor this year have been drawn from Aboriginal communities but only 36 of them have come from the classroom situation. The others have come from various organisations in Aboriginal communities. Those 36 students have been placed on study programs at Batchelor and are receiving full pay. Naturally this makes it difficult for any government agency to pick up and fund a replacement program in the schools. Just as study leave applies to every other community and every other school it is up to those schools to make the natural covering arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that, in the Northern Territory, this legislation has been under intensive examination by the community for at least 12 months and before that it was before the community for some six or eight months. The Minister for Education in the Northern Territory has canvassed the issues widely. I believe he has had a good, clear and positive response to all of the proposals. The Australian Labor Party in the Northern Territory has supported the new Teaching Service. If it had not been for the last Federal election, I am sure this matter would have been concluded a lot sooner. However, I appreciate that parliamentary time- tables on issues such as this do get disrupted. The issue of education is most important. I trust that these Bills will be passed as quickly as possible so that they can be implemented at an early date. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join my colleagues in supporting this Bill. I welcome its introduction, belated though it is. I rejoice on behalf of the people involved in education in the Northern Territory and the Commonwealth Teaching Service that we are about to pass this legislation. I refer briefly to the relationship between the Commonwealth Teaching Service which now provides teachers for the education system in the Australian Capital Territory and the proposed Northern Territory Teaching Service. Traditionally there has been a substantial interchange of teachers between the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory. I hope that that interchange will continue to take place because I think it would be to the benefit of both teaching services. I know that many of our finest teachers in the Australian Capital Territory have served in the Northern Territory, in Darwin in particular, or have served in Aboriginal schools. Some of those teachers come here for a stint and then go back to the Northern Territory to carry on their work. Both teaching services are relatively small and it is important, certainly from the points of view of the teachers and the pupils, that they continue to work closely to provide sufficient scope of opportunity for teachers compared with the much wider opportunities available in a State teaching service. Because they are very small teaching services compared with the State teaching services, I think it is necessary for them to work very closely together to provide greater opportunities for teachers and, of course, students.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think there is no question that a high degree of cross-fertilisation between the Commonwealth Teaching Service in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory Teaching Service is desirable. Of course, this Bill should facilitate that movement. The honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Tambling) referred to the paternalistic attitude taken by my colleague, the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins). I do not think that was intended at all. Rather I think he was concerned about the need for co-operation between the teaching service in the Australian Capital Territory, which happens to be the national capital, and a more remote service in the Northern Territory. As I say, both services will benefit if there is continual cross-fertilisation. </PARA>
<PARA> I think I should comment on some matters in respect of which problems may arise. Of course, the main object of the Bill is to provide that employees are not disadvantaged by compulsory transfer. In previous cases of compulsory transfer of Commonwealth employees, the Public Service Act has been amended to provide for the rights of the public servant to be preserved. However, fairly recently my office has been informed of cases in which public servants have experienced great difficulty following their transfer to the Northern Territory Public Service. Although on paper their rights are theoretically guaranteed, in practice it does not always work out that way. For instance, sometimes the public servants do not get the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette until it is too late if they are out in some remote area. As I say, in theory the opportunities are there. But in fact, quite often it is very difficult and sometimes impossible for them to apply for a job and expect to get an interview in Canberra if they happen to be up in the Northern Territory. So what we see on paper does not necessarily mean that the rights of the employee are in fact protected. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that a re-appointments review committee is to be set up to safeguard the rights of members of the teaching service in the Northern Territory. I hope that this works out. I hope that in these sorts of cases the Government will accept the decisions of the boards that it sets up for the purpose of review. Of course, the Government's record in accepting the decision of the umpire has not been terribly good. I hope that the mechanics which have been set up by this Bill do ensure equitable treatment because if a Commonwealth employee does feel that he is disadvantaged it is very difficult to prove that disadvantage when he does not have the sympathy and support of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Education (Mr Fife) in his second reading speech said:</PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Commonwealth Teaching Service has made a significant contribution to the development of education in the Northern Territory since its inception in 1972. </PARA>
<PARA>I would not question that at all. The Commonwealth Teaching Service has made a magnificent contribution here in Canberra. In many ways I think it was responsible for the very fine standards we achieved when we first set up the Australian Capital Territory Schools Authority. However, recent experience in the Australian Capital Territory indicates that there has been a decline in the standard of education provided by the Government. This is not the fault of the teachers. The teachers have consistently attempted to maintain high professional levels of efficiency and dedication. The problem, of course, has been staff ceilings. I know that the Minister for Education, who is at the table, is not unsympathetic to the Schools Authority in respect of the problems of education in Canberra. The fact remains that under the staffing formula we should have 2,820 teachers. But the Government has set a staff ceiling of 2,760 teachers which is below the requirement of its own staffing formula. </PARA>
<PARA> I say without equivocation that the Government has reneged on the undertaking given to the people of the Australian Capital Territory by Senator Carrick, the former Minister for Education. I hope that the present Minister will go in to bat and try to restore this situation so that the Government is made to adhere to the undertaking that it gave to the people of Canberra. There is a shortfall of something like 60 teaching positions in the Australian Capital Territory. I am talking about the Australian Capital Territory because its teaching problems are closely related to those of the Northern Territory. The two systems need to be interchangeable. Teachers need to be able to move freely from one system to the other. Almost all of our schools now have some hardships. There are overcrowded classes, teachers are being asked to perform extra duties outside their fields and children of different age groups are being put into the same classes. The trouble is that when pressure is put on staffing, the people who are affected are the very people who need the most attention and who are most in need of education. I refer to people who require special education, people in the remedial areas who need help in reading, speaking and mathematics. </PARA>
<PARA> There are grave teacher shortages even in our schools for the physically handicapped. I understand that Cranleigh school is short two full-time teachers. This situation has arisen because the Government has reneged on its undertaking to provide teachers in accordance with an agreed formula. Unfortunately the people who are most in need of special education are the ones who suffer when there is a shortage. Migrant children or children of non-English speaking parents particularly suffer in schools where there are just not enough teachers for special or remedial teaching. Although full-time teachers are needed, sometimes schools get 0.4 of a teacher or a teacher for four hours a week. The teachers know that there are children in classes who are not being taught correctly, they know they are not learning and they know they are in need of remedial teaching. However, the teachers cannot do anything about it. Quite often in this situation children in primary schools become labelled as failures as early as in third class. These children sit at the back of the class, they get behind and they never catch up. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is a very sad indictment of our system when the very people who need extra teaching are not getting it. This is particularly the case in Canberra where the Australian Capital Territory Schools Authority started off being a bit ahead of education systems in other parts of Australia. We were innovative, we were seen to be pacesetting. Now we have slipped behind and our system is no better or worse than any other. We are not saying we should be better. But we are saying that all the systems should be better. Teachers who have the skills required to overcome the difficulties should not be prevented from carrying out their professional work because schools are understaffed. That is the situation in Canberra today. I do not know what the situation in the Northern Territory is in relation to staff ceilings. But I hope that the teachers of the Northern Territory do not allow the Government to downgrade the standards as has happened in the Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Teaching Service needs to be large enough to meet the educational needs of children for whom the Government has responsibility. As I have said, the teaching of English as a second language is particularly important and this is one of the areas in Canberra in which migrant children are being seriously disadvantaged. I understand that under this legislation, Northern Territory teachers seeking to transfer back to the Commonwealth Teaching Service in the Australian Capital Territory under the provisions of the Bill will have few prospects under the present Government's policies simply because positions are not available although work needs to be done here. There are quite a few unemployed teachers in the Australian Capital Territory. It is quite difficult to get a job as a teacher in Canberra regardless of the needs of the schools and children. Staff ceilings are imposed in an arbitary fashion with no regard to teaching needs or the shortfall in the teaching staff in the Territory overall. These deficiencies have been well recognised by educators and professional people in the Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> The text of a letter which Senator Knight, a Government senator, wrote to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) asking him to honour his Government's commitment to education in the Australian Capital Territory was released in the Press today. So this is not just a partisan appeal. It is quite non-partisan and goes right across the board. The Government is not honouring its commitment and we call upon it to do so. For the last five years the Australian Capital Territory Schools Authority has not received increased resources in conformity with its needs. There is an immediate need for more staff, more remedial staff, more training, more reductions in school fees, more career counselling and more administrative funds. We see the transfer of teachers to the Northern Territory Teaching Service as a major step in the development of education in that Territory and we wish the Service well. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government has a responsibility to ensure that this Teaching Service for which it retains responsibility is improved. I know that teachers in the Northern Territory will regard it as their responsibility, as have the teachers here in Canberra, to see that the Government does not allow standards to be cut back in any way. I repeat that if standards are falling in the Australian Capital Territory this will have a spin-off in the Northern Territory and vice versa as the two services are closely interrelated. I hope that that close relationship will continue because it will be for the benefit of both services. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-The honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins) asked during his speech whether I could indicate when the transfer of Commonwealth Teaching Service personnel would take place. I am unable to do that. I understand that initially it was intended to make the transfer during July but that probably the Northern Territory administration will not be ready by that date. I am advised also that the Northern Territory wishes to transfer as early as possible. I reiterate that in relation to administration it is largely a matter for the Territory to make its own arrangements. Once the legislation has been passed by this Parliament and it receives royal assent, then the Commonwealth is in a position to transfer personnel as soon as the administrative arrangements have been made in the Northern Territory.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to provide, in respect of federal and certain territorial courts, reimbursement to litigants of a similar kind to that provided in the States under State suitors' fund legislation and similar laws. In each of the States there is now legislation providing for reimbursement to a litigant who, through no fault of his own, has to bear the costs of an appeal from a decision involving an error of law or an incorrect assessment of the quantum of damages, or the cost of a new trial. The State legislation is, however, restricted to proceedings in State courts and to appeals to the High Court of Australia and the Privy Council from State courts. No such provision is made in respect of proceedings in federal or territory courts, or appeals from these courts. This Bill provides for the case where a decision of a federal or territory court, other than a Northern Territory or Norfolk Island court, is reversed on a question of law, or on the assessment of damages, or a new trial is ordered in such a court. In the family law area, it also extends to appeals to the Family Court of Australia from State courts and the courts of the Northern Territory and Norfolk Island exercising jurisdiction under the Family Law Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the terms of the Bill certain persons will, in specified circumstances, be eligible for reimbursement of all or part of their costs. Firstly, an unsuccessful respondent to an appeal which is successful on a question of law or as to the amount of damages awarded may be reimbursed with respect to the costs of the appeal. Secondly, a party to an action from which an appeal is successful on a question of law and in which a new trial is ordered may be reimbursed with respect to the costs of the new trial. Thirdly, an accused person whose appeal against conviction upon indictment is successful on a question of law and who is ordered to stand for a new trial may be reimbursed with respect to the costs of the new trial. Fourthly, a party to civil or criminal proceedings which are aborted because a judge or magistrate involved dies or becomes, for whatever reason, unable to continue with, or give judgment in, the proceedings may be reimbursed with respect to the costs of those proceedings. Likewise, where proceedings are discontinued and new proceedings ordered through no fault of a party to those proceedings, that party may be reimbursed with respect to the cost of those proceedings. Fifthly, a successful appellant may in certain circumstances be reimbursed in respect of his costs. This may occur where costs are awarded against a respondent who is unable to pay or who cannot be found or, in the family law jurisdiction, where the courts are not empowered to award costs. </PARA>
<PARA> If a person comes within one of those categories, he may apply to the court which heard the appeal or the court in which the proceedings were aborted or discontinued for a costs certificate. A costs certificate is a certificate stating that, in the opinion of the court, it would be appropriate for the Attorney-General to authorise the payment of part or all of the taxed costs of that person. Whether or not such a certificate is to be granted is left, subject to one exception which I shall mention shortly, entirely to the discretion of the courts, and it is proper that it should be. Over the years, in considering similar applications under the legislation of the various States, the courts have developed guidelines which they apply. No appeal lies from the refusal of a court to grant a certificate. The one exception is contained in clause 14. Consistently with the practice under the State schemes, a court may not grant a costs certificate to the Commonwealth, a State or the Northern Territory or to a large company. </PARA>
<PARA> A person who has been granted a costs certificate may apply to the Attorney-General for reimbursement of his costs in accordance with the legislation. The Attorney-General may not authorise the payment of any amount unless the costs in respect of which the certificate was given have either been specifically fixed by the court, determined by taxation or otherwise in accordance with the rules of the court or regulations under the Bill or determined by agreement between the person and the Attorney-General. Nor may the Attorney-General authorise, in respect of a costs certificate granted by a court, payment of an amount greater than the maximum amount specified in respect of that court. Clause 18 of the Bill provides that the maximum amount in respect of a court is such amount as is specified in the Schedule to the Bill or such larger amount as is specified in regulations under the Bill, in respect of that court. It should be noted that, in the case of a costs certificate granted to a person by a court at the end of a succession of appeals in the same matter, the maximum amount payable applies in respect of all the relevant costs incurred by that person in the series of appeals to which the Bill applies. The maximum amounts fixed by the Bill are in line with those fixed by the various State schemes. Further, the Attorney-General may not authorise a payment pursuant to a costs certificate if that costs certificate has been or is likely to be vacated. A certificate will be vacated if the person to whom the certificate is granted subsequently appeals successfully in the same action. </PARA>
<PARA> Payments under the Bill are to be made out of moneys appropriated by the Parliament for the purpose. This follows the Victorian precedent, rather than that of the other States where the suitors' fund or like fund is financed by a levy on court fees. It is not expected that very large amounts of money will be involved, so that it is administratively simpler and less costly for the scheme to be financed directly out of Consolidated Revenue. This is a small but important measure of reform which reflects the growing significance of the federal and territory courts. Hitherto, ex gratia payments have been made in cases where, under State law, payments would have been made in respect of proceedings in State courts. With the growing volume and importance of litigation in federal and territory courts, it is proper that these payments should have a statutory basis. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 25 November 1980 the Governor-General officially opened the Thirty-second Parliament. I wonder how many of us who participated in that ceremony reflected on the significance of the institution that collectively we now form; or was it that some of us were more concerned to celebrate an election victory while others contemplated how they could win power next time? Unfortunately, in his Speech His Excellency made no reference to parliamentary reform, but it must be accepted that not all subjects can be covered in that Speech. In my view, it is high time we all gave serious consideration to the role of Parliament, the relationship between Parliament and government, the relationship between Parliament and political parties, and the part that we as members could and should be playing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is worth while to remember briefly that our Parliament was adopted from Westminster. The British Parliament evolved over hundreds of years. Its main purpose was to take power away from an entrenched executive based around the monarch and give that power to the people through their elected members. Because there was an ever present competition for power between the Executive and Parliament, there were often clashes and wrangles but, as time went by, Parliament gained the ascendancy because it represented the people. If our Parliament then is to be carried with any relevance into the twenty-first century, it is essential that Parliament establish at least equality with the Executive. It is true that Parliament has such power, but rarely in modern partisan politics is it used. It is assumed widely amongst the public that Parliament exists only in order to support an executive government and to test the metal of other people who might wish to form the government. Nowhere in the community is there a widespread belief that Parliament acts in the public interest as a buffer against unrestrained executive power. Such scepticism amongst the public is understandable because to all intents and purposes it is true. </PARA>
<PARA> Our founding fathers established independence on the basis that power would be divided between the executive, the legislature and the judiciary. It was not assumed that one part of that tripartition would completely dominate the other; nor was it assumed that elections would be held in every constituency throughout the country for the sole purpose of filling the Cabinet room. Parliament can and should represent the aspirations and interests of people throughout the country. However, because of modern political trends, Parliament now represents only political parties or governments and oppositions. Parliament is dominated by the all pervading party political interests and by the selfish ambition to have and to exercise power. However, if Parliament is to be relevant, it must establish its independence and autonomy. </PARA>
<PARA> I have put forward a number of suggestions that are designed to give Parliament independence from the executive and allow it properly to review policy proposals. I have suggested that all Ministers be appointed from the House of Representatives. That is not designed to allow more colleagues in this place to be appointed to the ministry, but rather to allow the Senate more thoroughly to scrutinise Government proposals. It seems incongruous that the Senate is expected to be a House of review while at the same time some of its members form part of the Executive Government. In reality, the Senate is not a proper House of review but rather an extension of the House of government and equally dominated by party allegiances. Surely the Senate could better fill its review role if none of its members were Ministers and there was no ambition on the part of others to become Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA> I have suggested also that there should be a one-line appropriation in the annual Budget for Parliament and that its expenditure should be controlled by the Presiding Officers. Parliament cannot properly scrutinise the Executive while the funding of parliamentary operations is controlled by the Executive. It would be a simple matter for the Government to say that a select committee cannot be established because no money is available. If the members wish to cut back expenditure on, say, the dining room in order to scrutinise more government operations, we should be able to do so without requiring approval from the Minister for Finance. I have suggested also that the term of parliaments be extended to four years and I am greatly attracted to the suggestion of fixed term parliaments. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3F4">Mr BURR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the honourable member waits he will hear what else I have to say. There is a widespread view amongst the public that once a government is elected it should concentrate on governing without the diversion of unnecessary elections. By fixing the term of parliaments an entrenched government cannot use the electoral system for its own expediency. Whilst a government may claim that that removes certain options that are presently available to it, in reality it means that a government cannot manipulate election dates in order to give it an advantage over its opponents. Democracy will work only when political parties and interested groups are able to put their policies to the people on a fair and equal basis so that the people may judge which policies they wish to pursue for the period of the forthcoming parliament. When one political party is given an advantage over another political party by manipulating election dates or by a gerrymander of electoral boundaries, public confidence is undermined and democracy is placed at risk. If we can remove the fear of that manipulation we will do much to restore public confidence in the Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Despite all that I have said, the most important factor is for members to exercise a judgment that reflects the views of their constituents rather than have decisions forced on them by the political parties they represent. The Australian Labor Party is probably more strongly disciplined than my party. Often decisions are made by the party members who have not faced the electorate and, unfortunately, Labor members of parliament are then compelled to ignore their constituents and to vote with the party decision. The Liberal Party of Australia maintains that elected members are free to make their own judgment. However, the reality is vastly different. If a member steps out of line or rocks the boat in any way, he can be subjected to the most intense pressure, from both the parliamentary executive and the party organisation. On the other hand, members who passively toe the line often are rewarded with overseas trips or junior portfolios. </PARA>
<PARA> Rank and file members of the Liberal Party complain that the Public Service has too much power and influence, yet the discipline that they, through their organisation, exert entrenches the Public Service power. If a member suggests that a department is inefficient or that a matter of government operation should be scrutinised, he is accused of disloyalty to the Minister, to the government and to his party, with a covert threat to withdraw endorsement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It certainly happens in the honourable member's party room, too. He should remember what happened to the former honourable member for Banks. Such a suggestion probably would lead to the dismissal of that member from Parliament, as it did with the former honourable member for Banks. Because of that the Public Service is not properly scrutinised and, therefore, its power is ensured.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Unfortunately, many people in the political parties believe the interest of the party outweighs concern for the Parliament or the electorate. The public at large is losing confidence in the Parliament because their elected members are not able properly to represent the people. Parliament belongs to the whole population; it is not the plaything of an entrenched executive or political parties. We as its members have the responsibility to ensure that Parliament fulfils the role expected of it by the community. The question then must be: What can we as members do to fulfil community expectations? Decisions made by the Government are usually made on the advice of Public Service departments or on expert advice that is marshalled by the Public Service. As private members, we do not have such advice available, nor do we have the facilities to marshall expert advice. However, official committees of the Parliament have secretarial staff and can call on expert advice either from within the Public Service or from other areas of occupation. </PARA>
<PARA> It would seem then that if we are to fulfil the role expected of us by the community, it must be done through an extension of the present parliamentary committees. I am not fully familiar with the Senate's procedures, but it would appear that it has a much more extensive system of committees than the House of Representatives. During the previous Parliament the House experimented with legislation committees and Estimates committees. These developments are encouraging and I understand they were introduced with the Government's approval. However, much more needs to be done. At present we have only three effective committees that can properly scrutinise government decisions: The Joint Committee of Public Accounts, the Standing Committee on Public Works and the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. More recently, we have been experimenting with a further Estimates committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The Estimates committees of the Parliament can look briefly into the operations of each department after the presentation of the Budget, but their time for debate and scrutiny is usually limited to about two hours. What is needed is a system that will allow committees of the Parliament to investigate workings of government departments at any time and also constantly to monitor the effectiveness of previous policy decisions. If a past policy decision is proven to be wrong by subsequent experience, it can be scrutinised only by the government or the Public Service. There is little opportunity for the Parliament to review past decisions unless those matters are formally reintroduced into the House by the government. That has happened on occasions, but usually only after intense pressure by the media. It is that media exposure of the weakness in the parliamentary process that is causing a loss of public confidence in the Parliament. We have it in our own hands to correct that anomaly, to establish committees that will properly scrutinise proposed government action and review past decisions. Such committees also should be available to receive a point of view from interested groups and members of the public. No doubt, that would help to bridge the communication gap between the community and the Parliament and would help to restore public confidence in the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> We need parliamentary committees with members from both sides of the House that are appointed to review the processes of each government department. They should review the departmental Budget estimates but they should review also the effectiveness of existing policy operation as well as proposed new policies. These investigations should be conducted at any time considered appropriate by the committee and they also should call on expert advice from either inside or outside the Public Service. If each committee were limited to one or two related departments, it would allow members to build up expertise and knowledge in those matters. Because I consider such work to be central to the purpose for which Parliament is established, every member of the House should serve on at least one such committee. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the fierce division between the political parties, Opposition members effectively are only able to oppose decisions made by the Government and refine their policies in the hope of winning government at some time in the future. Whilst I am not suggesting that Opposition members should be invited to join the Executive Government, they should have more opportunity to influence the attitude of Parliament. Involvement in bipartisan parliamentary committees would allow Opposition members more opportunity to make an input on behalf of their constituents. In any election about 45 per cent of the people will support the Opposition party and the philosophy it represents. It is unrealistic to assume that because the Opposition party regardless of its political persuasion has not won government it should be denied an influential role in the Parliament. Effectively, that means that 45 per cent of the people are disenfranchised. Participation in the committees I have suggested would give Opposition members more involvement and provide them with more opportunity to put forward the views of their supporters. </PARA>
<PARA> Parliament is a magnificent institution. It has been developed and refined over hundreds of years and has now been adopted by the free world as the central pillar of democracy. It is Parliament that preserves all the tenets of freedom for the people and prevents the development of totalitarian regimes. If we are to preserve freedom and democracy in this country for future generations, we must preserve the Parliament. That requires us to ensure that Parliament serves the purpose the community expects of it. If we fail in that task, public confidence will be undermined and the Parliament discredited. Parliament then could be considered redundant and swept aside by anarchists intent on establishing a totalitarian regime. We must show that Parliament is a vibrant institution in its own right, which the public expects, well capable of reflecting the views and aspirations of the community. That requires the most earnest endeavour from all of us to uphold the Parliament and not be distracted by the temptations, ambitions and pressures that constantly confront us. </PARA>

In no circumstances would I suggest that he is hypocritical in any way but I refer to the fact that he was elected to the Parliament in 1975. He advocates a fixed term for the Parliament and an extension of the current term to, say, four years. I agree with the proposal for a fixed term for the Parliament on one understanding, that is, that the Senate would have no right to withdraw Supply from the elected government or, in other words, from the party or the coalition parties which had the majority in the House of Representatives.

<PARA> I feel that we have received tonight an insight into the frustrations and problems which exist within the Government parties. We heard a few only yesterday. However, we are speaking tonight on the Address-in-Reply to the Governor-General's Speech. I refer to the part of the Speech which dealt with unemployment and youth. Of course, we recognise that, whilst the Speech was formally the Governor-General's Speech, it was prepared by the Government for him. There were some criticisms that it contained undertones of politics which we have not heard for many a year. I do not blame the Governor-General for that in any way whatsoever. I make that quite clear. I can blame only the Government and, in particular, the Prime Minister. Under the heading 'Unemployment and Youth' the Speech stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The first element of that program to which I wish to draw particular attention is the provision it contains for overcoming unemployment in general and particularly for stimulating the employment of youth. This is placed first because of the great importance my Government attaches to it. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent years, and for a number of reasons, the question of jobs for young people has emerged as a crucial one-</PARA>
<PARA>I am glad that at last the Government has woken up to that-</PARA>
<PARA>not only in Australia but in virtually all Western countries. It is not only an economic problem but a social one. Indeed, for the young people involved and their families it is a major psychological and human problem. </PARA>
<PARA>That was said by the Governor-General. In other words, it was spoken by the Prime Minister himself. Yet, only a matter of months after making that statement, the Prime Minister came out with the proposition that the unemployment benefit should be removed for all young people aged 16 and 17 years. In his view they should be told that they either are to be looked after by their own families or sent back to school. He is passing the buck back to the family for this Government's misdoings and economic policies which have caused massive youth unemployment. I will give some statistics for my own area in a few moments. The Prime Minister is endeavouring to pass the buck to the family or to the States to bear the cost of educating young people to the age of 18 years. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister has not been out into the areas of mass youth unemployment. I invite him to come to the outer western suburbs of Sydney to see it. I invite him to get to understand the psychology of these young people and their hopelessness instead of standing in his ivory tower and preaching these ridiculous policies. I suggest that, if young people continue at school to the age of 18 years, their chances of employment are far worse than they would be if they left school at 16 years of age. One could ask any employer. To start with, he wants a person with work experience. Further- more, if he has to choose between a person of 16 or 17 years of age and a person of 18 years of age he will employ the younger person who has just left school because he can pay him at a lower rate. It is financial common sense, but we would not find the Prime Minister understanding that economic proposition. Therefore, I would never advise a young person, unless he were undertaking university training and was capable of handling it, to leave school at a late age. I would advise that young person in New South Wales, for instance, to obtain the School Certificate and then set to, if possible, and get a trade qualification, obtain employment and acquire work experience. Once on that road, young people have the opportunity to improve themselves as they go along. </PARA>
<PARA> I should like to quote some figures concerning unemployment in the outer western suburbs of Sydney. First, I refer to the youth unemployment figures for Blacktown, as supplied by the Commonwealth Employment Service, for December, 1980. I do not have the January figures which came out only yesterday. They are a little difficult to obtain these days but I understand that they show a serious deterioration from the position of last year, despite the fact that in the last fortnight the Government has been claiming a big improvement in employment. As at the end of December 1980, 1,574 young people were registered as being unemployed, compared with 1,593 as at December 1979, a reduction of only 19. Let us keep in mind that the latest figures show massive increases compared with the figures for the same time last year. For Mount Druitt and St Marys combined, the number of unemployed young people stood at 2,341 in December 1980 compared with 2,400 in December 1979, a reduction of only 59. A great deal has been said by the Government about the improvement in the number of unfilled vacancies. As at December 1980 eight vacancies were registered in Blacktown and 1,574 young people were unemployed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would agree with the honourable member. As at December 1979 seven vacancies were registered and 1,593 young people were unemployed. In other words the number of vacancies has increased by one-from seven to eight. This is the massive improvement that the Government has been bragging about. For Mount Druitt and St Marys combined job vacancies stood at 39 at the end of December 1980 compared with 28 in December 1979, an improvement of 11. Let us keep in mind that although there were 39 vacancies, 2,341 young people were unemployed and that although in December 1979 28 vacancies existed 2,400 young people were unemployed. This is an indictment of any government. In the whole region of Blacktown, St Marys and Mount Druitt a total of 7,478 young people and adults are unemployed. That is the situation, yet the Prime Minister is proposing that no young people who are 16 or 17 years of age should receive the unemployment benefit-that either the families should look after them or they should go back to school. That would mean that they would leave school at the age of 18 years and find it harder than ever to obtain a job. These young people would not have gained work experience and an employer would naturally prefer someone younger with such experience rather than pay the higher award rate. It is time the Prime Minister, instead of sitting in his ivory tower, visited areas such as the outer western suburbs of Sydney.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with the honourable member. The Prime Minister should speak to these young people and find just how things work, instead of calling them all dole bludgers. Of course, there are problem children. That is not new; it occurs in every generation. Kids are basically the same as they have always been. A kid who leaves school and cannot get a job may run into one of his or her mates from the same class who has a job. That young person will say that he or she has a job. It is only natural that, from an inborn sense of self-protection the other kid will say, 'You are a mug, mate; I am on the dole. You have to work.' This is only a natural reaction. Out of that sort of situation is born the dole bludger psychology. In actual fact, that is the way in which the young person is trying to protect his or her self-respect. That is not understood unless one speaks to these people and understands their psychology and problems. It is well and truly time that this Government realised that much more needs to be done in the training of our young people. For far too many years-there has been error on all sides-we have concentrated purely upon the universities and the colleges of advanced education. Basically, as a nation, for far too many years we have neglected our tertiary and technical training.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is time that our whole apprenticeship system was reviewed completely. For example, would it be such a dreadful thing if an employer of five men who was engaged in a particular trade was required to employ one apprentice? Would it be such a dreadful thing if, under the subcontract system, which has been destroying our apprenticeship schemes, employers were required by law to employ apprentices instead of getting the job done as quickly as they can, making as much as they can and forgetting about the future?</PARA>
<PARA> Let us consider the bricklaying industry. Unless something drastic is done the public will be paying more and more because of the shortage of skills and the lack of trained apprentices. There will be fewer and fewer tradesmen in the field. These are the sorts of issues that the Government should be facing up to and considering. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to take this opportunity to refer to the flooding of the Parramatta River basin. I have here correspondence from the Honourable A. R. L. Gordon, the Minister for Lands, Forests and Water Resources in the New South Wales Government. I will give a little of the history of this matter. Some years ago, when the Labor Government was in office, we asked the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation to undertake a study of this very great problem of the flooding of the Parramatta River basin. Whenever a new subdivision had been created in the Hills District around Parramatta, particularly in Baulkham Hills and Castle Hill it has meant the building of additional roads, footpaths, gutters and driveways, all of which occupy land which would normally absorb water. As a result, the run-off has become more massive over time. It finds its way down into the creeks and eventually into the centre of the City of Parramatta. The result is that the David Jones store in that city has already been under water three times. If that problem is not corrected, it will become more serious as each year passes. I refer to the creeks around there, to the areas of Pye's Crossing, Johnson's Bridge and nearby areas along the old Windsor Road, which is one of the most historic roads in this country. A number of people have been drowned on the bridges in that area; as they drive along their cars are swept away and they are drowned.</PARA>
<PARA> The Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporaton, together with Willing and Partners Pty Ltd, who are consulting engineers to the Water Resources Commission of the New South Wales Government, have put forward a proposition which was originally put forward to this Government as the result of a report from the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation commissioned by the Labor Government and financed by the present Government. Having received the report, the Government has refused to take any action whatsoever, despite a number of deaths in the region. The report recommends what one might call retaining weirs, in the hills, so that the waters are retained. In other words, the flood waters instead of rushing down will be retained for a period and the floods will be more steady. As I have said, if something is not done many more lives will be lost and, furthermore, Parramatta itself will go under water time and time again, and far more often. The proposition has been put up and a submission has been made to this Government by the New South Wales Minister. So far as the report entitled 'Parramatta River Flood Mitigation Investigation' is concerned, this proposition provides that a detention basin at the site shown as 2B in the report-I will not go into the details of that-should be constructed as quickly as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> The New South Wales Minister has made an approach to this Government, which he tells me would involve the National Water Resources Program which is jointly funded by the Commonwealth, State and local government in a ratio of 2:2:1 respectively. The Blacktown City Council considered the matter last week and it has agreed to provide the funds, which it would have to provide, of $40,800. The Baulkham Hills Shire Council has ignored the matter in the past, and I have not heard of it approving anything, even though it would be concerned with a large proportion of the water. It would have to provide $67,200. The Holroyd Municipal Council would have to provide $32,400 and the Parramatta City Council would have to provide $99,600. They will be the amounts if the Commonwealth comes to the party. I make a two-pronged appeal tonight, firstly for the Commonwealth to come to the party to save lives and to save the City of Parramatta from flooding. It is one of the most historic cities in this country. Secondly I appeal to the councils which have not already agreed to the proposal to look to their consciences and do the job. </PARA>

It is a privilege to represent an electorate such as mine and equally I believe it is a privilege for every member of this House to be returned here either for the first or a subsequent time to represent a section of the people of Australia. Honourable members just now have heard the usual diatribe from the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Armitage). I have listened to him on many occasions speaking, as he does so eloquently, about the problems of the unemployed. It is unfortunate for the honourable member for Chifley that, apart from giving statistics, in his own electorate he does not appear to have done much else. A few months ago at the Federal elections the Australian Labor Party, which once again is in Opposition, advised the Australian people and made dire forecasts of what would become of this nation if the Fraser Government were returned. In fact, the situation is exactly the opposite of the gloom, despondency and despair that the Opposition told the Australian people would occur this year. It was wrong about unemployment, it was wrong about inflation, and it was wrong about economic growth.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QF4">Mr CONNOLLY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Chifley should look at the figures as they relate to the situation. He is happy to take only aggregate figures. He should have drawn from them the obvious conclusion which anyone in this House with half a brain would appreciate; namely, that in the early new year it is a fact that the rate of unemployment amongst school leavers always goes up. The honourable member should also have noted, had he bothered to read his statistics for the last three years or so-especially last year-that there was a significant fall in the rate of unemployment of young school leavers. The reality is simply that there are now 170,000 more people in jobs than a year ago, and that is over 300,000 more people in jobs than two years ago. That is the reality. It is unfortunate that school leavers are unemployed. It is a great tragedy that that is the situation but the fact of the matter is that it is not unique to Australia. It is an endemic reality through which the entire Western world is passing. There is not one government of the Western world worth its salt that has not been prepared to look as hard as this Government has looked to seek and to find reasonable arrangements to look after the welfare of those people and, above all, to enable them to have the qualifications and the capacity to enter the labour market.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In my opinion some of the points made by the honourable member for Chifley had some merit. For example, he emphasised the problem of education. It is true that there is a problem with education. He knows that because I tried the first youth work program in his electorate. He is aware of what I did in his electorate. He is aware that I took some of his young people to my electorate and, as far as I know, each one received training and found jobs. We have continued that program. We have taken young people from Hornsby and elsewhere in the metropolitan area. I know as much about the problems of unemployed youth as the honourable member, and probably anybody else in this place. It is a most pitiful situation when there are young people in our community who, quite frankly, cannot read or write. It is all right to talk about them in terms of statistics but they are more than statistics, they are human beings. It is a tragedy that the education system of which they were meant to be a part taught them so little, but that is the fact. That is the reality. Whatever our sins of commission in the past may have been, whatever government may have been in power in past years, State or federal-unfortunately the blame in most of this area has to lie at the State level-the fact is that a growing percentage of young people for various reasons find it difficult to gain employment because they do not have the qualifications which make employment a reality in terms of their capacity to offer something to potential employers. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, the fact remains that we have trained over 400,000 Australians during the last three years. We have given those people the capacity to be retrained; we have taken young people and put them through technical colleges and various other courses and high levels of education so that they are better equipped to go into the work force. The ultimate, and only, solution to youth unemployment and for that matter to any other type of unemployment in the community is to create, as the Government is doing, a sound economic base which will create jobs which people can fill. The honourable member for Chifley, and regrettably other members of his ilk, will take the view that somehow or other governments can create jobs. What they are supposed to do is left to the figment of one's imagination. I recall two wonderful stories told to me about the days of the Regional Employment Development Scheme. In a small country town it was decided that it should have a tennis court, and it was built under the RED Scheme. Then someone got the bright idea that they should have a night tennis court so electric light wires and so forth were put up, and the whole thing was superb. The sad fact is that the town was not on the main grid and they did not have sufficient power to run the lights on the courts of an evening. Stories such as that are innumerable and are to be found in virtually every electorate in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It is for that reason, because of the Labor Government's experience and failure with the RED Scheme, that this Government was advised by the public servants-rightly so-that those sorts of programs were simply not cost effective. The honourable member is talking about putting people into a situation where they virtually waste their time in doing something which is of no real use either to themselves or to the community. The important thing is to find people useful employment in which they can then develop their skills and abilities and make a contribution to society and, above all, get the self-respect which quite obviously is lacking in a person who has to suffer the problem of unemployment for any length of time. </PARA>
<PARA> The position today is that in a recent report of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Australia is regarded as having one of the world's most successful economies. In statistical terms and in virtually every other aspect-foreign investment and so forth-we are undoubtedly one of the leaders of the Western world today. We have a future which, frankly, is second to none. The only thing we have to fear is the stupidity of some people in Australia, especially members of the Australian Labor Party, who seem to believe that as good Australians they can talk this country into a rut and somehow or other be able to talk it out of it. The simple fact of the matter is that there is only one way to solve this nation's problems and that is to build up a sound economy based on a community which has confidence in its nation's future and in the destiny of its people. On the basis of confidence the people will make the decisions and the investments which will create the jobs of which we have heard so much tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> We are talking at the moment about a growth rate in the gross domestic product in Australia this financial year of approximately four per cent. That is four times the forecast rate for the rest of the developed world, which, for those who cannot work out the difference, is a mere one per cent. In other words Australia's rate of growth is expected to be greater than that of all the major industrial countries in the European Economic Community and the OECD area. In fact, many of them are not going to show any major growth at all. It is quite likely that this will have some impact in the foreseeable future on some of our extractive industries. They are totally dependent on overseas markets. </PARA>
<PARA> One very satisfactory feature which we have witnessed, especially since November of last year, has been the considerable pick-up in consumer demand in terms of the internal Australian economy. We have noted in the last four or five years that consumer demand has been slack, that it has not been satisfactory. Perhaps one of the reasons was that people were concerned about the ultimate outcome of the situation. The fact that they are now spending their money and are prepared to make long term commitments demonstrates that, whatever fears they may have had and which they certainly inherited from the unfortunate Whitlam years, the average Australian is today prepared to look to the future with some confidence in the belief that in this nation he will be able to bring up his children in a higher standard of living than possibly any other country. Provided this country continues to have sound economic leadership it will be able to proceed into the future with the satisfaction of knowing that we can achieve what we set out to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA> To have a stronger rate of growth in the Australian economy-I cannot repeat this too often-is the only way ultimately to strengthen the basis for employment. Personal income and private consumption are also key elements of this formula. They were all emphasised by the OECD in its last annual report. The OECD is an independent body. It does not have to go around pandering to the Australian Government or anybody else. It sees the realities and the statistics as they are. It is a body which makes its own assessment on the basis of the evidence before it. </PARA>
<PARA> We on this side of the House have every reason to be proud of the Australian Government, given the difficulties of the last few years. All honourable members, especially my colleagues, will appreciate that they were difficult years for all of us. We are at last seeing the product of those difficult decisions which had to be made. They were decisions which we were always told by the Opposition were wrong. The Opposition fell for the fundamental mistake of looking for the soft option. There is no soft option in these situations. We have taken the hard decision and we have been proven right. The Australian people refused to accept the blandishments, the hypocrisy and the nonsense which were fed to them in the last election by the Opposition. Today the Australian people are demonstrating with their pockets, by the way they are going out into the market place and spending, that they have confidence in the future of this nation, as do the people who have been given the responsibility of leading this nation further into the 1980s and of giving additional years of great satisfaction and national achievement. </PARA>
<PARA> I wanted to make those observations merely because I felt that the honourable member for Chifley, in the remarks I heard from him, was less than fair to this nation. He was certainly unfair to the facts of the situation and was not prepared to admit that the problems we have faced in recent years are extremely difficult to solve. Nobody can say that this Government has not been prepared to do whatever it can, in co-ordination with the private sector and the State governments, to give employment opportunities and training as best we can to those who need them. Whilst the figures still need to be higher, the fact is that an achievement of 400,000 trained positions is a figure which has never been attained by any other Australian government. </PARA>
<PARA> In the minutes which I have left to me I would like to spend some time talking about the future of the private sector and the relationship between that sector and the Australian citizen. I believe that this nation is more able than any other nation on earth to give its citizens the highest standard of living. More importantly, because of our natural heritage, the people of Australia should have the opportunity to involve themselves in a real and practical way in the development of our capacity in the mineral and agricultural sectors and elsewhere. It must never be forgotten that in the latter years of the 1980s and beyond this nation will be one of a literal handful which will be exporters of minerals as well as energy. That not only puts Australia in a unique position but also and more importantly places upon us a major responsibility-a responsibility to our people and, above all, a responsibility to mankind, especially to those countries of the Third World which, for various reasons, do not have the opportunities we have been fortunate enough to inherit. Basically, this means that it is essential that we devise, in co-ordination with the private sector, a range of opportunities so that every Australian will have the chance to feel that he has a personal commitment to the economic development of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA> The statistical realities which we are seeing in Australia and which have been compared to those of every other Western country demonstrate only too clearly that in recent years there has been a considerable falling away of the involvement of the individual in share ownership in this country and elsewhere in the Western world. On the other hand, equity participation by large companies and institutions has grown apace. The impact which this can create in the longer term is difficult to understand totally at this stage, but perhaps a couple of points can be made. Firstly, if the individual in society is led to believe that he really has no part to play, it follows naturally that he is less than concerned about the ultimate result. It follows equally that if the individual in society is given the opportunities and is made to feel that he does have a part to play, not necessarily by his physical involvement but more specifically by his financial involvement, it obviously follows that he will be interested in the outcome and the success of the company, corporation or institution with which he is associated. To deal completely through institutions, which is a growing trend, is to place a third party between the person who intiates the decision and the company which utilises that capital investment. It ultimately means that the nexus is broken and there is no longer that connection between the person and the company in which the investment has been made. </PARA>
<PARA> The simple fact that I am trying to put over is that it is essential to the success of the private sector in Australia that the shareholding base within the community be increased considerably above its present level. This means that, with the assistance of the stock exchanges and the other financial institutions in Australia, we have to go out to the Australian people and explain to them what the advantages are of their involvement in the development of their nation. I wonder how many people look at the list of figures in the stock exchange reports of the daily newspapers and say: 'I do not understand what that means. I am sure that it only refers to rich people'. Of course, the simple fact is that a company like the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd has over 111,000 small investors among its owners. The important point is that those people are the owners of BHP. </PARA>
<PARA> Every company in Australia should be proud to say that it has a significant number of Australian citizens who own that company and who are vitally concerned in the welfare and destiny of that company because through the improvement of those individual operations alone will we see the ultimate development of our nation. Much has to be done in this area, however. Not only is it a question of getting out and selling the concept to the Australian people but also, more importantly, it is essential that the nation and the Government in particular be prepared to negotiate with the organisations concerned to encourage companies, for example, to offer shares to their employees and to bring their employees into a closer relationship with the operation which ultimately is their bread and butter. Obviously, if people are made to feel that they have a part to play, their involvement in that operation and their financial success will depend to some degree on the success of the operation. </PARA>
<PARA> One would perhaps be less than naive to make the point that perhaps it could even have some impact on industrial relations. I have no doubt that there are employers in Australia who have been less than satisfactory in looking for ways in which they can improve the relationship between their employees and their own corporate entities. As I understand it those companies which have taken this step have had a very successful industrial relations record because the people who work for them have a loyalty towards the company. They are made to feel that there is a family relationship and that the success of the company is a success for every single participant in that operation. </PARA>

I realise that on the other side of the House there are people who think that the socialist dialectic sees no room for any possible linkage between capital and labour. I believe that there has been too much confusion, irritation and total concern for too long both in this chamber and certainly in this nation between the employer and the employee who apparently believe that, if a 'hands-off' or an 'at arm's length' relationship cannot be maintained, something must be basically wrong. The employer cannot exist without the employee. As we heard from the honourable member for Chifley, obviously the employee will not get very far unless he has a job which ultimately must be provided essentially by the private sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have to work together as a people and we have to work together as a nation if we are to have any possibility of developing the resources of our country and to reach for the undoubted opportunities which we have been given. This can be done. There will always be a major place in the private sector for all sections of the community which are prepared to put their capital to work. Each Australian has capital. For example, some people in parts of the electorate of the honourable member for Chifley have the highest disposable incomes in New South Wales. How those people spend their money, of course, is their decision. But I doubt strongly whether anybody has ever gone to many of those people and made the simple suggestion that perhaps it would be worth their while considering investments, other than the banks and the building societies, out of which they could get something worth while. </PARA>
<PARA> Much has to be done in this area. I am looking for ideas. I believe that this is a prospect which can only bring success to this nation and to the people. We are undoubtedly on the threshold of enormous development. We are dealing with sums of money which we have never known before. Equally, if we are not able to use our own national resources-above all, the resources of our own people; their flesh and blood as well as their capacity to work-quite clearly we will be less than able to achieve the undoubted opportunities which lie before us. </PARA>

<PARA> The world is passing through a massive economic crisis. In some technologically advanced nations there has been a sharp swing to the political right. This is illustrated most recently and most compellingly in the United States by the election in November 1980 of President Ronald Reagan. The sheer complexity and expense of running modern society, a growing sense that affairs are out of control and a mounting collective and individual frustration at the international constraints against the use of America's political and economic power have led to a national obsession that complex problems should be met by simple solutions-the more complex the problem, the simpler the solution. This has led to a movement with the strength of a religious revival, a return to robust simplicities, to the code of rugged individualism and to a growing faith in what Senator Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts has called 'bumper sticker economics'. We have something of that American mood in Australia but it is largely confined to Queensland and Western Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And Tasmania, as my friend from Franklin points out. The right wing economic revivalism in the United States is based on a naked appeal to self-interest. Five main ideas have been pushed: First, that the interests of the government and the people are opposed and that government must be reduced in extent and cost so that it gets off the backs of the people; second, that the affluent should be allowed to enjoy the fruits of their labour without having to subsidise, through progressive taxation and other redistributive measures, the poor, the ignorant, the unemployed or the sick; third, that capitalism, or free enterprise as we call it here, can enjoy an expansion of production which will lead to an economic rebirth if only government withdraws from all regulatory measures whether fiscal, environmental or social, leaving the economy to the regulation of market forces alone; fourth, that in the final analysis only money matters, that the pursuit of wealth is a noble aim, and that the community ought to be deeply suspicious of anyone whose motive is other than economic; and, fifth, that the best way to aid the poor is to teach them to be self-reliant and that this knowledge will lead to greater personal and economic development than any welfare mechanism. In other words, kicking the poor will transform them, raise their status and put money in their pockets. These five ideas are dangerous fallacies. They are fantasies based on a total misreading of the realities of a complex urban environment. I regret to say that they are current views not just in the United States but here in Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. The fallacy of the Friedmanite position is that it over-emphasises the virtues of competitiveness in an increasingly densely packed and interdependent social and urban environment. The constant rhetorical appeals to rugged individualism evoke a powerful and emotional response from the successful and the motivated. But, to jobless urban blacks in blighted areas where unemployment is running between 30 per cent and 40 per cent of the labour force, these appeals evoke only rage and frustration. The fires next time, when they come, will have far more impact than the riots and arson of 1968. This may produce the greatest domestic division in the US since the Civil War with no Abraham Lincoln in sight, with an even sharper movement to the right by the middle class. Perhaps an armed middle class will be prepared to shoot to defend its own interests. I draw attention to a recent book entitled The Zero-Sum Society: Distribution and the Possibilities for Economic Change by Lester C. Thurow, Professor of Economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. J. K. Galbraith stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Thurow's general concern, the one that provides his title, is with public policy in an economy which no longer yields large annual increases in real income. Such increases no longer being in prospect, it follows that any important benefit for any considerable group of citizens requires an equivalent sacrifice somewhere else. Thus the zero-sum game. The ability of the affluent to identify actual or potential sacrifice is highly developed, so if there must be sacrifice, the most promising opportunity is to reduce the largesse accruing from government to the always undeserving poor. Things were far easier back when the poor could be bought off out of the annual increases in income, with much additional and righteously deserved income going to the upper-income brackets as well. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, in the nineteenth century, which many of the right wingers in the United States hanker for, the United States had about 80 per cent of its population self-employed living in small towns and, notwithstanding the division of labour, performing a variety of tasks. In the twentieth century, more than 80 per cent of Americans are employees, living in large cities or towns, performing a narrow range of specialised tasks, increasingly interdependent and reliant on the provision of government services-education, health, waste disposal, water supply, postal and welfare services-which help, incidentally, to maintain the levels of demand by the the poor, factors which are increasingly important to the market economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Even more serious, there is a failure to understand the extent of the revolution which is transforming the economy of all technologically advanced nations-that is the movement from an industrial society to a post-industrial society. In an important article in the New York Review of Books for 5 February 1981 entitled 'Reagan and the Real America', Professor Emma Rothschild of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Sorbonne uses the latest figures in Employment and Earnings (1980) from the United States Department of Labor to point out the vast shift in patterns of work in the 1970s. This decade was marked by very high job creation combined with low productivity growth-a refutation of Okun's law, one of the pieces of conventional economic wisdom like the Phillips curve which went by the board in the 1970s. As Emma Rothschild says, employment in three industries-eating and drinking places, health services and business services, including mail delivery and janitoring-increased three times as fast as total private employment and 16 times as fast as employment in the goods producing or industrial sector of the economy. She notes:</PARA>
<PARA>The increase in employment in eating and drinking places since 1973 is greater than total employment in the automobile and steel industries combined. </PARA>
<PARA>But it has to be pointed out that that enormous employment growth is largely female, largely part-time, largely unskilled, largely non-unionised and largely, of course, without much prospect of job satisfaction or advancement. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard Emma Rothschild's article. I am grateful to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) who suggested that instead of just incorporating segments, I incorporate the whole of what is an immensely valuable article. </PARA>

<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>REAGAN AND THE REAL AMERICA</PARA>
<PARA>Emma Rothschild</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Reagan has an imposing vision of the country that he is to lead. He sees an inherent America-an America which is white, and male, and industrial-and a project, of economic growth, by which this reality can be born again. He sees a ''spirit'' which is ''still there, ready to blaze into life'' if we ''stimulate our economy, increase productivity, and put America back to work.'' But his America no longer exists. The pursuit of his vision may lead to an economic crisis and a level of unemployment in comparison with which the events of 1975 and 1980 will appear as the merest disturbances of the compassionate state. </PARA>
<PARA> During the election, Mr Reagan spoke frequently about the American economy, and his words served him well. They had resonance-such is the political charm of the president-to-be-on two quite different levels. First, in policies, projections, and legislative proposals. Second, and far more importantly, in the imagination and in a tableau of American resurgence, packed and repacked in the cardboard of the traveling theater, which journeyed with Mr Reagan through his seemingly interminable electoral wanderings. </PARA>
<PARA> The first level of economic discourse can be dismissed fairly expeditiously. Mr Reagan said that he would cut income tax by 30 percent by 1983, that he would reduce business taxes in order to stimulate investment, that he would increase military spending, that while he would eliminate waste in government he would not assault the ''integrity'' of Social Security, that he would in the meantime balance the federal budget, and that his policies would reduce inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> The unlikeliness of this enterprise is not hidden by the appointment of a Cabinet balanced between wild tax cutters and men who appear as pillars of fiscal responsibility. We need not doubt the new government's resolution to kick the poor by eliminating social programs. The Republican policy equation depends, nonetheless on the assumption of rapid economic growth. Only then would tax revenues be equal to Mr Reagan's extravagant schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> But such accelerated growth seems unlikely. The United States exports more than 10 percent of its gross national product, and the countries with which it trades are sickly. Industrial production turned down in the second quarter of 1980 in each of the five largest capital economies.2 The number of people looking for jobs in the European Community has increased by 20 percent in one year.3 The world economy may be moving, as Mr Reagan takes office, toward the synchronous recession of 1981-1982. </PARA>
<PARA> The expectation of economic growth thus depends in turn on a further assumption: that some unknown Republican inspiration, some elixir of indigenous capitalist expansion, will intervene to make possible the American regeneration. It is here that Mr Reagan's imaginative tableau is of importance. </PARA>
<PARA> The scene is of an innate economy, an economy of industrial workers, male, white, neither young nor old, which is to ''get working again.'' It is the country of the man in the Republican television commercial, standing lonely but determined in a deserted factory that he hopes to bring to life. And it is the country of basic manufacturing values. In his main economic speech, Mr Reagan mentioned only two industries. ''Outdated depreciation schedules,'' he said, ''now prevent many industries, especially steel and auto, from modernizing their plants.''4 The image is related, in turn, to the idea of remilitarization. The resurgent America will be equipped with missiles and tanks and military transport planes. Mr Reagan repeatedly joined his objectives, of reconstructing ''a disintegrating economy, a weakened defense.''</PARA>
<PARA> It is on this vision that the Republican mission of restoring economic confidence relies. The new policies, Mr Reagan's adviser George Shultz says, will have ''an electric effect on expectations.''5 Like other observers of capitalist behaviour, including Keynes, the Reaganites believe in an investment ''spirit.'' The ''strategy,'' Reagan himself says, ''is based on solid economic principles and basic experience in both the govenment and the marketplace. It has worked before and will work again.''6 And indeed his imagery corresponds to the reality of the postwar period. The two great surges in recent American economic growth, from 1950 to 1953, and from 1962 to 1966, were each accompanied by an even more rapid increase in manufacturing ouput; each was also a period of rapid expansion in the military economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The vision is not implausible. But it is false. For the structural changes that have taken place in the US economy in the 1970s are such that the old truths no longer hold. These changes-in the structure of employment and also in the structure of military expenditure-make Mr Reagan's regeneration, his Pittsburgh Redivivus, unlikely. They also hold out the possibility of a far more cruel economic crisis to come. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1970s were a time of startingly rapid expansion in employment in the American economy. In the period of the economic crisis alone, from 1973 to 1979, almost 13 million new nonagricultural jobs were created of which almost 11 million were in the private economy.7 This is as though the entire labour force of Canada had moved south and found employment in the United States. The US had by far the most rapid growth in total employment of any major industrial country: from 1973 to 1979, it was more than three times as fast as in Japan, while employment actually fell in West Germany, and was virtually unchanged in France and the United Kingdom.8</PARA>
<PARA> The new American jobs were concentrated, however, in two sectors of the private economy-services and retail trade-and, at least in the early 1970s, in one public sector, state and local government. By 1979, 43 percent of all Americans employed in the private nonagricultural economy worked in services and retail trade. The two sectors together provided more than 70 percent of all new private jobs created from 1973 to the summer of 1980.9</PARA>
<PARA> Even within these two vast sectors, the growth in employment was further concentrated. Three industries each provided more than a million new jobs during the 1973-1979 period. ''eating and drinking places,'' including fast food restaurants; ''health services,'' including private hospitals, nursing homes, and doctors' and dentists' offices; and ''business services,'' including personnel supply services, data processing services, reproduction and mailing, and the quaintly named ''services to buildings.'' These three industries together accounted for more than 40 percent of the new private jobs created between 1973 and the summer of 1980. In that period their employment increased almost three times as fast as total private employment, and sixteen times as fast as employment in the goods-producing or industrial sector of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The three ''new'' industries loom very large in total employment. Mr Reagan's fundamental manufacturing industries are insignificant by comparison. Thus the increase in employment in eating and drinking places since 1973 is greater than total employment in the automobile and steel industries combined.10 Total employment in the three industries is greater than total employment in an entire range of basic productive industries: construction, all machinery, all electric and electronic equipment, motor vehicles, aircraft, ship building, all chemicals and products, and all scientific and other instruments. </PARA>
<PARA> This transformation has profound consequences for the organisation of society, and for the American economy. The new jobs are different in several respects from jobs in productive industry. In the first place, they provide employment for women. Women accounted for 41 per cent of all employment in 1979, and 31 per cent of all manufacturing employment; they accounted for 56 per cent of all people employed in eating and drinking places, 43 per cent of employment in business services (a sharp increase since the early 1970s), and 81 per cent of employment in health services. Waiting on tables, defrosting frozen hamburgers, rendering 'services to buildings', looking after the old and the ill: 'women's work'. </PARA>
<PARA> Second, jobs in the big three industries of the 1970s offer short hours. People working in eating and drinking places work the shortest weekly hours of any industry: 26.4 hours in 1979, compared to an average of 35.7 for the entire private economy, and 40.2 in manufacturing. ('Services to buildings' and health services are also parsimonious in hours worked.) Third, hourly pay is very low. Eating and drinking places offer the lowest average hourly earnings (excluding tips) of any industry. Business services and health services are also among the low-paid industries. Employees in 'nursing and personal care facilities', for example-of whom 89 per cent are women-earned an average of $3.87 per hour in 1979, compared to an average of $6.16 in the entire private economy, and $6.69 in manufacturing. And these pitiful earnings increase very slowly. Hourly earnings in services, measured in 1972 dollars, fell from $3.16 in 1973 to $3.08 in 1979; earnings in retail trade fell from $2.70 to $2.61. Over the same period real hourly earnings in manufacturing increased from $3.83 to $3.85, while earnings in the motor vehicle industry increased from $5.13 to $5.22.11</PARA>
<PARA> Fourth, the new positions are 'dead-end' jobs'. One measure of the prospects for change and promotion in an industry is the proportion of all jobs which are for production or nonsupervisory workers. The average for the private economy in 1979 was 82 per cent; for manufacturing it was 72 per cent, with such adventurous industries as chemicals requiring only 57 per cent non-supervisory workers, aircraft 54 per cent, and guided missiles 32 per cent. Business services, by comparison, employ 87 per cent nonsupervisory workers, health services 89 per cent, and eating and drinking places 92 per cent. Fifth, the 'new' industries, with their short hours, temporary and part-time employment, and their women workers, are less protected by union agreements and benefits than are older manufacturing industries: the motor vehicle industry, for example, with its unemployment compensation, health benefits, and increasing earnings. </PARA>
<PARA> The booming labor-intensive industries are, finally, distinct economically from older productive industries. Their 'structure' in input/output terms, for example, is different from that of manufacturing industries. They buy inputs from a very few other industries, and most of these suppliers are similarly crowded into the service and trade sectors. Thus the business services industry does not buy as much as a penny's worth of inputs, per dollar of its output, from any manufacturing industry; its major purchases consist of services from real estate and from itself. (Purchases of capital equipment are not covered in these statistics.) Medical services spend about three cents per dollar on food and drugs, and just over one cent on such suitably office-bound inputs as paper and printing; the important purchases are of business and other services. Eating and drinking places spend thirty-two cents per dollar of out-put on 'food and kindred products', one cent on paper and paper containers, and the rest of their substantial purchases in the transport, trade, and service sectors. </PARA>
<PARA> This more or less hermetic behaviour is in evident contrast with the more familiar input/output profile of, for example, the motor vehicles industry: for each dollar of output, it buys two cents worth of textiles, three cents worth of rubber, one cent of glass, eight cents of screws, seven cents of iron, one cent of engines, one cent of miscellaneous machinery, twenty-two cents from motor vehicles and equipment, and so forth . . .12</PARA>
<PARA> The new service industries are isolated from the coming and going of intermediate inputs, from the propensity, in Adam Smith's phrase, to 'truck, barter and exchange one thing for another'. </PARA>
<PARA> The United States, in sum, is moving toward a structure of employment ever more dominated by jobs that are badly paid, unchanging, and unproductive. This most industrial of societies, this bourgeois El Dorado has in fact gone further toward a service and retail economy than any other of the largest industrial countries. Two 'activities' in international industrial classifications, 'wholesale and retail trade including restaurants and hotels' and 'community, social, and personal services', together correspond approximately to American trade and services activities (although they also include public employees and wholesale trade). The United States has by far the highest proportion of its employed population in these activities of any of the five major industrial countries: 51 per cent in 1978, compared to 44 per cent in Japan and 37 per cent in Germany. In the race toward services13 the United States-how shameful, how distant from Republican hopes-had surpassed even Sweden, which still had only 48 per cent of its employment in trade and community services. </PARA>
<PARA> It is in this morose environment that Mr. Reagan's industrial Geist must blaze into life. Is such resurrection likely? There are, it seems to me, two successive great dangers ahead. The first is that the policy will not work, that the spirit will fizzle. The second is that the doomed pursuit of the Republican resurrection may lead to a disintegration of the employment-intensive industries, and thus to tremendously increased levels of unemployment, particularly among the poorest and least protected workers. Eventually, as we will see, this may bring about a new ''industrial'' boom. But it would be one that in virtually no way resembles Mr Reagan's essential heavy industry. And the long term in question would be extended, and vicious beyond any part of the postwar economic experience. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to explore the first danger, we need to look more closely at the economic consequences of the changing employment structure. Here we see that the movement is from high to low productivity sectors of the economy. For retail trade and services have the lowest productivity, as measured by conventional economic indicators, in the entire nonagricultural economy. In both output per hours worked, and output per person employed, the two sectors are well below the national average. </PARA>
<PARA> (It is important to be clear that this low productivity is not a consequence of the proportion of women workers in retail and services. The industrial sector with the highest productivity-finance, insurance, and real estate-is also among the most feminized in its labor force. The sector where productivity is growing fastest, communication, also has a higher proportion of women workers than the national average. Within manufacturing, electric and electronic equipment-the source of much innovation for the entire economy-has a higher than average proportion of women workers. Nor is there a strong correlation between output per hour worked and hourly earnings. Workers in finance are among the lowest paid in the economy.)</PARA>
<PARA> We might think of the private American economy as being composed of two sectors, sector I and sector II, where sector II consists of the fast-growing retail and service industries, and sector I of all other industries. Employment in II, as we have seen, accounts for 43 per cent of total employment in 1979, up from 38 per cent in 1969, and its advantage has been accelerating. But it accounts for less than 26 per cent of total output, and this proportion has scarcely changed since 1969.14</PARA>
<PARA> Output per employed person in sector II was $9,853 in 1979 (measured in 1972 dollars); in sector I it was $21,433. The consequences of the shift are yet more dire because productivity in II is not only low but also grows slowly, or not at all. Output per employee in II was lower in 1979 than in 1973; in sector I it increased 1 per cent per year over the same period. </PARA>
<PARA> The shift to sector II is likely, thus, to have affected overall rates of growth of output per employee. Consider, for example, a different kind of economic growth: H-growth, or high-industrial growth. Suppose that, under conditions of H-growth, all of the 10.8 million new private jobs created in 1973-1979 had gone to workers in I. And suppose also that output per worker had still changed at its actual rate in the two sectors. By 1979H, the total product of the economy would have been $1,302 billion, instead of $1,233 billion. Output per worker would have been $17,622 instead of $16,552. Instead of essentially no growth in output per employed person (0.03 per cent per year), there would have been an increase of 1 per cent per year. </PARA>
<PARA> We might consider a more likely alternative-N or normal growth, for an outcome in which the increase in employment from 1973-1979 was divided between sectors I and II in the same 'normal' proportion as was the increase in employment from 1949 to 1969. Even under N-growth, output per worker in 1979N would be significantly higher, at $16,781, than the actual outcome. Real growth in output per employed person, over the period between 1973 and 1979N, would have been a modest but respectable 0.261 per cent per year.15 These simple calculations are not, of course, comparable with studies of the effects of 'structural shift' on productivity defined as output per hour worked. But they do suggest some economic consequences of the movement into sector II employment.16</PARA>
<PARA> The shift in employment is thus likely to be implicated in one of the most lamented problems of the recent American economy, namely the slow rate of growth of productivity. Output per hours worked in the private non-farm economy-to revert to the most widely used measure-which increased 2.2 per cent per year from 1950 to 1973, increased only 0.5 per cent per year from 1973 to 1979; the level of productivity was actually lower in 1979 than in 1978, and is lower in 1980 than in 1979.17</PARA>
<PARA> The tribulation of a slowing rate of productivity growth is not new. Mr Reagan's Republican predecessors were similarly preoccupied: compare Mr Nixon's 'comprehensive national crusade' to increase productivity of 1972 with Mr Reagan's marginally less felicitous 'great national crusade to make America great again'.18 But the United States is peculiarly afflicted in comparison with its international competitors. From 1973 to 1977, it had the lowest rate of growth of productivity of any of the five large industrial powers-lower than even Britain's.19 Productivity growth rates have been decelerating in all the largest industrial countries; only in the United States has the level of productivity actually been falling. </PARA>
<PARA> The structural changes in employment and output also make it less likely that the strictly industrial part of the economy can bring about a new boom. For even within the sector we have called I, 'industry'-defined as manufacturing, construction, and mining-is far from dominant. We might describe industry, in this sense, as sector IA, and a sector IB as being composed of all other I-sector activities: transportation, communication, utilities, wholesale trade and finance, insurance and real estate-what could be described as 'industrial services.'</PARA>
<PARA> Sector IA, on this definition, accounts for only 48 per cent of I-sector output (35 per cent of total output in I and II) and 63 per cent of I-sector employment. Sector IB has by far the highest output per employee of the three sectors: $30,400 in 1979. In sector IA output per employee is relatively low, at $16,300. Over the entire postwar period, productivity in this sector increased at about the same rate as productivity in IB. (Within IA, however, output per employee in manufacturing has increased 1.3 per cent per year from 1973 to 1979, while output per employee in mining and construction fell substantially.)</PARA>
<PARA> Here again, international comparisons are interesting. Of the five major industrial countries the United States has the lowest proportion of its civilian employment (public and private) in the equivalent of sector IA; 30 per cent in 1978, compared to 44 per cent in West Germany, for example, or 38 per cent in Britain. Once more, the United States is less industrial, in this sense, than Sweden. The positions are the same if we look at manufacturing alone: the United States has less than 23 per cent of its total civilian employment in manufacturing, compared to 35 per cent for Germany, 27 per cent for France, and 25 per cent for Sweden.20</PARA>
<PARA> How welcoming is this environment for Mr Reagan's economic policy, founded as it seems to be in the hopes of industry, of sector IA? The industrial sector is easily surpassed, in employment, by sector II; it is surpassed in total output and in output per employee in sector IB. Only the most prodigious expansion of industrial production, therefore, would suffice to invigorate the entire economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Consider, for example, the consequences of a more dynamic industrial performance in the 1970s. Let us double the 1973-1979 rate of growth of output per employee in sector IA-0.615 per cent per year-keeping all else constant, and call this hypothetical dynamic economy D-growth. In this outcome, 1979D output per employee in IA would be $16,913 instead of the actual $16,275. But the total growth rate of output per employee would have increased only to 0.261 per cent per year; just the same, in fact, as under our earlier hypothetical outcome (1979N) where employment in sector II grew at no more than its 'normal' historic rate. </PARA>
<PARA> Or imagine the transformation that would have been required in IA in 1973-1979 to shift the private economy not to a paltry 0.2 per cent annual growth rate in output per employed person but to its historic rate, for 1947-1973, of 2.055 per cent per year. Such a shift, with conditions in the other two sectors held unchanged, would have required an increase in IA output per person employed to $22,297 in 1979S (outcome S for superdynamic). This would imply an annual growth rate of over 6 per cent from 1973-1975S: more than twice the historic growth rate of output per employee in this sector, and ten times its actual growth rate. </PARA>
<PARA> A 'supply side' enthusiast might answer to these considerations, that the recent emphasis on traditional industry is no more than political rhetoric; that the Republicans once in office will care not at all whether their economic recovery comes about in sector IB, sector IA, or sector LXXXIV. Supply-siders-like their opponents and mirror-images, the 'demand-siders' or Keynesians-are unconcerned with the real industries and workers and technologies that constitute an economy. They prefer to live among the abstractions of economic theory and economic politics, whether of 'supply' and 'expectations' or of 'effective demand.'</PARA>
<PARA> But the primacy of traditional industry, of IA, is not easily ignored. If the economy were to expand in sector IB, employment would be unlikely to increase fast. And the characteristic behaviour of IB corporations-immense semi-public utilities, bus companies and truckers, financial corporations, AT&amp;T- is hardly that of the sensitive, even skittish entrepreneurs, the investors in new factories and equipment to whom the Republican policy is addressed. Yet if growth of output and employment continues to expand in sector II, then the present problems of inflation and low productivity growth will be compounded. </PARA>
<PARA> There seems a very reasonable chance, in sum, that the Republican inspiration will not bring about rapid, noninflationary growth and increased productivity; that the spirit, fizzling rather than blazing, will not be equal to the constraints of domestic structure and international recession. </PARA>
<PARA> The Reagan program in these conditions is likely to be wildly inflationary. And the military spending to which the new government is committed will exacerbate such tendencies. The Republicans do not discuss the economic consequences of remilitarisation; nor are they likely to, given their conviction of the priority of defense, which transcends the banal calculus of economic costs and benefits. But the military boom of 1981 is likely to bring all the problems of previous expansions with few of their benefits. The two periods of greatest military expansion were both times of rapidly accelerating inflation. Thus the Korean War boom began in 1950, when inflation was 1 per cent; in 1951 inflation was over 8 per cent. The Vietnam War-related military boom began in 1966, when inflation was less than 3 per cent; since then, inflation has averaged 6 per cent per year.21</PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, the employment effects of increased military spending will be dampened in the 1980s by the overall structural changes in the economy. The 'defense products industries' are only a minor subdivision of our sector IA: together they employ fewer workers than they did in 1967, and only a third as many people as are employed in eating and drinking places. The Defense Department employs less than two thirds as many people, military and civilian as it did in 1967, and its purview is unlikely to increase.22 Does Caspar Weinberger want more civilian bureaucrats? Does the Middle East Rapid Deployment Force want more quartermasters, or more missiles?</PARA>
<PARA> The proposed military expansion seems organised to maximise the economic costs of defense and to minimise its economic benefits. It, will favor nuclear missile 'systems,' submarines, planes, and other 'big ticket' items. But spending of this sort requires large numbers of scientists and engineers and construction workers; it requires relatively new manufacturing workers. The MX missile system, or a substitute costly project, would provide some employment, and inflation, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, it would also provide considerable inflation and employment for low productivity construction workers in Utah and Nevada. But it would not provide jobs for unemployed steel workers. MIRVed experimental missiles are not bolted together in assembly lines. </PARA>
<PARA> What will the Republicans do if their policies lead them into higher inflation and unbalanced budgets? Their most likely recourse will be to the conventional conservative remedy of recession. The old conservatism represented in the Reagan cabinet by Mr Regan and Mr Weinberger has its acrid but available medicines: control the money supply, increase taxes (or limit tax cuts), hack with ever greater frenzy at nonmilitary government spending. There is a recent precedent for the repression of neoconservative exuberance. Mrs Thatcher came into office determined to cut taxes and inspire the ''spirit'' of British entrepreneurship, but has retreated to the purest policies of victory through recession. </PARA>
<PARA> Such conservative orthodoxy could bring about the second great danger of the Reagan economic policy, namely a collapse of employment throughout the economy. The 1970s seem to have confirmed the experience of the postwar period, that employment in sector II is immune to the vicissitudes of the business cycle. Employment in services and to a lesser extent in retail trade changes, on this view, according to a long-term growth path. And the recent dominance of sector II employment has indeed been countercyclical in just this sense. From 1974 to 1975, employment in sector I fell by 2.4 million jobs; employment in sector II increased by 0.5 million jobs. Similarly during the recession of 1980. From July 1979 to July 1980, employment in I fell be 1.3 million jobs, while employment in II increased by 0.8 million jobs.23</PARA>
<PARA> But there are reasons to doubt whether the resilience of retail and services employment will continue into the next one or two recessions of the 1980s. First, because services employment has not in the past been immune to cyclical declines, if the cycles in question are sufficiently great. Second, because there may be special characteristics of the new employment which make it particularly vulnerable to the special recessions which lie ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> The ominous precedent is 1929-1932. The 1920s were a period of rapid expansion in the equivalent of sector II: trade and services together accounted for 77 percent of all new private employment from 1920 to 1929. But many of these jobs were lost after October 1929. From 1929 to 1932, employment in retail trade declined almost as much as did employment in the entire economy, and employment in services also declined substantially. In some services-particularly frivolous ones, like hotels and ''amusements''-employment declined even more than it did in the economy as a whole.24</PARA>
<PARA> It is also plausible to suppose that sector II employment will be particularly vulnerable even to milder recessions in the 1980s. This is so, above all, to the extent that the next recessions will be accompanied by cuts in civilian government spending. One apparently ''recession-proof'' sector, state and local government, has already been affected. This sector accounted for over 40 percent of all new public and private employment in 1973-1976 and less than 10 percent from 1976-1979. And other retail and service activities may be affected directly and indirectly by spending cuts. Each of the ''Big Three'' employment-intensive industries of the 1970s could be vulnerable to a combination of recession and government cutbacks. </PARA>
<PARA> The expansion of employment in eating and drinking places seems to be closely linked to long-term trends; more people live alone (and are far more likely to eat out than are ''multi-person households''); more women work (and families with working wives spend more money on eating out). But output in eating and drinking places is also sensitive to changes in real per capita income; it stagnated in 1959-1961, for example, and also in 1973-1974.'' In the next recession, this sector might behave like the ''frivolous'' services of the early 1930s. People might treat eating out, even eating hamburgers, as an amusement and not a necessity. There could also be an adverse multiplier effect having to do with the long-term demographic trends. If a recession in the 1980s led to lay-offs of women workers in such ''feminine'' activities as local government, health services (and eating places themselves), then the demand for meals might contract further. </PARA>
<PARA> There might also be tendencies within the eating and drinking industry which will affect employment. Productivity growth in eating places was much less rapid in the 1970s than in the 1960s, but might increase again. Large chains-notably in fast food-are particularly adept at labor-saving innovations; the pre-frozen portions automatic frying baskets; and continuous flow broilers which transform cooks into unskilled materials handlers. A recession could lead to the bankruptcy of small restaurants (and even small fast-food chains), and a concentration of employment in more efficient operations. Will the deserted Burger King (or Milkshake Queen) be as common in the 1980s as the closed-down gasoline station of the 1970s?</PARA>
<PARA> The boom in business services is also a consequence of persistent trends. Corporations now contract out jobs such as copying, data processing, mailing, cleaning. This is to some extent a function of technological change and the onward march of the division of labor: business uses more data processing, for example, and specialized companies are efficient providers of computer services. But it is also related to social trends. Large corporations may find it easier to send out copying and bring in cleaners; their suppliers are obliged to manage part-time and temporary workers, many of them women. </PARA>
<PARA> Business services depend none the less on the overall business environment. In a recession, corporations could retrench, compelling their own employees to do more photocopying, and cutting back on temporary help. Here again, there are small and perhaps vulnerable companies, and many vulnerable short-time employees. There could also be a further multiplier effect, in, for example, the ''personnel supply'' establishments which provide temporary workers for other business services. </PARA>
<PARA> Medical services seem the most inexorable of the three big industries. Americans are getting older and they show few signs of wanting less health care; they are not less sick in a recession. Private health services (which employed some 400,000 people in 1929 compared to five million now) were scarcely affected by the collapse in employment in the 1930s.26 But medical services are also among the private industries which will be most hurt by reductions in civilian government spending. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Richard Schweiker (R-Pa), the Secretary-Designate of Health and Human Services, has announced an assault on ''abuse'' in Medicaid, and has said that Medicare could save money if more people were looked after at home. His colleague Senator Pete Domenici (R-NM), the incoming chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, agrees that ''nothing's immune-indexed programs, entitlements, the whole works.''27 Such budget cutting could affect employment in all the private activities which have grown up around the semi-private health care system: for example in the million-employee ''nursing and personal care facilities'' business. Here too, as in other services, there are small companies which might go bankrupt. And there are four million women workers, who unemployed might return to unpaid cooking, cleaning, and nursing: the reverse multiplier once more. </PARA>
<PARA> The Reaganites are probably right to be preoccupied with an economic ''spirit.'' Marx conveyed the theatrical and irrational character of capitalist inspiration. The Cambridge economist Nicholas Kaldor once criticized Schumpeter's tendency to explain economic growth by recourse to a ''stage army of entrepreneurs''; he too conceded the importance of what Keynes called the ''animal spirits'' of investors. </PARA>
<PARA> But the conservatives are dangerously wrong when they invoke an old spirit-''the spirit . . . still there''-and old American industries. For changes in the structure of the American economy have brought equivalent changes in expectations, in the structure of entrepreneurial spirits. </PARA>
<PARA> The growth of employment in what we called sector II corresponds to persistent social and economic tendencies. At a superficial level, we can see that the economic booms of the 1970s were related to the multiple ''crises'' of American society: eating places and the crisis in the family; business services and the crisis of the corporation. But the expansion of sector II also has deeper origins. </PARA>
<PARA> Two of the essential institutions of modern capitalist growth are intimately concerned: the system of reproduction of the labor force, and the corporation. The family, it seems, is increasingly incompetent to sustain the reproduction of educated, healthy workers. Women's work is multiplied by the isolation of small families; women themselves join the commercial labor force; many work for the small fly-by-night companies of sector II. These problems are exacerbated by the demographic tendency toward an aging population. In 1968, 9.6 percent of the American population was over 65; in 1978 the proportion had increased to 11 percent.28 And most elderly Americans-unlike Donald Regan (sixty-two), Caspar Weinberger (sixty-five), William French Smith (sixty-two), Ronald Reagan (sixty-nine)-are not chosen for well-paid and respected jobs; many are consigned to the ignominy of ''personal care facilities'' and the declining family. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, the corporation is faced with two different assaults. On the one hand, it is ill suited to fulfilling the new needs of the labor force for familial and other services. On the other hand, the sector I monolith of Alfred Sloan's imagination is equally unsuited to employing part-time and temporary workers, young people, old people, and women. </PARA>
<PARA> These problems are by no means unique to the United States. Sector II-type employment is increasing throughout the advanced industrial world, although different countries have arrived at different patterns-for replacing the extended family with public or private employment, with the welfare state, or with nursing homes and fast-food restaurants. Mr Reagan's conservative nostalgia for an old industrial spirit is itself not new: he echoes the hopes of (ill-fated) conservatives in two other sector II countries-Thatcher in Britain and Falldin in Sweden. </PARA>
<PARA> The capitalist solution, in the long term, will be a new entrepreneurship to ''industrialize'' sector II. Certain service activities will become far more mechanized; others will be detached from the retail and service sector and reattached to sector IA. We can see the outlines of this process in the electrostatic frying baskets of the fast-food industry, or in the instant meals, the panglandular biscuits of Brave New World. In medical services, there will be more institutions like the Swedish hospital for long-term care, with a swimming pool and comfortable cafeteria, but where the patients were sent to bed early because there were too few staff to keep the facilities open. </PARA>
<PARA> The industrialized service economy may be dismal. It will evoke capitalist spirits of a different sort: vicious feminine entrepreneurs, Frederick Winslow Taylors of the kitchen and the hospital. The transition to a humane post-sector II economy is in some respects the most profound political problem for progressive governments in Europe or, some day, in the United States. </PARA>
<PARA> But in Mr Reagan's America, the transition may be cruel in another sense. For it may require the convulsive decline in employment to which we pointed earlier: the disintegration of the existing sector II. The employment boom of the 1970s in the United States was extremely odd. The US is historically far more brutal, in its ''normal'' levels of unemployment, than are its main competitors. In the 1960s, average unemployment was over three times as high in the US as in Japan, West Germany, or France. In the 1970s, however, unemployment rates increased far less in the US than in these other countries (except Japan). By 1981, unemployment rates in France, West Germany, and Britain will be five times their 1960s levels, but less than twice their 1960s level in the United States.29</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Reagan's initial economic policies are unlikely to bring the high productivity, noninflationary growth he seeks. His next set of policies-his next economic emergency, not for Inauguration week but for a recession months or years from now-may lead back to even higher levels of unemployment than were previously accepted. The employment expansion of the 1970s, of the Carter year, was bizarre: compassionate, androgynous, not characteristically American. There may be far worse to come. </PARA>

<PARA>13 OECD, Labour Force Statistics, 1967-1978 (Paris, 1980). By ''services'' we understand, for the United States, activities within the US industrial classification ''services'': hotels; personal services; business and repair services; amusements; health, educational, and other professional services. This definition is, of course, much narrower than one which includes under ''services'' all activies which do not produce goods. </PARA>
<PARA>14 Here and in what follows employment figures are taken from Employment and Earnings, as above. Output figures for the private nonagricultural economy, in constant 1972 dollars, are from the Department of Commerce's series ''Gross National Product by Industry in Constant Dollars,'' Survey of Current Business, May 1980 and July 1979, Table 6.2; and The National Income and Product Accounts of the United States, 1929-1974, Statistical Tables (Department of Commerce, Washington, D.C., 1977), Table 6.2. The national income and product accounts are in the process of being revised; published figures are used here. It is worth noting that the measurement of productivity in service activities poses very serious problems, and that the derivation of price deflators for different industries also requires stalwart assumptions. </PARA>
<PARA>15 Our illustrations, and the ones that follow, are not of course intended to be realistic. Similar calculations using total hours worked instead of number of employees, although no more realistic, would yield broadly comparable results. Thus output per hour worked in a hypothetical 1978N, where hours worked increased from 1973 to 1978 in the same ''normal'' sectoral proportion as in 1949-1969, would yield an increase in output per hour worked of 1.278 percent per year from 1973 to 1978N, as compared to the actual 1.120 percent. Figures for hours worked are from Survey of Current Business, July 1979, Table 6.11, and The National Income and Product Accounts, op. cit., Table 6.11. </PARA>
<PARA>16 Several well-known studies minimize ''shift'' effects. Thus Edward Denison (''Explanations of Declining Productivity Growth,'' in Survey of Current Business , August 1979) suggests that the shift in hours worked to services had ''trivial'' consequences in 1966-1976; he concludes that most of the decline in productivity in 1973-1976 must be attributed to a negative ''residual'' to be loosely identified, presumably, with the regress of knowledge. An OECD study of seven countries, using more recent data, also concludes that sectoral shifts in employment had little effect on growth of output per employed person. (''Sectoral Shifts and Productivity Growth,'' in OECD, Economic Outlook, Paris, July 1979, pp. 28-35.) But this study groups services into a compendious sector of ''other activities'' which also includes such high productivity and high productivity growth industries as communications and finance, insurance and real estate.

<PARA> Last week Reagan referred to America as 'this once great industrial giant'. Two days earlier General-Motors, the dominant corporation in America's emblematic industry, had announced that in 1980, for the first time since 1921, it lost money. Chrysler probably now has more debts than assets: a negative net worth. Reagan also referred to the second symbol of American industrialism: steel. But golden arches, not blast furnaces, are becoming the symbols of American enterprise. Today McDonald's has more employees than United States Steel. This 'once great industrial giant' used to make big locomotives, big Buicks. Now it makes Big Macs. </PARA>
<PARA>The Economist of 3 January 1981 pointed to the phenomenon that in the years 1970-76 when 9 million new jobs were created in America, 6 million were added by small businesses, while there was no net increase at all made by the 'Fortune 1,000' companies-that is, the thousand companies with the highest annual turnover. </PARA>
<PARA> Retreating from the global scene and the American picture back to Australia, this has to be said: Compared with other technologically advanced nations, Australia appears to be mildly retarded. To our national disgrace we have cut back on essential investment in research and development so that our per capita spending each year is only a miserable proportion of expenditure in the United States, Japan, Britain, West Germany and France. We have the worst informed legislature in the world on scientific and technical matters, lacking the resources or the intellectual vitality to initiate a national debate on where we are going or how we are getting there. We have thrown away priceless intellectual capital, partly through the brain drain and partly through the criminal wastage of human resources in our school systems where 70 per cent of students drop out of our state schools after the compulsory minimum leaving age is reached. We have gazed blankly into the middle distance as our school system fails to meet the needs of students themselves, of society or the economy generally. </PARA>

A century ago Australian States were among the first places on earth with compulsory primary education. We did not have a Commonwealth then. No one would claim we are world leaders in education now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the 1980 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development economic survey on Australia, this country ranked fourteenth of the 23 nations listed for educational retention rates for young people aged 15 to 19 years. Turkey and a few other countries in the Third World were behind us. The Williams Committee of Inquiry into Education, Training and Employment 1979 found that in New South Wales, 17 per cent of 15-year-olds were not able to read or could only read 'at a level below satisfactory comprehension of simple passages' and a further 32 per cent were reading 'at levels of comprehension below the competence required for a fully literate adult life'. That 49 per cent would have had its supposed basic training in literacy under the Government of Sir Robert Askin. By the time the Labor Government came in under Neville Wran, it was too late to change the situation. However, 49 per cent of 15-year-olds have defective literacy. Similarly the Williams report confirmed that overall about 25 per cent of school leavers lack sufficient competence in reading, writing and numeration. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously we have lost the capacity to feel shocked by these appalling figures. The debate on the Williams report in the House of Representatives in 1979 lasted less than 30 minutes. There were two speakers-the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden). The debate was then adjourned and never resumed throughout the life of the Thirty-first Parliament. That is appalling. </PARA>
<PARA> Our abject failure in educational planning points up the class and regional biases in our education system. The urban middle class-articulate, influential and affluent-has access to superior education and has little interest in the under-achievers. The urban and rural classes lack the motivation, skills and fight-back capacity and their children are the victims of our system. But educational failure is not just visited on the children of the poor. It has national significance as well. Just as some primitive peoples, the anthropologists tell us, failed to grasp the relationship between sexual intercourse and pregnancy, in the same way the economic and social Neanderthals who run our nation see no connection between the nature and quality of education generally and the capacity to innovate and develop new forms of enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA> In the United States during the last fortnight I have been looking at high technology industries. It is no accident that the two geographical areas of the greatest technological innovation with the largest number of new firms created are in the Santa Clara Valley, generally called Silicon Valley around Palo Alto near San Francisco, and in the Waltham area on Route 128 west of Boston. Boston has probably the greatest concentration of intellectual capital in the world, including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard University, Boston University and Brandeis University. It is no accident that Hewlett Packard, Polaroid, Honeywell, Wang, Prime, Digital and many other high technology industries are set up in the Boston area. Similarly, Silicon Valley, with Intel, Fairchild, Xerox, Jacquard, National and Kennedy, has an umbilical link with Stanford University and the University of California at Berkeley. These high technology industries have also been highly dependent on the stimulus of government funding largely through defence-based work. The growth of high technology industries in Texas, Minnesota and Colorado, but in not too many of the other 50 States, has depended on three elements: Government funding, the presence of universities, and a solid and expanding intellectual base. </PARA>
<PARA> In Australia we put far too much emphasis on the raw material to be dug out of the ground and too little on that found beneath the skull and between the ears. We have been told often enough that we are in an internationally competitive race but the Fraser Government has failed to grasp the extent of the prevailing economic and technological revolution. We have missed the bus in the computer industry and we will be non-competitors in biotechnology unless we initiate national policies now. However, we have also failed to grasp that new technologies are not, on the whole, large employers. Of course, in their infancy they have high growth rates as employers but as total employers computers and biotechnology will not be large relative to the value of their output. Biotechnology will largely make products and carry out industrial processes which are in substitution for existing products and processes and not in addition to them. But they will have significantly lower inputs of labour, capital equipment, energy and raw materials. They are prodigious producers but small employers. Unfortunately, while there are rich rewards for being first or second in developing key industries so that the world's markets can be penetrated and won there is absolutely no advantage in being eighteenth or thirty-second in line. There is a mixture of comedy and pathos in current British attempts to 'get with' the micro electronics revolution while Sir Keith Joseph explains to bankers why they should invest in microtechnology, 15 or 20 years too late. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of urgent measures must be taken and they must be taken by the thirty-second Parliament. First, it must stop and reverse the winding down of public education and provide opportunities for working class children. Second, it must encourage the development of intellectual capital for its own sake and wherever it leads. Third, it must double public investment in research and development in the life of this Parliament. Fourth, it must set up an office of technology assessment as has been done by the United States Congress to provide independent arm's length advice to the Parliament. Fifth, a joint parliamentary committee on science and technology should be set up. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) has done me a service by drawing attention to some of the problems facing this country. It is a matter of very great regret that the solutions which he proposes to the problems are the same tired, old Australian Labor Party solutions. I ask honourable members just to recall what those solutions were. Firstly, there was increased expenditure on public education; secondly, increased public investment in research; thirdly, the establishment of yet another government department to solve some of these problems; and, fourthly, the establishment of another parliamentary committee. It is a matter of great distress to me and to people on this side of the House that the Labor Party cannot sit down for once and think about what free individuals can do by using their initiative.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is on that general matter that I wish to make some remarks tonight. I do so because the Governor-General's Speech provides an opportunity for a government to state its objectives and programs for the next three years. But it does more than that. It provides an opportunity for the Government to state its philosophy and its basic principles and it provides an opportunity for honourable members of this House to say where they stand in regard to that philosophy and those principles. It is not in pinpointing the problems where I would disagree with the honourable member for Lalor. It is the solution to those problems and the philosophy that a government should adopt as it sets out to solve those problems. I wish at the outset to refer to the Speech of the Governor-General where he mentioned a society which maximises the rewards of individual effort and initiative and which also respects the right of individuals to shape their own lives. I refer also to the Speech of the Governor-General where he had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA> During the life of this Parliament, therefore, my Government will be making a serious and sustained effort to explain to the Australian people the philosophy on which it bases its approach to governing-a philosophy which it sees as liberal in its principles, flexible and undogmatic in its application of those principles to the realities of Australian life and conservative in its distrust of abrupt and sweeping changes as a means of achieving desired ends. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the Government's philosophy and it is a statement of the Government's position on the most basic question that any government should ask itself and which it should keep asking itself while it remains in government. The question is this: Should a government be concerned above all to control, to regulate, to manage and to provide or should it be concerned to allow the individual the maximum freedom to determine his own life, not only in economic or commercial activities but also in every area of human endeavour. It is the latter proposition which is the Government's philosophy and it is the latter proposition which is my philosophy. When Sir Robert Menzies surveyed the sorts of problems that the honourable member for Lalor was looking at tonight he said: 'The right answer is to set the individual free'. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1949 the right answer was to set the individual free and that answer remains the right answer today. It is not a changing proposition but a permanent principle. It remains the correct solution today because basic principles of philosophy never change. The policies may change, the minutiae of implementing the policies may change but the basic principle remains the same. The basic principle-the principle to which this Government subscribes and the principle to which I subscribe-is that the right answer is to set the people free. If the Labor Party would think for a moment about that solution it might find a more ready and more practical solution to some of the problems to which the honourable member for Lalor was drawing attention tonight. But one may ask: Why should this principle be endowed with so much virtue? It is because governments are trustees. Governments are trustees of power and that power is given to them by the people. In the context of the present taxation debate the Government is a trustee of the people's money which is given to it.</PARA>
<PARA> Governments have no power that they can assume as of right. They have no more power than is temporarily entrusted to them by the people. Free people do not surrender their freedom to a government. They give on trust a limited power to govern in the interests of the people and the power to perform only those functions that individuals cannot perform themselves. Like many trusts the power surrendered can always be withdrawn and no government should forget that. Those are principles to which the Federal Government subscribes. But like all governments this Government needs to be encouraged to stick to those principles. It needs to be encouraged to put them into practice. The more demands that we in this House make on the Government to increase its activities, to involve itself in more and more activities that can well be left to the individual, the more we make it harder for the Government to subscribe, to carry out and to practice this highly desirable principle and philosophy upon which it is based. </PARA>
<PARA> My speech is concerned firstly with making a plea and, I hope, giving some sort of encouragement to the Government to put its philosophy into practice; to put into practice the philosophy that was set out so clearly by the Governor-General in his Speech. Secondly, I hope that I can suggest some areas where a more principled approach can be taken. I will give several examples of this sort of thing. One such example is poverty. We have heard a lot about poverty in recent times and there seems to be a lot of very well-meaning people studying the question of poverty, quite often at our expense. Undoubtedly, there is some poverty in Australia. Poverty will remain as long as the poor are encouraged in their poverty. The more mendicancy that a government encourages the more it will encourage the permanent poor to remain exactly that-the permanent poor. </PARA>
<PARA> One can give many examples of this process. We find that in the last Budget $139m was appropriated for welfare housing alone and $109m for rental housing. Without getting into an argument with members of the Labor Party about this, I simply ask them to consider these questions: Should we continue with this sort of scheme and this sort of expenditure? Should we be encouraging the poor to remain poor? Should we be encouraging the people who need welfare housing to continue to need welfare housing? Should we encourage people, as we do in so many of these programs, to be dependent on the State and to remain dependent on the State? By providing money for rental housing, should we continue to encourage people to remain tenants, whether of the Government, if the Government owns the housing, or of a private landlord, it matters not. So long as we continue to provide funds of this sort, so long as we encourage medicancy, we will encourage people to remain in exactly that state. If we give people some encouragement to lift themselves out of that state, if we given them some encouragement and incentive and reward to acquire their own homes and to leave that state of being a tenant and a mendicant, then they will prosper and benefit from that encouragement. </PARA>
<PARA> One could go on to consider the whole area of social welfare payments. One could stand here all night and go through them one after the other. Of course, those payments are made available from the very best motives. This Government has the highest of motives in its concern for the poor, for those who are in need of social welfare payments. But we must stop occasionally and think about the proposition that the more people who are eligible for social welfare then the more this mendicant attitude is spread throughout the community, and encouraged to spread. The only way to stop destroying the society in that way is to encourage people to stand on their own feet and rely on their own initiative and self-help. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another broad area in relation to government solutions to problems which we should occasionally stop and think about, to consider just where we are going and whether we are acting consistently with the basic principles and basic philosophy to which we subscribe. The area to which I want to address some few remarks relates to the way in which problems are solved today. Too often it seems that we fall into a pattern. The first stage of the pattern is that we isolate the problem, as the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) did earlier this evening. Secondly, we appoint an inquiry to investigate the problem and try to find some solution. Thirdly, and I regret all too often, our solution is to establish a government body to control the problem. Then we appoint an advisory body to advise the government body that is doing the controlling, and so the pattern goes on. That is not the way to solve the sorts of problems that we have been highlighting tonight. It is not the way to solve those problems permanently. </PARA>
<PARA> Too often we completely ignore a different and, I would suggest, better approach; that is, to leave the problem to natural forces and the activities of free men and women, who through their own efforts and activities and initiatives can solve so many problems which we seem to think, with our intellectual arrogance, can be solved only by government bodies, only by the sort of bureaucracy that the honourable member for Lalor earlier this evening said he wanted to establish and even expand. Let us think about it for a moment. The inventiveness of free men and women gave us the great inventions of history, took us through the age of enlightenment, the Renaissance, the Industrial Revolution. Surely those forces of freedom are still powerful enough to solve the sorts of problems that today we think can be solved only by government bodies and government bureaucracies? Surely there is enough initiative and incentive still there, enough motivating force to make the society better and stronger? It is there. All we have to do is tap the efforts of individual free men and women. </PARA>
<PARA> A further step in this evolution to which we should address ourselves is the establishment of government bodies to perform what in many cases are very worthwhile functions. Those bodies have a natural tendency to become permanent. They become monopolies. In many cases they cost enormous amounts of money. I regret to say that in many cases they are unsuccessful in solving the problems they have been set up to solve. Of course, in many cases they run at an enormous loss. What is the result of it all? The result is that the problem is not solved, the society becomes no better, but the free men and women who go to make up the society and who create the wealth are called on to pay even more in taxation, to give up even more of the wealth that they create in order to keep this machine going. Unfortunately, in many cases, all that is to no avail. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, one could stand here all night and detail examples of this, but let me give just one. I was privileged to read recently the annual report of the Australian National Railways Commission, which no doubt is a very worthwhile body performing a very worthwhile task under difficult circumstances, with the combined tyrannies of distance and the railway unions. In those circumstances the Commission probably gets by quite well. It is interesting to read the Commission's accounts because they provide a frank illustration of the way in which some government bodies approach their tasks. Towards the end of the report it is stated that the operating loss for the year ended 30 June 1980 was $64m. Under that entry another item states that the Commonwealth subsidy to meet the operating loss was $58m. The net loss, and this is the miracle result, was only $6m. This government bureaucracy-I do not mean that in a pejorative sense, but it is a bureaucratic area of government-with the stroke of an accountant's pen has converted a loss of $64m into a loss of $6m. That is a remarkable effort. The report should be sent to the archives of the Cambridge University as an extraordinary contribution to human knowledge. </PARA>
<PARA> What would happen if this were a private body? What would the shareholders say? What would the people who invested their money in it say on finding that their organisation had suffered a loss of $64m? They would be horrified and the organisation would probably go out of business. But that is the approach, and as a government, because it is a government responsibility, we must make it plain to the Australian people that, in a way in which I think at the moment they do not understand, there is an enormous difference between private enterprise and public enterprise. It is hard to engage in business, hard to start a business, hard to get a job in business, hard to keep that job, hard to get a market, and hard to make a profit. In the public sector the market is there, the work is there, the job is permanent, and the superannuation is extensive. We must understand that here is the nub of the whole problem. We must get back to an understanding of what really makes the world go round. If I have a serious criticism to make of the honourable member for Lalor-I hope in a charitable way-it is that he and his colleagues in the Labor Party do not understand that there are people who have real needs which can be met by their going out and working, that people have aspirations, both material and otherwise, which they can achieve and want to achieve. They want to achieve those things by going out and fighting for them themselves. It is unfortunate that the Labor Party's solution to this sort of problem is not a solution that can be found in the real world. </PARA>
<PARA> In the few minutes remaining to me I will list a number of courses we can follow. I cannot speak about them at length, but each of them is worth while considering. In the first place, we can encourage free men and women to make more of their own decisions about their own lives and about how they use and dispose of the wealth they create. I repeat that it is free men and women who create wealth; it is not governments that create wealth. Secondly, all of us in this Parliament, both on this side of the House and on the other side, can cease our demands on government to solve our problems, to involve itself in more areas where we believe governments can solve problems. Thirdly, we can be compassionate, and compassion at all times, to those who cannot help themselves. We can help those who really need help and assistance. Above all, we can put the emphasis in social welfare on need and provide help only to those who need it. If we do not follow that principle then every taxpayer, every individual man and woman in the country, will suffer. If they do not receive the social welfare benefits they will pay for them through their taxes. Fourthly, we can keep government expenditure down by exactly that means. We can continue to examine the areas of government expenditure and find economies. If we do that everyone will benefit-every taxpayer, every man and woman in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Fifthly, we can continue in particular to lessen the tax burden of individuals. One must praise the Government for its achievements already in the taxation area and must encourage it to continue with reforms in that area. Obviously, as the Treasurer (Mr Howard) has said-it is the basic point he has been trying to get across and I believe he now is doing so successfully-there cannot be substantial reductions in the rates of personal income tax levied unless there is a substantial reduction in the amount of money that the Government spends. That is a simple proposition and one which people must learn to accept. Sixthly, we can continue our scrutiny of public expenditure and of public involvement in all areas. If we do that we will find new areas which, probably with the best motives in the world, have been taken over by government but which, nevertheless, if they were returned to the private sector-not just to private companies but to private efforts, to personal initiatives of free men and women-would benefit every Australian and our society and country would be even greater. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listened with interest to the attitude towards society expressed by the honourable member for Diamond Valley (Mr N. A. Brown). It occurred to me during his speech that the slogan for Government members will be the word 'free', without definition, without substance and without understanding. The massive social welfare payments reflect the Government's inability to promote a more egalitarian society, to provide a society which offers work for all who want it, to ensure that the cake in Australia is more equitably distributed, and to promote personal initiative and concern for others and not just exploitation. Free men and women need equality of opportunity if that sort of situation is to occur.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I enter this Address-in-Reply debate to support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Kent), particularly those sections of it which refer to the Government's failure to respond to record levels of unemployment and to reduced and falling family living standards. Earlier in the evening I was pleased to hear the distinguished honourable member for Chifley (Mr Armitage) make reference to the problem of youth unemployment in his electorate. I shall refer to youth unemployment and the Community Youth Support Scheme. Initially, I mention a matter to which I am sensitive, not only as a politician but also as a medical practitioner. It is a matter which requires sensitivity. Such sensitivity is not shown by this Government when it concentrates on its macro-economic policies with no regard for human beings. I refer to a paper published in the Australian Family Physician, Volume 9 of December 1980, at page 845 and entitled 'Unemployment and the mental health of adolescents'. It is an article which would bear reading by anyone with the slightest streak of compassion. Here I can only give the essence of what is said in the paper. The author, Dr Robert Kosky, starts with the following Australian Bureau of Statistics statement:</PARA>
<PARA> On 1 February 1980, there were 442,400 people registered as unemployed in Australia. One-third of them were aged between 15 and 19 years. </PARA>
<PARA>I doubt whether any honourable member would deny that the figures would be higher now. So one-third of the unemployed people are adolescents. The author states:</PARA>
<PARA>In adolescence, the two major psycho-social tasks are the establishment of independence and the consolidation of a sense of personal identity. It should be clear that unemployment can cut directly across the accomplishment of both these tasks. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet his further comment could be that, despite unemployment being the major social phenomenon of the past five years, there has been negligible research into its effects on mental health. An inability to demonstrate a capacity to support oneself independently is a shameful experience for young people. The author goes on to discuss intelligently what flows from that and the social debt being amassed for the future. He emphasises that this major social phenomenon largely has escaped careful psychological, social and political analysis. Surely a knowledge of the social and political effects is a matter of concern for this Parliament; yet there is no Government appreciation of that. The author's concluding statement is that the social consequences of the group bonding developed between unemployed young people have not yet been fully appreciated and that social disturbaces of a violent type may result. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that about one of the basic concerns of youth unemployment, let us turn to the Government's record with the Community Youth Support Scheme. In my electorate I have supported that scheme since its inception, although I believed it to be just a band-aid measure; but band-aids do provide comfort for a time. However, I must admit, having watched the scheme in operation, that I can see such a scheme with wider guidelines, even when economic circumstances are better, being of use as a meeting point, as a guiding agency for young people who are not sure where they are going. </PARA>
<PARA> In November 1980 the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) expressed his Government's commitment to provide youth employment through various schemes, including the Community Youth Support Scheme. I questioned the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr Viner) on this, asking him whether it meant the provision of new finance for new schemes, extra project officers where need was demonstrated, administrative assistance, et cetera. I did that on 4 December. The Minister's reply to the House was over long and I had to read it to see whether there was substance in it. There was none. There was no commitment whatsoever to the scheme. In fact, on searching the Minister's Press releases, I found that his last Press release on the Community Youth Support Scheme was dated 2 January 1980, when he announced an additional grant of $1.6m. I should think that the fact that only one Press statement was issued in some 14 months or so shows that a high degree of concern or interest is not held by that Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> On 3 December 1980 I placed on notice a question directed to the Minister regarding the scheme. I received his reply, or rather his non-reply, on 9 February 1981. Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to have a copy of that question which sought details of the Community Youth Support Scheme and of the Minister's answer refusing to answer incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House and the Minister for Education (Mr Fife), who is at the table, for their courtesy. It is impossible to go through those statistics in speaking, but I assure the House that they show substantial figures in various areas. Despite the fact that the last date available at which the figures were broken down by age is 28 November, I am sure that honourable members will be able to project the numbers now that the school leavers have hit the lists. The Lalor-Epping-Thomastown Unemployment Scheme has been operating for the last couple of years. If honourable members look at the figures in the tables they will notice that that Scheme has a very heavy load of young unemployed. Late last year the operators of the Scheme applied to the State committee for an extra project officer to do further outreach work with the young unemployed. The application was supported by the Scullin electorate committee and me. I believe that the operators of the Scheme have been advised informally that the application has been refused, not because of lack of need but because of lack of finance. This is despite the Prime Minister's commitment to provide finance for these schemes. In fact, I understand that, if another Community Youth Support Scheme project in Victoria should happen to fold, the Lalor-Epping-Thomastown Unemployment Scheme would get an extra project officer. But this would depend on another project folding, not on a new initiative. So much for the Government's support in that area!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the last year it became evident to me that in the Bundoora-Watsonia area there was not only a substantial overt youth unemployment situation but also a great deal of hidden youth unemployment because of a certain perception of social status. A well-attended public meeting was held at which an interim committee composed of concerned citizens, clergymen and school careers officers was set up for the purpose of establishing a new Community Youth Support Scheme project. Those concerned with that committee, some of whom were not necessarily convinced of the numbers of unemployed when they joined the committee, found that the extent of the perceived situation was worse than had been at first thought. However, the extent could not be clearly defined without a formal structure being set up. Application was made to the State committee to set up a CYSS project. I also supported that application. The State committee recommendation went to the Minister last week. No formal answer has been received. Once again, there is informal information that the request cannot be acceded to. Once again, this is not because of the lack of a substantial case for the need to help these young unemployed but because of lack of finance. Once again, if another scheme folds this project will have a chance of being established by a transfer of finance from that scheme. So much for the Government's expressed intent and concern to help young people gain employment in the community! The concern is only on paper. The action does not occur. </PARA>
<PARA> I had hoped that we might have been able to form an auxiliary with the co-operation of local employers such as operates in the west Heidelberg area which, I think, is in the electorate of the honourable member for Batman (Mr Howe). Last week I called a meeting of what I felt were the 200 largest employers in the electorate, plus school careers officers, social workers and politicians. I asked two Community Youth Support Scheme project workers to tell the story of youth unemployment as they saw it. Of more than 200 employers invited, five attended and there were three apologies. So much for the compassion and concern of local industry for the area from which it gets its custom and makes its living. Can honourable members wonder that I listened to the honourable member for Diamond Valley with some bemusement about the attitudes of free men and women. They are free to do what? They are free to do without work and to starve. They are certainly not getting equal opportunity. So much for compassion and concern! I must, however, compliment the five employer representatives who attended. They have been most helpful and co-operative. They have shown an understanding of the problem. They were not necessarily right on beam but, because they talked to some of the young people and project officers, they gained some understanding. They showed a willingness to discuss and advise and to have the young people and project officers examine the situation in industry just as they were prepared to look at the projects and articulate their problems as well as those of the project officers. Their interest is certainly at a much higher level than that of the Minister. Is he letting the CYSS run down with this lack of concern?</PARA>
<PARA> Another problem in the area, which arose at the same meeting, is the Special Youth Employment Training Program. Young people are trained in skills. The Government subsidises the employers. But what use is this program if fewer than one third of those who take part in it are able to obtain jobs after they finish their stint with a particular company? Once again we have a useless youth training program which does not get down to basic needs. That substantially covers some of the aspects of the problem of youth unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA> In rounding off my discussion of that subject, I return to my first proposition, that the young unemployed-these in the 15 to 20 age group-are adolescents in their formative years. It is a time in which their niche in society is stamped and shaped. Unless we show concern and compassion, future governments will face very grave problems. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish now to refer briefly to a campaign conducted throughout Victoria in January with regard to emergency relief. It showed clearly that most people who required emergency relief were receiving social security benefits. Thus, emergency relief was being used to subsidise pensions, not to meet real emergencies. Unfortunately, government members who knew about this campaign, in which some of the employees of the State social welfare department were concerned, complained to the State Minister because those officers showed compassion. That is disgraceful. We had better take a look at our emergency relief programs to ensure that they are true emergency relief programs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to have the opportunity tonight to speak in the Address-in-Reply debate to the speech by His Excellency, the Governor-General on the occasion of the opening of the Thirty-second Parliament. Last October some 76 per cent of the people in my electorate voted to support this Government. They voted to maintain the basic thrust of the policies that have been followed over the last five years. I quote the words from His Excellency's speech:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These policies are designed to work for the well-being of all Australians and to develop a society which maximises the rewards of individual effort and initiative, and which also respects the right of individuals to shape their own lives. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish this evening to devote my time to what I regard as Australia's greatest national resource, the Murray River basin. It has been claimed by some historians that River Murray problems, which were already claiming a good deal of attention from about 1880 onwards, accelerated the advent of Federation in 1901. Conflicts between the States were then developing on the use of River Murray water for irrigation, to the possible detriment of navigation requirements in the river. These sorts of interstate problems were cited as examples of the type of impasse which the proponents of Federation sought to overcome. Therefore, from the earliest days of its existence the Commonwealth has manifested an interest in River Murray matters which reflected a realisation that water conservation and associated land development, based on the river, would eventually be of national importance. It also reflected the Commonwealth's concern for interstate trade implications relating to water borne traffic. Over many years numerous proposals have been put forward for multi-government control of the River Murray. Many noteworthy meetings, in which the Commonwealth took part, were held to explore the development of practical formulae for that purpose. Among these was the meeting in 1902 of the Interstate Royal Commission and the interstate conference of engineers, held in 1913. Agreement was finally reached in 1914. Enabling legislation came into effect in 1915 and the River Murray Commission was established in 1917. It is now time that the Commonwealth Government and the States sought to remove the other barriers that threaten the long term viability of this nation's most valuable asset. Of course, pre-dating these long and involved discussions, by millions of years, were even more involved natural processes of land formation. These resulted in much of the Murray Valley being created on a former sea bed. The underground salt content of this part of the Murray Valley remained more or less dormant until it was activated by substantial increments being made to the underground water table as a result of irrigation development in recent times. It is obvious that these geomorphic facts will determine fundamentally the extent to which salinity problems in the Murray Valley can be mitigated. All evidence seems to suggest that at best we will have to develop strategies for coping with these problems. Economically, and perhaps technically, we cannot hope to overcome them completely. </PARA>
<PARA> The question, then, is what can realistically be done and should be done to solve the problems inherent in the complexities of Murray River water usage. Because of its importance to the economy of the region and indeed of Australia, the River Murray must continue to be a source of irrigation and of industrial and domestic supplies but, short of duplicating its supply function at a prohibitive cost, it will also have to continue to be a drain for run-off from the catchment. After all, that is part of a river's natural function. However, it must be done without the connotation often associated with drains. We have to ensure that the quality of the run-off is maintained at an acceptable level for human consumption and other beneficial uses along the river. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1979, when for the first time the Commonwealth Government clearly enunciated its water policy, it identified as one of the cardinal points of its strategy for assisting the States to deal with their immediate water problems, the encouragement of management practices which would reduce trends towards the deterioration of water quality and associated land resources. At the farm level this objective may be slowly being achieved as a result of recent amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act, which have liberalised concessions for income tax assessment purposes in respect of on-farm investment in water conveyance and storage. This will encourage the installation of irrigation systems which reduce excess watering, a factor contributing to high water tables. Hand in hand with these measures will go the financial support available for on-farm improvement of farming practices and management. It goes without saying that the best way to keep salt out of the river is to put as little as possible into it. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to mention, in regard to the improvement of salinity levels by farm practices the problem that some of us are having in north-west Victoria and southern New South Wales in relation to a government duty on the importation of lasers used in land levelling. My colleague, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) and I have been endeavouring for some time to have the Government re-assess a regulation which restricts the importation duty free of laser land levelling equipment. Lasers are being used effectively in the rehabilitation and improvement of layout of irrigation farms. A Queensland manufacturer has claimed that he can produce lasers which can be used for this purpose but his claim cannot be substantiated. Agricultural work requires a rotating laser, unlike the fixed lasers used in construction which have no application to agriculture. Despite requests by land owners, these manufacturers have not been able to supply the needed lasers or even to provide a test demonstration. At present some 200 lasers, at a cost of some $15,000 to $20,000, are being used in northern Victoria. This gives some idea of the expanding use of these new methods. I therefore ask the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Moore) to reassess the duty that is placed on lasers in an endeavour, in one way, to reduce the salinity in our River Murray system. </PARA>
<PARA> At government level, Commonwealth assistance to the three States for salinity control and drainage works in the Murray Valley and support for a new River Murray Waters Agreement to take account of water quality in the river are further clear manifestations that this objective is being pursued, but not, however, with the vigour commensurate with the seriousness of the problem. Proposed changes to the River Murray Waters Agreement provide a suitable mechanism for resolving the conflicting functions of the river. </PARA>
<PARA> One particular aspect of the proposed new agreement to which I would like to draw the attention of the House, and which I believe is at the heart of the resolution of this conflict of functions, is the particular new responsibility proposed for the River Murray Commission; namely, the formulation of water quality objectives and, where appropriate, standards for various parts of the River Murray, and to make recommendations in respect thereto to the governments concerned. I think the successful results of this are indicated by the fact that already a water quality monitoring program has been instituted by the River Murray Commission to provide data essential for the improved water quality management of the river. This program, which comprises about 32 stations located on the main stem of the river and the lower ends of the tributaries, has now been running for two years. In addition to salinity, some 20 other water quality parameters are being measured. Whilst they are probably less critical than salinity, a number of other water quality characteristics of the Murray are of concern and need to be monitored. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe there is a means for seeking the active collaboration of the States in undertaking action where it is appropriate in all aspects of man's activities in the region which could influence these objectives. As we recognise, these activities could be hundreds of kilometres from the river and in such varied fields as forestry, industrial development and agriculture. It is obvious that the utmost goodwill will be required from the three States and the Commonwealth because the matters to which I have referred have a very real potential for influencing water quality objectives or standards and are completely State constitutional responsibilities. Implementing the River Murray Commission's recommendations on water quality may require the States to take a broader national viewpoint rather than one confined to their own sovereign interests. </PARA>
<PARA> It is sad to say that to date evidence of such a response has been disappointing. I mention one example of where it has been most disappointing. It is in the New South Wales Government's policy of continuing to grant diversion licences on western flowing streams which enter the River Murray basin. Despite the fact that the South Australian and Victorian governments have asked for a moratorium on the issue of these licences, whereby some many thousands of hectares of land have been put under irrigation, or have been recommended to be put under irrigation, the New South Wales Government has not placed a moratorium on the issue of licences but rather it appears to be anxious to grant as many water licences as possible before the new powers for the River Murray Commission are ratified. At a recent public meeting in Mildura a senior officer of the Engineering and Water Supply Department of South Australia stated that during the months of October, November and December 1980, 28 per cent of the Murray River salt load entering South Australia originated in the Darling River. I am pleased to see the honourable member for Hawker agrees with me. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This letter, from the Premier of New South Wales, states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . only 2 per cent of the salt input comes from New South Wales, with 98 per cent reaching the river from Victorian and South Australian lands. </PARA>
<PARA>I think this indicates the parochial attitude being taken by some of the State governments towards solving some of these major problems of the Murray Valley basin. I must stress that in carrying out its water quality responsibilities the River Murray Commission will have only the power of persuasion. Legal sanctions have not and never have been suggested to enforce compliance with the Commission's recommendations. To date, the collaboration of the four governments in the implementation of the River Murray Waters Agreement has been a single example of co-operation to the mutual advantage of all concerned. It is likely that the proposed new water quality responsibilities for the Commission will quite likely rise to intrastate and interstate conflicts of interest, thereby generating pressures on the goodwill established over the past 60 years of the Agreement. I hope sincerely that governments rise to the occasion, despite the complexity of the task they have set themselves of agreeing to water quality responsibility for the River Murray Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, progress towards a new agreement has been slower than anticipated and I am looking forward to finding out details of the progress that is supposed to have taken place in a recent meeting between Commonwealth and State Ministers. The River Murray Commission does not have the broad constitutional framework necessary to enable it to handle effectively all water quality problems in the basin. I hope the Commonwealth and States make considerable progress in dealing with these matters on a bilateral basis outside the Commission's charter. We are all aware that the Maunsell report, commissioned by the four governments, recommended a series of works and measures to help cope with immediate problems but I think we all should recognise that the Maunsell report only established priorities for those projects already proposed by State governments. That committee was not asked to, nor did it, attempt to investigate proposals considered to be of a more long term nature. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to be concerned about and recognise the fact that the River Murray system is being used beyond its capacity in a situation which reverses its natural flow, resulting in a conflict between storage operational procedures to give maximum irrigation benefits on the one hand, and to mitigate flooding on the other. There are demands for more water for irrigation, with a corresponding potential for further river bank erosion and irreversible damage to the natural river environment. Many of these conflicts are predictable consequences of controlling natural processes. Land salinisation, waterlogging, river bank erosion and the impairment of water quality with associated social and economic implications are some of the results of these conflicts in water and associated land uses. Urgent steps are necessary to avoid these serious threats to Australia's most productive irrigated region and its most successful closer settlement venture on a national scale. Priorities have to be given to works and measures which have as their main objective the consolidation of existing urban and rural settlements, the protection of existing infrastructure and the stabilisation of existing rural enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA> Our four governments and their departments need only the will to support a significant national project and make a commitment. All of us can visually assess the damage caused by piecemeal remedial measures that transmit the problems of one district to another. We have to ensure measures to prevent the factors that seriously threaten the important ecology of our region, that contribute to saline drainage water entering the river and that restrict an adequate minimum flow for the length of the Murray necessary to prevent high salinity levels. In the past Australia has responded well to developing its natural resources. A series of reports have been made by highly competent people. There is no doubt that lack of action has overtaken many proposed measures considered satisfactory at the time. However, one thing is obvious in most of the reports. They have all been conducted with restraints. Sometimes it is political restraint, sometimes it is financial restraint and sometimes without sufficient scope for inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw attention to the environmental statement of stage 1 of the Tyrrell scheme. This inquiry is restricted to overall river improvement because the objective for the proposed works is to control any detriment to river quality attributable to works under construction in the Shepparton region. It is restrictive for financial reasons because, despite the alternative of piping water to the ocean receiving acceptance, it has not been recommended. It is also restrictive because understandably it has been assessed relative to proposals for the possible transmission of saline water to Tyrrell at a later stage. Throughout its history the Murray Valley has made a very substantial contribution to the economic development of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, and of course to Australia at large. River water quality, particularly in respect of salinity, has become a key factor in the long term utilisation of this nation's most important water resources. </PARA>
<PARA> The answer to the questions addressed by me tonight and by many others in the past depend on many complex factors. However, there is a clear willingness on the part of all concerned to examine closely all the factors significantly affecting river management. I believe that there also has to be a clear willingness on the part of all governments involved. I have no doubt that, in the current climate of awareness of the delicate balance within the ecosystem of the region, the River Murray will remain the lifeline of the river system, carrying supplies from its vast storages for the efficient rural industries and urban centres in the valley. It will remain as a drain for a productive hinter-land. I hope that it will always be an ever renewable delight for the tens of thousands of Australians who return to the river for relaxation and recreation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Governor-General's Speech emphasises the coalition's continuing commitment to conservative philosophy and programs. This commitment has as its basic principles firstly a commitment to private enterprise or market economics and, secondly, a limitation on the power of government. With these basic commmitments the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) links the Australian Government's political and economic philosophy with those of conservative governments in the United States, Britain and a number of European countries. The Governor-General, in his Speech, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But my Government does believe profoundly that it is vitally important that the power and functions of the State should be limited and contained. It does believe that the State is likely to be in many ways an inefficient and wasteful provider and that many services can be better supplied in other ways. And it does believe that the expansion of private enterprise is the best means to achieve the well-being and health of a society. </PARA>
<PARA>The philosophy which is implicit in the Governor-General's Speech was dealt with at greater length in an address which I understand was read by Senator Chaney on behalf of the Prime Minister in Adelaide on 5 December. In that speech Senator Chaney set out not only to argue-I believe it is an important argument-for Liberal philosophy but also to put a case for the new conservatism. Towards the end of the speech there are a number of propositions which are described as being central to the new conservatism that the Prime Minister apparently espouses. I want to refer to each of the four principles which are set out. The first one reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is concerned to maximise the degree to which people have control over their own lives and their own resources. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The second one reads:</PARA>
<PARA> To this end the Government is concerned to limit the role and reduce the power of the State, and as part of that to restrain taxes and to contain public expenditure. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The third one reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is committed to supporting and strengthening the private enterprise system in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>The final one reads:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . in an age of turbulence and innovation, the Government is concerned that the process of change shall be a deliberate and considered one and that those things which . . . Australians value highly are not lost or damaged in the process. </PARA>
<PARA> It appears to me that there is nothing particularly new about the so-called new conservatism to which the Governor-General's Speech refers and which the Prime Minister so strongly espouses. No doubt the reason for expressing these sentiments was a certain feeling in the Australian electorate that there was very little congruence between these values, particularly the values about democratising society and giving people greater control over their lives, and the somewhat authoritarian, arrogant conduct which is so often associated with this Prime Minister. Nevertheless, I believe that the propositions which have been put forward are worthy of examination and ought to be examined by this Parliament. Too little do we take ideology seriously within the context of this Parliament. Too often do we admit that the views being expressed have an ideological basis and a reference to traditions and philosophies which go back in history. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer particularly to the first proposition put forward in that summary; that is, that the Government is concerned to maximise the control of people over their own lives. It is suggested that the institutions which might limit that are government, bureaucracy, the unions and corporate power. What is common to each of these institutions is that they are all ordered in a thoroughly hierarchical way. One might ask a question about the institution of government and address the question to the Prime Minister. Has the Prime Minister sought to make government more responsible, for example, to his own party? To what extent has he sought to increase the power of the members of the back bench to make his Government more reponsive to the views of people within his party? To what extent has he or his Government sought to make its activities more responsive to the interests of the Parliament? To what extent has the Government sought to encourage debate to see that the policies and programs developed are tested in this chamber by vigorous debate? To what extent has his Government sought to produce its policies and programs, regarding the Parliament itself as irrelevant?</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that if we answered those questions we would have to answer that this Government has not been particularly sensitive either to the party process or to the needs of the Parliament to be involved in debate about its policies. We cannot forget that this Prime Minister was associated, in his own intervention and in his own drive for power, in debasing this institution by the means he used. One might ask: Where are the proposals of this Government for parliamentary reform, proposals that might have opened up the Parliament itself and the policies it is debating to wider scrutiny and wider analysis? What reforms have been introduced for the committee system of the Parliament? What opportunities have been provided for people to be involved in investigating the issues which face this nation? I would not suggest that this Government has been strong on reform of this institution, although Mr Speaker has made a number of suggestions. </PARA>
<PARA> One could ask similar questions in relation to the bureaucracy. If the Prime Minister is concerned about the removal of hierarchical arrangements and the involvement of people in the control of their lives, to what extent has he sought to introduce reform within the bureaucracy which serves the Government? Again I think one would have to answer the question by saying that there have been no significant proposals for reform of the bureaucracy which would make that bureaucracy more sensitive or responsive to the Parliament, make it more sensitive or open to public opinion or introduce elements of industrial democracy so that workers had greater control over their lives. I believe that if one examines the record of both the Government and the Prime Minister with respect to those institutions one will find that there has been no movement towards achieving less hierarchical forms of social organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been no initiatives with respect to the trade union movement either. The fourth institution referred to by the Prime Minister as representing a problem in this respect is the corporations. Indeed one would have to argue, if one looks at those speeches in their context, that the corporations are not seen as a significant part of that problem. The problem is seen essentially to be not in the corporations, which are to be delivered from bureaucracy, but in the government or the state. I believe it is here that we get some clue as to the essence of conservative philosophy. The state must be restrained because it operates as a countervailing power to that of the corporations. It is these corporations which, in Liberal philosophy, must be untrammelled. They are no longer, apparently, the robber baron enterprises that they may have been in the nineteenth century, but they are seen in Liberal philosophy as civilised institutions working to improve the material conditions of the people. Their problem is that they have been too fettered by government, which competes for resources and would seek to limit the range of their freedom. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I focus my attention on the subject of unemployment, in particular on youth unemployment as it relates to a particular resources development area. For years now, we have been told that there will be a resources development boom. I wish to address my remarks to what has been the totally ineffective approach by the Fraser Government to public investment in the future of this great country. We have had five years of trying to justify the need to cut back on public expenditure. We have not heard from this Government of the need for public investment. Because of its philosophical and ideological approach to free enterprise, this Government has created a mentality in the community which, by its very nature, will seriously retard the development of this country. The community has been encouraged to believe that the unemployed are the cause of their own situation. The education system has been blamed for the number of unemployed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn now to deal with some of the realities that honourable members opposite would like to ignore to suit their ideological position. As an example of what is being contemplated, let us have a look at the situation in southern Victoria. Let us have a look at an area in my electorate of McMillan which takes in some of the brown coal areas of the Latrobe Valley in central Gippsland. The Gippsland region is going through a period of accelerated industrial development. It is now one of the three important growth areas in Australia. Its importance equals that of Gladstone in Queensland and the Hunter Valley in New South Wales. More than $8 billion worth of projects have been announced or foreshadowed. There are more in the pipeline. These include the State Electricity Commission's Loy Yang project. This is one of the biggest projects, if not the biggest project, in the Southern Hemisphere. There are to be large extensions to Esso's installations in Bass Strait. Proposals have been announced to extend the plant of the Australian Paper Manufacturers Ltd at Maryvale, right in the heart of the Latrobe Valley. There are proposals to build pilot plants to produce solvent refined coal and brown coal to oil in the near future. At this time, the Public Works Committee of the Victorian Parliament is being asked to report by the end of June as to whether the next stage in the Victorian State Electricity Commission's proposals should go ahead at Driffield. This proposal is to build another power station in my electorate. It will be bigger than the Loy Yang project. Heavy demands, therefore, will be placed on the training facilities and on colleges of advanced education to provide the skilled labour which will be required to build these projects. </PARA>
<PARA> The Latrobe Valley has developed into an area of national significance in which a range of educational resources must be part of the fundamental infrastructure. This is the paradox: In the five years of the Fraser Government, we have been bombarded with the ideology of free enterprise. We have been told that the Government must make room for private investment. I should like to highlight the result for our young people of this approach. Government spokesmen, with all their ideological rhetoric, have convinced many parents that their sons and daughters should grab the first job which becomes available. This has created a situation in which many highly intelligent young people are opting to take jobs which do not require higher education qualifications. The State Electricity Commission in Victoria now has a group of apprentices with the highest qualifications on record. Students with Form 6 standard education are taking apprenticeships in preference to continuing to complete their education. This pressure from the top down is creating further unemployment than would be the case if more of our young people could confidently go on with their education. What a tragedy this is for this country. In five years from now, the State Electricity Commission will have a work force which will be totally dissatisfied with its employment. Young people with ability should be encouraged to continue with their education. They should not be placed in the position of taking the first job which comes along. This Government has cut back the allowances for those eligible under the Tertiary Education Allowance Scheme. It has cut back expenditure on education to the stage where we are facing a resources development but we will have no skilled tradesmen to carry out the necessary work. At the same time we have a group of unemployed people who have little chance to get any jobs available. Since the election in 1980, the Government has announced that there will be cuts in the unemployment benefit rate for 16 and 17 year olds. This shows that the Government has not learned its lesson. It intends to attack the problem from the wrong position. I urge this Government to realise that this country will not develop unless we train those people who are required. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last year, the Government introduced legislation in an endeavour to protect a section of the petroleum industry, namely, the service station proprietors of Australia. At that time there was a fair amount of cynicism in relation to that legislation. Some of that cynicism still remains. Some people believed quite firmly that the Government did the right thing but others believed that there was no way to stop the manipulation and to stop some of the movement within the oil industry. There have been many reports within the oil industry and there have been many moves to overcome some of the problems of which we have all been aware.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Coming to Canberra from Sydney today by aeroplane, after talking to a group of service station proprietors who are still in a difficult situation in relation to their survival in the industry, I read the Sydney Morning Herald. It is not my intention to criticise or run down anybody. As honourable members are aware I never do that. I read a report in the finance section of the Sydney Morning Herald which was headed: 'Sir Walter's last shot at price ''manipulation'' '. I will read a few paragraphs from this article. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Sir Walter Leonard fired yesterday a parting shot at what he termed the 'political manipulation' of Australia's petrol pricing mechanism. </PARA>
<PARA> Sir Walter, who stepped down as chairman of Ampol Petroleum after 10 years in the position, said State Governments were not prepared to fall in line with the Prices Justification Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> He said petrol pricing had been a political football throughout his 43 years in the oil industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Sir Walter added: 'The difficulty today is that we don't know what sort of football we are playing. </PARA>
<PARA> 'It used to be Australian rules, but it seems to be a combination of that and some foreign game introduced to this country. </PARA>
<PARA> 'I suppose the tentacles of government are felt in many industries, but I would suggest nothing to the extent that happens in the oil industry. </PARA>
<PARA> 'Over the last few years the oil industry has been subjected to the most detailed investigation by the Federal pricing authority and other Government agencies on no less than 16 occasions'. </PARA>
<PARA>I say to Sir Walter that the oil industry deserved being subjected to those investigations. </PARA>
<PARA> I am afraid that some of the things that occurred in the last 20 years as a result of the manipulation by the oil companies are things of which this country should be ashamed. I refer to the thousands of decent respectable Australians who have endeavoured to earn a living within that oil industry but who have been manipulated by the oil companies. The trouble is that petroleum giants and the executives who work within this industry seem to forget one fundamental point. Their industry and their businesses were built up by the efforts of people working within that industry. Those people have toiled for years to make the oil companies as great as they are today. Unfortunately, because of this manipulation these people have not been treated as part and parcel of the oil industry. Many of these people have lost their livelihoods. Many of them have lost everything that they put into their business enterprises. This Government and previous governments allowed that to happen. How could a person compete when he could not buy the petrol for the price for which other people were selling it? It is a simple fundamental. That is the sort of thing that went on for many years. For over 10 years the people of Victoria, because of the petrol discounting that took place in that State, were able to buy their petrol more cheaply than retailers in the other States were selling it for. That is the sort of thing that was allowed to go on. In fact, the people in the rest of Australia were subsidising the people of Victoria. We all stood by and allowed that to happen. I could quote many instances of this sort of thing but I do not have the time to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> I would just like to say to Sir Walter that unfortunately he has stepped down as Chairman of Ampol; he has had a critical shot at this Government and other governments; he has had a critical shot at the people employed in the industry but unfortunately he should have had a good look at himself and the other oil company magnates. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday we learned with dismay that the Australian Broadcasting Commisson Showband which is stationed in Melbourne and which is one of Australia's most successful orchestras was slashed in half by the ABC. Sacked members were told that lack of funds was the reason for their dismissal. The ABC Showband has a long list of successful engagements to its name and indeed is a credit to Australia. It is in fact the only one of its type in the Commonwealth. However, the Fraser Government now, through its total choking of funds, has finally carved into the creative heart of this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Why only half the band has been sacked is a mystery. Is this the end of the whole orchestra? All the arrangements have been made for the full band. So what happens now? There is no money for any new arrangements. May I remind honourable members that several years ago the Sydney Showband disappeared in much the same way. Does the Fraser Government, through the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair), intend to strangle the ABC totally? This Government should be assisting and encouraging the creative people of this country-not only musicians but also actors, artists, singers, dancers, directors and producers, just to name a few, to fulfil their talent and develop an artistic culture that is sadly lacking in Australia today. Instead, just about all the creative bones of this country have been shattered. </PARA>
<PARA> This is just another example of this Government's treatment of its own employees. By imposing Dracula-like legislation on its own public servants and setting staff ceilings in many government departments such as the Commonwealth Employment Service, this Government is hindering people in their effort to achieve full time employment. The youth of this country especially is suffering. </PARA>
<PARA> The entertainment industry cannot hope to succeed if the government of the day does not assist and financially encourage it through government funding. Tax concessions announced by the Fraser Government at the last elections do not solve the many problems existing in the entertainment industry today. Too often private individuals are left to cream off profits while the creative heart of Australia is slowly driven into the ground. Why do so many young Australians go overseas in an attempt to extend their talents? This country has never looked after its creative people, and by handing out a few dollars through taxation benefits this Government is perpetuating that situation-a situation that has existed under conservative coalition governments for 28 of the last 31 years. </PARA>
<PARA> The ABC Showband is one of Australia's foremost orchestras. It has a wonderful reputation. It has given many thousands of people hours of enjoyment and now it has been slashed in half. As I said before, does this mean the end of this great orchestra? I sincerely ask the Government to look at this situation carefully and, if lack of funds is the real reason, to supply those funds to the ABC to keep this wonderful orchestra operating so that many more hours of enjoyment can be had by the many thousands of Australians who appreciate its music. We cannot allow orchestras such as the ABC Showband to be slowly eaten away never to appear again on the Australian scene. That is exactly what will happen if this Government does not take steps to rectify the situation. I urge the Minister for Communications to do something about this situation and to look immediately at the position in which the ABC Showband finds itself. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A constant complaint being made by the Australian business community, especially the small business sector, centres on what seems to be the increasing burden of responding to government requests for statistical and other business information. This paper burden has been documented in part by one of its major generators, the Australian Bureau of Statistics. A survey of small business enterprises conducted by the ABS indicated that the perceived cost to small business of completing government forms during 1978 was $215.3m, representing an average cost of $604 for each small enterprise. Of the total cost, 80.5 per cent was attributable to paperwork originating from the Commonwealth Government, 18.3 per cent to paperwork originating from State governments, and 1.2 per cent to paperwork originating from local government authorities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am pleased to say that the Federal Government for its part is at least aware of the problem. In March last year the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch) announced that all Commonwealth departments and authorities would be reviewing the paperwork requirements they impose on the business community with a view to achieving a reduction of the paper burden. This announcement flowed directly from the ABS survey and a related interdepartmental committee study of the matter. This on-going review is welcome and it is to be hoped that further reductions in government paperwork result. I say 'further' because in fairness the ABS, as stated in its 1979-80 annual report, is also very conscious of the need to minimise demands upon the business community for data. However, business complaints about the paper burden continue unabated. </PARA>
<PARA> The small businessman especially feels himself inundated with goverment questionnaires asking for information so obscure that he as a proprietor does not possess it, nor in his opinion ever needs to possess it for the efficient and profitable running of his business. To obtain from what the businessman's point of view is needless and irrelevant information, involves considerable time and unproductive effort and incurs costs most small businesses can ill afford. What is more, business is subject to a penalty if it fails to comply with an official request for information. </PARA>
<PARA> I certainly recognise the need for any government to collect information in order to provide a consolidated data bank from which to assess current policies and for use as a basis for formulating new initiatives. However, to attempt to strike a balance between meeting increased demands for official statistics and minimising the reporting burden on business of ABS collections, it is my suggestion that businesses should be paid for completing ABS and similar questionnaires. I think it is quite reasonable for a government to recompense enterprises for the time and effort spent in supplying requested information. Such recompense, set at realistic and appropriate levels, would offset business costs incurred completing questionnaires. But more importantly, the requirement to pay for business information will properly discipline the ABS and other collecting authorities to request only that information that is considered vital to national data collection. I will be placing this suggestion before the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Moore) and the Treasurer (Mr Howard). I sincerely trust the Government will give this matter the consideration it deserves. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;An article on the front page of today's Australian Financial Review reports that IBM Australia Ltd plans to locate its Australian-New Zealand head office in the Sydney suburb of West Pennant Hills. IBM is reported to have acquired 65 acres in that suburb at an estimated cost of around $5m. IBM's plans to consolidate its administration and management under one roof are said to involve an expenditure of around $20m for a development which will cover 4,500 square feet. Clearly that is a large investment in urban land. It is a proposal for office development which would have an enormous impact on Pennant Hills or the Hills district of Sydney and eventually on a large part of the Sydney metropolitan area. This development would affect location, employment, population densities, housing prices, traffic flows, business location decisions and the provision of infrastructure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Because of the large scale impact of such an investment decision it needs to be planned within an urban policy framework consistent with the Sydney outline plan of 1968 which, of course, was again revised in 1980. It is an arrogant act on the part of IBM-one of the world's largest transnational corporations-to assume the right to determine the shape of urban development in the Sydney metropolitan area and to make such a huge investment decision without the approval of the appropriate public authorities. What astounds me is that IBM has the arrogance to think that it can get a change in land zoning in such an area where there will be a great deal of sensitivity, particularly involving those people living in that area. It is true that the central business district of Sydney and North Sydney is over centralised to a point of inefficiency. This overcentralisation has created gross inequalities in relation to access to jobs and cultural amenities for those people in the western suburbs of Sydney. A move of private sector and public sector office space to the suburbs is a desirable thing and should be encouraged but it should not be undertaken without prior public planning or without an urban impact assessment. It certainly should not be undertaken in West Pennant Hills. </PARA>
<PARA> We should be striving to develop sub-metropolitan nodes within the metropolitan area of Sydney such as at Parramatta, Campbelltown and Penrith. We should be striving to organise the urban public transport services which will connect those nodes. In my view a sensible place to establish that area would be at Penrith, at the foot of the Blue Mountains. The cost of land and dwellings in the Blue Mountains is the lowest in metropolitan Sydney. It is a pleasant place in which to live and certainly it would fit in with the outline plan of Sydney. For far too long market forces have been determining where these areas of development should be located. In Sydney this plan to determine where these areas should be developed has been in operation since 1968. We have not only been over-developing the central business district of Sydney but also the cultural facilities and job opportunities. If this company worked in with the State Government, local government and the Australian Government this would be a progressive move. </PARA>
<PARA> I talked to the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Macphee) who is sitting at the table. He represents the Government. This is a foreign corporation. It so happens that this Parliament has control over the investments of foreign corporations. It can say to such a foreign corporation: 'Yes, we want your investment in real estate development but at places where it will be in the interests of the Australian community, and in the interests of a rational development of a metropolitan area'. Certainly, a place like Penrith would be a rational development. But to choose a place like Pennant Hills is a stupid and arrogant decision. I am surprised to see such arrogance appear on the front page of the Australian Financial Review. If such an investment is allowed at this stage it would be against the best interests of planning. I believe there should be strong opposition to this development not only in West Pennant Hills but also all over metropolitan Sydney. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I want to draw the attention of the House to a new form of industrial disruption which is being aided by the Government of New South Wales and which is massively affecting the coal industry, particularly in my electorate, along with other industries involved in the bulk export of commodities. I refer in particular to the way in which the Government of New South Wales allows levels of industrial disruption to persist when those schemes of disruption do not in effect involve any substantial reduction in the pay of the unionists involved but which bring about enormous disruption to the private sector industries using those facilities. I draw attention particularly to the coal loader at Port Kembla and-if one can call it this-the rail shunters' strike in New South Wales.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the case of the rail shunters' strike, which has been going on for a bit more than three weeks, there is a limitation on the number of wagons which can be attached to a train with the result that the large 20-wagon loads of coal required to make the transport of coal economic are no longer available to coal exporters. The result is that approximately 30 ships are standing off Newcastle costing between $10,000 and $15,000 a day in demurrage. As a result of this strike and the coal loader strike a cost of about $400,000 a day is being met either by the coal industry, other bulk export industries, or the customers. Ultimately that cost will come back to the Australian industries and will be reflected in the capacity of those Australian industries to pay bonuses to the miners or taxes to the Australian community. It seems to me that there is a total lack of recognition by the unions involved, and certainly by the New South Wales Government, of the consequences of this kind of ratbaggery. </PARA>
<PARA> An amount of $400,000 a day is not just lost exports or lost profits that might have been made on exports but it is a direct cost that cannot be recouped in any way whatsoever. Yet the Government of New South Wales-particularly while the by-elections were being held in the Hunter Valley-was not prepared and never has been prepared to stand up to those of its employees who are refusing to work, particularly when the impact of that refusal is not felt by the State Government but by the private sector using those facilities. This is an appalling situation. Equally appalling is the situation in the coal loader at Port Kembla where there has been non-stop disruption for three months. Of course, that disruption does not take place on Saturdays and Sundays when special incomes can be earned for work done on those days. This is what happens: There are wildcat, eight-hour strikes. One shift goes off. The situation is timed so that the tide will not enable the next shift to complete the loading of the bulk carrier. In effect one can have a situation where one eight-hour strike can produce another eight hours of non-production at the expense of the coal exporter, the miner and, in particular, at the expense of the coal truckie. Members of the Transport Workers Union who live in my electorate and whose incomes depend on the capacity to transport coal to the coal loader have complained to me that over the last three months they have suffered a 62 per cent reduction in income. Their fellow unionists at the coal loader do not care a damn for them, for Australia or for the future of the coal industry in general. Instead of standing these people down, instead of confronting them or preventing this kind of ratbaggery continuing, it is appalling that the New South Wales Government has adopted a continually pusillanimous approach. We have the curious situation that once a judge was called in and he said to these coal loader people: 'I will not hear your case until you do some work--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to reply briefly to the comments made by the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Charles). I am in complete sympathy with his sentiments concerning the Australian Broadcasting Commission Showband. I possess a number of its tapes and records which I am sure will be collectors items if indeed that Showband is to be disbanded or reduced in number. I am sure that my colleague, the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair), would respond to the honourable member by saying that it is not a decision for this Government. Over a number of years this government has deliberately kept the ABC as a separate statutory corporation. It makes its own decisions. It can be verified that the Government has given substantial funds to the ABC. If the ABC has chosen to disband the Showband or reduce its numbers, I as a taxpayer and a consumer of its music, would be disappointed. But it would not be a decision of this Government and I am sure that my colleague, the Minister for Communications, would wish me to place that fact on record.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 27 November 1980 Mr Goodluck asked me, as Minister representing the Attorney-General, the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My question is directed to the Minister representing the Attorney-General. By way of explanation, let me say that during the past three weeks I have been approached by concerned parents about the development of religious and other cults in this country. Some of the information conveyed to me is most disturbing and, if I may say so, nauseating. Will the Minister request the Attorney-General to call for an up-to-date report on these religious and other cults in this country?</PARA>
<PARA> The Attorney-General has now supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The activities of some religious cults give rise to concern within the community from time to time and I am asked to investigate them. The view that I have taken is that as freedom of religion and belief is involved the proper way for these matters to be dealt with is by persuasion, discussion and exposure of excesses. Because of these considerations I have not regarded it as appropriate for the Commonwealth to carry out a general investigation of their activities.</PARA>
<PARA> The cults and their members must, however, comply with the law and if there are grounds for believing that the cults or their members have breached the law, this is a matter for police investigation. I should also mention that the power of the Commonwealth to take action is, in any case, limited and the activities of these organisations are primarily matters for State rather than Commonwealth law.</PARA>
<PARA> The subject of religious cults was discussed by the Standing Committee of Commonwealth and State Attorneys-General in October 1979. The Attorneys-General agreed that undesirable activities of cults should be dealt with under ordinary laws governing the community generally, that nothing should be done that might infringe basic religious freedom, but that any particular harmful or fraudulent practices should be identified and dealt with by law.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) It has not been possible to establish whether a TIFA machine (Todd Insecticidal Fog Applicator) was in fact used at Maralinga during the period of the atomic tests there. The TIFA machine, which is normally mounted on or towed behind a vehicle, is designed specifically for the spraying of insecticides. Its operational principle is that the insecticide, dissolved or suspended in a carrier fluid, is first atomised mechanically and then introduced into a blast of hot air and further fractionised. On contact with the atmosphere this material becomes a fog which is dispersed over a wide area.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) While a TIFA machine could have been used at Maralinga for the spraying of insecticides, it is considered unlikely that it would have been used for herbicides, as the nature of the vegetation there is not likely to have required the use of herbicides.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) In the absence of factual information on whether a TIFA machine was used at Maralinga, I am unable to answer the remaining parts of the honourable member's question.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The RAAF B707 aircraft are not operated by No. 34 Squadron, but No. 37 Squadron which is based at Richmond.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the training conducted on the B707 aircraft itself, the training of pilots for Boeing 707 aircraft requires the use of a B707 flight simulator facility for both conversion and refresher training. No such facility now exists in Australia and arrangements have been made for use of the Cathay Pacific Airway's simulator in Hong Kong for the simulator sequences of training for RAAF B707 crews.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The arrangement provides for an average conversion requirement of one crew (2 pilots, 1 flight engineer) per year, the continuation/refresher training of converted crews three times each per year, and conversion of an instructor crew on average every two years.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QS4">Mr Malcolm Fraser</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) Several offers have been made to the Commonwealth to provide at the Government's expense fire fighting aircraft for demonstration or operational purposes. In most cases similar approaches have been made to the State Governments. Precise cost estimates were not provided but estimates of up to $2m were mentioned. Most of these offers have been in general terms and have involved such aircraft as the Canadair CL215, the Douglas DC6, the Neptune, small agricultural aircraft and U.S. or German equipment to convert Hercules transports to a fire-fighting role.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) As a response to representations by a number of parliamentarians and also because of the Government's concern about the tremendous potential of bushfires for loss of life and property and stock damage, I announced on 22 September 1980 that the Government would commission a study by CSIRO to evaluate the effectiveness of using aircraft to fight bushfires. All State Premiers and the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory have agreed to participation by their respective Governments.</PARA>
<PARA> The study does not merely involve, as some have suggested, a demonstration of water bombing. It requires CSIRO to design and implement a detailed scientific evaluation of the effectiveness of bombing fires of varying intensities with water and fire retarding chemicals. This will then need to be compared with an assessment of the effectiveness of conventional techniques under the same conditions. Finally, a cost-benefit analysis of bushfire suppression will be carried out. The study will obtain the quantitative measurements essential to an objective evaluation of the effectiveness of aerial bombing as a fire suppression tool.</PARA>
<PARA> When the time comes for aerial trials to be conducted as part of the study, the CSIRO will call for tenders for aircraft to meet its requirements. The CSIRO is aware of the earlier offers.</PARA>
<PARA> Separately, the Commonwealth has agreed to provide a RAAF Hercules aircraft to the Victorian Government to evaluate a Mobile Airborne Fire Fighting System to be supplied by the US Forest Service in the summer of 1981-82. This will be an extension of the current Victorian practice of fighting fires with small agricultural aircraft and the cost will be shared equally by the Commonwealth and Victorian Governments.</PARA>
<PARA> Apart from the above, the Commonwealth provides financial assistance to the States under the Natural Disaster Assistance Arrangements to assist those who suffer loss from bushfires. It also readily makes available Defence force personnel and equipment to fight bushfires when requested by the States. The value of Defence force assistance was amply demonstrated in recent fires in New South Wales and Victoria, where Defence force personnel, equipment and aircraft gave invaluable support to State bushfire fighters.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) and (2) Herbicides were used by Australian forces in Vietnam primarily for the purpose of reducing vegetation around the perimeter of base areas. This vegetation offered cover to the enemy and thus posed a risk to Australian Servicemen.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The advantages of coal fired ships include:</PARA>
<PARA> Price. Coal is currently a more abundant resource than petroleum. Consequently, prices increases over the life of a ship may be expected to be less for coal than oil. At present, steaming coal is less than half the price per unit energy of fuel oil.</PARA>
<PARA> Pollution. There is reduced risk of pollution of the sea from spillage of ship's bunker fuel because coal, being heavier than water, sinks to the sea-bed. Coal fired ships are subject to the same emission controls as oil fired ships.</PARA>
<PARA> Trade. Use of coal fired ships overseas could result in increased Australian steaming coal exports and Australian coal powered ships would reduce our dependence on imported oil.</PARA>
<PARA> The disadvantages of coal fired ships include:</PARA>
<PARA> Capital Cost. Initial capital cost is about 8 per cent to 15 per cent greater than that of a diesel engined ship, depending on the vessel size and specifications.</PARA>
<PARA> Cargo Capacity. The bunker weight of coal may be two to three times the bunker weight of oil required for the same voyage, resulting in less cargo carrying capacity for the same ship size.</PARA>
<PARA> Bunkering Facilities. Until world-wide coal bunkering facilities are established, coal powered ships would be limited to trades where coal bunkering is available.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. No, but the Department has been monitoring investigations into the economies of coal fired ships. As a simple indication of the current economies, annual bunker savings in the order of $1.5m are possible on a vessel of about 70,000 dwt.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. Yes, facilities for bunkering of coal powered ships on order will be provided at Gladstone, so that the loading of coal bunkers can be carried out concurrently with the cargo handling.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To accurately determine the relative energy efficiencies of different marine fuels it is necessary to take into account the mass of the fuel and the volume required for fuel storage. Thus for each type of fuel, a different size of ship may be required to carry the same cargo over a fixed route.</PARA>
<PARA> However, if energy efficiency is defined to be the energy required to transport a fixed weight of cargo over a specified distance, then coal-fired steam turbine ships appear to be slightly less energy efficient than oil-fired steam turbines and significantly less efficient than diesel-engined ships. Wind assistance, although still under development, has the potential to increase the energy efficiency of coal or oil fired ships. There are no nuclear powered commercial ships operating at present.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (a) Yes, although the $118.7m allocated for project and technical assistance includes a provision for disaster relief, (b) yes, (c) the Development Import Grants were introduced as a new feature of the Australian aid program in 1978-79. A new program of DIGs has now been introduced and will be made available to certain South Pacific and African and Indian Ocean countries.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) No. EFIC's finance facility is designed to assist Australian exporters of capital goods and services by providing finance on internationally competitive commercial terms and conditions. This facility is not designed to compete with the aid/commercial credit loans used by a number of our competitors. In this regard, export credit flows comprising EFIC type loans are not regarded as overseas development assistant by the Development Assistance Committee of the OECD.</PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, a new facility know as the Development Import Finance Facility (DIFF) has been introduced to Australia's aid program this year for use in ASEAN countries. The facility involves the use of aids funds in conjuction with EFIC finance to increase the concessional element in credit terms that Australian firms can offer when tendering for the supply of capital goods and services to those countries. An allocation of $1.6m has been made to DIFF 1980-81.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BU4">Mr Anthony</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for National Development and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I am aware of the provisions of the United States Crude Oil Windfall Profits Tax Act of 1980 as they relate to the disposition if windfall profits tax revenues. Under that legislation, the receipts for fiscal years 1980 to 1990 have been allocated to a number of specific purposes. One of these purposes is the energy and transportation spending program which has been allocated 15 per cent of net oil revenues. Of the remaining 85 per cent, 60 per cent has been allocated to individual and corporate income tax deductions, and the remaining 25 per cent to aid lower income households.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (a) and (b) While the Government does have substantial commitments in the areas of public transport and research and development into alternative fuels, it believes that it is desirable that all expenditure commitments compete for funding on their merits and within the context of the overall availability of funds as determined by the needs of responsible economic management. The Government is not in favour of 'ear-marking' a portion of general revenue measures such as the crude oil levy to particular expenditures. The Federal Government does, however, allocate funds for both public transport and research and development into alternative fuels under a number of separate expenditure programs. In relation to energy research and development, the National Energy Research Development and Demonstration Council (NERDDC) has committed a total amount of $59.7m for expenditure for this purpose, including several projects examining the potential for alternative fuels. In relation to public transport, the 1980-81 Budget allocated $45m for expenditure on urban public transport under the States Grants (Urban Public Transport) Act 1978.</PARA>

During 1981, the International Year of Disabled Persons, particular emphasis is being given to improving the opportunities and choices available to the disabled, in accordance with the Year's objectives of full participation and equality. Aid to the handicapped will be strengthened and a number of special measures to assist handicapped people to play a full part in society have been announced. These include a major campaign to provide work and training opportunities for disabled people, and a program providing aids for daily living. In addition, a national publicity campaign will aim at increasing the community's awareness of the problems, needs and abilities of disabled people.</PARA>
<PARA> The National Women's Advisory Council report, 'My Child was Born Disabled' was tabled in Parliament on 2 December 1980.

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="224" SPEAKER="Sinclair The Rt Hon I.McC." NAMEID="5E4" PARTY="NCP" ELECTORATE="GRIFFITH">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5E4">Mr Sinclair</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (a) Installations in public places</PARA>
<PARA> (i) Proposed introduction of a hearing aid coupler into the new type public telephone</PARA>
<PARA> All public telephones are currently being replaced by a new instrument, the latest version of which will be fitted with a handset incorporating a hearing aid coupler.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) Public Telephones and Public Telephone Booths</PARA>
<PARA> Telecom is currently evaluating various modifications both to public telephone instruments and to booths. The modifications include:</PARA>
<PARA> altering the height of the telephone instrument,</PARA>
<PARA> installing ''drive-in'' telephones,</PARA>
<PARA> modifying full length cabinets to enable access by wheelchair,</PARA>
<PARA> introducing half length cabinets in suitable locations.</PARA>
<PARA> Some prototype units have already been installed for testing purposes in carefully selected protected sites. The provision of any of the modifications on a wide basis will be dependent on the type of facilities required by disabled users in particular geographical areas, and upon the resistance of the instruments to vandalism and mis-use.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Tariff concessions</PARA>
<PARA> (i) Special Rental Rates for products designed for the disabled</PARA>
<PARA> Products designed specifically for use by disabled people for example, the Gliding Tone Caller and the Volume Control Telephone, are rented at a rate which either just covers Telecom's costs or is actually ''below cost''. There is no rental charge for the Hearing Aid Coupler while a Large Number Dial Ring, which assists customers with low vision, is available free of charge from Telecom Business Offices.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) Concessional Installation Rates</PARA>
<PARA> From 1st September 1980, a 20% discount has applied to the installation fee chargeable for miscellaneous items of telephone equipment (i.e., over and above the basic instrument) where this equipment is required in order for a disabled person to adequately use the telephone.</PARA>
<PARA> The granting of the concessional rate is not dependent upon the recipient being the actual subscriber to the telephone service. This means that the parents of a disabled dependent would be eligible, as would a disabled person at his or her place of employment.</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) Waiving of Evaluation Fees for Privately Supplied Equipment</PARA>
<PARA> Before privately owned and maintained equipment can be connected to the network, it must first be submitted to Telecom for examination and the issue of an Authority to Connect. However, should the equipment be designed primarily for the use of disabled people, the fee chargeable for technical evaluation is waived.</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) Touchfone Concessions</PARA>
<PARA> Special concessions apply to a Touchfone where it is to be used by disabled people who qualify under conditions specified by the Department of Social Security. In cases where approval is granted by the Department of Social Security, Telecom waives the additional annual rental while the Department of Social Security meets the once-only charge of $20 and the installation fee.</PARA>
<PARA>Other Telecom planned projects to assist disadvantaged users and which form part of its contribution to the 1981 International Year of Disabled Persons include:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) Release of the Porta-Printer II as a distributorship product</PARA>
<PARA> Porta-Printer II is a telephone typewriter for profoundly deaf people and is available to the public through a private company, Intercept Communications, Camberwell, Victoria. Telecom is to act as a distributing agent for the company as soon as an appropriate agreement has been concluded.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) Digital Display Dialler</PARA>
<PARA> This product has been conceived and designed by a voluntary group to enable access to the telephone network by people with severe upper limb disabilities. It has been field researched by Telecom for user acceptance and the design has reached the prototype stage.</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) Display and Advisory Centres</PARA>
<PARA> During 1981, Telecom will establish Display and Advisory Centres which will be staffed by specialized personnel to provide an improved consultancy service to disabled people.</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) Report 'Disabled People and Telecommunications'</PARA>
<PARA> This report was commissioned to determine the needs and preferences of persons who have a physical disability or handicap with respect to the use of readily available telecommunications equipment, and to quantify the various needs for special facilities by disabled users of the telephone. The report will be released early in 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> (v) Booklet 'Telephone Services for Special Needs'</PARA>
<PARA> This booklet details products available in Australia to aid disabled people in their use of the telephone. It will be available through Telecom Business Offices early in 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> (vi) Information Film on Telecom Products and Services for the Disabled</PARA>
<PARA> A 7 minute film has been produced to give information on the products and services available through Telecom. This film is available on request to interested organisations.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. As foreshadowed in my predecessor's reply to Parliamentary Question (No. 1027, Hansard, 16 September 1976, page 1194) at the request of the Ministers of Labour, the officers reviewed the order of priority previously agreed, and in February 1979, the Ministers agreed to a revised order of priority for consideration of unratified Conventions according to new criteria. Convention No. 107 was allocated to Category B which covers Conventions considered to have good ratification prospects, immediate ratification being precluded by minor legislative impediments or difficulties in one or two jurisdictions only.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Queensland Government has not refused to agree to ratification of Convention No. 107.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZS7">Mr Thomson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Veterans' Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The action taken in respect of each individual recommendation in the Senate Standing Committee report is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation No. 1</PARA>
<PARA> ''Payment of Repatriation pensions be made through the Social Security Department and that the Repatriation Commission be retained to handle the determining of claims, reviews and administration.''</PARA>
<PARA>Action Taken</PARA>
<PARA> After full consideration of the proposal it was decided to take no action on this recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation No. 2</PARA>
<PARA> ''The determination of entitlements should initially rest with a senior statutory officer of the Repatriation Commission specially appointed for the purpose. Initially, he should base his determination on the personal case records including reports from medical officers and all other relevant evidence.''</PARA>
<PARA>Action Taken</PARA>
<PARA> This recommendation was considered. On the first point, after taking into account the views of ex-service organisations it was decided to retain the Repatriation Boards in their present form.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the second point, the Boards have always based their determinations on the personal case records of the veteran including reports from medical officers and all other relevant evidence.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation No.3</PARA>
<PARA> ''Appeal should be to:</PARA>
<PARA> an 'independent Appeal Tribunal' to which questions based on relevant facts will normally be referred. The independent Appeal Tribunal should be appointed by the Governor-General and should consist of three people, one at least of whom should be a qualified legal practitioner, one representing community interests and one by national ex-service organisations; and</PARA>
<PARA> to a judge of the Court sitting alone on questions of law.''</PARA>
<PARA>Action Taken</PARA>
<PARA> The Repatriation Review Tribunal, an independent statutory tribunal to which members are appointed by the Governor-General, was set up in 1979 and generally reflects the tenor of the recommendations, but no representatives of 'community interests' have been appointed. 'Service members' are appointed from lists submitted by bodies representing returned servicemen throughout Australia. Provision was made in 1979 amendments for access to the Federal Court of Australia for determination of questions of law.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendations Nos. 4 and 5</PARA>
<PARA> ''Claimants contemplating an appeal to either body should be provided with independent advice at Commonwealth expense. The facilities of the Legal Service Bureau should be extended to every State to provide appropriate service.'' ''If a Legal Service Bureau officer advises an appeal to a Court, expenses should be paid by the Commonwealth. Claimants acting on their own account should be required to bear the costs of appeal to the Court, but would be entitled to claim reimbursement of costs of successful appeals.''</PARA>
<PARA>Action Taken</PARA>
<PARA> These are matters for my colleague, the Attorney-General. However, I understand some assistance is provided to claimants and appellants from time to time.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation No. 6</PARA>
<PARA> ''The appellant or his advocate may attend before the Appeal Tribunal if desired, but must appear, if requested, with suitable penalties for failure to comply without reasonable excuse.''</PARA>
<PARA>Action Taken</PARA>
<PARA> The appellant has a right either to appear in person or to be represented by an advocate before the Repatriation Review Tribunal and the Tribunal has a right to summon witnesses. Whether it requires the presence of the appellant in person in a particular case is a matter for decision by the Tribunal. The Act provides for suitable penalties for failure to comply without reasonable excuse.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation No. 7</PARA>
<PARA> ''The Repatriation Commission should be represented at appeals to state its case.''</PARA>
<PARA>Action Taken</PARA>
<PARA> The Repatriation Commission does exercise its right to appear before the new Repatriation Review Tribunal where it considers it necessary.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation No. 8</PARA>
<PARA> ''All service documents, medical opinions and reports should be accessible in the office of the Department to an appellant's advocate and any medical adviser, authorised by the appellant''.</PARA>
<PARA>Action Taken</PARA>
<PARA> Departmental files, including service documents and medical reports, are accessible by arrangement through Branch Offices to the appellant or to his advocate or medical adviser.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation No. 9</PARA>
<PARA> ''Hearing of appeals should be in public unless otherwise determined by the tribunal''.</PARA>
<PARA>Action Taken</PARA>
<PARA> Hearings by the Repatriation Review Tribunal are held in private but may be held in public at the request of the appellant.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation No. 10</PARA>
<PARA> ''Evidence should be taken on oath''.</PARA>
<PARA>Action Taken</PARA>
<PARA> The Repatriation Review Tribunal, the Repatriation Boards and the Repatriation Commission have the power to take evidence on oath; this is seldom exercised.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation No. 11</PARA>
<PARA> ''A record of deliberations should be taken''.</PARA>
<PARA>Action Taken</PARA>
<PARA> The Repatriation Review Tribunal records proceedings in respect of a hearing before it.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation No. 12</PARA>
<PARA> ''Written reasons for decision should be given as well as a brief statement of relevant facts and references to relevant legislation and be available to claimants and appellants in cases determined adversely. Consideration should also be given to the provision of reasons for accepted cases''.</PARA>
<PARA>Action Taken</PARA>
<PARA> Reasons for decisions are given by all statutory Repatriation determining authorities.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation No. 13</PARA>
<PARA> ''An applicant be entitled to the benefit of any reasonable doubt''.</PARA>
<PARA>Action Taken</PARA>
<PARA> The applicant receives the benefit of any reasonable doubt by virtue of the provisions of sections 47 and 107VH of the Repatriation Act 1920 which require that a claim or appeal be granted or allowed unless the determining authority is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there are insufficient grounds for granting the claim or allowing the appeal.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation No. 14</PARA>
<PARA> ''In all cases, the 'onus of proof' shall rest on the Repatriation Commission''.</PARA>
<PARA>Action Taken</PARA>
<PARA> No onus of proof is now placed upon the Repatriation determining authorities. However, the provisions of sections 47 and 107VH of the Repatriation Act 1920 require a high standard of disproof in the minds of the various determining bodies before a claim can be refused. See also comment on recommendation 15 below.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation No. 15</PARA>
<PARA> ''Section 47 of the Act regarding 'onus of proof', be reviewed by the Repatriation Commission twelve months after Determining Authorities start to give reasons for decisions. By that time, it should be clear whether the onus of proof provision is properly invoked in the determination of entitlements. The Commission should make a report of its review back to the Senate Standing Committee on Health and Welfare''.</PARA>
<PARA>Action Taken</PARA>
<PARA> In order to clarify and rationalise the provisions of section 47 of the Repatriation Act 1920 which set out the basis on which claims for pensions are determined, particularly the provisions relating to onus of proof and benefit of the doubt, a new section was substituted on 16 June 1977. Section 47 now provides that the Repatriation Commission or a Repatriation Board shall grant a claim or allow an appeal, unless it is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there are insufficient grounds for so doing. A similar amendment was incorporated into the Repatriation Act 1920 on 28 March 1979 to apply to the Repatriation Review Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation No. 16</PARA>
<PARA> ''A new formula for a unified scale of war pensions be established in which the present Special (T&amp;PI) Rate be identified as 100 per cent, with lower assessments expressed as percentages of that rate''.</PARA>
<PARA>Action Taken</PARA>
<PARA> Various possibilities relating to the Repatriation pensions structure have been considered but no action has been taken as yet to introduce a new pension structure.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation No. 17</PARA>
<PARA> ''The Special Compensation Allowance should be incorporated into the new unified pension scale''.</PARA>
<PARA>Action Taken</PARA>
<PARA> Special Compensation Allowance was abolished in November 1974. The cancellation was balanced in most cases by a corresponding increase in disability pension.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation No. 18</PARA>
<PARA> ''All pension assessments, including those for total incapacity should have regard to a medical and/or rehabilitation assessment of incapacity taking into account the degree of incapacity, unemployability and quality of life''.</PARA>
<PARA>Action Taken</PARA>
<PARA> All disability pension assessments under Repatriation legislation are based on loss of function and on the restriction of ability to engage in employment. Assessment is determined by comparing the condition of the disabled person with that of a normal person of the same age and sex and measures the general handicap of the disabled person. The assessment takes into account the less obvious effects such as interference with social and recreational life.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation No. 19</PARA>
<PARA> ''Section 37 of the Repatriation Act concerning special provisions regarding tuberculosis be repealed''.</PARA>
<PARA>Action Taken</PARA>
<PARA> Section 37 of the Repatriation Act 1920 was repealed on 1 November 1978.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation No. 20</PARA>
<PARA> 'The Repatriation Commission should undertake regular review of all pensions, other than fixed statutory rates, e.g. certain amputees, at not more than five yearly intervals and may review a case at any time on receipt of further evidence. (Special attention should be paid to curable conditions)'.</PARA>
<PARA>Action Taken</PARA>
<PARA> Apart from a limited number of reviews in certain cases, no regular overall review is undertaken.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation No. 21</PARA>
<PARA> 'There should be an investigation into the relative merits of a payment, optional or otherwise, of a fair and reasonable lump sum compensation as an alternative to the continuing payment of minor pensions having due regard to the possible deterioration of the conditions and the right to reapply for compensation and/or medical treatment'.</PARA>
<PARA>Action Taken</PARA>
<PARA> A number of alternatives to the present method of payment of minor pensions has been considered but no suitable alternative to the present system has been devised. The matter is still under consideration.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation No. 22</PARA>
<PARA> 'A panel of medical experts be appointed on a national basis by the responsible Minister to:</PARA>
<PARA> draw up a schedule of the aetiology of diseases, including a specification of diseases which cannot be causally related to war service;</PARA>
<PARA> review such schedules regularly; and</PARA>
<PARA> appoint sub-committees of appropriate medical status and specialty, to review and report on cases when requested by the Repatriation Commission or an Appeal Tribunal. The report of the sub-committee should be passed to the statutory authority requesting the review. A request by an appellant to an Appeal Tribunal for such review, should be referred to the Tribunal, which, at its discretion, may request the review'.</PARA>
<PARA>Action Taken</PARA>
<PARA> (i) While a formal panel of medical experts has not been appointed on a national basis, the services of appropriate specialists from most States have been used in the preparation of a Guide to the Aetiology of Diseases and in its subsequent revision which is a continuous process.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) After due consideration, it appears impracticable to draw up a specification of diseases which cannot be casually related to war service.</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) Medical Boards are constituted to report on cases when requested by the Repatriation Commission or by the Repatriation Review Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation No. 23</PARA>
<PARA> 'Repatriation hospitals be integrated into a National General Hospital Scheme'.</PARA>
<PARA>Action Taken</PARA>
<PARA> No action has been taken on this recommendation. However, there has been a continuing development of the close links already in existence between Repatriation hospitals and their counterparts in the community in order to avoid unnecessary duplication of resources.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation No. 24</PARA>
<PARA> 'All persons for whom pension liability has been accepted should be referred to a rehabilitiation unit for assessment of residual disability and if necessary, for treatment, and that no final assessment should be made until treatment is completed. These cases are reviewable after 6 months or on presentation of further written evidence which is material to and has substantial bearing upon the assessment'.</PARA>
<PARA>Action Taken</PARA>
<PARA> As part of the compensation provided to veterans who have service-related disabilities, any rehabilitative steps, medical or otherwise, considered necessary or desirable are taken to restore them to a normal state of health. To refer all disability pensioners to a rehabilitation unit would be impracticable and unnecessary as in many cases it would not be appropriate or provide any benefit.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation No. 25</PARA>
<PARA> 'Failure to comply with the direction to a rehabilitation unit should result in suspension or loss of pension'.</PARA>
<PARA>Action Taken</PARA>
<PARA> The Repatriation legislation provides that a pension may be cancelled in such instances.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation No. 26</PARA>
<PARA> 'The Committee strongly recommends implementation of the Senate Report on Physically and Mentally Handicapped Persons in which it recommended that rehabilitation units should be established in all public hospitals and that a Rehabilitation Commission be set up and be responsible to the Prime Minister for the purpose of co-ordinating all efforts'.</PARA>
<PARA>Action Taken</PARA>
<PARA> A Repatriation General Hospital is located in the capital city of each State. Each Repatriation General Hospital has a Department of Rehabilitiation.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation No. 27</PARA>
<PARA> 'Any person whose pension has been reduced or discontinued following rehabilitation assessment, treatment or review, may reapply if his condition deteriorates'.</PARA>
<PARA>Action Taken</PARA>
<PARA> Under Repatriation legislation, any disability pensioner who suffers a reduction or cancellation in pension following review has recourse to appeal rights or may reapply if the condition deteriorates.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation No. 28</PARA>
<PARA> 'Effort should be made to encourage ambulant patients to use public transport to the fullest possible extent in the interests of their rehabilitation'.</PARA>
<PARA>Action Taken</PARA>
<PARA> The use of public transport is encouraged where it is considered appropriate to the patient's particular circumstances and is likely to have a rehabilitative effect.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation No. 29</PARA>
<PARA> 'Because of the amendments recommended above and their effects on other provisions, the Act should be redrafted and consolidated'.</PARA>
<PARA>Action Taken</PARA>
<PARA> The Repatriation Act 1920 has recently been reprinted in a consolidated form and copies are now available. No action has been taken to redraft the Act.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation No. 30</PARA>
<PARA> 'There should be a change in emphasis from pension compensation to rehabilitation'.</PARA>
<PARA>Action Taken</PARA>
<PARA> The need for rehabilitation of disabled veterans is always well in the minds of medical officers and other members of the Department's treatment services. Also, compensation by way of pension and other allowances for disabilities accepted as associated with war service is a statutory obligation. These matters are therefore complementary.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation No. 31</PARA>
<PARA> 'There should be a simplification and clarification of existing provisions for participation in different warlike conflicts and clearly understood definitions and guidelines should be incorporated'.</PARA>
<PARA>Action Taken</PARA>
<PARA> Due to the complex nature of the Repatriation legislation this would be difficult to achieve and no action has been taken in this regard.</PARA>
