<PARA> (1) That the Government, in the intervening months from October 1981 to February 1982, should consult widely, especially on the local scene, to explore the affects of C.Y.S.S. in the community.</PARA>

<TITLE>Community Youth Support Scheme</TITLE>
<PARA>To the honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Victoria respectfully showeth; that the serious youth unemployment problem is a direct result of the community's failure to create sufficient jobs.</PARA>
<PARA> In these circumstances the decision to abolish Community Youth Support Schemes (CYSS) is a socially retrogressive step. The CYSS Projects provide valuable support services and work training for many young unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA> We the undersigned are concerned that the closure of CYSS Projects may lead young unemployed to become involved in anti-social behaviour such as crime, vandalism, prostitution, rebellious behaviour and mob action. There is the even more frightening prospect that many more young people will give up hope of obtaining a job, become idle and even contemplate suicide.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Federal Government reverse its decision to abolish CYSS Projects and provide sufficient funds to enable the various CYSS Centres to continue their valuable work with the young unemployed in the future.</PARA>

<PARA> That Librarians and library users throughout the nation call for the exemption of books, periodicals and newspapers from the imposition of sales taxes.</PARA>
<PARA> The tax exempt status of libraries and schools will not protect them from general cost increases which sales tax and its collection will cause. Indeed, exemption claims on millions of items per year will themselves add to the cost burden of both libraries and suppliers.</PARA>

<PARA> Many Australians depend almost exclusively upon Trans Australia Airlines for the provision of essential air services.</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Liberal Party policy objective of selling Trans Australia Airlines within 4 years is contrary to the national interest.</PARA>

<PARA> 1. Note that legislation establishing plant variety rights in other countries has had adverse effects, namely:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Virtual monopoly control of seed production has passed onto the hands of a few large international corporations seeking to profit from the exclusive rights over plant genetic materials created by such legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The varieties of seeds available have been restricted mainly to hybrids which will not reproduce truly and will not grow without the aid of artificial fertilizers and pesticides, thus maximising corporate profits without regard for the interests of growers and consumers.</PARA>

<TITLE>Subsidy Payments for Nursing Home Patients</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Right Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The majority of pensioners in nursing homes are currently not receiving any significant rebate after all fees and laundry expenses are paid. This situation does not allow for a basically acceptable quality of life and undermines the dignity of people who are unable to fend for themselves. We call upon the Federal Government to investigate the plight of these people and guarantee them at least the opportunity to financially support their own basic needs.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. When residents of nursing homes go to stay with friends or relatives for short periods-e.g. weekends-they are compelled to pay the Commonwealth subsidy for the period of their absence. This expense is obviously not able to be met by the majority of nursing home residents or their friends and relatives. The result is that people who would benefit from short periods away from the nursing home are restricted to its confines because they are not in the position to pay for their release. This situation causes emotional trauma on festive occasions such as Christmas and birthdays.</PARA>
<PARA>We feel this is a hardship that should not be borne by nursing home residents and call on the Federal Government to relax its policy regarding subsidy payments for nursing home residents on short leave.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has the Minister for Communications seen the report in today's Canberra Times of statements made by Senator Walsh in the Senate alleging that the Minister put pressure on Mr Webster of the Australian Dairy Corporation to issue an export certificate in breach of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade arrangement? Did the Minister instruct Mr Webster to issue a certificate to a manufacturer at some time between 13 October and 15 November 1976, or at any time between September and 15 November 1976? The Minister, in two statements to this House, has said that as soon as he was advised of the breach of GATT he instructed Mr Webster to end it. Can the Minister inform the House of the exact date on which he was advised of the breach, or are we to assume that he was advised in September 1976, as Mr Wallace's evidence to the Senate Committee states?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5E4">Mr SINCLAIR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The source of the allegation in the Senate sufficiently demonstrates its calibre and quality. It was made by a person for whom I have little regard and absolutely no respect. In terms of the representations made to me by manufacturers, it is true that over an extended period as Minister for Primary Industry, quite a number of people came to me asking whether it would be possible to export particular agricultural commodities, including skim milk powder. The price control mechanisms, of course, were operated through the Australian Dairy Corporation and any requests sent to me were passed on to the Australian Dairy Corporation. I know that on some occasions new markets were sought to be developed and propositions were made about concessional terms in order to become established in those markets. At no stage did I approach the Australian Dairy Corporation to breach international arrangements in order that those sales could be concluded. However, I certainly passed on many requests to the Australian Dairy Corporation under the chairmanship of Mr Webster for consideration of whether they were exports which should be approved. In the very vague way in which the suggestion has been made in the Senate, I find it impossible to know whether the particular discussion took place as alleged, but at no stage did any discussion take place between me and Mr Webster or any other officer of the Australian Dairy Corporation suggesting that there should be a breach of the international GATT arrangement or in any other way in order that Australian sales could be augmented or should take place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn to the other part of the honourable gentleman's question concerning the time lapse before advice was received from the ADC about the breach of the pricing arrangements within GATT. Discussions were held between my officers and me after the officers advised me about the sale having been made at a price less than provided for by international arrangements. There was correspondence-I think in telex form-between the departmental officers and the ADC instructing the ADC to terminate the breach and, as a result, at the first possible occasion I saw Mr Webster to confirm those instructions. As I remarked in the House before, there was no time lag between the advice to me and the instructions from the Department to Mr Webster to terminate that breach.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Treasurer. Has the Government given consideration to undertaking the preparation of family impact statements on a continuing basis to monitor the effect on families in recent years of all relevant government revenue raising policies, expenditure programs and movements in major economic indicators? Does the Treasurer recognise the need for such statements involving all three levels of government and involving family samples in each State?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question raised by the honourable member for Perth is a very thoughtful one. I must say that the idea of a family impact statement as such has been put to the Government on a number of occasions. I certainly have sympathy with the objective. Whether that is quite the most productive methodology to be adopted to provide governments with all the information that ought to be at their disposal when taking revenue and expenditure decisions is perhaps another matter. But the honourable gentleman, whose concern to see that Government policies are sensitive to family interest is well known to the House, properly reminds us that we ought to have objective information available when we take decisions that affect the family.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Indeed, the current debate on the impact of sales taxes on average family incomes is testimony to the need for more objective information, because some of the exaggerated claims that have been made about the impact of these taxation measures on family incomes indicate that the people making those accusations are completely without any objective data so far as the impact of these measures is concerned. Of course, ultimately the quality of individual government decisions is reflected in the results. If one looks back over the last five years at areas of enormous significance to Australian families, one sees very great improvement. For example, the level of home ownership has risen some 4 per cent or 5 per cent in the last five years.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since 1976 it has risen significantly, according to the latest survey. There cannot be anything more important to the quality of life of average Australian families than the overall level of home ownership. If one looks at the level of inflation, which affects all of us, and at other measures of the standards of living, one sees a pattern of constant strengthening in growth over the past few years. I will address myself to the question of whether a family impact statement would be appropriate even though it may not be possible, as a result of that examination, to justify the enormous commitment in terms of man hours that would be involved in preparing it. I can nonetheless assure the honourable gentleman that in future revenue and expenditure decisions of this Government continuing and special regard will be paid to the interests of Australian families.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct a question to the Prime Minister about South Africa and diamond policy. In view of the fact that the Ashton diamond mine will provide an increment equivalent to half the present total world production of diamonds, does the Government see this development as a remarkable opportunity for the establishment of a totally new and massive industry for Australia not only in mining but also in processing? Is the Government continuing to ignore this huge potential benefit, as the Deputy Prime Minister indicated to the House a few weeks ago, by its failure to set in place a diamond marketing policy, or is the Prime Minister now in a position to apprise the House of the Government's policy towards this new and exciting prospect?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Is the Prime Minister aware that with Zaire and the Soviet Union having left the De Beer's Central Selling Organisation, the CSO is now particularly vulnerable to a large low cost potential producer such as Ashton? Finally, in the light of the Prime Minister's firm view on South African policy, what does the Government intend to do to guarantee that Australia's huge diamond output will not be swallowed up by the South African diamond syndicate, serving only to make the De Beer's monopoly stronger and more resilient at a time when its old high cost diamond mines are rendering it less and less competitive?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GH4">Mr HUNT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are no approved specialist passenger services from Western Australia at present. I expect the 1981 airlines agreement to be proclaimed within the very near future. Therefore, any applications will be considered against the background of the new airlines agreement. If an operator proposes a specialist-type service which differs from the type of service that is offered by the major operators and which serves a need that the major operators are not offering, it is possible for the Minister to ask the two major airlines whether they are prepared to offer that service. If they are not prepared to offer that service then the Minister could-I repeat 'could'-approve such an application.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have approved a specialist service between Sydney and Canberra under the 1972 airlines agreement. I regarded the application by East-West Airlines Ltd for a no-frills service, where passengers can purchase tickets aboard the aircraft, where no services are provided on the aircraft free of charge and where baggage is carried on to the aircraft, as being a quite different type of service from that being offered by the major operators on that route or on any other portion of the trunk route.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Communications. In view of the answer given to the Leader of the Opposition yesterday conceding the social importance of Telecom Australia in providing services in areas where the density of traffic is such that profitability in narrow economic terms is unlikely in the foreseeable future and in view of the Minister's statement that it is only in the major population areas of Sydney and Melbourne that the profit potential is high, why does the Minister persist in inhibiting the expansion of Telecom into new, highly profitable areas of communication? Would this extension of Telecom's activity not better enable Telecom to improve its facilities and range of services throughout the rest of Australia, particularly in country areas, which, I take it, he is very interested in? Why did the Government ignore the report of McKinsey and Co. Inc., which in June 1980 recommended increased capital investment by Telecom for these very purposes? Why is it necessary to set up yet another inquiry into Telecom which must inevitably come to the general conclusion that the Minister came to yesterday?</PARA></TALK.START>

In terms of the extension of Telecom's activity into the provision of new technological services, there is little doubt that it has done so. It is for that reason that it is maintaining the level and standard of services that it now provides. Only this week it announced a new package designed to facilitate data transfer around Australia. It is a very significant development and is one which will offer to data and computer users a significantly more economic basis of data transfer than was previously available. If that is the basis of his question, I suggest that he is on the wrong ground altogether.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The purpose of the inquiry is to try to ensure that, in the very rapidly developing communications period we are about to enter, there is a capacity for the Australian community to have the greatest possible diversity of facilities available. There is no reason that the honourable gentleman has advanced in his question, nor any that has been advanced by McKinsey in that report, nor any that has been advanced in this House and on other occasions for suggesting that Telecom alone should have a monopoly to operate in this entire area. Indeed, the very opportunities for diversity are paramount with technological change. Our concern is that the public dollar should be spread as far as possible and, where possible, the private dollar used to extend the facilities available. The purpose of the Public Inquiry into Telecommunications Services in Australia-the Davidson inquiry-is to ensure that Telecom can move into the next decade and into the year 2000 able to provide those services which Australia provides at the most economic level and without undue demand on the capital facilities of this country.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government has given support to the live sheep export trade for good and valid reasons. There is a demand in a number of Middle East countries for live sheep. They firstly have a preference for freshly killed meat and, secondly, in some cases they do not have facilities available for the handling of frozen meat or chilled mutton. We as a government also have given encouragement to the development of facilities in a number of Middle East countries to increase their capacity to handle chilled meat but this will not move their consumer preference away from live sheep. Therefore, if Australia does not meet that market requirement they will move their purchasing to some other product in some other country. It has been established that they are able to purchase alternative products from other countries to satisfy their demand. So the Australian sheep industry is really built up to meet this new trade. I met representatives of the ACTU here several weeks ago and we had a good discussion on the problems of the live sheep export trade. They sought answers to several other questions that were put to us and we agreed to provide those. I provided that information, but unfortunately before we were able to meet again as agreed, the ACTU congress carried a resolution seeking to place a limit on the live sheep export trade.</PARA></TALK.START>

There has not been a transfer within the Australian community from live sheep to cold killed sheep. There has in fact been an increase in the slaughterings of sheep for the Middle East trade as well. I was able to demonstrate that to the ACTU. The abattoir side of the industry has not lost its numbers; the live sheep part of the trade has built up its numbers.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OD4">Mr N. A. BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It should be understood at the outset-I do not think it has been fully understood over the years-that the Commonwealth Government is not the employer of CYSS project officers. Those project officers are in fact employed by local committees which have the responsibility for the day-to-day running of the CYSS projects. However, when the funds are calculated reference is of course made to, amongst other things, prevailing salaries in the community in similar fields. As the honourable member said, the Government made a decision that the current projects would receive their current level of funds until 28 February next year, to enable the Government to conduct a wide ranging process of consultation with community interests as to the new guidelines under which the Scheme should be conducted after that time. We are making funds available to projects at the current levels until that time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Within the overall sum that the local committees have they may have-I am prepared to consent to this-responsibility to redistribute their funds so that if in their own discretion, judged on local circumstances, they believe that it is appropriate to pay additional money to project officers, they may do so, but within the ambit of the lump sum which is paid to them. It is not possible to pay additional money to the projects simply because there has been an increase in salaries for people in similar fields of employment. It is a matter of the local committees exercising their responsibility and judgment. I think most people would agree that there is a responsibility in making decisions with respect to spending money, especially when it is not one's own. It is a responsibility which the local committees will have to exercise themselves. They may decide, with reference to local circumstances, that it is more appropriate to pay additional money to the project officers until that time and to devote less money to other activities of their project. That is a matter for them to decide. If they wish to do that I am prepared to consent to it.</PARA>
<PARA> I might add also that, to assist local committees that wish to take part in the consultation process, they may also use a small part of their funds-I will be giving details of this later-to enable project officers or other committee representatives to take part in some of the conferences that are being held to enable submissions to be put to the Government as a part of the consultation process.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Bradfield and several other members from both sides of the House have raised that matter with me in recent days. Investigations are continuing and we have not yet determined the status of those on board. We became aware of the vessel when it reached Malaysian waters and the close co-operation which we have with the Malaysian Government enabled us to ascertain that the vessel had not come from Vietnam. When it was heading south, the Governor-General proclaimed the Immigration (Unauthorized Arrivals) Amendment Bill which this House passed last year. I expect, as a result of the interrogations, that we will take action either under that Act or under the Migration Act and perhaps under other legislation to prosecute at least some of the people on board. There are, of course, 60 children on board and that creates considerable difficulties because they are the innocent victims of other people's decisions. We are anxious to make sure that no final statement is made until every individual has been interviewed and we are satisfied that we are in a position to make a judgment on the status of every individual on board.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have a team of people, including immigration officers, the Federal Police, and also the Hong Kong Police who are fluent in all of the Chinese dialects that are likely to be spoken on board. Their investigations are necessarily painstaking.

I add that one of the sensitivities has been that we are most anxious not to impugn the status of those persons who are unquestionably genuine refugees, many of whom are now Australian citizens. I know that they share everyone else's concern that this racket, if indeed it is, is fully exposed, and that action is taken.</PARA>

The honourable member made a public statement a few weeks ago in which he alleged that the housing section of the Department of the Capital Territory, which deals, inter alia, with welfare housing, was shirking its responsibilities. Not only was that an unjust reflection on the Commissioner for Housing, Mr Brian Rope, and the members of his staff, but also it was a very great reflection on the House of Assembly Housing Committee, which is chaired by a member of the Australian Labor Party, Miss Robyn Walmsley, and which vets all decisions taken.</PARA></TALK.START>

There is no doubt that, given the significantly increasing revenue of the commercial television stations, the ABC is faced with some difficulty in trying to mirror the program range that they provide and yet provide its distinctively different responsibilities, in terms of the quality of both the programs that it offers and the range of services which extends throughout Australia and which covers not just the national television stations but also national broadcasting. It is for that reason that the Dix Committee looked quite closely at the question of advertising and corporate sponsorship.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that it is necessary that these questions be properly aired. The Government has not yet reached its conclusions on that aspect of the Dix Committee's report, but I would welcome views raised in this place and outside as to the implications of such extended funding of the ABC so that they can be properly considered at the appropriate time.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Treasurer aware of the problems that small businesses will have in administering the 2 1/2 per cent sales tax? As I pointed out to him yesterday, a button manufacturing firm, such as the Maxart Group Pty Ltd, which sells in small lots to many customers, delivering two and three times a week, has many returns from manufacturers of sample dresses. It will have to invoice out its buttons with the sales tax and then credit the sales tax on goods returned in hundreds of weekly transactions. Small businesses like Maxart are vital to Australian employment. This tax could send some of them to the wall with its increased cost of administration. Can the Treasurer offer any relief to them in both their administration problems and costs?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It would be idle to pretend that the introduction of a wholesale tax for the first time for certain manufacturers will not cause an additional administrative burden and some additional cost. But whenever one decides to make a change in the taxation system, or even if one decides not to change it but rather to rely on existing methods in raising their respective proportions of tax, there are costs and consequences involved. If, as the Government believes, there is value in broadening the taxation base, I do not think there can be any doubt that of all the methods of raising indirect taxation, given the existing mechanism for collecting wholesale tax in this country, the method we have chosen is infinitely less costly and infinitely less burdensome on the Australian business community than, for example, the introduction of a value added tax or the introduction of a general consumption tax at the retail level, whatever other advantages that might have. I can assure the honourable member that every effort will be made by the Australian Taxation Office to minimise the administrative costs involved. The existence of a well trained and very experienced administration so far as sales tax collection is concerned will ensure that that occurs. I am very confident that in cost benefit terms this broadening of the tax base can be achieved with minimal interruption to and disturbance of the Australian business community.</PARA></TALK.START>

Yesterday a document was circulated to honourable members which was entitled 'House of Representatives-States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Bill 1981-Explanatory Memorandum-(Circulated by authority of the Minister for Education, the Hon Wal Fife)'. The normal procedure is for those explanatory memoranda to be circulated after the Bill is introduced into the House. I can only assume that what has happened on this occasion is that this explanatory memorandum relates to a Bill notice of which was given yesterday. It appears as Notice No. 5 on today's Notice Paper and is intended to be introduced into the House this afternoon. Inasmuch as the explanatory memorandum may be authentic-we have no way of knowing-it therefore would pre-empt the contents of the Bill which has not yet been presented to the House, and I wonder if you, Mr Speaker, could examine this matter and see, in the first instance, whether it is authentic and whether in fact the Minister for Education (Mr Fife) was entitled to circulate this memorandum or whether it constitutes a breach of the procedures of this House.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Speaker. My personal explanation contains two separate but related matters and I seek your indulgence if it consequently takes a little longer. Firstly, during the personal explanation made by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) yesterday, you objected to a clear interjection which took the form of a question. The honourable member, in broad terms, denied having received a bribe during his term as Victorian Leader of the Opposition. The question was to the effect, 'Well, when did you get it?' Mr Speaker, you were unable to identify the interjector. However, the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke), in an excellent portrayal of a school boy, informed you that it was the honourable member for O'Connor. I remained silent. On reflection over the last 20 hours I wish to admit I was the person who made that interjection. I give reasons to this House which I hope will have a beneficial effect in the future. I wish to withdraw my interjection formally and to apologise to the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. It is the first time, and I hope the last, during my parliamentary career that I will forsake the ideals of strong and constructive debate for personal vilification. However, I believe I should give the reasons that I entered the House that morning with a determination to make things as difficult as possible for the honourable member for Melbourne Ports.</PARA></TALK.START>

I said I was a relative newcomer to this place and as honourable members are well aware I can only learn its forms and procedures by observing others. Consequently I will read to the House some short extracts from Hansard which have been the basis for some of my education. These extracts do lead to the second matter.

I very much doubt whether the honourable member should be given leave to make a series of statements about matters which obviously go back a long period. In fact he is now adverting to matters which the honourable member for Melbourne Ports may or may not have said some time ago. Mr Speaker, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports is attending a funeral this morning and you will notice that he is not present in the House. Are you going to invite the position where perhaps the honourable member for Melbourne Ports will be impugned or affected in some way by the honourable gentleman's explanation, but will have no chance of replying or correcting the record? I would have thought that a personal explanation should have been made at the time there was some misunderstanding.

I recognise that there will be difficulties with what he intends to say because he wants, first, to establish a base for his major point. His major point is that personal abuse of one member by another member produces a counteraction. I think the honourable member intended to say, after establishing the base, that he would hope that the Parliament and all members of the Parliament might avoid that form of abuse.

When yesterday the honourable member for Melbourne Ports raised an explanation of the matter in which he considered himself to have been libelled, he presented to this House evidence of the accusations that he made against the person who had maligned him. He quoted from a number of court documents and reports. No evidence has been presented for any of the accusations being levelled in explanation by the honourable member for O'Connor. He has talked generally about well-known Labor Party people having done this or that to him. He has not cited them. I do not believe that his explanation is of the same quality as the explanation given by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. I believe that your indulgence and the indulgence of this House is being abused.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, we are all familiar with the many varied problems which dominate policy making relating to primary industry. I refer specifically to such problems as trade for different commodities, the effects on the ongoing cost-price squeeze, rising interest rates, escalating land values and adjustment problems. These are all areas of concern which justifiably receive a good deal of attention from government. Often they are the result of our primary industries being so export orientated and consequently sensitive to international trends and fluctuations in world prices. Despite the significance of these issues their effects in terms of threatening the long term viability of agriculture pale in comparison to a problem which arises within our own shores and is basic to everyday agricultural activities. I refer here, of course, to the degradation of agricultural land throughout Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is this serious problem which I wish to draw to the attention of Parliament today. It is also my aim to set out how the Fraser Government has steadily retreated from its national responsibility in this area and has shown complete disregard for the future viability of Australia's land resource base. The relationship between agriculture and the land is as basic as one will find. Without a healthy land resource base a strong ongoing agriculture cannot exist. Therefore this problem is not just a conservation issue concerning the binding of economic activities and protecting environmental quality for a number of intangible reasons. The objectives of efficient productive use of resources and resource conservation are synonomous. A degrading land base can neither sustain the increasing output of food and fibre essential to feed and clothe an increasing world population nor maintain this important sector of our economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the apparentness and basic logic of these statements, cropping and grazing activities in Australia at present are threatened by a number of largely unattended processes which lower the stability of the landscape and render large areas of land useless for future use. There is ample evidence that degradation of our soil and water resources is accelerating. This scene is brought about by a number of interrelated processes such as: Erosion by wind and water in many of our major cropping and grazing areas; desertification of the arid inland as a result of overgrazing by domestic and feral animals; the spread of noxious weeds; the lowering of soil fertility by overcropping; the spread of soil borne pests and diseases; dry land salting as a result of indiscriminate clearing, and salinisation and waterlogging problems in irrigation areas. This list is by no means exhaustive but it is indicative of the environmental problems assailing agriculture in Australia today. It is important to realise from the outset that we are not merely talking about a bit of erosion here and there. </PARA>
<PARA> Much of how this present situation has come about can be explained by land users' and governments' traditional attitudes towards land resources in Australia. For most of our history we have seen the Australian landscape as being somewhat hostile; something to be subdued and exploited. This attitude has been fostered by government land development and settlement policies which encouraged ad hoc utilisation of the land for purposes of short term gain. The land degradation problems confronting us today are the legacy of such attitudes. Denuded and eroding slopes and areas of land covered with salt are the long term costs not accounted for by early developers. Similarly these same costs will face future generations because once land is severely degraded the effect is permanent. Indeed it is still possible to come across examples where governments are still supporting land development schemes with scant regard for the long term damage which may accompany such projects. </PARA>
<PARA> Australians tend to think of their country as being one generously endowed with land suitable for agriculture. This view is reinforced by constant referrals by enthusiastic, though uninformed, National Country Party politicians to the 'wastage' of natural resources in the remote areas of Australia. The Australian countryside is littered with degraded relics of grandiose development schemes. Once again it is the old story of quantity not equalling quality. The plain facts are that, while Australia is indeed well endowed with substantial areas of land, much of it is of poor quality and fragile, unsuitable for intensive development. In addition recent survey work by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation reveals that we have already occupied most of the land suitable for agriculture. We cannot continue to look to development of new lands on a broad scale as a means of improving productivity; instead we must turn to managing properly those areas already utilised. Indeed, the need for this is well overdue, for it is on these lands that the future viability of agriculture in this country depends. </PARA>
<PARA> In the past farmers and governments had an excuse for early mistakes in land utilisation. Little was known of how the Australian environment functioned, of how unsuitable techniques developed in Europe were here. Today no such excuse exists. Research over the last couple of decades has shed considerable light on the processes at work in the landscape and on how the use of land for cropping and grazing can best be managed so that stability and thus long term productivity can be achieved. What is lacking is the political will of governments to confront the problem and to implement what has been learnt. Nor is the matter of loss of productivity as a result of resource degradation new to the political sphere. Soil erosion first became a prominent political issue in the 1930s and 1940s in Australia. Fresh in the minds of those advocating government action was the 'dustbowl' catastrophy of the Great Plains in the United States of America, where many thousands of hectares of farming land were rendered useless by unsuitable management. Out of this concern began a movement leading to the establishment of soil conservation authorities in each of the States. </PARA>
<PARA> Before turning to the matter of Federal Government involvement in coping with the problem of land degradation, I wish to give honourable members some idea of the magnitude and seriousness of the problem confronting Australian farmers today. I do this lest the Government attempt to play down the problem or to accuse me of overreacting, particularly since it obviously sees the matter as being of little consequence. The most recent and thorough assessment of the extent and severity of land degradation in rural Australia was undertaken by officers of relevant State and Federal government authorities. The study entitled 'The Commonwealth and State Government Collaborative Soil Conservation Study 1975-77' was released in April 1978. That study was initiated by the then Minister for the Environment, the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Dr Cass), and all State governments, with the exception of the then New South Wales Liberal Government, agreed to co-operate. That study's findings were, to say the least, disturbing and confirmed the worst fears of many experts that the problem was spreading and rapidly getting out of control. </PARA>
<PARA> The study found that over half of the area of land in Australia being used for cropping and grazing required treatment for land degradation if its productivity was to be maintained. At June 1975 prices the costs of capital works required to control and treat the degraded area were assessed to be $675m. This figure does not include annual maintenance costs, estimated at around $50m a year, nor does it include costs of land use changes or the costs of extension advice, survey design and administration. Given the damaging effects of a four-year drought and a 10 per cent or higher inflation rate since these figures were released, it is certain that the total bill for land degradation is well over a billion dollars. The total value of fixed investments in the area threatened by degradation of one form or another was assessed to be of the order of $12 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> No wonder a recent Four Corners program gave soil erosion the correct title of being the most serious environmental problem in Australia today. At an international seminar on arid land management held in Brisbane in May, the country where desertification was deemed to be most likely to spread was not Ethiopia, Sudan or any of the other poorly developed countries which border on the world's major deserts; it was Australia. Some 40 per cent of Australia is at high risk of becoming desert. There is more. Work carried out by the Queensland Department of Primary Industries has shown that in wheat lands soil is being lost at an annual rate of 50 tonnes a hectare. If these losses continue the productivity of these soils will be seriously reduced before the end of the century. In many areas the consequences will be disastrous well before then since they simply do not have that amount of topsoil to lose. The costs do not end with just declining productivity; there are also those costs associated with silted creeks and dams-costs that affect the community. </PARA>
<PARA> I could go on detailing the results of other studies because the evidence is there, but time precludes this. What is obvious is that land degradation is not just some conservationist's whim, as the coalition prefers to see it; rather it is a major problem with potentially disastrous economic, social and environmental consequences for rural communities and indeed, through the importance of primary industries, for the nation. What is obvious also is the inability of the market forces to deal with the costs of land degradation and the need for government intervention. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not to say that some responsibility does not lie with the individual land user. However, the farmer is seriously constrained in his capacity to practice and fund soil conservation. Direct government involvement is justified by the need to maintain a productive and versatile land resource for future generations as well as to minimise off-site effects, such as siltation of dams and harbours, which directly affect the community. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the Constitution, the State governments have the responsiblity for land. However, the Federal Government has a basic responsibility to ensure an efficient agricultural sector for the social welfare of people in rural areas. The magnitude of land degradation in Australia is such that it threatens both. Therefore, I feel active participation by the Federal Government with the States is warranted and essential if the problem is to be dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA> Given this responsibility of the Federal Government for the maintenance of Australia's land resource, I turn now to examining how the Fraser Government has gone about bearing this responsibility. During the years of the Whitlam Government Federal involvement in soil conservation was steadily intensified. In 1971-72, grants to the States for soil conservation totalled $637,000. By the Budget of 1975-76 this had grown to nearly $3m. This followed the findings of an interdepartmental committee established in August 1973 to examine the matter of financial assistance for soil conservation. When the Fraser Government took office, things took a backward step and, by 1978, Federal funding had fallen to less than $1.5m. This then was how the Fraser Government accepted its responsibilities for dealing with Australia's land degradation problem. It was an ominous sign of things to come. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the principal findings of the interdepartmental committee's report was that there was an urgent need for a national soil conservation program and that a collaborative study involving State and Federal governments be undertaken so as to provide a sound basis for such a program. I have already referred earlier in my speech to some of the findings. It was a most comprehensive and competently prepared document. It provided a basis for a national soil conservation program and advocated a more active role be taken by the Commonwealth Government through the complementary mechanisms of research, policy co-ordination and financial assistance to the State soil conservation authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> Following the release of the main report of the study, the Government dillied and dallied and generally avoided taking any substantial steps, although it agreed in principle to assist the States on a national soil conservation program. There is nothing in the 1979 Budget, or the 1980 Budget, despite repeated assurances. Following angry responses by the States to the omission in the 1980 Budget of any specific funds for soil conservation, the Minister for National Development and Energy (Senator Carrick) announced, quite incredibly, that the Government would be reviewing the soil conservation program funding later in the financial year. All that the Federal Government was doing was biding its time. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Government pledged itself to support financially a national soil conservation program. Predictably enough, this occurred in the coalition's election speeches in October 1980 when the Government pledged $3m for soil conservation. The Leader of the National Country Party (Mr Anthony)in his Party's 1980 election speech-ironically enough entitled 'Keeping Australia Strong'-said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . as a first step towards a national soil conservation program we will provide $3m in 1981-82. </PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately it proved also to be the last step. In April 1981, the Fraser Government, in its Review of Commonwealth Functions decided that suddenly soil conservation was no longer a Commonwealth responsibility and that the States should take full responsibility for policy and administrative matters. With this short statement, the Fraser Government beat a hasty retreat from its responsibilities and assured that the land degradation problem would continue to worsen. </PARA>
<PARA> All the posturing and side-stepping of the Government following the release of the major study was always only intended to buy time and the miserly promise of $3m in the 1980 election speeches was yet another example of political grandstanding. Arguments that the funds promised will be included in general grants to the States give no grounds for complacency since there can be little assurance that the States, already struggling to find funds, can allocate the money specifically to soil conservation work. Besides, the amounts promised are a mere pittance. More importantly, the States cannot be sure that any more funds will be forthcoming from the Commonwealth in the future. They cannot undertake any long term planning for soil conservation, given this uncertainty. The whole purpose of devising a national soil conservation program was to enable the problem of land degradation to be tackled on a planned and progressive basis. The Government will take resort in the fact that it has taxation deductibility for certain soil conservation measures. I do not doubt the wisdom of this. But tax deductibility is a particularly inappropriate policy for soil conservation. Some of those whose properties are most eroded, which affects other people's properties, are those people with low incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Fraser Government's approach to water resources smacks of the same empty rhetoric and lack of political will. Since 1977, the Government has made repeated promises to allocate $200m for water resources over the five years to 1982-83. With only one year to go, only $109.4m has actually been allocated. The Fraser Government's record in managing the natural resources of this country can only be described as dismal. Its ostrich-like approach to problems of environmental degradation in relation to the quality of land and water resources, upon which agriculture depends, has ensured that their future ability to sustain production remains in jeopardy. This is hardly a record to be proud of or an approach which would be taken by a responsible government. However, as we have seen on numerous occasions over the last few weeks, responsible government is hardly one of this Government's strong points when it comes to primary industries. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Labor Party is pledged to the maintenance and restoration of expendable resources of soil, water, air and forests. To this end a Labor government would ensure that the Commonwealth assumed a responsible and active role in tackling the problem on a national basis. Whilst the States have primary legislative responsibility for land, this is no excuse for a Federal government to turn its back on a serious national situation. Australian governments have always played a significant role in land policy relating to agriculture. The more traditional areas of Commonwealth involvement include land settlement and land development. We should take the opportunity when we develop land to insist on decent conservation policies. Commonwealth financial involvement in such policy areas has been justified on the basis of its being important to the national interest, and it is. Just as it has been seen to be in the interests of the nation for the Commonwealth to contribute to the development and settlement of its agricultural lands, it is also proper that the Commonwealth ensure that these lands are not allowed to degrade. There are a number of complementary means whereby the Commonwealth could, and should, take an effective role in dealing with the varying forms of land degradation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the House should be grateful to the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin) for raising the importance of the preservation of one of the most important basic resources in the Australian community. There is no question that the preservation of the soil resource is fundamental to a country such as Australia which is so heavily dependent upon its agricultural and primary industries and which still relies significantly on generating export income from those primary industries. It is a country which ranges from the arid to the non-arid zones. It experiences severely changing seasonal conditions when flood and drought tend in cyclical form to generate the circumstances within which agriculture is carried out. It is for that reason that the Government has a great deal of support for at least the first part of what the honourable gentleman said and the consideration that needs to be given to this fundamental problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was within one of the committees of the Standing Committee of Agriculture, which was one of my responsibilities as Minister for Primary Industry in days gone by, that the review of a basis for soil conservation policy in Australia was produced in 1978. Its report on the collaborative soil conservation study undertaken between 1975 and 1977 was, of course, subsequent to the report to which the honourable gentleman referred. It is interesting to look at this study, Mr Deputy Speaker, for I know your own concern in South Australia, a State which has been significantly affected by the problems of soil degradation of one form or another. The report remarks that, of the total land area of Australia, one third is not used for agricultural or pastoral purposes, nearly one-third is stable under present land use, and more than one-third-about 35 per cent-is degraded to varying degrees and needs some form of conservation treatment. The report identifies four types of conservation treatments-land management practices, such as cultivation and crop management, pasture and grazing management; conservation works on pastoral and farm land, which include land management work, such as contour banking, and erosion control work, such as gully control structures; change in the present use of land to a less hazardous use; and various treatments for degraded land used for other than pastoral agricultural purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> Having identified those four types, I think it is important that the House identify the ways in which they can be implemented. It is in the manner and responsibility for this work and the way by which stimulus can be given that lies the fundamental differences between the Government and the Opposition on this very important matter. The extent to which the land management practices that I identified can be pursued by government is, of course, minimal. Cultivation, crop management, pasture and grazing management are significantly the responsibility of two agencies. One is the State governments, which determine the terms and conditions of the occupancy of the land. They have responsibility for allocating irrigation licences for land which is irrigated, determining the land use and the stocking capacity of arid land and controlling land management practices. </PARA>
<PARA> The second type of management is conservation works on pastoral and farm land, such as contour banking and erosion control work, such as gully control structures. In the State from which I come the Water Resources Commission has developed very extensive services which were funded heavily during the Liberal-National Country Party coalition days so that it could provide supplementary services for the land holder. Again, the State governments and the land holders have the responsibility. The third area is the change in the present use of land to a less hazardous use. The Commonwealth has no responsibility for determining land use. Constitutionally, that responsibility lies with State governments. Again, it is a matter for determination by the State governments, which have the capacity to redesignate or reapply land for a particular use, and by the individual who is the land holder and the person utilising the land. The fourth area is the various treatments for degraded land used for other than pastoral agricultural purposes. The responsibility for that lies predominantly with the State and with the individual. </PARA>
<PARA> The history of Australian agriculture and the development of this country shows that European settlement has significantly increased pressures on Australian soils and vegetation. Native vegetation and timber have been cleared over large areas and cultivation of soils has been introduced. Some agricultural practices left soils bare, particularly in the days when tillage was not as scientific as it is today and when the equipment used tended to leave ground bared for long periods, particularly in the summer rainfall zones where heavy storms tended to wash away land. Native pastures have been subjected to increased grazing pressures. Crops and pastures have been introduced which differ from the native vegetation in their growth cycles, their nutrient needs and their demands for water. Hydrological regimes have been redistributed. Flood plains have been developed. Many of the more indistinct natural drainage lines have been cultivated. All this has contributed towards the degradation of the soil's surface. The result of all these changes has been soil erosion, flooding and salinisation of soils and water. Erosion products are the most widespread pollutants arising from agricultural, pastoral and even urban activities and are a major pollutant of water sources. </PARA>
<PARA> Those remarks come from the report to which I referred. There is no doubt that the position is serious. The assessment of areas needing soil conservation treatment shows, as the honourable member for Werriwa mentioned, that 52 per cent of the land in use in Australia needs some form of treatment for land or vegetation degradation. This area amounts to more than one-third of the entire land mass. Over five million square kilometres are used for agricultural and pastoral purposes. Of the total area in use 23 per cent needs treatment with land management practices only and 29 per cent needs conservation works of various kinds, almost invariably in conjunction with appropriate management practices. The Government does not deny-indeed, it recognises-the problems that exist in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> I need to make a couple of other remarks on the report before I deal with the substance of the responsibility and how the Federal Government is reacting to it. The private land owner is identified on page 21 of the report as having a central role in soil conservation. The report remarks that it may be taken that he is primarily responsible for sound management and maintaining his land in good condition. Protection of his own and neighbouring land and structures is unlikely to be assured under common law, but it is the rural land user and the city land user who generate so much of the land degradation. We should make no mistake about it-land developers and those who develop our cities and urban areas are as much responsible as the miner and the farmer who, in their more extensive areas and also through historical land practices, have caused soil degradation in one form or another. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of involvement, the first person identified in the report is the private land holder. It is to him that the Federal Government is giving very significant help in an area from which the Labor Government, its predecessor, removed that help. That is most important in considering this matter of public importance. The second thing in the report in terms of involvement is the case for public involvement. Land degradation imposes costs on society. It affects productivity. It certainly affects the degree to which the natural beauty of an area is in one way degraded or in another way enhanced. On page 25 of the report there is a suggestion of the measure of public involvement. Let us look at it. The first area suggested is monitoring-assessing the extent and rate of land degradation and the effectiveness of control efforts. That demonstrably is a responsibility of State governments. The second area is research and development. The third area is participation-the provision of extension services, specialist services, construction of conservation works, the provision of incentives and subsidies. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> Governments act as a source of knowledge and expertise in soil conservation. This is a vital function performed by the various State and Territory soil conservation authorities. </PARA>
<PARA>Having indentified those three areas the report suggests that governments act as a source of knowledge and expertise, and states that this function is performed by the various State and Territory soil conservation authorities. The report continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Continuing research into the causes and effects of land degradation, and into methods of control, together with the efficient dissemination of the knowledge gained, are important roles of government. </PARA>
<PARA>The principal area of concern is not whether there needs to be an approach taken at those two separate levels but rather how we go about it. Let us have a look at this. The first thing I say to the House and to the people of Australia with respect to this is that the origins of soil conservation and the present state of play with regard to soil conservation date way back. There certainly has been an involvement by State governments and the Federal Government for many years. Indeed, before 1972 the Liberal-National Country Party Government provided very generous concessions to the landholder. Honourable members will remember that there were two particular areas of responsibility-one was the land holder and the second was the State governments and those who have a particular involvement with the soil and with land management. With respect to the individual, the Whitlam Labor Government in 1973 changed the then available deductibility of expenditure for soil conservation purposes so that this expenditure, instead of being deductible in the year in which the expenditure occurred, became deductible over a 10-year period. So much for the record of achievement that the honourable member for Werriwa referred to. There was a complete removal of the incentive for the private landholder who has the major responsibility in the area with the removal of the tax reduction by the Whitlam Government back in 1973. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us see where we have got to now. There is no doubt that, in terms of the present position as far as tax concessions are concerned, the Federal Government has recognised its responsibilities. I draw the attention of members of the Opposition to the second reading speech on the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 6) 1980 by my colleague the Treasurer (Mr Howard). The speech states:</PARA>
<PARA>Soil Conservation Expenditure</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The second of the policy initiatives implemented by the Bill will authorise full deductions in the year of expenditure for the capital cost of a wide range of soil conservation measures on land in Australia that is used for primary production. Capital expenditures to qualify for the new deduction include outlays on the eradication or extermination of animal or vegetable pests, on the destruction of detrimental weed or plant growth and on the draining of swamp or low-lying land. Also specified are expenditures on the prevention or combating of soil erosion, on the erection of control fences to exclude livestock or vermin from areas affected by erosion or excessive salinity and on the erection of levee banks. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable members will recall that in the report we identified a number of areas which referred not specifically to work that had to be done on the soil but to necessary measures in terms of land use. The prime responsibility in that area lies with the landholder. This Federal Government quite properly introduced a tax deduction in order to encourage the landholder to pursue his proper responsibilities. The Treasurer in the second reading speech said that, at present, expenditures of these kinds are generally deductible, as explained, by way of equal instalments over a period of 10 years. That, honourable members will recall, was a Labor initiative. In the case of fencing, landholders were subject to depreciation allowances over a number of years. All that was changed, specifically with the intention of meeting the Federal Government's responsibility to assist the landholder to pursue his soil conservation practices. The Treasurer's speech continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Eligible expenditure on soil conservation measures will qualify for the full deduction if it is incurred under a contract entered into on or after 1 October 1980 or on or after that date in an operation carried out by the taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA>The Federal Government introduced a very significant tax concession. It provided an extension not just with respect to soil conservation but also with respect to fencing. It ensured that as a result there would be a capacity for the private individual landholder to undertake that soil conservation work. The second part of the proposal concerns the State governments' responsibility. The honourable member for Werriwa made a lot of what he said is the responsibility of the Federal Government to fund State government in this area. The Federal Government recognised that the State governments need to have a financial capacity to pursue that objective. As honourable members will recall, the report of the Committee of Review of Commonwealth Functions stated that one of the objectives was to return to the States their sovereign responsibilities, to give them the financial sinews with which they could exercise them, and to give them the task of so doing. The decision of the RCF was implemented at the Premiers Conference on 4 May 1981 when the States were offered an additional 9 per cent in their share of tax revenues plus $69m in support of functions and programs being transferred to the States. The $3m in 1981-82 for soil conservation, promised to the States by the Government in its 1980 election speech, was included in that $69m, although not separately so identified. This allowance for soil conservation was built into the tax sharing base from which future tax sharing entitlements will be calculated. Not only was the $3m provided but also an increment was provided to enable the State governments to meet their tasks. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is worth commenting that-I see that my time is running out-on page 85 of the Budget address delivered by the New South Wales Premier the other day, with respect to allocations for 1981-82 for the soil conservation facilities, an amount of $3,150,000 was allocated. This is down some 14 per cent on the amount provided the year before. I know that funds provided for the soil conservation services in that State have been increased. The point is that the Federal Government is providing a tax concession and, through our tax reimbursement grants, is giving funds to the States which properly have this responsibility. I share the honourable gentleman's concern that it is of prime importance to Australia that the landholder and State governments exercise their responsibilities. I hope that as a result of this discussion of a matter of public importance they do so. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AV4">Mr HURFORD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have made the point. I am grateful to the Leader of the House for postponing the Committee stages so that proper attention can be given to the amendments. The purpose of this Bill is to introduce new methods for valuing goods for import duty purposes. The new methods of valuation are in accordance with the customs valuation code which was agreed to at the Tokyo Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The new code replaces the current system which is based on the Brussels Definition of Value. This system was drawn up in 1950 and was adopted by Australia in 1976. Although about 100 nations have also adopted this code, others, including such important trading nations as Canada and the United States, have rejected it. The fact that this is so means that, indeed, the Opposition-when we learn this part of the information-gives even greater attention than might otherwise be given to what might be called a machinery measure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> An internationally agreed code clearly is significantly more acceptable than a profusion of rival codes, in particular, because where no standard is agreed, nations bring into use unfair valuation methods as an artifical barrier to trade. The importance of valuations for duty purposes is, of course, the fact that the higher the valuation the higher the duty. The codes used before the introduction of the new system, including the Brussels Convention, were open to some abuse in this respect because they were based on notional values-that is, the value declared at entry was not accepted as the value for customs purposes. Rather, it was based on a notional price which, it was assumed, the imported goods would obtain in open market between buyers and sellers, if those buyers and sellers were operating at arm's length. </PARA>
<PARA> The new system is more objective. It begins with the actual transaction price and it adds other objectively determined costs to obtain the value for duty. It is possible that this new system will involve greater administrative efforts by importers who must adapt to these new procedures. But this will be offset by the three main advantages of this new scheme. I want to relate to the House what those three advantages are, as I see them. The first is that it is internationally agreed and so this all contributes to the promotion of trade between nations. Certainly my party supports the facilitation of that trade. Secondly, it is an objective value. Thirdly, it is more easily administered by the Collector of Customs. For these reasons the Opposition, I repeat, supports this Bill just as it has supported, in general, the outcome of multilateral trade negotiations in the past, for example, the anti-dumping code and the subsidies and countervailing duties codes. </PARA>
<PARA> In supporting the code and this legislation we, in the Opposition are, however, concerned that it is monitored closely as the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Moore) in his second reading speech and, I believe, on other occasions has promised. He has said that the adoption of the new valuation system will not have widespread consequences for levels of tariff assistance now provided for Australian industry. We take that to be true. We accept those assurances as being based on the very best information available to the Minister at this stage, but agree that in the event that any industry finds itself facing injury as a result of a significant unforseen fall in effective tariff protection, then a reference should be sent to the Industries Assistance Commission or, indeed, if it is more serious and more urgent, to the Temporary Assistance Authority in order that appropriate variations in duty rates and appropriate protection for those affected can be made. </PARA>
<PARA> Tariff protection is of considerable importance. There is an incorrect assumption in the thinking of a large number of our political opponents in the Liberal and National Country parties that levels of protection for Australian industry should be cut across the board. There is grave concern at the moment in the community about this. It would be most inappropriate, we in the Labor Party believe, at a time of temporary massive capital inflow to seek to dismantle large sections of manufacturing industry as a response. The facts are that Australia is facing, yet again, a sustained increase in the level of unemployment. Moreover our balance of trade has moved into deficit. The balance on current account is in a massive and unpredictable deficit. </PARA>
<PARA> These experiences highlight how inappropriate tariff reductions can be in response to short term economic conditions. The conditions that led to calls for tariff reductions earlier this year have already changed substantially. The manufacturing sector of the Australian economy, as the recent quarterly survey of the Confederation of Australian Industry reveals this week, shows a slowing of output growth and the halting of employment growth. Expectations are 'rather more subdued'. So, there is no cause for optimism about the state of Australian manufacturing industry right now. This is no surprise because it stems from the general economic mismanagement perpetrated by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to go through some of the errors in the economic strategy. The dollar has been appreciated at the cost of manufacturing competitiveness by about 11 per cent since last year. Although there may be a temporary devaluation at the present time, it is only very small in comparison with the general appreciation over the last 12 or 13 months. This is causing such grave concern to many who are creating employment in this country by competing against imports and, indeed, creating employment by getting out into the export world and competing against others. Any appreciation in our currency of this order will give them far greater difficulties than would otherwise apply. A second element of mismanagement-my list will not be comprehensive in this debate today-is the razor gang's operations where programs of business assistance have been cut and reduced consumer confidence has thereby resulted. There is the fact of increased taxes on most manufactured goods and also the fact that the monetary policies of the Government have reduced the availability and raised the cost of loan finance for business. </PARA>
<PARA> Lastly in this rather short and incomplete list, there is the threat to the motor vehicle industry which has damaged the prospects of the manufacturing sector in the vast range of industries which supply the automotive producers. The Federation of Automotive Products Manufacturers is meeting in Canberra at the present time. Never has it met at a time of greater threat to its industry. The sooner the Government makes its decision and the sooner the Government realises that those decisions must be for the future health of that industry the better it will be for those who have invested in the industry, for those who work in the industry and for those who are sadly unemployed in this country at the present time and who need jobs so badly. </PARA>
<PARA> For all these reasons, and others, I believe it can be said that the Government has damaged the Australian economy, particularly the manufacturing sector. For that general reason as well we must ensure that further uncertainty is not caused by a new system for striking customs duties which are so important for local manufacturing industry. That puts this Bill into a correct perspective. With that note of warning I repeat the Opposition's support for this legislation. We want fair and open trade to develop with improvements made on a planned basis after due consideration by the IAC processes. We do not want random changes in areas of administration which have unintended effects. We certainly do not want the sort of inquiries that are going on at the moment into the general level of tariffs with the extraordinary request that such an inquiry by the IAC should be completed in six months and that other inquiry into the general level of assistance to industry also be completed in six months. It seems so unreal that anything of a worthwhile nature could be done in such a short space of time. The only result of such action is, of course, to increase the uncertainty in the manufacturing sector, one of the big hopes we have of reducing unemployment in our community. In my view the Government is destructive of the Australian economy more than enough, without added concern in an area such as this one. </PARA>
<PARA> While dealing with these matters I will say something about the Subsidies and Countervailing Measures Code which has recently been adopted and officially agreed to by the present Fraser Government. In a speech the Minister for Trade and Resources (Mr Anthony) made outside this Parliament to the Australian Industries Development Association annual general meeting on Friday 9 October. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Governments of the major trading nations, including Australia, have devoted increasing attention to the problems of protectionism arising from the use of non-tariff barriers on internationally traded industrial products. A prime example of this is the use of standards to protect domestic industries and the emergence of the Multilateral Trade Negotiations of a Standards Code or, as it is more correctly called, the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade. </PARA>
<PARA> This Code establishes rules and procedures to ensure that technical regulations or standards adopted for reasons related to health, safety, quarantine and consumer or environmental protection are not used to create unreasonable barriers to trade. Membership of the Code requires the use of international standards as the basis for technical regulations and standards, except where inappropriate for the protection of national security or similar reasons. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Trade and Resources pointed out that the Government, when it announced several months ago that it would adopt that Code, said that our country would join the Standards Codes. He indicated:</PARA>
<PARA>That membership would assist our efforts to achieve improved access to world markets where our exports face unreasonable restrictive or discriminatory standards. </PARA>
<PARA>In part of his speech to the IADA he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government recently announced that Australia has joined the Subsidies and Countervailing Duties Code which seeks to ensure that subsidies do not harm trading interests and that countervailing measures do not unjustifiably impede international trade. Some time ago, I indicated that Australia had decided to join this Code only if appropriate arrangements could be negotiated to safeguard Australia's right to use export incentive arrangements which do not materially harm the interests of our trading partners. These negotiations were necessary because the United States considers the Government's present export incentives schemes to be contrary to the Code. Our membership of the Code was therefore effectively blocked which in turn meant that Australian exports were denied the right under US legislation to the benefit of a material injury test in US subsidy investigations. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Government's decision to join that Code has caused a certain amount of consternation in various business sectors. However, the Opposition is taking the statements of the Deputy Prime Minister and others at their face value that certain interests of ours have been safeguarded. He pointed out that the consequences of this United States attitude were highlighted when there was United States countervailing action on our lamb exports. If that precedent were established it would effectively enable the United States Government, on the request of any United States industry, to countervail any Australian exports which received assistance under a very broad range of alleged subsidies, including grants under Australia's current Export Incentive Scheme. A most serious threat was therefore posed to Australia's export industries. But the Minister has assured us, and the Opposition accepts it, that Code membership has put a brake on any future investigations of our exports to the United States which may be considerably more significant for Australian exports than just the case of lamb. So the decision to join the Code has been-and I reiterate, is being-supported by the Opposition because it has been made possible by a bilateral understanding with the United States which we have been told about and which involves the provisional application of the Code between the two countries on the basis of certain reciprocal expectations. </PARA>
<PARA> Our country we have been told-we accept this at face value-expects that the United States will not operate its export assistance system in a manner inconsistent with the Code beyond the middle of 1983. For its part the United States expects that Australia will not operate export subsidies on minerals and manufactured products which are inconsistent with the Code beyond that same date. That is worrying in itself except that we are assured that this does not preclude Australia from introducing new export incentive schemes, provided they are consistent with the Code. I am confused about this matter. At a recent meeting of the relevant Estimates Committee, when it examined the estimates of the Department of Trade and Resources-I have not had an opportunity to examine the transcript in recent hours-I thought that the Secretary of the Department of Trade and Resources, Mr Scully, in the absence of the Minister, told me fairly and squarely, without equivocation, that our existing export schemes were not in any way contravening the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade rules. But here we have, in the Minister's speech, the doubt raised whether or not they do contravene those rules. But we are given the assurance that the export subsidies will be altered, if necessary, to be consistent with the Code. I hope that at the same time that will not mean that the subsidies are less effective than they are at the present time because if ever there was a need for assisting the exports of this nation, it is now as we can see from the very adverse balance of trade announced this week. The announcement caused quite grave shock waves. The Minister went on to say in his speech:</PARA>
<PARA> Additionally Code membership will not limit Australia's right to maintain other subsidies which do not cause or threaten damage to other Code signatories. </PARA>
<PARA>We trust that that will be so. Australia has made it quite clear that it is dissatisfied with some aspects of the Code. For instance, the discipline on export subsidies for agricultural products are less rigid that those which apply to minerals and manufactured products. The Opposition expects this imbalance to be redressed and the Government has promised that it will seek to do something about the matter. If there is insufficient progress in this area or problems arise from our inability to continue export incentive schemes which may operate for non-agricultural products, Australia will, if necessary, the Minister promised us-the Opposition supports this-consider withdrawing from the Code. Our experience as a member of the Code will be reviewed, we are promised, and it is on this basis that the Opposition has supported the Government's actions in that area. I welcome the opportunity to put the Opposition's view, as this is something causing an amount of concern in some sectors of industry. Once again it is a bipartisan approach. Just as we support this Customs (Valuations) Amendment Bill, so, with the assurances given by the Deputy Prime Minister in that speech, we support Australia's adoption of the Code. I am happy to be able to say that we too will be monitoring the situation closely. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to this relatively straightforward and simple but quite important measure, the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford), as usual, has not been able to forsake making a number of tilts at the Government's overall policies. The things he said are rather hollow, I think, coming from one who was a part of the Labor Administration of 1973-75 whose policies resulted in a massive boost to inflation, which saw the cutting of tariffs-beginning with the across the board cut of 1973-which had such disastrous effects on the confidence of Australian industry, which saw a halving of the then prevailing export incentive schemes, which saw the abolition of the investment allowance and which saw for most of that period a significant upvaluing of the Australian dollar-all of which contributed to the most disastrous fall in activity in the Australian manufacturing industry and the emergence of very high levels of unemployment. So, I think it perhaps ill becomes the honourable member for Adelaide to take the tilts at this Government's policy that he has taken.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Industry policy, which is affected by the measure before the House, is a wide-ranging matter that covers the general economic environment, and hence the Government's overall economic policy, as well as specific measures of industry policy and, of course, the tariff, subsidy and assistance structure which is part and parcel of the overall policy. In point of fact, as the Australian electorate knows well, as a result of the Government's consistent policy to contain inflation, the international competitiveness of Australian industry, that is, its ability to produce in competition with imports and to export, has been restored to the sort of situation that prevailed before all the events in the early period of the 1970s that I was detailing a moment ago. As a result of the sound policies of this Government, there has been a very significant expansion in non-farm product in this country. This country has set out upon an era of new development practically unparalleled in its history. I think we would have to go back to the goldrush days to see a parallel. In fact, over the last year there has been an expansion of demand and output in Australia of 4 per cent to 5 per cent, which is practically the fastest rate of real economic growth of all the major Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries-the major industrialised countries in the world. Australia is the envy of the major industrialised countries of the world in this respect. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member referred to the impact of interest rates on industry. I take the opportunity, therefore, of stressing once again that the whole thrust of the recent Budget brought down by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) is to ease and, hopefully, to reverse the upward pressure on interest rates. Of course, interest rates are of great concern to industry, particularly to small business and, indeed, to most Australian families. That is why that policy has been adopted as the key thrust of the Budget. The purpose of the large domestic surplus that was budgeted for is to reduce the totality of the Government's borrowing and, therefore, to take the upward pressure off interest rates so that the process of bringing interest rates down can be started. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the general environment in which industry operates and it has not been healthier for many years. Within that context, the Government has a positive industrial development policy, of which the export assistance to which the honourable member made reference is a key element and of which industrial research and development grants are a key element, to stimulate and to bring about the more export-oriented, technologically advanced, more specialised and larger scale industry that we all want to see. Part and parcel of that policy is an area to which the honourable member referred and which is raised by the Customs (Valuations) Amendment Bill now before the House: It is important that there be a concern that the adoption of this new valuation procedure does not adversely affect the degree of effective protection afforded industry. That concern can be allayed but as background to that the honourable member made reference to the Government's policy of assistance to industry including tariff measures, bounties and quotas. </PARA>
<PARA> Lest there be any misunderstanding, let me assert that this Government is committed to the reasonable and adequate protection of Australian industry, but it is committed to that within a long term context and objective of a gradual movement towards a lower and less complicated structure of assistance. I believe the Government's commitment there is in line with a widespread consensus within the community, including business and industry, that it is appropriate to look towards a gradual, planned and phased move towards a lower and less complicated pattern of tariff and quota assistance. But I stress-I am grateful that the honourable member for Adelaide who is responsible for these matters on behalf of the Opposition really agrees with me-that that consensus relates to a long term context of change. This looking to a gradual phased lowering of protection involves looking to a long term context of change and restructuring associated with a lowering of costs in industry and, along with that as both instrument and effect, a lowering of the degree of assistance. But I assert-I am sure he would agree with me-that there is no consensus at all; indeed, it is entirely wrong-headed to think of a major cut in protection as a short term policy instrument for controlling the money supply and exchange rate pressures, or as a direct counter to inflation. Specifically there is no case at all for anything of the nature of the across-the-board tariff cuts that we witnessed in 1973. </PARA>
<PARA> The pursuit of significant tariff reduction is a gradual, long term matter. It involves participating in international negotiations for reciprocal reductions of tariffs and in negotiations relating to the matters that are before the House at the moment, as embodied in the Customs (Valuations) Amendment Bill. Unfortunately, the absolutely exorbitant and prohibitive agricultural protectionism that we see in the European Economic Community hardly ever comes within the purview of such negotiations. It is very important that it should. Australia participates in those negotiations. Then there is the process involving the continuing thrust towards lower levels of protection and more flexible arrangements in particular areas, such as last year in the textiles, clothing and footwear industries, where there was the introduction of bounties at the level of yarn production and spinning with a view to reducing costs at higher stages, a simplification of the quota categories and the putting of an increasing proportion of quota to tender with a view to reproducing more closely what would happen in a market situation. And indeed, confronting the Government at the moment is the motor vehicle industry decision. The honourable member has raised it, so I shall make a comment in passing on it. </PARA>
<PARA> We are talking of a decision about the motor vehicle industry which relates to the arrangements to apply in that industry after 1984, from 1 January 1985. Admittedly there are lengthy lead times in this industry and it is important to get the decision made, but the final report of the Industries Assistance Commission was received only at the end of June so that there has been a delay of only a month or two in order to give this very important matter effective consideration in looking to arrangements which are to apply, as I said, from 1 January 1985. It is carping criticism to suggest that the Government is, in some way, dragging its heels in this matter. It is a major decision which has to be taken with care. I can avert that it will be a decision which will look to a real but gradual reduction in the assistance afforded to that industry. Let me hasten to say that it is not a decision as to whether there should or should not be assistance to the industry. Substantial protection has been recommended by the Government's advisory body, the IAC. It is a question of the extent and the form of the assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> This matter has to be very carefully thought through. The motor vehicle industry is a major contributor, as the base load of Australian manufacturing. We want to see the retention of a sizable motor manufacturing industry in Australia. I am sure that the honourable member will agree with me that the current position is not an option. There has to be significant change in this industry and a principal matter at issue is not whether there should be significant change associated with a reduction in protection, but the pace of that change. The capacity to absorb change is a matter to which we have to take note. I am confident that an appropriate decision in this matter will be taken within the next month or so. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the broad thinking of the Government in this matter of tariffs and industry policy. The most important thing-I come back to this matter as I conclude-that one can do for industry is to get the overall environment right, to contain inflation and to set the general economic parameters of the economy so that one achieves significant economic growth in the context of the restored competitive position of Australian industry. This is the greatest contribution that this Government has made to the restoration of manufacturing industry in particular and other sectors of industry in general. </PARA>
<PARA> The main purpose of the present measure is, as the honourable member has said, to introduce new provisions for the valuation of imported goods for customs duty purposes. I do not know whether I misheard the honourable member. I thought he suggested at the beginning of his speech that the code which emerged, this basis of valuation of imports, from the Tokyo Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and trade had not been adopted by the United States of America. Did I mishear him? In fact, it has been. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I see. It has been. We are adopting a code which has, in fact, been adopted by all the major trading nations and groups. It is in line with the valuation system practices in the United States of America, Japan and the EEC. I could list others. So it does, in this matter of valuation, bring Australia into line with the major trading countries of the world and thus with the mainstream of the international trading system. It is a process of valuation which, as the honourable member said, replaces the Brussels Definition of Value with a valuation which is more positive in the sense that it starts where appropriate, and in most instances that will be the case, from actual prices and charges for imported goods. The Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Moore), in his second reading speech, set out the circumstances in which on ocassions that may not be appropriate and the steps that are then provided for in this legislation to be taken to ensure an appropriate valuation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I conclude by stressing again the point that it is a valuation procedure which is in line with that adopted by the major trading countries and groups of the world. It is appropriate that we come into line. The second point is that the government expects-I notice that the honourable member has accepted this-that it will not have widespread consequences for the levels of tariff protection now provided to Australian industry. Indeed, the best estimates that can be made indicate that, at most, it is likely to affect marginally the import values for tariff purposes, perhaps by the order of one to 2 per cent in most cases. There may be some particular cases-perfumery was a particular case-where this valuation made a significant difference. That industry was, in fact, reviewed by the IAC last year and new recommendations were made in the light of this new valuation system. The Government has every intention, as the honourable member has suggested it should, of referring cases where there is any difficulty to the Industries Assistance Commission. In addition, the new system makes customs valuation more predictable for importers and, as I understand it, it does have the support of organisations involved in or representing persons importing goods as well as organisations representing local manufacturers. With those remarks, I commend to the House this change, which has the purpose, as I said, of bringing Australia into line with the major trading nations of the world and the mainstream of the international trading system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Customs (Valuations) Amendment Bill is straightforward. Indeed I was going to confine my remarks to the legislation, which would not have taken very long, but I feel that prior to doing that a few remarks made by the honourable member for Berowra (Dr Edwards) should be answered. I believe that the honourable member misled the House earlier in his speech when he spoke about the Whitlam years of 1973-75. A few of the things, of course, that he failed--</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9M7">Mr MOUNTFORD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the honourable gentleman listens he will find out. It is not what he said, it is what he failed to say. He failed to mention that when the Whitlam Government came to office in 1972 it inherited an already overheated economy and an undervalued currency. International inflation was occurring with great spurts, due mainly to the United States policy of financing the Vietnam war. What was happening here with inflation was happening in other countries. Also during the period when the Whitlam Government was in office, as honourable members might recall, we had tremendous hikes in Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries' oil prices which had tremendous repercussions right throughout the world. In fact the economies of some countries, for instance Japan, were shot to pieces because of those tremendous hikes in oil prices during that time. I think what the honourable gentleman said earlier about the 1973-75 period was not correct. Irrespective of that, people are worried about what is happening in 1981 and in fact what is happening since this Government came to office. What we see at present is a very high level of unemployment, and it is continuing to grow. A lot of Australian industries presently are threatened. Despite the Government's promises to reduce the level of inflation below the 10 per cent mark, at present, it is on its way up again and presently is running at around 10.75 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Perhaps having made those few remarks, Mr Deputy Speaker, we can come back to the legislation. The main purpose of this Bill is to amend the Customs Act 1901 to introduce new provisions for the valuation of imported goods for customs duty purposes. The new valuation provisions are designed to give effect to the agreement on implementation of article 7 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The Government decided to adopt this agreement in May 1980 on a free on board basis. The decision to adopt the agreement took into account the views of State governments, industry associations and other interested groups within the importing community. Presently Customs valuation is based upon the Brussels Definition of Value which provides for the valuation of imported goods on a notional basis by comparing each actual transaction with an ideal transaction in which all the circumstances conform with an entirely open market or an arms length situation. </PARA>
<PARA> The new valuation system provided for by this Bill differs from the present system to the extent that it is a positive system, using actual prices and charges to arrive at a dutiable value for Customs purposes. The principal method of valuation of imported goods for Customs duty purposes will henceforth be based on the transaction value of imported goods. The transaction value will be the price actually paid or payable for imported goods when sold for export to the country of importation after certain adjustments have been made to that price. Where the transaction value of the imported goods cannot be used as the basis for their valuation a sequence of five alternative methods is provided. If all these methods fail to establish a value for Customs purposes there is provision under proposed new sub-section 157 (8) for the Comptroller-General of Customs to determine the value. The adoption of the GATT valuation will bring Australia into line with the valuation system practised by other major trading nations. Basically, under the valuation changes, imported goods will be valued on the basis of their invoice prices rather than on an average price of the goods in the country of origin. The aim of the change has been to provide more certainty to Customs valuation. </PARA>
<PARA> As the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) stated, the Opposition does not oppose these measures because the need for such a change in valuation of goods obviously has become necessary. However, one must ask this question: Why has it taken the Government since May 1980 to bring in these measures? While quite a long period of delay has been in existence the business community has been able to import goods into Australia at a value rate lower than the true rate. The Government's reluctance to quickly bring in these measures has benefited the business community and at the same time has denied the Government its proper revenue share through the importation of goods into Australia during that period. Whilst supporting the Bill we trust that the Government will closely monitor the situation to ensure that government revenue is not lost through the false valuation of imported goods. Trade in and out of Australia is very important to our economy and should be encouraged. The proposed valuation of goods for Customs import duty purposes will not impede trade but will only place the business community in Australia on an equal footing with its counterparts in most other trading countries that have adopted the GATT agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying how important it is for Australia to retain a strong manufacturing industry. This in no way implies that I do not think that some improvements can or should be made to production methods and also methods to create greater economies in Australia's existing manufacturing industries. I feel that present statements by the Government in which it is suggested that some Australian manufacturing industries will have their assistance removed so that they can go to the wall, as some have in previous years, will do nothing but great damage to the Australian economy and the Australian community. I think it is a falsification to assume that if freer trade exists between Australia and other nations, prices will be lowered. Certainly they may be lowered in the short term, but in the long term if we remove the element of competition by doing away with our local manufacturing processors I believe that prices inevitably will rise. I feel that history has proved that to Australia and it certainly has proved it to other countries. I commend the Government on bringing forward this legislation but again query the delay in bringing it forward since the Government agreed in May 1980 to be a party to the GATT agreement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the debate was interrupted last night I was discussing the fact that at Estimates committee hearings this year there was not enough time to cover the whole gamut of the Transport portfolio. It is a huge department; I understand that it is the second or third biggest department in the Commonwealth Government. I was appealing especially for more time to be given to debates on the Estimates in future years. I mentioned also last night that during the time that we had for discussing the estimates for the Department of Transport we did not manage to discuss the international aviation situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I expressed concern at what Australia's future policy may be in light of the fact that the Government is about to embark on yet another review of Australia's international civil aviation policy. I was pleased to hear the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt), in response to a question of mine this morning, indicate that the preliminary work by Sir David Hay and members of the Department of Transport had almost been completed; that it was hoped that shortly we would hear the guidelines for the proposed review; and that, most importantly, the review would not be kept within the Department of Transport. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose that our minds go back to the ill-fated international civil aviation policy review of a couple of years ago. That review was held behind closed doors and we had a situation in which the Department of Transport sat in judgment of its own decisions and its own policies. At a time when the international world of aviation is in a state of turmoil-indeed, the situation is difficult for a number of international operators-it is absolutely essential that the proposed review should be as broad-ranging as possible, as probing as possible, to make sure that Australia does not get itself into the situation in which a number of overseas countries find themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose that we have to look around the world today and see what is happening, with record losses being announced by operators such as British Airways and Pan American World Airways Inc. Indeed, I understand that Qantas Airways Ltd sustained quite a substantial loss during last financial year and that is extending into this financial year. It was reported in the Press this morning that, because of strikes and various other factors, Qantas could be facing a $20m loss for the first six months of this year. That must concern us all. There is a feeling abroad that there need to be some very real changes in the nature of Australia's civil aviation policies. I believe that this feeling comes not only from the travelling public but also from State governments, State tourist corporations, the travel industry generally and the hotel and other tourist operators that are now scattered around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Tourism has been expanding tremendously in the last few years. At a time when tourism is fast heading towards a situation in which it will become a net income earner for the country, we certainly do not want to lose any edge that we may have in that market at the moment. Of course, so much of the future of the tourist industry and the wealth that it can provide will hinge on the decisions which will be made in the coming weeks by virtue of the new international civil aviation policy review. It is essential that that review should look at the entire structure of airlines in Australia. There is no doubt that Qantas has had some difficulties in the past and that there is room for expansion of our domestic airlines into some of the regional routes. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose that that has been exemplified in recent days with, for example, the announcement that Air New Zealand Ltd is dropping no fewer than 13 services between Brisbane and New Zealand and between Sydney and New Zealand. One of the factors which could be cited as a reason for the cancellation is not only a lack of patronage but also the type of equipment being used by a number of the international carriers operating on the short-haul routes into Australia is too big for the job. Air New Zealand is using 747s and DC10s and Qantas is using 747s on the trans-Tasman route, but those aircraft are just too big for the job. The 747 was never really designed for short-haul traffic anyway. </PARA>
<PARA> We can look at the situation that has existed since the opening up of the Christchurch-Hobart run, on which both Ansett Airlines of Australia and Trans Australia Airlines are using 727-200 series Boeing jets. The interesting thing is that TAA's operations on that run are already profitable. That was a case of horses for courses-the 727 was an ideal aircraft to operate on that route. With hindsight it would be easy to say that perhaps Qantas should have ordered 727s, Airbus equipment or something smaller than the present Boeings which they operate, in order to operate that service. But that is with hindsight. We must look to the future and the last thing which I think we would want to see would be a deprivation of any services which may be operating in and out of Australia at the moment. Obviously one of the very real issues which should be faced by the new international civil aviation policy review is allowing the domestic operators to move into some of those short-haul routes. That is not to say that we should not be looking at the other side of the argument, too, whereby perhaps Qantas could be involved in some of the long-haul domestic traffic in Australia. We hope that that sort of rationalisation may come about. </PARA>
<PARA> We should also be looking at the competitive nature of the fare structures that can be set up between Australia and other countries. One of the interesting happenings of the last few weeks was that the Department of Transport dropped the prosecutions of Singapore Airlines Ltd, TAA and travel agents in Hobart for the price cutting of international airline tickets. Frankly, I welcome that move by the Department of Transport because we were saddled with section 106A of the Air Navigation Regulations, which was never really practical but which tried to enforce that old international civil aviation policy. I think we have already an indication of what a little open competition can do in that market-place as a result of that decision, because within days all the major international airlines were entering into the net fare field. Already it is possible for Australians to travel between Australia and London on the new open slather fares for less than $1,000 return. The international airlines are quite openly flouting these fares of $950 to $1,000. I think that can be commended. In fact Qantas-and quite rightly so-has entered into the net fare market. I appreciate that Qantas must also be competitive. I welcome that move by the board and the management of Qantas to start getting into the market-place and competing. Just how low the fares could go is not for me to judge. It is interesting, if one reads some of the London Sunday newspapers in the Parliamentary Library, to see the fares to Australia that are being offered at the moment through some of the travel agents in Great Britain. One fare that was offered in the Sunday Observer of 4 October from London to Australia was #Stg234. That is not an unusual fare. It is on a scheduled carrier. That fare is being advertised quite openly and obviously is being sold. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe there is some very real room to move in the structure of international air fares in these coming months, provided that the civil aviation policy review committee looks very closely indeed at getting the optimum amount of competition into that market. As I have said, at a time when conditions in the international aviation industry are tight, to say the least, it is interesting to note that those airlines that are competitive, that are going out after that traffic, are doing extremely well. I have mentioned once before in the House the situation on the London-Miami route where no fewer than five international carriers are now operating, including a relatively new airline in the United States of America called Air Florida. The fact that that route was opened to competition brought some interesting results. All five carriers on that route are operating profitably. The story concerning Air Florida is an interesting one. In the first 12 month period of operations, its traffic went up 55.6 per cent to 1.8 million people. It had a 156 per cent increase in revenue to $US114m and a 110 per cent increase in profit to $5.1m although it was operating on the lowest fares on that route. There is no reason why Qantas need not go into that sort of market and promote vigorously overseas and at home. There is no reason why more competition could not be introduced to open up the whole market. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speek mainly on the estimates for the Department of Finance. During this debate we have heard mainly contributions in relation to the Department of Transport, but as a number of departments were covered by Estimates Committee D I hope that we will find that each one of the headings is related to in this debate when we are reporting the deliberations of what took place in committee rooms away from this chamber. First of all, I wish to make some general remarks about the committee system. In the past there has been criticism of the functioning of these House of Representatives Estimates committees. In my view some of that criticism has been well founded, but perhaps not enough of it has been of a constructive nature.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This year, I attended and participated in the deliberations of committees covering six departments of State, but only one under this heading of Estimates Committee D, that is, the Department of Finance as I mentioned earlier. Under other committees, the Department of Industry and Commerce, the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs, the Parliament, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Department of Trade and Resources and the Department of Finance-on which I intend to concentrate today-were dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA> Without wishing to be too critical, it is clear to me that this committee system, as it is presently constituted, has room for a lot of improvement. It is not by any means perfect. On the positive side, the committees provide a useful source of information for members from both sides of the House. They can provide a relatively speedy and time-efficient way of obtaining detailed views from Ministers, or from officers through Ministers, on the present workings of their departments, which information can be gleaned other than through this committee system only by the rather laborious and delay-riddled process of putting questions on notice and awaiting months, as is the present practice, to get answers to those written questions. In my experience, to the credit of the public servants present at those committee hearings, they are always well briefed and very helpful. Yet, as I indicated earlier, I believe there are imperfections. The time for preparation is inadequate. The Minister, if he so chooses, can be extremely unhelpful to a committee in its deliberations. We get some one-word answers at times from some Ministers. I hasten to add that that did not apply to the Treasurer (Mr Howard) who, in the case of the Department of Finance, answered for the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle). He is not used to one-word replies and I am glad that he did not give them in this instance. The endeavours of the committee can be constantly interrupted by other parliamentary duties such as the bells ringing, voting in the chamber and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> If the committees are to fulfil their potential, in my view, as a means of improving the quality of Government and the role of all back benchers, those committees must first be taken seriously by the Executive of this nation. At present the committees are too much of a mixed grill. There must be a certain understandable and necessary reluctance on the part of members to give committee work a high priority if they have the fear in the backs of their minds that, if a Minister wishes either to inhibit a committee's deliberations or, worse still, to use a committee to attempt to score political points from the Opposition or, indeed, his or her colleagues, he or she has the capacity to do so. A lot depends on the attitude of the Minister concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> Such a situation does not point to any high degree of efficiency in the running of the affairs of the Government or of the Parliament. Government must be open and democratic but it must be efficient also. I repeat that it depends so much on the attitude of the Minister. Perhaps that is one of the values of the committee system inasmuch as one is able to gauge to a greater extent the attitude of the Minister concerned to the Parliament and whether he has a respect for parliamentary procedures. Also, of course, beyond that, one can gauge whether a department is being run efficiently and a Minister has control over his or her department. </PARA>
<PARA> Stated generally, it is the function of the Department of Finance to which I now turn to evaluate government expenditure proposals and programs, collect and analyse forward estimates of expenditure, and to administer the public accounts and so on. To use the Treasurer's own words, the Department was founded in an attempt 'to give a greater concentration on specialist expenditure control'. Within that charter, the Department looks also at forward Estimates with a three-year horizon. To some extent, the Department represents a very tentative attempt on the part of the Government to engage in some form of planning. We on this side of the House are absolutely certain that we want to bring in a form of indicative planning in this country, more forward estimating and more forecasting. Indeed, it will be most important for the government sector that this Department improves its procedures. It is a form of planning which is a little, but not much more than that, indicative in nature. This Department is largely confined to monitoring the public sector. </PARA>
<PARA> As an exercise in planning, it is pretty unambitious at present. The Department has a proposed staff ceiling of 1290 to June 1982. I believe that more effective use could be made by the Government of the expertise of this Department than is being made at present. The results are not outward looking enough. Even we, as parliamentarians, have difficulty because of the lack of explanatory material provided by the Department in relation to statements on the trends of government expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> In the course of my questioning at this Committee hearing, I asked the Treasurer a number of questions about the role of the Department and the formation of goverment economic policy and its relationship with other departments of State-that is, the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Public Service Board and so on. My concern was-indeed, still is-that there is unnecessary duplication between these and sections of the service as it is now structured. But, at the same time, I have a strong feeling that alternative advice ought to be given, particularly on economic strategy. All the talent in the bureaucracy in the administration of this nation should be encouraged, where there is indeed talent, to come forward and give views so that not just one set of views is being given to the Government through the head of the Department of the Treasury. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Prior to the suspension of the sitting I was speaking on the report of Estimates Committee D. I directed my remarks to the experience I had as a member of the Committee investigating the estimates of the Department of Finance. I said that in my view it is important that economic departments other than the Treasury should present economic advice so that a variety of advice is available to Ministers. When the Australian Labor Party takes over the reins of government it will introduce some medium and long term planning of worth for this nation for the first time in its history. We will then be able to compare ourselves with almost every other nation in recognising that there are longer term objectives as well as short term needs. In my view, the Department of Finance should look after the income or revenue side of government as well as the expenditure side of government. It would then, of course, have even more responsibility to give alternative economic advice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To be frank, the Fraser Government's record in the area of economic forecasting has been less than inspiring. Some statistics have been, to use a word of the previous Treasurer, now the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch), 'rubbery'. To illustrate this I point out, firstly, that since 1977 the present Treasurer has never got M3 right. Secondly, the Government, despite enthusiastic support at another Estimates committee by departmental officials for our export incentive scheme, is proceeding to dismantle that scheme and others which are of help to industry in the face of a deteriorating balance of payments situation. My third point is that the Budget strategy is wrong, as revealed by the balance of payments figures. </PARA>

<PARA> I want to refer to tax avoidance in particular. I make the point that a notable feature of the Government's action in this area is the way in which it has had to be spurred into action by the Opposition. A good example occurred during the debate on the Estimates Committee dealing with the Treasury. I raised with the Treasurer (Mr Howard) his lack of action on the blatant avoidance of the short term capital gains tax, under section 26AAA of the Income Tax Assessment Act, by the Bell group of companies and the Bond corporation. This involved the simple device of placing shares bought in the process of a share raid in a subsidiary company, the sole assets of which were these shares, and selling the company rather than the shares at a greatly increased valuation, so avoiding short term capital gains tax. The Bell group did this in March of this year. We raised the issue then. On 9 April the Treasurer said in the House that he would put recommendations to the Government regarding this matter shortly. By 9 September when the Estimates Committee dealing with the Treasury met no action had been announced. The matter was raised that day and, quite remarkably, the Treasurer was able to make a statement to the House the very next day announcing action to prevent the use of this tax loophole. That is one example of the Government being spurred into action by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> Another example involves avoidance through the misuse of the taxation incentives for the arts scheme. In April of this year it was revealed that a donation of pre-Columbian art to the National Gallery of Victoria was used to claim a tax deduction of $3.7m for a group of 22 businessmen who paid only $1.2m for the collection. This matter was raised by the Opposition at that time. The Treasurer said that he would ask the Commissioner of Taxation to examine the matter to see what legislative and administrative changes needed to be made. On Tuesday of this week, when debating the income tax Bills in this House, I drew attention to the fact that nothing had been done about this avoidance scheme six months after the issue had come to light. The very next day-yesterday-the Treasurer announced action to prevent tax avoidance by this means. He announced it by issuing a Press release rather than by making any statement to the House although the House was meeting yesterday. That statement bears all the hallmarks of hasty and ill-considered compilation. This is especially so in that it contains a glaring gap which will doubtless be exploited in the future to enable tax avoidance to proceed through this scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> I will say a few words in more detail about this tax avoidance scheme. It exploits section 78Aa of the Income Tax Assessment Act, which allows a tax deduction for gifts of property to the Australiana Fund, public art galleries, libraries or museums. As the section now stands, the gifts qualify for deduction irrespective of when or how the property was acquired by the donor. The amount of the deduction is the value of the property at the time of gift based on the average of two or more valuations by approved valuers, subject to the Commissioner being satisfied that this amount fairly represents the value of the property. In the case I have already mentioned involving the National Gallery of Victoria the syndicate purchased the collection for $1.2m after being advised that it had been valued at $3.7m by three overseas valuers. Members of the syndicate knew before they bought the collection that they could obtain much more from the tax deduction than they would be able to obtain on a claim based on the outlay to purchase the collection. They knew that they would make a substantial tax gain from making this purchase and donating the collection. The deduction was based on the valuation rather than the lower purchase price. They were able to claim a deduction of $3.7m, three times their initial outlay. Total tax savings would thus have amounted to $2.2m if all investors were paying the top margin of tax rate. If each had contributed equally to the purchase price and paid $54,545 they could claim a donation of $168,182 and save tax of $100,909, almost double the initial outlay. </PARA>
<PARA> This scheme was successful only because the Government had liberalised the donation rules in 1978. Previously deductions had been allowed only when the property was purchased by the donor within the preceding 12 months and the deduction was limited to the lesser of the value at the time of gift or its cost to the donor. The 1978 changes abolished the 12 months requirement and allowed revaluation at the time of gift, regardless of the fact that this could be far in excess of the purchase price. The Treasurer's statement indicates that the Government now proposes to move back towards the pre-1978 rules. When the property is donated within 12 months of acquisition the deduction will be limited to the lesser of the value of the property or its cost except for property inherited by the donor. In an attempt to ensure that these rules are not avoided by holding property for over 12 months prior to making a gift, the deduction will again be restricted in such a case to the lesser valuation or cost where the property was acquired for the purpose of making a donation or is subject to an agreement about donation. However, these changes will still leave this scheme wide open for abuse. Rather than stopping tax avoidance, the Government has created scope for continuing dispute along the lines which have emasculated section 26 (a). </PARA>
<PARA> It will be easy for a potential tax avoider to obtain property which is kept for 12 months, ostensibly for investment or collection, and then donate it at a very high valuation and receive a large tax deduction along the lines of the Victorian scheme. This will be possible because, under the proposed changes, the deduction in this case will still be based on the value of the collection at the time of gift-not its cost to the donor. How will the Taxation Commissioner prove that the donor had the initial purpose of making a deduction rather than collecting? How can the collector be penalised for changing his mind? Similar questions have arisen with section 26 (a), which aims to tax capital gains on the sale of property purchased with the intention of making a profit. This section has been rendered useless by High Court decisions because the Commissioner cannot prove the intent of profit making in many cases. Yet, we have the same principle which has been destroyed by the High Court decisions in respect of capital gains being incorporated in this legislation which was announced yesterday by the Treasurer to overcome a tax avoidance scheme. Quite obviously that will not work. This is typical of the half-hearted way in which the Government acts against tax avoidance. It simply creates more loopholes every time supposed anti-avoidance action is taken. It further illustrates the hasty, ill-thought-out way in which the Government amends the tax Act to provide generous concessions to particular groups and then has to tighten up these concessions against abuse. The film concessions will be well in the minds of honourable members as having suffered the same fate. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention just briefly also the staffing levels in the Australian Taxation Office. In the Estimates Committee we raised the matter of the reduction of the number of staff in the enforcement section of the Taxation Office, which remarkably has been reduced by 179 persons. I would have thought that with tax avoidance and evasion at all time highs, the last place the Government would be cutting back on staff would be with respect to a tax office and that, in particular within that office, it would not be cutting back on the enforcement section of the office. That, in fact, is what has been done with this enormous reduction of 179 persons. When that matter was raised in the Estimates Committe the Treasurer said that the Public Service Board had been asked to review the consequences of staff ceilings on the Taxation Office. Well, what has happened to that review? The Treasurer said that the review would be completed soon. He said that on 9 September, that is, about five weeks ago. </PARA>
<PARA> The year goes on with the Taxation Office still with this much reduced level of staff compared with what it should have, particularly in the enforcement area. We have had no word from the Treasurer yet about the results of this review by the Public Service Board. It seems to us to be a matter of an absolutely very high priority that the Government, one way or another, ensures that the Taxation Office has in the enforcement section enough people to ensure that it can adequately keep up with its job of finding out tax avoidance schemes and rooting out tax evasion schemes and tax evaders and can be able thereby to ensure some equity in the tax system. To take away substantial numbers from this section of the Taxation Office just seems to us to be an absolute absurdity. To allow that situation to continue in the way that the Government has seems to us to be something for which this Government should be condemned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The continuation of this debate on the Estimates Committee report gives me a further opportunity to make some more remarks about the Department of Transport. Specifically I refer this afternoon to a matter that was raised in the Estimates Committee by my colleague the honourable member for Moore (Mr Hyde), that is, the question of Qantas Airways Ltd being able to use its excess capacity on its domestic sectors, on the sectors between Perth and Sydney or Perth and Melbourne and return. I am very pleased to see that the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) is at the table because I know he has expressed interest in this possibility. I hope that he will take into account the remarks that I make and that perhaps, before very long, we might have a definitive response as to whether this possibility of Qantas being able to use its excess domestic capacity will be a reality.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first thing I do is to look at the practical difficulties of Qantas being able to sell to domestic passengers its excess seats on incoming or outgoing international flights. Honourable members will recall that earlier in the year, in April, we had an air hostesses strike and that this put paid to domestic operations for a couple of days. Returning to the Parliament, members of parliament from Western Australia were allowed to travel by Qantas. On the first opportunity available to me I asked a question of the Minister for Transport as to whether the fact that we had been allowed to fly with Qantas, and board the aircraft in Perth quite easily and exit quite easily in Melbourne, was not in itself a practical demonstration that any apparent difficulties could, indeed, be overcome. The Minister for Transport in his answer to me said:</PARA>
<PARA> I think the events of the last few days have indicated that the proposition put forward by the honourable member is certainly a feasible one in terms of administration. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish also to speak about transport. The honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) at the start of a 10-minute speech on tax avoidance made the assertion that no members from this House had risen to speak on the subject of transport. Up to that time there were two. The number has now got to four. The point is that up to that time there had been two. It seems to me that he is a doubtful witness. I would not be at all surprised if the Treasurer (Mr Howard) took into account the fact that he got his first fact wrong when he takes the rest of his speech into account.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The East-West Airlines Ltd organisation recently announced a no frills air service between this city-Canberra-and Sydney. The service is to operate on a fare of $49.50 with a $32 standby fare. That compares with $60.70, which was the fare offered by the two major airlines, Trans Australia Airlines and Ansett Airlines. Shortly after that announcement Ansett offered to meet that fare. A significant point was made by Ansett's Canberra manager, Mr Des Vidian, yesterday. I quote from a newspaper account of what he said. The article stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . he did not expect a reduction in Ansett jet flights between Sydney and Canberra because of the increased volume of services. </PARA>
<PARA>That is interesting in view of evidence that was given to the Holcroft Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares. He also said that if a drop in traffic became apparent Ansett was more likely to bring in fare discounts on the route than cut services. This indicates that at least some of the Ansett staff believe that the demand for air travel is very elastic, that as the price falls more people will travel. This is consistent with the experience in the United States of America and, I submit also, it is consistent with what one would expect. If we see competition on a route that brings the price down we are catering for a demand that is there. There are people who wish for cheaper travel. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall tell the House of an incident that happened in my office. I will change marginally the events as they took place just to make it impossible for anyone to identify my constituent. A lady came into my office a little tearful. She told me that she had a daugher in Sydney, single and pregnant. She desperately wanted to travel across the continent to see her daughter and help her. That was a perfectly reasonable request. But what is significant to this debate is that she pointed out to me that had she been in the United States she could have afforded to have done so. At that stage it cost $US99 to travel the full length across the United States which is a distance only very slightly further than-but essentially the same distance as-it is from Perth to Sydney. She was prevented from travelling because of the airline system in Australia which is a highly regulated system as opposed to the deregulated system that exists in the United States. She did not want a sophisticated, frilly service. She desperately wanted to get to Sydney for a price she could pay. She did not care very much whether she travelled at night or whether she was seated at the back of the aircraft; she did not want meals; she wanted to get there. She was typical of the thousands and thousands of people who would be travellers if, in fact, the system would let them. The price for which they can travel is more important than any peripheral frills. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a situation in Perth where young people are travelling to Bali and companies are holding conventions in Bali because it is cheaper. It is cheaper to go to Bali than it is to go to Adelaide. Yet, if we had the fare prices that have been achieved in the deregulated system in the United States that would not be the case. It is bad for the Western Australian tourist industry. It is bad that Western Australians are, for financial reasons, going overseas instead of seeing Australia. It is bad for the unity of Australia that one State, because it is geographically isolated, should feel isolated by the system. It is bad that any part of this nation should feel that the other part of the nation is setting up an artificial barrier to contact between Western Australia, in this case, and the rest of the nation. It is bad politically, economically and socially. Yet, Ansett indicates that it believes that the market for air travel is elastic-that as the price comes down more people travel. That is precisely what one would expect. </PARA>
<PARA> It is surprising that the one route that has a three-airlines system is the one that the bureaucrats use, not on the long haul route between Perth and the eastern States where people really pay a lot of money to travel. No! It is the shortest trunk route, the one that the bureaucrats use. We go to a three-airline system that, with a bit of competition, has forced the price down. Perhaps they and their wives travel to Sydney to the opera. Good for them. But why should not the rest of Australia have access to the type of service that results from competition. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to say something about competition. It is important that Ansett and TAA compete with East-West Airlines on a fair basis and that the services of the two major airlines are not in some way cross-subsidised by earnings on other routes. I am hopeful that the TAA application will be rejected because I do not see how a straight 20 per cent discount can be other than a cross-subsidy unless the fare in the first place was wrong and was cross-subsidising another area. If the fare were set correctly in the first place, reflecting all costs, which is an enormously difficult thing to establish-but since we are going to have a regulated system somehow or other we have to establish just that-the 20 per cent discount must necessarily be a cross-subsidy. So, I am hopeful that that will be rejected. But I am also hopeful that they will get into the system with something that is as cheap to operate as East-West does. I welcome competition, but it must be fair competition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my remarks to the Estimates Committee report on the Department of the Treasury. At the meeting of Estimates Committee D on 9 September the Treasurer (Mr Howard) expressed the view that a greater reliance on indirect taxation would reduce tax evasion. He further indicated that he was sceptical that a person who had evaded tax for five or 10 years would re-enter the taxpaying community even if tax rates were reduced. It appears that his solution to the problem of tax evasion is to require these people to pay indirect taxes. What happens to those pay-as-you-earn taxpayers who are presently paying almost 46 per cent of total tax revenue received by this Government? There is no escape for them. They continue to pay income tax but, in addition, the regressive indirect taxes will further reduce their disposable incomes by an amount estimated by the Australian Taxpayers Association at $3.50 per week for the average family. It appears that the Treasurer has decided to throw in the towel on tax evasion. The facts are that those people will pay indirect taxes while the honest Australians paying income tax will be further slugged by paying regressive indirect taxes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Treasurer further expressed the opinion that the field audit system of the Australian Taxation Office was very successful, but that it was not well received by some taxpayers. That is not surprising as the Treasurer admitted that the system of field audits was effective in the areas of direct evasion, tax avoidance and understatement of income. All of these practices are perverting our tax system and have caused the tax burden to fall on those least able to afford it. Who cares whether those people who are evading or avoiding tax or understating income are not pleased by the field audit system? It appears that this matter causes the Treasurer some concern. The resources of the Taxation Office should be increased, particularly in the area of field audits. But to the contrary, there has been a substantial reduction in full time employment within the Taxation Office. That is an extraordinary approach to a situation where the Treasurer admits that we have a grave problem of tax avoidance and an even graver problem in the area of tax evasion. Yet, as was pointed out by the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis), the enforcement areas of the Taxation Office have, in fact, been reduced from the point of view of manpower. The indirect taxes are a further indication of the deceit of this Government. The history of this problem should be spelt out. </PARA>
<PARA> In June 1978, the Treasurer announced an inquiry into the system of indirect taxation, including value added tax. In January 1979 he announced that plans for a value added type tax had been shelved. That was, of course, after the matter had been floated. There had been a community response which was adverse and then the Government changed direction. But on 19 October 1980, the day after the election, there was again speculation about indirect taxation. On 19 November, a month after the election, the Treasurer announced a major study of possible new forms of indirect tax. There was not a mention of it prior to the election. In fact, in January 1979 the Treasurer indicated that any such proposals had been shelved. Yet a month after the election we had an announcement that there would be a major study into possible new forms of indirect tax. </PARA>
<PARA> On 12 March 1981 the Treasurer made a ministerial statement that the Government was going to do nothing to change the tax system. The reason given was that a significant increase in indirect tax to enable reductions in personal income tax would be too inflationary. But what happened then? The 1981 Budget introduced a broad based wholesale sales tax on all items except food and medicines. The tax on goods formerly levelled at 2 1/2 per cent increased to 5 per cent; tax on goods set at 15 per cent increased to 17 1/2 per cent; and tax on goods at 27 1/2 per cent increased to 30 per cent. At some stage in the future, in a desperate attempt to hang on to power, despite the previous statements, there will be income tax cuts. But this time the electorate will know that this Government has again engaged in a confidence trick which the people of Australia will not tolerate on this occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of interest rates is one which is causing untold suffering to those struggling with ever increasing mortgage payments, yet it appears that this crucial item of expenditure will not be included in the consumer price index. At the present time the Australian Bureau of Statistics is reviewing the consumer price index. However, at the Estimates Committee hearing we were told that the prospect of including the item of interest rates in the consumer price index was not very good. More than half of the countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development managed to include interest rates in their consumer price indices. It is difficult to see why Australia cannot manage it. It is such a significant factor that it requires urgent attention. The Government must pursue this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the reasons given for the delays and problems in relation to the review of the consumer price index was the obsession that this Government has. It was stated at the hearing by an officer of the Bureau of Statistics that like every other Government department the Bureau is heavily constricted by staff ceilings. It is doing this work with a very small additional number of staff. It is not easy to find the right people to undertake it. A better job is done if it is spread over a longer term and carried out by a smaller number of more skilled people. The Government cannot continue to procrastinate on this matter. Action should be taken to step up that review in order that this crucial item of expenditure is included in the CPI so that it gives a reasonably true reflection of the increased cost of living to be borne by the people of this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I particularly want to refer to the works commitments of the Department of Transport and to a large extent the comments I make will be based on my experience as Chairman of the Joint Committee on Public Works which has had opportunities over recent years to look at a number of works undertaken by the Department. If honourable members look at the appropriation they will see that the Department of Transport has one of the largest capital expenditures within the Commonwealth Budget with the exception of Defence. The Department of Transport works commitment is very large indeed. To some extent this is partially caused by a backlog because certain works that should have been performed in the past have not been done. Also these estimates cater in part for the new generation of aircraft and for the increased traffic that is now developing at a number of airports. Unfortunately to some extent the expenditure is necessary to honour a number of election promises. This has required capital expenditure prematurely. I am concerned about a number of these things. Some of the election promises include airport terminals at Perth, Canberra, Darwin and a complete new airport at Brisbane. These promises in themselves involve substantial commitments by this Government and will have a substantial effect on reducing other expenditure which is also needed. I have not referred to the problem of Sydney airport where, due to political and other difficulties, a major problem is developing. The existing airport is operating very close to its capacity. So a massive task is before the Department of Transport in planning the capital expenditure required to meet immediate needs over the next few years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer to several aspects of which I am critical of the Department and its methods of planning expenditure. For instance, in recent times the Public Works Committee has been looking at a new air traffic services centre and control tower for Perth Airport. This of course is of concern to a number of Western Australian members who are in the House at the moment-the honourable member for Moore (Mr Hyde), the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack) and the honourable member for Perth (Mr McLean). It has been one of our efforts to get this work undertaken because there is definitely a requirement for development at Perth Airport. But in doing this we have found that there has not been a master plan developed for the airport; so we are not sure, in siting such a work as the control tower, whether it will fit into the long term designs for the airport. The people who appeared before the Public Works Committee recently in Perth and advocated that the work should be deferred until the master plan was available had a very valid point. The Committee will, in its report, be forced to weigh up the views that they put and the fact that this work is critical, from a safety aspect. I think it is an indictment of the Department that there is no master plan for Perth airport to indcate exactly where necessary development should be going on. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the greatest comedy of errors is in relation to the Brisbane Airport where, of course, in 1979 the Public Works Committee recommended deferring commencement of that work so that the completion date would be in the 1990s or so. At that stage, the airport, with a capacity of 165 aircraft movements a year, would have been adequate until 1991. The plan advanced to the Committee at that stage-in 1979-was that a new major runway would be constructed which could be used in conjunction with one of the existing runways at the airport. But from recent evidence given before the Public Works Committee we have now found out that this operation reduces capacity to a stage where it is not sufficient to meet the needs even in 1986. We find also that this plan, which was advocated in 1979, requires 37 additional staff and that it also requires about $1.2m additional capital expenditure to make it work. The Committee was not told these facts in 1979 and I doubt very much whether the Department knew about them. I think the very fact that the Department has not taken into account such important factors makes one critical of the planning methods of the Department in relation to capital works. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Okay; perhaps the Minister is telling me the Government decision is wrong and not the Department. This may well be the case. One other element I refer to is the fact that there seems to be a proliferation of international terminals within Australia. It worries me that international terminals are expensive facilities to provide because of the additional staff required for immigration and for a number of other security and quarantine functions. It seems to me that we should be looking very closely at whether further international terminals should be developed in Australia, because all this expenditure has an effect on the cost recovery program. For instance, just the $265m being spent on Brisbane Airport will have the effect of increasing the average domestic air fare by between $3.50 and $4. That is a substantial increase purely to repay the domestic commitment in the cost recovery program. The old Brisbane Airport has the capacity for 165,000 movements per annum which would have met the forecast traffic needs until 1991. The new runway that has been approved has a capacity of 130,000 movements per annum which will meet requirements only until 1995, and the runway is to open in 1986. We now have a revised provision of 183,000 movements a year which will meet the needs until 1994. So the early recommendation of the Public Works Committee in 1979 that the work be deferred for some time was very valid; and I take note of the Minister's early interjection.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am heartened to some extent because I believe there is an interdepartmental committee responsible for looking at airport strategies. I understand that this interdepartmental committee will be reporting later this year or some time early next year. I understand that it is charged with the responsibility of trying to put the various works within the Department of Transport in order of priority. I emphasise that the complaint I am making is that it is very clear now that we have never had clear orders of priority in the way in which works in the Department of Transport should be scheduled. I hope that the report of the interdepartmental committee will provide this. </PARA>
<PARA> I referred earlier to the master planning of Perth Airport. I request the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) to make every effort to ensure that master planning of airports proceeds and is available before works are committed within those areas. My plea with regard to the works aspects of the Department of Transport is that we should be able to put them in order of priority and that we should be able to plan the expenditure for a number of years. In that way I am sure we will get better co-ordination and planning in our airports. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Federal Government's monetary and budgetary strategy for 1981-82, centering as it did on an expected massive level of private capital inflow of $7 billion to $8 billion, was always ill-conceived. The adoption of such a strategy reflected two persistent themes underlying the management of the economy by the Fraser Government: Firstly, its total ineptitude in the conduct of monetary policy year by year; and, secondly, its willingness to accept unconditionally foreign money from any source.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When the Budget was introduced into the Parliament nearly two months ago, the Opposition warned the Government against relying on the net balance of payments position to provide nearly half of total growth in money supply in 1981-82. We suggested, firstly, that private capital inflow was too volatile an item on which to pin one's monetary strategy hopes and, secondly, that the private capital inflow that has found its way to these shores had been predominantly portfolio investment-hot money-buying up Australian real estate, shares in Australian companies or simply speculating on trends in the Australian dollar exchange rate. </PARA>
<PARA> The totally inadequate response of the Government and its apologists among the economic and financial commentators has been: Well, if private capital inflow falls short of the target, the authorities can always shift round quickly by easing up the restrictions on domestic credit creation, by selling fewer government bonds or by releasing some of the $1,900m locked up in statutory reserve deposits. However, the question is: How long will the Government wait before some of the necessary adjustments are made? The figures for the September quarter point to an all-time record quarterly balance of payments deficit, hardly the launching pad for a substantial full year balance of payments surplus. Without the expected flow of funds from overseas into the banks, in combination with the massive $1,500m withdrawal from money supply via the Budget, there will be a rapid drying-up of credit in the community. While the Government ponders its next move, the home buyers and the businessmen seeking finance must grit their teeth and wait or chase fringe finance at exorbitant rates of interest. </PARA>
<PARA> It was clear at the time of the Budget that the forecast flood of foreign money, unrestrained by any coherent set of controls protecting our national interest, was to be offset principally through massive increases in family taxation. It is equally clear now that if this expected level of private capital inflow does not materialise, as many commentators are now suggesting, the Government has no intention of handing back any of the 22 per cent increase in income tax or the 39 per cent increase in sales tax. The Government's total failure to acknowledge or to act upon the clear evidence of a massive buying up operation of Australia's industry, real estate and resources must be brought to the attention of the Australian people. Its willingness to incorporate this largely unrestrained flood of foreign money into its monetary policy strategy must be condemned. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1976-77, more than $13 billion of foreign investment has flowed into enterprises in Australia. Excluding undistributed income, more than 60 per cent of that foreign investment has been portfolio investment-hot money-in shares, real estate and the like. It is speculative investment. From the Foreign Investment Review Board statistics, we learn that in 1980-81 two-thirds of the value of foreign investment scrutinised by the Board was for the takeover of existing business in Australia. The Foreign Investment Review Board, as it is presently constituted, appears to be little more than a welcoming committee for every get-rich-quick merchant in Europe, North America and South East Asia. </PARA>
<PARA> Before this Government abolished the section of the Australian Bureau of Statistics which compiled data on the extent of foreign ownership of Australian industry, we knew that about half of Australian industry in the early to mid-1970s was foreign-owned; that is, apart from Canada, Australia had the highest foreign penetration of its economy in the world. We can only guess at what is the current level of foreign ownership. The paucity of recent information on the degree of foreign ownership is scandalous when all the evidence points to there having been a massive buying-up operation of Australian industry under the Fraser Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me tell the House what a Labor government would do-the Government after 1983. A Labor government would re-establish the very important foreign participation section of the Bureau of Statistics. Another major impediment to gaining a clear picture of the true extent of overseas ownership of Australian industry has become apparent from a study by Mr Peter Davies of the Australian Financial System Inquiry. He conducted an analysis of the BHP share register over the period 1970-79. He found that nearly 70 per cent of bank nominee holdings of BHP shares were on behalf of non-residents. He concluded from his analysis that 'overseas ownership of BHP would now be headed towards 25 per cent'. The drama of that is simply this: It is in marked contrast with the figure of 9 per cent foreign ownership cited in the BHP annual report. It is our contention, the Labor Party's concern, that the operation of nominee companies needs to be overhauled. It is true that, in many instances, nominee holdings are quite validly held on behalf of overseas investors and superannuation funds use nominee companies for convenience or because they are not recognised as a legal entity by share registrars in their own right. The significance of being able to identify beneficial ownership has been highlighted by Mr Davies' study. Labor in government would move to require beneficial ownership of nominee shareholdings to be made known, to be declared publicly. </PARA>
<PARA> If the extent of hidden overseas ownership apparent in BHP is true for other Australian companies, questions need to be asked about the ability of the Foreign Investment Review Board to police the foreign investment guidelines. Can we now be sure that all broadcasting and television is at least 80 per cent Australian owned, that uranium projects-putting to one side the Labor Party's clear commitment to its policy-are at least 75 per cent Australian owned, and that mining and primary industry projects are at least 50 per cent Australian owned? We want to know whether we are being taken to the cleaners by the shroud of secrecy which nominee companies provide. Of particular concern to the Opposition is the potential for breaches of agreements by companies granted naturalising status. The Opposition is not satisfied with the procedures for checking the progress towards the attainment of majority Australian ownership by naturalising companies. </PARA>
<PARA> These companies should be required to apply formally for registration with the Foreign Investment Review Board and be subjected to annual scrutiny by the Board as to their true beneficial ownership position and their progress towards majority Australian shareholding. We would require companies also to agree to some broad time scale for the achievement of majority Australian shareholding. A divestment procedure would be applied in the case of companies which the FIRB considers to be failing to fulfil their obligation to achieve majority Australian ownership. The granting of naturalising status is a privilege which, under present procedures, is open to abuse by foreign companies. With proper safeguards, the naturalising procedure would become a valuable means of achieving greater Australian ownership and control of our resource industry. Clearly, the Government must require that the national interest is enhanced by granting approval to naturalise and that progress towards majority Australian ownership is not made through the takeover of existing Australian enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA> To conclude, Labor believes that the conduct of foreign investment policy by the Australian Government needs to be clearly separated from day to day economic management considerations. Foreign investment and the development of Australia's resources are necessarily long term considerations requiring sensible, clearly enunciated policies which maximise Australia's national interest. The conduct of a foreign investment policy which puts an end to the unchecked bargain basement sell-out of Australian industry and Australian resources must necessarily involve having access to up to date information on the extent of foreign ownership in Australia. A Labor government, post-1983, will also be anxious to ensure that the guidelines governing naturalising status operate to provide genuine progress towards majority Australian ownership of Australia's resource industries. Without these measures, and others such as a profits related resource rent tax, the benefits of the resources boom will not accrue to all Australians, but rather, and inexcusably, to foreign investors and an elite few Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to raise a couple of matters which I believe are most important to this transport debate. They are firstly, the matter of country airports and, secondly, the situation in relation to the provision of finance for roads throughout Australia, particularly in the country areas of Australia. A large amount of money is to be spent and is being spent on the airports in some of the capital cities and on other major airports throughout Australia. I draw the attention of the Government to the fact that it is most important that the facilities actually available in many provincial cities and towns throughout Australia be improved to meet the needs of the communities concerned and the travel industry. I feel that as time goes by greater pressure must be brought to bear by the local authorities and the owners of the aerodromes concerned for a building up of the services and facilities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have spoken a number of times in the House of the most unsatisfactory situation concerning road finance in Australia. I particularly want to refer to the situation in New South Wales. I am very conscious of the fact that we are at present in the second year of a five-year agreement between the Commonwealth and the States on the provision of $3,650m for three categories of roads. It concerns me that as the third, fourth and fifth year go by there will be a general reduction in the overall percentage of the moneys available. The major answer to the problem is for the Commonwealth and the States-Government generally-to make a greater allocation of funds for roads. Local government throughout Australia generally looks principally to the Commonwealth for assistance because it is the body which collects the petrol tax moneys. Local government has always-perhaps rightly so-been able to divert attention to the Commonwealth as the body which is basically responsible for road funding. </PARA>
<PARA> I illustrate the situation by saying that in New South Wales the funds collected directly from the motorist are the only funds allocated to roads and for road safety throughout the States. In other words, the priorities for New South Wales in the eyes of the New South Wales Government are such that that government does not allocate any of its funds to the vital area of roads. The councils and, I am sure, every member of this House would want the Government to look more closely at the importance of road funding throughout Australia. I know of no more important matter than this to my electorate, which is a country electorate in a growing area. I am sure I speak for those who represent the interior of Australia when I say that the country areas are very dependent on roads and communication facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> Three categories are mentioned in the Commonwealth and States agreement-national roads, arterial roads and local roads. I am beginning to wonder whether there should be a general reclassification in this respect. If one goes into any of the country shires throughout Australia today one will find that the most neglected roads are in many cases the main arterial roads that service the towns. The primary producers are terribly dependent upon them and the local school bus travels on them. The safety of the children is a most important aspect as far as we are concerned. These roads are the ones that are deteriorating. They are the ones that are used for bringing the produce to market. They are the roads which people generally use to travel from one major town to another. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VF4">Mr COWAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is quite true. If one looks at the remark of the Minister for Transport a while ago one will find that over the last four or five years the New South Wales Government has reduced its funding assistance to local government in real terms. What is taken from the motorist does not all go back. No extra money is provided for this most important aspect of life today in country areas. I represent people and councils which are concerned about this matter. I believe that next week the President of the Shires Association of New South Wales and the Local Government Association of New South Wales will be speaking again to the Minister on this matter. I believe that they have a very real case for extra funding for roads. If we consult the Australian motorists' associations we will find that they have the figures to prove that a lesser percentage of our overall Commonwealth expenditure in going directly to roads now than there was in the early 1960s. I believe that on their figure alone it is now 1.78 per cent. So it is necessary. I think the Department of Main Roads in New South Wales has pointed out that the actual cost to date, forgetting the consumer price index which was about 8.8 per cent last year-the inflationary trend-to bitumen or to upgrade a road is up between 12 per cent to 16 per cent per year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These circumstances are very disturbing for country people and, I believe, for city people as well. They are all concerned about their local roads and about their national roads. The sooner we develop better roads between the capitals of Australia and around the vast circumference of Australia the better for everybody. But those local roads and development of arterial roads of which I spoke earlier are the important ones for which we have to get greater finance. One could go on and talk about the safety aspect of roads, fuel economy, and the growth of the tourist industry within Australia. Many of these aspects have been covered by many people before, but the answer still has not been found. As far as I am concerned there is only one answer to this and that is that there must be a greater allocation to road finance throughout Australia. Also the tidying up could be done through the Commonwealth Grants Commission or some other body. The allocations are the responsibilities of the States. They have to live up to their obligation also. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact it disturbs me that year after year when we look at a Budget we see a lesser percentage of this nation's wealth going into the material things that matter to this country. When I speak about material things I speak about roads, natural resources of water within Australia and the preservation of our soil. These are the things that really will cause productivity and will build the economy of Australia that will create work for people and bring a better social life generally. We all want to see this happen in our country. I wanted to add my few words and say that there must be a greater recognition by the Commonwealth and the States of the need for roads and for better bridging within Australia in order to service those who live in those outlying areas and to build up the industries that surround them and that are so dependent upon a better form of communication. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted that the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) is at the table for the discussion on these Estimates because I wish to pursue, within the context of the estimates for the Department of Transport, the replies that the Minister gave to two questions, one yesterday from the honourable member for Calare (Mr MacKenzie) and one today from myself. The matter relates to Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport and particularly is in response to the question I raised this morning in which I asked whether the Minister proposed to take further action on the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) that there should be a second Sydney airport. I wish to make it very clear that the Prime Minister at last has agreed that there is a necessity for a second Sydney airport. In a letter dated 15 April to the Premier of New South Wales he said that he required the co-operation of the Government of New South Wales in the determination and securing of a suitable site for the construction of a Sydney airport of international standard in the vicinity of Sydney to meet the contingent demands of the community from the end of the century and beyond. Further on in that letter, to underline the Prime Minister's priority concerning a second airport, he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There must be a long-term development of a new airport . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I, as the member for St George, was delighted to see what in fact has been a change in the Federal Government's policy because the officials in the Department of Transport, particularly those participating in the Major Airport Needs of Sydney Committee, remarked that the close spaced parallel runways avoided a commitment to a major second airport for Sydney. So we have it very clearly. I remind the Minister of the Prime Minister's promise. I must confess that he may give only the same degree of credence to a Prime Minister's promise, as a lot of other Australians may, but there is that promise that there is a need for a second airport. We trust that the Prime Minister will carry out for once and for all at least one of his promises. </PARA>
<PARA> Various comments have been made by the Minister about the time scale involved in the construction of the second airport, and this ranges from 12 to 20 years. The only thing I can say about that is nonsense. If one looks back to the construction of the second Melbourne airport at Tullamarine, one will see the sort of time scale involved. Certainly no more than nine years are involved in the construction of a second airport. But when we look at the close spaced parallel runways, the Government underestimates the time involved. Again the time taken to construct close spaced parallel runways at Sydney airport will be of the same order as constructing a second airport. I will give some reasons why. When the Minister talked airily about the close spaced parallel runways he missed a few very important technical matters. The first is that the construction of those runways will require appromixately 20 million cubic metres of fill. No study has been made of where that fill will come from. There also has been no mention of the requirement for detailed hydraulic modelling of the effects of putting a runway into Botany Bay. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point-I suppose this is a point a lot of people seem to forget-is that when we look at Sydney airport now we see that there are terminals: The Ansett Airlines of Australia terminal, the Trans Australia Airlines terminal and the Qantas Airways Ltd maintenance base. They will all have to go if the Government's proposal for close spaced parallel runways comes into effect. All those structures will have to go. That is the order of things that have to be taken into account which the Minister, in making his various statements, has not mentioned to the public. But these are very serious problems that have to be considered. What we can say is that the timing involved in the construction of close spaced parallel runways will be of the same order as a second airport. A great number of cost estimates have been put out. In fact in the Prime Minister's letter he states a cost of approximately $700m for a second airport. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am quoting the Prime Minister. If the Minister wishes to point out that the Prime Minister is incorrect, I am prepared to believe that again. But in terms of the investigations carried by the Government of New South Wales the cost of the close spaced parallel runways would be of the order of $600m. Here is the proposition of the Prime Minister: First we build close spaced parallel runways and then later on, because he already has promised it, we build a second airport. So we are up for the order of $1,300m. It seems to me to be eminently sensible that all we have to do is to build the second airport and save the Australian taxpayer the sum of about $600m. But also on technical grounds there are reasons against the close spaced parallel runways. These are that in order to have simultaneous operations the runways should be approximately 4,300 feet or 1,300 metres apart, but the Government is proposing that the runways be about 1,100 feet or 335 metres apart. This means that the runway will cost nearly as much as a second airport, but in addition the runway will not be technically efficient because we will not be able to have simultaneous operations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I agreed with the Opposition Whip that I would not proceed any further but I make the point that I believe the Government has a responsibility to build the second airport and it should stop fooling around and get on with the job. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will put the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) on my list. The purpose of amendment No. (2) is to insert a definition of 'container' for the purpose of the new definition of a 'place of export'. The purpose of the amendment No. (3) is to redefine the definition of 'place of export' to enable the continuation of the present practice of treating overseas freight as commencing with goods that are picked up in a container of a type defined by amendment No. (2), as circulated. The purpose of amendments Nos (4) and (5) is to make it clear that the cost of marketing and propotional activities of the purchasers, undertaken for their own benefit, shall in no way be treated for valuation purposes as forming part of the price for imported goods. The purpose of amendment No. (6) is to ensure that a person who is informed of the view of the controller as to the possible effect of the relationship between the purchaser and the vendor on the price of the goods is also informed of the controller's reasons for forming that view.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The purpose of amendments Nos (7) to (13) is to remove a possible avoidance device, whereby parties may artificially reduce the apparent sale price or computed value of goods by contributing material, components, et cetera, towards the production of other materials and the component used in the production of the goods so valued. The purpose of amendment No. (14) is to insert a new clause 10A into the Bill to make a formal amendment to section 237GA of the principal Act and to insert a provision in that section to ensure that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal will be able to review all of the administrative decisions made in the course of valuing imported goods. That is a brief explanation of the amendments. They were brought about by representations from people who operate in the area-namely, customs agents-to make the Customs (Valuations) Act more workable in their interests. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am grateful to the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Moore) for explaining to the Committee these amendments as the Government sees them. In relation to the first group concerning the definition of the place of export, I must confess that the Customs Agents Federation approached both my office and the office of the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown), who is the shadow Minister in this area. That group of amendments was known to us. We understand that the current system excludes the costs which arise after goods have been containerised in assessing customs duty. We recognise that the amendment inserted now gives a definition of 'containers' and allows for the costs after containerisation to be excluded from the value for customs duty. That applied previously and it is equitable that it should continue. As is often the case, the Opposition was not approached in relation to the other amendments. It was necessary for me to learn how they arose. The second group of amendments relates to the treatment of rebates. This is clarified in that the costs of promoting or advertising goods are not now taken into account by the Collectors of Customs where such costs are incurred on the account of the purchaser. I believe that this was the original intention. These amendments clarify the matter as provision has already been made in another place in the legislation for this to be done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The third group of amendments really involves whether the particular transactions that are taking place are being done at arms length. A provision is inserted that the Comptroller must give reasons why he believes that a relationship between the buyer and the seller could affect the price in a transaction; in other words, if I have understood it correctly, if indeed he believes that the buyer and the seller are not at arms length, I understand that amendment now, although no one actually approached us or gave us any previous indication as to why that amendment was necessary. As the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs has just said, the final amendment, (14), inserts a new clause altogether relating to a review of decisions. Provision is made now to extend the rights of persons in dispute with a decision under section 167, that is, a dispute in relation to amounts of duty payable to decisions prior to and relevant to a decision as to duty. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of those explanations, the Opposition approves of all of the amendments. We understand, from discussions with the Customs Agents Federation that at least the first amendments were necessary. We now learn from the Minister that perhaps he had had representations from the same source. But he has had representations from other sources which have given rise to these amendments. I thank him for the promise that his office will be in touch with the relevant shadow Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, the honourable member for Parramatta. I believe that he knows already that, due to inadequate staff being made available to the Opposition, the person who serves the honourable member for Parramatta serves me also in relation to these matters. I assure the Minister that I took the trouble to make sure that nothing had been delivered, as far as I could ascertain, to the office of the honourable member for Parramatta in view of the fact that he is absent from Australia at present and would have otherwise dealt with this matter. I was assured that nothing had been delivered. I am glad to hear that steps will be taken to ensure that there are not these misunderstandings in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Judges' Pensions Amendment Bill 1981 is an extraordinary piece of legislation that seems to have come from a government that appears to be in a state of paralysis as to what it is all about. There will be an amendment to the Bill because even in the first draft the Government could not get the Bill right. The Judges' Pensions Amendment Bill we regard as being a special benefit amendment Bill. It benefits one particular judge-a pretty handsome benefit-on the basis that the judge will get a pension after a relatively short period of service. That pension will be pretty substantial.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Bill makes some rather ludicrous changes to the 1968 legislation. It updates references to the Papua New Guinean judges for whom the Government is responsible. It contains the rather delightful expression that it is changing legislation as to the rate of pensions payable to the widow or widower of a judge from five-eighths to 62 1/2 per cent. Every one of us has always thought that five-eighths was 62 1/2 per cent. Every computer or abacus with which I have ever dealt says the same thing. But here it is in the Bill. I thought that changes like that certainly could have been made in a statute law revision Bill because they are purely draft measures. </PARA>
<PARA> The real reason for this piece of legislation is to carry out a promise. I thought that legislation should be based more on what applied to the community and to standards rather than to a specific promise. But no. Apparently last year, the then Minister for Industrial Relations, appointed what we would call two 'hired guns' to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, Mr Justice Marks and Mr Justice Maddern. As it turns out, Mr Justice Marks is apparently 59 years of age and he must retire at 65. It seems extraordinary that we have to have a special piece of legislation aimed solely at a benefit which the Government has so comprehensively botched. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZE4">Mr LIONEL BOWEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No marks for that. But plenty of marks in the future. I remember making submissions on behalf of a judge in the Family Law Court, and another judge, on the basis that they were going to miss out in respect of other entitlements. The Government did nothing about them. The Family Law Court judge was appointed on the basis that he at least would have been given some consideration. But my submissions fell on deaf ears. The other judge, who was in the Australian Capital Territory, certainly was not going to get any entitlement. But now, because of a special promise made by a Minister to one person, the whole of the law is to be changed to give a special benefit. I think that is to be deplored.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For Mr Justice Marks to be eligible, the legislation has to be amended by altering section 6 to a qualifying period of six years rather than the present 10 years. Thereby hangs the argument that I am putting forward. The other judges that I have mentioned might have had cause for concern as they would not be able to achieve the 10-year period because their retiring age was altered to 65 years. The Government did nothing about that matter. I hope that these judges benefit under this legislation-I think they might. This legislation seems to be a backward way of doing it, all because of a promise made by a Minister to a particular person. </PARA>
<PARA> At present, judges receive a non-contributory pension which is not insubstantial. To that extent one ought to draw a distinction between the parliamentary pension which, admittedly, is substantial but it is also contributory. Judges receive 60 per cent of current judicial salaries but the Government has gone to the trouble of trying to adjust that in this legislation that it has got wrong. It now has to move an amendment to that legislation. When the Government drafted the legislation, it said that the specific period would be seven years. We now have an amendment to make it six years. I say to the Government that we will not approve of it. We will oppose it on the basis that we think it is ridiculous to have this sort of approach given to us as being something that is a considered opinion of a government in relation to standards when, as we say, it is a matter that relates to a specific promise. </PARA>
<PARA> When we look at other people in the community, particularly pensioners, we find that, prior to the last election campaign, the Opposition was castigated because it was talking about bringing pensions up to 25 per cent of average weekly earnings, and ultimatly 30 per cent when economic circumstances so permitted. That was pooh-poohed as though it was ridiculous. We cannot have one standard for one section of the community and none for the majority. If the stringiness of the Government towards pensioners is to apply, it should apply across the board. As I said, a great deal of Press comment has been made about pensions and what politicians, for example, might get. I make the point that any Labor politician elected at the same age as Mr Justice Marks would not be entitled to a pension. He would never get there in time. When it comes to the Liberal Party no such prohibitions apply. With the greatest of respect to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, we seem to be recycling politicians in that a number of politicians from State parliaments have come into this Parliament on the Government side. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister is worried about the facts and I cannot stop him interjecting. In any event, we think six years is too short a period for qualification for a non-contributory pension. The Minister who made the promise should not feel too badly if we say that he cannot expect us to agree. It is well known that this Government has made a number of promises which it has felt unable to keep, so this one should not cause any embarrassment. There are other factors which ought to be considered. This is a generous pension. Other provisions relate to judges and their children. One does not want to cavil too much at the provisions for the children of judges but there is a disparity between the benefits given to their children and those of other people in the community. This is a cause of comment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To summarise the situation, the Bill is necessary to redeem a promise. It has not been properly drawn. We feel that the promise should not have been made. It is lowering standards to suggest that substantial pensions can be paid for a relatively short period of service, particularly when the pensions are non-contributory. I think the Government is embarrassed to have to do this. It is another gaffe. We cannot do much more at the moment than say that we note the embarrassment of the Government. We will oppose the amendment in the Committee stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am deeply concerned that we are bringing about changes to the 1968 legislation that will, in effect, in future allow a man to be appointed to a Federal court for a period of only six years and have an entitlement, on a pro rata basis, to a pension for the rest of his life. I am very much aware of why the Government proposes to introduce an amendment to the amendment. Honourable members in the chamber will also be aware that the Bill, as it presently stands, requires a member of the bench to serve for 10 years before he or she will become eligible for a pension. There have been lots of talk and efforts to reduce that period to five years. Some people have consistently opposed such a reduction on the grounds that if a person is to be entitled to a pension for the rest of his living days he or she should at least make a considerable contribution to the nation and 10 years is a reasonable period. However, the wisdom of others decreed-I see some justice in it-that after seven years service a person would be entitled to a pro-rata pension. Often extenuating circumstances exist which cause a late appointment or an early departure. Nevertheless, the period of six years probably creates a new national record in terms of the entitlement of anyone in the country on the Federal payroll to a pension.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that in bygone days there was acceptance by the public of the non-contributory nature of the pension for judges. I have discussed this subject in the House. I think the last time I did so I was severely attacked by the then honourable member for Wentworth, who is now Mr Justice Ellicott. That is history. I have been consistent in my belief that the proliferation of the judiciary has brought about a need for change. I believe that the public originally accepted the non-contributory nature of the pension because there was but a handful of Federal judges. At the time of Federation the writers of the Constitution designed a High Court of Australia with a Chief Justice and two judges. That number has now been expanded to seven. I have no argument with that-none whatsoever. I have no argument with the salary level of $87,000 which is now paid to the Chief Justice of the High Court or the $79,000 which is paid to ordinary justices of the High Court. Those men are given the responsbility of making decisions of the highest order. To obtain men of such calibre we need to pay a suitable remuneration. However, when the people of Australia first accepted the principle of judges' pensions the situation was very different from that of today. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent years we in the Parliament have seen the creation of the Family Court of Australia, a Federal court. Hey presto, we now have 39 judges earning salaries of between, I think, $55,000 and $67,000 who also are sharing in the advantage of a non-contributory pension scheme. It is a pension scheme and not a superannuation fund because they contribute nothing. It is proper to reflect on the fact that this Bill is being introduced in this chamber and not in the Senate. It is a Bill that the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) should have introduced but the reason it has originated in this chamber is that it is a money Bill. The decision we are making today could in the long term be a very costly one for taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA> As well as the creation of the Family Court, we have seen in the last five or six years the creation of the Federal Court of Australia. Whilst I concede that a number of the judges of the Federal Court also serve in other areas of jurisdiction we have seen the appointment of 25 Federal Court judges. When one adds those numbers to the number of Family Court judges, and when one compares those numbers with the original three positions which existed at the birth of the Commonwealth, one sees an expansion, taking all those numbers into account, representing an increase of 25 to 30-fold. Although the pensions have been provided for judges only in the last 40 or so years, I really believe that for a privileged group we are indulging in generosity of a kind that cannot be justified in view of the vast numbers of judges that now exist. </PARA>
<PARA> When one considers the Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia-I have already said that I have no argument with the level of his salary or with the quality of the work done by that court-and when one looks at a pension worth six-tenths of $87,000, which he will receive for the rest of his natural life, one sees figures the magnitude of which the ordinary person would find it difficult to comprehend. When we relate those figures to Family Court judges, of course, the pension would be considerably less, but it would be far more than the person earning average or even above average wages would ever be likely to earn. All I am saying is that it is high time an amendment was brought into this chamber to provide for a contribution from those on the Bench to their own pension benefits or to their own superannuation schemes. I will not sabotage the workings of the Government today by moving an amendment to that effect but I give notice to the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner), who is at the table, that should this Bill experience difficulties in the Senate and be returned to this chamber to be subjected to further consideraion by the joint parties I will have no alternative but to move an amendment to the effect that those on the Bench should start contributing to their own superannuation fund. Frankly, I cannot understand the mentality that exists that would change legislation which was introduced to amend existing legislation in order to pick up the needs of one man. That has been explained, but I still find it difficult to stomach, as I believe do most fellow citizens of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion I refer the Minister again to the fact-I am sure that he is looking up notes to assist him to respond-that the judges or those who have the status of judges number 87 in the Federal area. I know that the argument is used that the State governments give the judges of the Supreme Court and their various other courts access to non-contributory superannuation or pension schemes and that the Commonwealth is only following. I say to the Minister in his capacity as the Minister representing the Attorney-General that if we are to justify what we are doing on the grounds that we have to do it because the States do it, that if we do not do it nobody will come to the Federal courts-they will all stay back home in their various States-it is high time that there was a little bit of morality injected into State thinking with the Commonwealth as leader. Instead of simply saying that we have to follow it is time that the Commonwealth said to the States when they are clamouring for additional funds that this is an area where they can increase their funds by requiring a contribution. To my knowledge there is no other superannuation scheme funded by a government anywhere in this country where the recipients and the later beneficiaries do not have to put in a razoo themselves. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking on the Judges' Pensions Amendment Bill 1981 I am taking the opportunity to draw attention by way of contrast to the zealous way the Government ensures that the professional elite which controls our society is adequately rewarded for its enthusiastic support of our conservative Constitution. This scrupulous benevolence, which I am most pleased to note the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Donald Cameron) does not support, is not extended to the poorer sections of our society, however. Let us face it; they do not have the numerical strength or the resources to change our social structure, whether it be by constitutional or revolutionary means. By revolutionary means I mean, of course, not a violent revolution but one which accepts that the disadvantaged and poorer people should have a greater say in the decisions which affect the distribution of resources in our community. For members on the Government side of the House this represents a revolutionary view. For them it is the Hancocks and Murdochs of the world who should decide the future direction of Australia's social and economic development.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What do we discover about this Bill which is, of course, no different in its provisions from many other similar remuneration Bills which have preceded it over the years? As an example, clause 2 (4) provides that the amendments relating to pro rata pensions and amendments of a machinery nature shall come into operation on the 28th day after the day on which the Act receives royal assent. Clause 2 (3) provides that pension entitlements and increases shall be backdated to 1 July 1981. It is interesting at this point to note the determination of the Remuneration Tribunal, which operates under parliamentary procedures, whereby increases in the salaries and allowances for members of parliament, senior public servants, justices and judges, also virtually takes effect immediately. In the case of the determined increases of pensions, salaries and allowances for judges and their dependants the increases are payable virtually immediately and, in some cases, even backdated. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me contrast this almost nepotic generosity with the increases for pensioners who are subject to the administrative machinery of the Department of Social Security. In this case the pensions are adjusted to accord with movements in the consumer price index, but the actual payment of the increases lags six months behind the June and December consumer price index figures. This six month delay in the payment of social security pension increases for age and other pensioners is disgraceful when contrasted with the provisions of this Bill. There can be no excuse for such a skinflint procedure in relation to our age pensioners. It is estimated that this lag in the payment of increases will cost pensioner couples $172 in one year. This represents a saving for the Government of $90m this year at the expense of pensioners. I call on the Government to explain why this six-month delay is necessary at a time when many pensioners are finding it difficult to make both ends meet, particularly when this unreasonable delay is contrasted with the speedy payment of pension increases to judges and their dependants. </PARA>

<PARA>I do not have terribly strong views on this but I think this is different from some of the other legislation which we have passed.

I would like to see the case argued as to whether pensions should cease. I know, in my capacity as a member of the finance committee of the Australian National University Council representing this Parliament, that that question has arisen there. I have an idea that the argument there was that as far as the Public Service is concerned and, I think, as far as this Parliament is concerned, this sort of exclusion no longer applies. In other words, the widow or widower is not forced to 'live in sin' so as to qualify for the pensions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will consider the matter raised by the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman), discuss it with my colleague the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) and provide what information I can to the honourable member. As to the substance of the Judges' Pensions Amendment Bill, the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen) has not criticised any part of the Bill except that which would provide for a retiring judge, who cannot qualify for a full pension on the 10-year qualifying period basis, a pro rata pension if that judge has served seven years as the Bill provides or, as is proposed by the amendment, six years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer the House to the second reading speech made on my behalf by the Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr McVeigh). I will repeat some of it so that the matter is clear in the minds of those honourable members of the House who are in the Chamber at the present time. After referring to the present 10-year qualifying period I said that that requirement was introduced at a time when federal judges enjoyed life tenure. I then pointed out that as a result of the 1977 Constitution alteration, the retirement age of judges was compulsorily fixed at 70-that is, for Federal judges. Furthermore, in the case of Family Court of Australia judges Parliament has fixed, independently of the Constitution, 65 years as the retiring age. In my second reading speech I said:</PARA>
<PARA> As the Act now stands, a judge appointed at an age at which he is not able to complete 10 years service is not entitled to any pension at all when he retires on reaching retiring age. </PARA>
<PARA>It was known by the Government that there were some situations where, both in the Family Court and in other federal jurisdictions there were judges who would not, because of the age at which they had been appointed, reach the 10-year qualifying period. So it was considered by the Government fair that they should be entitled to a pro rata pension. That is the position in a number of States. Originally the Government thought of a qualifying period of five years and an entitlement to a pro rata pension in that event. That entitlement applies in New South Wales, Queensland and South Australia with respect to judges in those State jurisdictions. </PARA>
<PARA> In the end the Government fixed on a period of seven years. As was the Attorney-General's state of knowledge at the time, it was thought that that period of seven years would cover the situation of all present Federal judges both in the Family Court and in other jurisdictions. Now the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith referred to a Federal Court of Australia judge in the Australian Capital Territory and a Family Court judge. I will not name the two judges who I have been advised in both those jurisdictions, will, in fact, benefit from this Bill and the proposed seven-year qualifying period. But I point out that there is a judge in the Federal Court who was in the Australian Capital Territory jurisdiction and a Family Court judge who will benefit by the seven-year qualifying period. </PARA>
<PARA> It came to the attention of the Attorney-General that there was a judge in the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission who could, by reason of age at the time of his appointment, only have six years on the bench and therefore would not qualify under the seven-year period proposed in this Bill. The Attorney, supported by the Government, thought that it was a matter of simple justice, no more than that, that this judge, whose name has been mentioned here, Mr Justice Marks, should be brought within this pro rata entitlement when an amendment was being made specifically to benefit other known judges in the Federal jurisdiction. I challenge anybody in this House to question the simple justice of the proposition. That is the way in which I view it, the Attorney-General views it and the Government views it. I think it is to be deeply regretted, indeed, that the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith should have spoken about this matter in the way in which he did. It is to be greatly regretted that the honourable gentleman, who is a legal practitioner himself and who knows the integrity of the legal profession, should feel that there is anything but a sense of simple justice which will cause the Government to move the amendment for the six-year period.</PARA>
<PARA> I am advised by my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) that no promise of the kind which the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith has spoken about was given. Certainly my colleague, in his discussions with Mr Justice Marks, said that if there was to be any changes to the pension rights of judges, then the gentleman's position would be taken into account. I would have thought that that was a perfectly honourable thing for my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs to do. If one needs any more verification than what I have said, that there was no such promise as has been said to this House, it can be gauged from the fact that the original intention of the Government was to amend the Bill by putting in a qualifying period for a pro rata pension at seven years. It was only after the position of Mr Justice Marks was drawn to the attention of the Attorney-General that the Government proposed six years. So I do feel that the tone, language and approach of the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith is to be deprecated. I might say also that the tone, language and approach of certain press reports of discussion in the joint parties room yesterday about this matter is to be deprecated. I end on the note that the amendment that I propose to move, as I and the Government see it, is a matter of simple justice for the judge concerned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As indicated now, the Judges' Pensions Amendment Bill has no relationship to any one judge. It regularises the whole matter of judges pensions in terms of public interest and the amount of pension that is payable to a widow and children who are beneficiaries. A widow appears to receive 62 1/2 per cent of the rate of the relevant pension. If there are three children they will receive 100 per cent of the pension; so the children, in addition to the widow, get a pension. A very substantial amount of money is being given on a non-contributing basis. Whilst I now welcome the fact that, after I raised the matter in early 1979, the Government has seen fit to introduce legislation to encompass the two judges who I made representations for, it is very clear that this measure benefits one particular judge. I am wondering how far can we go in supporting the Government if we find a judge who will serve for only three or four years. We will reach the ridiculous situation of needing to have some standards. From the point of view of the Opposition, it seemed appropriate that seven years was a reasonable time. It certainly covered all the judges at that time I made representation. I accept the point that no promise was made to this particular judge. I have already withdrawn any inference that there was. In fairness to what has been said in the course of the debate, seven years is a reasonable time. It is a most substantial pension which applies, as I say, not only to a judges widow but also to his children. The Opposition sees no reason why the qualifying period should be reduced further from seven years. We oppose the amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Estimates Committee E, which examined the estimates of the Department of Industrial Relations, met on 8 September. Of course, it was those proceedings which gave rise to the subsequent censure motion in this House of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner). In speaking to the report of the Committee at this stage, I draw the attention of the house to the very disturbing fact that we may be up for additional expenditure because of the result of another case of this Minister misleading people in the field of industrial relations, particularly in the area of the National Labour Consultative Council. On 4 December 1980 the Minister's predecessor, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), gave an indication that he was going to move a motion requesting an inquiry to be undertaken in respect of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act which would lead to its simplification and make it an instrument which would be more useful in the area of industrial relations. He confirmed that to the House on 9 April this year when he indicated that Mr Richard Searby, Q.C., and Deputy President Taylor had been commissioned to undertake such an inquiry into the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. On both those occasions-in December 1980 and again on 9 April 1981-the firm promise was made that the inquiry to be undertaken would be confined to technical matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I say, the predecessor of this Minister made that statement in good faith to this House on 9 April. Just one week later, on 16 April, the present Minister took over that portfolio. Just a short while later, on 27 April, there was a meeting of the National Labour Consultative Council. At that meeting on 27 April the Minister referred to the review of the Act which was to be conducted by Messrs Searby and Taylor. On Monday, 27 April the Minister specifically confirmed to that meeting of the NLCC that the inquiry would be concerned only with technical matters of simplifying and clarifying the Act and would not go into questions of policy. That was Monday, 27 April. The unequivocal and specific undertaking was given to the supreme body in the industrial relations area, the peak councils of employers and trade unions, that the inquiry by Searby and Taylor would not go to questions of policy. That is what the Minister said to the NLCC on Monday, 27 April. By the Friday of that week-1 May-the Minister was actively engaged in breaking that specific and unequivocal undertaking he had given the previous Monday to the NLCC. On that Friday he was specifically asking that the inquiry should go to matters beyond mechanical matters-that it should go in fact to questions of policy. That is confirmed in a letter which he wrote on 8 May to Mr Searby. </PARA>
<PARA> He wrote:</PARA>
<PARA> I write following the talk I had with you and with Mr Taylor on Friday afternoon last (May 1). </PARA>
<PARA> Amongst other things, we discussed three additional particular matters the Government would like you to examine in conjunction with your consultancy to the department. </PARA>
<PARA>He then listed the three matters concerned:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the possible need for legislation as to: Qualifications and accountability of officials of organisations registered under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act; Accelerating the process of securing stand-down orders from the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission or providing a right of stand-down by legislation; Complementary legislation between the Commonwealth and a State in cases of deregistration. </PARA>
<PARA> You were kind enough to tell me that you were willing to examine these matters alongside the work you would be doing as part of the consultancy. </PARA>
<PARA>There we have in writing by the Minister on 8 May confirmation that, on the Friday after the Monday on which he had given a specific and unequivocal undertaking to the national employers and trade unions that the inquiry by Searby and Taylor would be confined strictly to mechanical matters, he was breaking that undertaking. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to see how this matter developed. On 21 May, Mr Boulton, who is the legal officer of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, met with Messrs Searby and Taylor and Mr Fogarty of the Department in the offices of the Department in Melbourne, having been informed again at that stage that the review concerned technical matters and non-policy matters. That is what he was told and on that basis he met with them on 21 May. What had been given to him to confirm that that was the nature of the inquiry was the terms of reference of the consultants. I read the terms of reference given to the ACTU after the Minister had broken his promise on Friday, 1 May. The terms of reference were:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. To consider the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904 and the conciliation and arbitration regulations and to make recommendations as to how the provisions of the Act and regulations can best be simplified and clarified. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. Review the large number of amendments that have been made to the Act and regulations with a view to formulating proposals for their integration into a more coherent and cohesive legislative framework. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the terms of reference were completely to do with the technical matters of the Act, with no reference to any suggestion of policy. At that meeting on 21 May, therefore, Mr Boulton indicated that the ACTU would support such a review and, indeed, would advise affiliated unions to co-operate. That was the undertaking given at that point. </PARA>
<PARA> After Mr Boulton had given that undertaking in the discussion on 21 May, as Mr Dolan, the President of the ACTU, has since made clear publicly, the first indications of the deliberate duplicity of this Minister emerged. Mr Searby on 21 May, in conversations that he expressed to Mr Boulton to be off the record, asked whether the ACTU would consider it controversial if one of the recommendations went to the question of prohibitions on people holding union office. Of course, the legal officer of the ACTU on 21 May objected very strongly and naturally, as was his duty, reported the thrust of that discussion to officers of the ACTU. But they, on the basis that Mr Searby's comments were off the record and on the basis of the specific terms of reference which had been conveyed to them and which mentioned none of these policy matters, went ahead on the basis that the ACTU would co-operate. So it stood at that point. </PARA>
<PARA> It was not until 23 June when the Australian Financial Review published that letter of 8 May that there emerged for the first time to the knowledge of the ACTU and of the employers for that matter-the first time it came to the knowledge of the participants in the NLCC-the fact that there had been this deliberate duplicity and a deliberate contradiction of the unequivocal undertaking given to both the employers and the ACTU that the only matters to be considered in that inquiry by Searby and Taylor would in fact be matters of a technical kind. When that emerged on 23 June in the Australian Financial Review, the President of the ACTU, Mr Dolan, naturally got in touch immediately with the Minister. In his telex he said:</PARA>
<PARA> If the report in the Australian Financial Review is correct, it would appear that the Government has been less than frank in disclosing the purpose and scope of the review. In fact, it would indicate that the Government has been deceitful in its relations with the Union Movement over this matter. Needless to say, this is not an approach that will foster co-operation or understanding between the Government and the Union Movement, nor will it contribute in any postive way to the improvement of industrial relations in this country. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister telexed back the following day and said: 'Well, it is all right. I have got in touch with the people who are doing this inquiry and I have told them not to go ahead'. But that letter was sent on 29 May. Why did he send the letter on 29 May saying: 'We do not want you to go ahead with this'? It was because the gaff had been blown in the conversation with Mr Boulton on 21 May. In other words, for a month from 27 April, when he had deceived the NLCC, until 29 May-his cover having been blown on 21 May by Mr Searby to Mr Boulton-he allowed that deception to go ahead. In the event, of course, when the report was made available to the NLCC, both the national employers and the ACTU expressed their total condemnation of the Minister for this misrepresentation that had taken place. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister, in total contradistinction to the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr Street) and the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) who have held this position before him, is not a man whose word can be trusted. He has done it now a second time. The taxpayers of this country may be up for additional expenditure because of the additional investigation that those two people were requested by the Minister to undertake on 1 May in deliberate contravention of what he told the employers. The national employers of this country and the national trade union movement of this country do not trust this Minister; nor does anyone else. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to talk about the estimates for the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs. I was a member of the Estimates Committee which considered that Department. Naturally most of its time was devoted to the Government's decision, which still stood at the time, to terminate the Community Youth Support Scheme. Again I take the opportunity to congratulate the Government on reversing its Budget decision and deciding to continue the funding of CYSS. I hope that some of the recommendations that I made in this Parliament on 24 September will be given consideration when the new CYSS guidelines are introduced. I certainly hope that the review of these guidelines, which I consider to be a most important exercise, will take into account the views of the various CYSS project officers throughout Australia. In my electorate, many of the project officers have been putting a lot of time and effort into this matter because they recognise many of the deficiencies in the previous guidelines for the Community Youth Support Scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One matter which I raised in the Committee referred to the Special Youth Employment Training Program. I think it is an excellent scheme for unemployed youth provided it is well monitored by the Department. The scheme provides a subsidy of $55 a week for 17 weeks for employers who take on and train unemployed young people aged between 15 and 24 years. The scheme is fine so long as employers do not use it as a source of cheap and expendable labour. I was advised at the Estimates Committee that there was a retention rate of about 60 per cent of youths in this scheme who were in employment 12 months after commencing participation in the scheme. That is a good record and I do not want to be negative about a scheme which is producing positive results; but I am anxious to ensure that the scheme is not abused by employers. It should not be seen by the young unemployed as a 17-week wonder. This would only reinforce negative attitudes towards employers and towards the scheme itself. I wrote to the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr N. A. Brown) some months ago regarding the possible exploitation of this scheme by employers. He responded in a letter dated 29 July 1981 by saying:</PARA>
<PARA> Administrative guidelines have therefore been written in such a way as to minimise as much as possible any avenues that may be used by employers to exploit the program. For example, employers must lodge any vacancy in which they intend to employ a trainee with the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) and select from among those referred to the position by the CES. </PARA>
<PARA>Certainly this minimises the possibility of employers using the program as a means of obtaining a subsidy for persons they would normally employ anyway. That kind of guarantee is provided. The same letter went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, before payment of the training subsidy can be approved, employers must enter into a written training agreement which specifies the duties of the position, the training to be undertaken and the award wage which is to be paid. Any default by the employer of part or all of these aspects is regarded very seriously and if not rectified will result in cessation of the payment of subsidy and/or recovery of any subsidy paid. Furthermore, defaulting employers are given a low priority for any future placements. </PARA>
<PARA>That also is an essential guarantee. These guarantees do not refer to the possibility of the scheme being used solely as a source of cheap and then expendable labour by employers. Most of them, I must say, have behaved responsibly towards the scheme but, of course, one does get feedback that there is perhaps a minority of employers who are not abiding by the spirit of this scheme. I hope the Department continues to monitor carefully this situation. The new extended Special Youth Employment Training Program whereby subsidies to employers are paid over a 34-week period is a very good and much improved scheme and will probably result in better employment retention rates for unemployed youths. I congratulate the Government for that initiative. In summary on this Department, I congratulate the Minister and the Government for the very high priority given in this Budget to job training and work experience programs. The 67 per cent increase in funding for youth training programs and the large increase in funding of overall job training and work experience programs represent a real and genuine concern by this Government for the unemployed in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> I also attended the Estimates Committee for the Department of Housing and Construction. I would like to say a few words on that. We discussed appropriations of some $980m to this Department for 1981-82. One of the biggest problems facing the average Australian at the moment is undoubtedly the difficulty he is having in meeting his home mortgage repayments. Australia traditionally has a proud record in the area of home ownership. At the Estimates Committee on 17 September the Minister for Housing and Construction stated that Australia has the highest level of home ownership in the Western world with 71.9 per cent of our relevant population either owning their own homes outright or in the process of purchasing them and 35 per cent of this population owning their own homes outright with absolutely no mortgage. Interestingly enough in response to my question at this Committee the Department has subsequently given me information which indicates that the majority of those families which own their own homes outright are those on the average weekly earnings level of income or those in the middle income brackets. I seek leave to have this question, answer and table incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am concerned that this record could be placed in jeopardy. As I said in my speech on the Budget, the average family unit with normal family obligations of mortgage repayments, education bills, health bills and the like is having great difficulty in surviving financially given the present levels of interest rates and State and Federal charges. I think that any threat to the family unit in our society is a threat to the very future of this country. This is a matter I have pursued in this House and will continue to pursue with the Government. I simply say here that there is a great need to introduce family impact statements on a national and continuing basis involving all three levels of government because, after all, each level of government takes money out of, and puts money into, the family unit. We must know exactly and officially how families with mortgages have fared in recent years given their other obligations and the policies of each level of government in this country. Only then will the Government be in a position to target accurately the tax relief which we are told will be coming at some time in the future. Whether this is in the form of tax deductibility for home repayments and the increased interest component of these repayments or whether it is to be targeted directly through tax reductions for the family unit is a matter of judgment, but relief for the home purchasing family is imperative. Professionally prepared family impact statements should be introduced in order that the extent, the nature and the direction of financial relief for the family unit can be soundly based.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to give some bouquets to the relevant Minister for some of his recent initiatives. I congratulate the Minister and the Government for the increased commitment to the Homes Savings Grant Scheme arising from the Government's previous decision to increase substantially the maximum value limit for homes savings grants and to provide a family bonus, recognising the needs of the family unit, all of which means that expenditure on this scheme will increase from $45m in 1980-81 to $74m in 1981-82, which is an increase of 64 per cent. This does not overcome the major problems of high interest rates confronting home owners in Australia faced with record mortgage repayments; that is the responsibility perhaps of other Ministers. It does go some way towards helping those who are facing the purchase of their first home. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like also to congratulate the Minister and the Government for introducing the program of crisis accommodation for families. This commitment of $2m honours an election promise of the Government and it will be provided either directly to charitable organisations or indirectly through the States. On my own experience in welfare matters, I urge the Minister to press for these funds to be made available directly to voluntary, church and charitable organisations because I believe that they are better placed to identify areas of real need in society and are better placed to ensure that the administration of these funds is handled in a way which ensures that the $2m is spent on needy families rather than on expensive administrative machinery. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to congratulate the Department of Housing and Construction for being awarded the Bronze Medal this year for its contribution to the International Year of Disabled Persons. Although this Department has not committed large or massive funding to this area of need, it has provided very practical and obvious assistance for disabled people of the kind which is often overlooked in large, universal welfare programs. I am advised from the estimates of that Department that this three-year program will be continued at a reasonable level of funding in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are considering the report of Estimates Committee E in relation to the Department of Industrial Relations, the Department of Education, the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs and the Department of Housing and Construction. I say at the outset that this debate is a farce. It is a farce in that the time a member has to make a contribution to the consideration of the Estimates is extremely limited. There was a time when an honourable member could speak in this chamber for 15 minutes on two occasions on each department. Now the departments are thrown together and there is no continuity of discussion. I will limit my contribution on housing and construction. The honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) has made a contribution on industrial relations and on employment and youth affairs. The Executive controls this Government and this Parliament and the Parliament has very little say. Back bench members are being restricted year after year, are being gagged and are not being allowed to express themselves in the way they should.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having said that, I will now make a contribution, limited by time constraints, on the matter of housing and construction. Next to unemployent, housing is the most serious social problem in this country. This Government clearly has set out to sabotage and completely wipe out the housing industry. It will downgrade it completely because of the financial policies it is following. The fact is that money is being drained out of the housing industry. The government is not only attacking the private sector but also the public sector. For instance, the cuts in public sector housing are so serious that if we take into consideration the last full year in which a Labor Government governed this country-that was 1974-75-we see that the amount in constant terms given to public sector housing was $789m. After interest repayments and capital repayments from the States to the Commonwealth the net amount was $573m. This year-the equivalent period-the gross amount of money is $255m and the net amount of money is $47m. That is an appalling condition. It is an enormous cutback. What is making the situation worse are the conditions in which the Government is placing private home buyers. </PARA>
<PARA> For instance, the situation is so bad that in Australian Business of 22 October, in a major article on housing, a table sets out the median price costs of housing in the respective capital cities. In Sydney the median price was $79,500, in Melbourne it was $45,400, in Canberra it was $52,500 and in Perth it was $42,100. The table shows that in Sydney one needs a loan of approximately 53,000 and a deposit of $26,500. With a 12.5 per cent interest rate a person would have to pay $552 a month for such a loan. We know that is an impossible dream if we look at average earnings. Average earnings at the end of the July quarter this year were $290 a week. The maximum loan a person on that income could get from a savings bank would be $29,350. That means that a person would have to repay $320 per month. Even if we did not take the median price in Sydney but took the bottom end of the market, that is approximately $50,000. So these people, if they are on average earnings, would be able to borrow $29,300. They would have to find about $21,000 deposit and then, of course, pay $320 a month for 25 years. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation is that 70 per cent of all workers earn less then average earnings. That means that nearly four out of every five people are excluded from owning a home in the private sector. Therefore, according to those figures I have just given in regard to public sector housing, more and more pressure is being placed on them. At present in Australia 150,000 people are homeless. One quarter of a million people live in makeshift, temporary accommodation and 80,000 families are waiting on housing commission lists in New South Wales alone.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The article in Australian Business states that the climbing birth rate and increasing immigration has led the Indicative Planning Council for the Housing Industry to suggest that the rate of new housing would reach 150,000 dwellings per year for the rest of the decade. Building approvals for new dwellings have dropped from 120,000 to 106,000 a year. I bring to the House's attention the fact that the Indicative Planning Council, the Government's advisory body on housing for the future, says that for the next decade we need another 150,000 dwellings a year. Yet in the last six years the highest figure was 135,000 new dwellings. This year it is estimated that only about 106,000 dwellings will be built. In regard to the projections of the population of this country, Borrie said that in the middle 1970s there would be a population of about 17.5 million people, but the latest information tabled in this House by the Minister for Immigration (Mr Macphee) estimates that there will be between 19.5 million and 20 million by the turn of the century.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I ask the Government for heavens sake to start to re-examine the situtation. What it is doing by putting all its eggs into one basket of resource development is squeezing out the little people. It is transferring wealth to the big corporate sector and it is squeezing the little people, both in the private and public sectors. It is even forcing semi-government authorities to borrow to build electricity power stations to back up aluminium smelters. They are paying 15.5 per cent and 15.7 per cent in interest. How can the housing authorities, the banks or the permanent building societies compete with that interest payment level? We want a realistic policy for housing. We want a policy that will allow first home buyers to get their foot on the home ownership rung. We need to protect those people who are now paying off their homes. Because of increasing interest rates we need to protect those people who cannot meet their repayments from being forced out of their homes. We need a policy which will give the public sector housing a high priority in this country where only 4.5 per cent of all houses in Australia are owned by public sector housing. We need to see that by the end of the decade at least 10 per cent of all housing will be in the public sector. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to answer the matters raised by the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) because they are clear enough to answer. I think we have seen from the honourable member today the malevolence which he is prepared to bring to bear in debates in this House. I suspect that the longer the honourable gentleman is with us and the deeper his frustration grows, the more malevolence he will pour upon this side of the House. I think that comment extends beyond myself to other members on my side of politics. I think that is clear enough from the way in which the honourable gentleman has approached his role in this House. We have seen it more and more from the beginning and, as I said, I suspect that as his frustration deepens we will see even more of it in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The situation regarding the Searby-Taylor consultancy and the matters raised by the honourable gentleman are clear enough. That consultancy was implemented by my predecessor, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), and Mr Richard Searby, Q.C., and Mr J. E. Taylor were engaged to undertake that exercise. Mr Searby is a skilled barrister. I remind the House that he has done other work for the Government, notably in the area of trade practices law, when a year or so ago amendments were made to the law to cover the situation of a garage proprietor being discriminated against by the unions and the major oil companies. The engagement of Mr Searby, Q.C., as a consultant to the Government is not a new phenomenon. </PARA>
<PARA> It so happened that, within the Government and within the Government parties, notably, in our party room, a member knowledgeable in and concerned with industrial matters, raised the matters referred to in my letter-not of 8 May, I might mention, but of 6 May-to Mr Searby. Those three matters were: First, the qualifications and accountability of officials of organisations registered under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act; secondly, accelerating the process of securing stand-down orders from the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission or providing a right of stand-down by legislation; and, thirdly, complementary legislation between the Commonwealth and a State in cases of deregistration. As is well known publicly, the last mentioned matter was raised with the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) by the Premier of Western Australia some time ago. The second matter, relating to stand-downs, has been a matter of concern to employers and the Government. The first matter, relating to qualifications and accountability of officials, is one which has been raised in the Government members party room. </PARA>
<PARA> Upon consideration it was thought that those three matters might be ones which could be incorporated in legislation in the then current session of the Parliament. It was thought further that Mr Searby might be able to assist the Government as he had done in drafting amending legislation to the Trade Practices Act. So it was that I approached Mr Searby after the National Labour Consultative Council meeting of 27 April, as is indicated clearly enough in my letter to Mr Searby of 6 May. Indeed, I approached Mr Searby on 1 May and asked him whether he could assist the Government in the way I mentioned. The House will notice the language I used as I read part of that letter:</PARA>
<PARA> Amongst other things, we discussed three additional particular matters that Government would like you to examine in conjunction with your consultancy to the Department. </PARA>
<PARA>The three matters were then mentioned. I went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> You were kind enough to tell me that you were willing to examine these matters alongside the work you would be doing as part of the consultancy. We discussed the possibility that you could formulate proposals which might be considered by the Government with a view to appropriate legislation being introduced in the current Session of Parliament. On present indications, the Session will end during the first week of June. </PARA>
<PARA>Those three matters had arisen within the Government subsequent to the meeting I had with the NLCC on 27 April. In those discussions Mr Searby advised me that he would consider the matter. He thought that it might be possible not to intrude into the timetable of his general consultancy on the Act in looking at those three specific matters. He said that he would advise me whether it would be possible to examine the matters within the time frame I had mentioned to him, that is, within the then current parliamentary session, in May this year, or whether it would take longer. His advice to me was that he could not do it within the then current session. He said that, if it was the Government's intention to introduce legislation, we would have to look at introducing it during the Budget session or later. </PARA>
<PARA> I noticed that the honourable member for Wills referred to a meeting held on 21 May. I take it that he was referring to a meeting by Mr Searby-I am not aware whether Mr Taylor was present-with the Australian Council of Trade Unions as part of the consultation process he had always intended to undertake in his review of the Act. Of course, I was not informed by Mr Searby what his precise timetable of discussions was to be. I was aware that he proposed having discussions with the ACTU and other unions, the Confederation of Australian Industry and other employer groups; indeed, with whomever he thought it advisable to hold discussions. </PARA>
<PARA> Early in June I was about to leave for overseas to attend the annual conference of the International Labour Organisation. In the course of reviewing what work was current in my Department, I considered the advice Mr Searby had given me about his timetable for looking at those three matters. I came to the conclusion that I should not authorise Mr Searby to proceed with the engagement concerning those three matters and I notified him of that by letter of 29 May. I informed Mr Searby that I would be leaving for overseas on Sunday, 31 May. I said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I have been considering what you have said in your letter and, in particular, the implications of including these three matters in your discussions with interest groups including peak union councils and employers.

In the circumstances, I have concluded that they should not be included in your consultancy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I referred to the malevolence of the honourable member beforehand. As his frustration grows so his malevolence grows deeper. I think the honourable member will appreciate that, where there is cor- respondence on matters such as this, I am not obliged to table it. On 23 June, the Australian Financial Review published a report-speaking of confidential correspondence-of a letter it dated 8 May, which is the letter I referred to as dated 6 May. That letter is set out in full in the Australian Financial Review of that date. Obviously some person chose to make that letter available. I have no idea who did it. I telephoned the president of the ACTU, Mr Cliff Dolan, that day-indeed, it may well have been before Mr Dolan's telex reached me-and I expressed to Mr Dolan my concern at the Press report in that day's Australian Financial Review. I informed Mr Dolan also that the matter to which my letter of 8 May referred had been withdrawn from Mr Searby. I pointed out to Mr Dolan that the Press report did not refer to the letter of 29 May.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I put out a Press statement that day. The relevant parts of that Press statement are:</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Ian Viner, today said that the disclosure of the letter quoted in today's Australian Financial Review is a good example of a malicious act taken without knowledge of all the facts. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Viner said that on 29 May he had written to the consultants, Mr Richard Searby, Q.C. and the Honourable J. E. Taylor, C.B.E. advising them he did not wish them to consider the matters referred to as part of their consultancy. </PARA>
<PARA>I then quoted from the letter and said:</PARA>
<PARA> I have advised the President of the ACTU, Mr Cliff Dolan of the true facts and reassured him that the consultants will only be examining technical aspects of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. </PARA>
<PARA>I telexed Mr Dolan that day in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA> Thank you for your telex message regarding the Australian Financial Review article. I can understand your concern. The disclosure of the letter is a good example of a malicious act undertaken without knowledge of the full facts. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government had asked me to explore with Searby the matters mentioned in the disclosed letter. However, before I left for overseas, I wrote again to Searby advising him that the matters were not to be included in his consultancy. I said in my later letter and I quote, 'All three topics clearly go to matters of policy which would normally be raised with employers and unions through the National Labour Consultative Council.'</PARA>
<PARA> I will be raising these matters in the normal way at the next NLCC meeting on July 8. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope this clarifies the situation for you. The purpose and scope of the review is as originally stated, concerned with technical matters only. </PARA>
<PARA>From the conversation that I had with Mr Dolan and the Telex that I sent him, I believed-and I still believe-that he was quite satisfied as to the circumstances of the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> This matter was raised at the NLCC meeting on 8 July. Naturally enough the ACTU sought clarification. Clarification was given as I have explained it to this House. The ACTU, again not unnaturally, sought assurances that the review that was to be carried out by Mr Searby and Mr Taylor would be made available to the ACTU for comment before the Government took any action on it. That, of course, will be done. I think that as the House knows the facts, in a form neither twisted nor distorted as they were by the honourable member for Wills, the House will understand that what happened was a perfectly normal series of events in the ordinary course of government. Only the malevolent mind of a person such as the honourable member for Wills could distort these events in the way in which he has sought to do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall not take up much of the time of the House. However, there are a few matters that I wish to raise. This Government has a long record of confrontation in the industrial relations area. Since this Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner) took over the portfolio in April this year, that confrontation has increased dramatically. In fact, the industrial relations record of this Government has gone from bad to catastrophic.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair) got into the act in the telecommunications dispute in May of this year. Singlehandedly, for and on behalf of the Government, he nearly brought telecommunications in this country to a standstill. The Government refused to negotiate some very reasonable demands by the Telecom Australia union and the postal union. Those demands are reasonable when one considers that those bodies are well down the wages list for statutory bodies. In fact, the Queensland Electricity Commission had by far the highest paid workers. At that point they were receiving some $40 more than the Telecom workers. But the Government refused to negotiate. It then attempted to use the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to ratify an agreement. This Government uses the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission when it thinks it fit to hammer the unions, but never really for the purposes of conciliation. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish now to raise a few matters which were brought up in Estimates Committee E on 8 September. The Government and the Treasurer (Mr Howard) keep saying that we are in a year of restraint; yet we see that already nearly three-quarters of a million dollars is earmarked to deregister the Builders Labourers Federation. At the Estimates Committee E meeting, Mr Power had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Referring to my notes, the correct figures is $693,500. </PARA>
<PARA>That amount has already been earmarked to deregister the BLF. At one stage at that meeting, Mr Viner said:</PARA>
<PARA> It could well be beyond 30 June 1982. </PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, it is possible that the deregistration of the BLF would cost the people of Australia over $1m. Yet at the same time, as the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren) has already said, the money allocated to pensioners, sporting clubs, and the fields of education and housing has been cut in no uncertain terms. Here we have an amount of $1m set aside. Yet the Industrial Relations Bureau has been expanded and its staff ceiling has been lifted. Last year its inspections doubled from 14,000 to 28,000. We never quite got to the bottom of that as the time of the Committee ran out before further inquiries could be made into that area. It seems to me to be a body that should have been abolished. The Prices Justification Tribunal went out of the window. But the Industrial Relations Bureau-the Government's big stick-was kept going and, in fact, has been expanded. The Trade Union Training Authority-TUTA-which is recognised from all sides as having done a wonderful job in training unionists and others in the area of industrial relations and conciliation and arbitration, has had its staff reduced. I asked the following question of Mr Heagney at the Estimates Committee:</PARA>
<PARA> Is the reduction in staff ceilings for TUTA likely to hamper TUTA's operation?</PARA>
<PARA>The answer was a fairly long one. I picked him up and said:</PARA>
<PARA> So it will have an effect. </PARA>
<PARA>The answer from Mr Heagney was:</PARA>
<PARA> It has that effect. </PARA>
<PARA>This has happened at the same time as the Government is spending $1m or more to deregister the Builders Labourers Federation. Normie Gallagher must be laughing at the expense to which this Government is going to wield the big stick. A good Liberal, Mr Searby, is being paid by the Government as an independent consultant to help with its industrial relations. Page 20 of the explanatory notes indicates that over $53,000 has gone to the consultants in more ways than one. An amount of $33,500 has been paid in consultants' fees and the other $20,000-odd is made up of travelling allowances, air fares, car hire and secretarial allowances for Mr Searby and Mr Taylor. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right, he is a Queen's Counsel. I think his last public exploit was to referee one of the rounds between the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) some months ago. At the same time he was a consultant for the Government on industrial relations matters. If this Government were fair dinkum about industrial relations it would consider conciliation more. It never does so. The Minister should be reminded that it is the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. It is not the other way round. It never has been. It was deliberately called the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission for that specific purpose.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Government has always taken the big stick to industrial relations. People are continually told that it is always the fault of the unions in dispute after dispute. Members of the Opposition have never said that the unions are always right but one surely must start to wonder whether it is the fault of the unions all the time. It is like the little boy who gets punched on the nose by 10 different kids. Is it the fault of the other 10 kids? After the first three or four occasions one begins to wonder whose fault it really is. I ask the people of Australia to consider whose fault it really is. Industrial relations in Australia are in an absolute shambles, mainly caused by the Federal Government. The Victorian Government is desperately trying to cause some trouble because it is the only way it will win the State election. It will go down the drain whenever it calls an election. Conservative governments have no idea how to bring people together through conciliation so that they can work in harmony and not in continual confrontation. Those are the few remarks I wished to make. On the one hand money is being thrown around with gay abandon when it suits the Government and on the other hand great restrictions are being brought forward in many areas. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to respond to the opinion of Estimates Committee E in relation to the proposed expenditure for the Department of Education. First, in relation to the Government's decision to change from retrospective cost supplementation to a prospective allowance, the previous arrangements have been changed over in their entirety. The Government believes that this arrangement provides for all anticipated cost increases. The allowance is not an artificially scaled-down one. In fact, the methodology and level of the allowance were determined after consultation with the education commissions. The Government believes that this change will promote greater efficiency by giving education administrators greater certainty as to the level of funds available, thus enabling them to meet additional costs as they arise instead of experiencing the lags in payments inherent in the previous retrospective system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the discussion with the Committee, it was not made clear that non-government schools have been receiving a prospective allowance in their recurrent grants for cost increases since the cost supplementation arrangements were introduced. The procedure is that, before the commencement of each year, the Government announces recurrent grants at a level which includes a prospective allowance for cost increases in the first half of the year. In the second half of the year, any necessary adjustment to the prospective allowance is included in the grants for estimated cost increases in the second half of the year. The differences between the prospective allowance and actual cost increases have been minimal. </PARA>
<PARA> The question was also raised by the Committee as to the effect of sales tax increases, announced in the Budget, upon the cost of building materials for schools, and hence the effect on the level of capital grants for 1982. Honourable members will recall that the Treasurer (Mr Howard) clearly stated in his Budget Speech that education institutions will retain their exempt status. This means that all goods, including building materials, for educational institutions will continue to be free from sales tax. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also refer to the expression of opinion by Estimates Committee E which was moved by me at that Committee meeting and carried by the Committee. I am grateful to the Minister for Education (Mr Fife) for having provided us with his views on the expression of opinion, as he has just done. I add that it is a great pity that he was not able to respond at the Committee meeting in the way he did today. The expression of opinion has as much to do with the Committee's inability to get satisfactory answers to important questions as it has to the questions themselves. The Minister referred to the question of the impact that sales tax may have had on the building costs of schools. He said we should have known about that because the Treasurer (Mr Howard) mentioned in his Budget Speech that sales tax on building materials would not apply to educational institutions. If it is so obvious now it is a pity that the Minister, or at least one of his several advisers attending the Estimates Committee, could not have answered that simple question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn to the questions in greater detail. I do not think that the explanation that the Minister has now provided is anything like adequate. I think that the House should, at the very least, note the expression of opinion agreed to at Estimates Committee E. First of all, I will deal with the Government's change from cost supplementation to the out turn prices basis for determining funds for education. In the past the Government at Budget time announced what it proposed to appropriate for education-schools, universities, colleges and so on-in the forthcoming period. If there were cost increases during that period the Government would provide later special appropriations to take account of those increases, the net result of which was that the educational institutions were compensated for them and did not themselves have to bear the brunt of inflation. In fact, the real value of the moneys appropriated in the preceding Budget was maintained. What has happened on this occasion-the Minister passed over it lightly as though it were a fairly trivial change-is that the Government is making prospective estimates of what the cost rises will be in the forthcoming period and building them in to the appropriations in this Budget. Now that might be all very well if the Government had a perfectly reliable crystal ball and could accurately determine what the cost increases were going to be in the forthcoming period. It is quite clear from my calculations that the Government has not accurately predicted what the changes in costs will be and, in fact, the estimates it has made do not even agree with the estimates in the Budget itself. </PARA>
<PARA> The first point is that the amounts provided for universities, colleges and schools were first announced in June. It was in June that the estimates were made in relation to cost increases during 1982. Of course, what has happened, between June and August is that circumstances have changed and the estimates by the Government itself have changed also. Let me say that it is not easy to work out what estimate the Government was using in June. It is a very great pity that the Government has not come clean and tabled the basis of that calculation so that we know the actual basis on which it was made. From the information that is publicly available to us it is apparent that the Government was using a figure of about 9.2 per cent for the estimated cost increases during 1982, and that is what it built in to the grants which it subsequently made available in the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> However, in the Budget statements the estimate for cost increases in 1982 is, in fact, 10.75 per cent, that is, an estimate of 1.55 per cent more than the estimate in June. The problem is that the Government did not then increase the amounts which it had determined would be available back in June. To that extent it is already clear that schools, universities and colleges throughout Australia will be shortchanged by the Government as a result of this apparently trivial change from cost supplementation to this prospective estimate of cost increases built into the grants. What that means in dollar terms is that universities and colleges throughout Australia will be shortchanged by an amount of $23.6m and schools throughout Australia will be shortchanged by an amount of $14.3m a year. What this really represent is a sort of sleight-of-hand, a sort of devious attempt to reduce further the amounts of money which the Government is making available to education; that is, the shortchanging comes on top of the quite deliberate, quite specific funding cuts which the Government is determined to make. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, as an absolute minimum the Government ought to make available to the Parliament the basis on which those calculations were made back in June so that everyone can be clear about the extent to which those calculations are out. Ideally the Government ought to abandon this scheme and return to the much fairer system of cost supplementation. The Minister said just a few moments ago that this is a better method because it provides for greater certainty in relation to the funds available to the educational institutions. What he really means in saying that is that the institutions are now faced with a certain poverty rather than delayed security in terms of the amount of money which they will get. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government said also back in June that one of the reasons for this change is that it will force the educational institutions to be far more responsible in dealing with cost increases and they can apparently resist those cost increases. That, quite frankly, is nonsense. Eighty per cent of the cost of running most educational institutions is by way of salaries and wages. There is really no way in which universities, colleges or schools can resist those increases in wages. All the wage and salary levels are set by independent arbitral bodies of one kind or another. Of course, the salaries in universities and colleges are set by the Academic Salaries Tribunal, which is a body established by the Commonwealth. There is really no way in which the universities and colleges can resist these cost increases; they are increases over which those institutions have no control at all. I have had the Parliamentary Library prepare a document and I have asked the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner), who is at the table, for leave to have it incoporated in Hansard. I now formally seek leave to have the document incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What I really want to say in this regard is that this will have very serious consequences if, as I suggest, the estimates of the Government are substantially out. Whilst the Schools Commission regrettably seems to take this change on its face value and makes no comment about the impact of this change, the Tertiary Education Commission at least draws attention to the problem inherent in the change. I will not read all that the Commission says in relation to funding cuts for the forthcoming period. Having referred to those cuts, the Commission says in referring to the fact that there is something like $54m less than the Commission recommended available for expenditure on universities and colleges and the technical and further education sector:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The consequences of this reduction in funding will be even more serious if the prospective allowance for cost supplementation falls short of actual cost increases. </PARA>
<PARA>So much for the Minister's suggestion that the commissions have, in fact, concurred in their estimates. Quite clearly, the Tertiary Education Commission has some doubts about it. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to building costs, I accept now what the Minister has belatedly discovered, that educational institutions will not be liable directly to pay for these new sales taxes or sales tax increases. I put it to the Minister that there is absolutely no question that the imposition of sales tax on building materials will flow through to building costs, especially with small projects. It will be quite impossible and, I think, quite unrealistic to expect that builders involved in contracts for building schools and so on will have the time to make claims for exemptions in relation to what might be individually quite small amounts of sales tax. What they will do is make some guess about what the impact will be on their total costs. They will build those costs into the costs of their contracts. I think that the Government should have taken much more account of the impact of these new sales taxes on building costs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I address a few brief remarks in response to the contribution made by the honourable member for Perth (Mr McLean) in which he directed his comments to the estimates of the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs. The honourable member referred to the review of the guidelines of the Community Youth Support Scheme. He expressed the view that the opinions of project officers in this scheme should be taken into account. The answer to the query is yes, indeed, the views of project officers in the scheme will be taken into account. Indeed, I go further than that and say that the Government would welcome those views and would hope that they would be expressed by project officers. Not only will the views of project officers be welcome and taken into account but also the views of committee members of the local committees which have the day to day responsibility of running this scheme will be welcome and taken into account. Indeed, the Government's concern goes even further than that. The Government is concerned to get from interested community groups also views on the scheme and on reforms that should be made to the scheme, and in particular on changes, if any, which it is desirable to make to the guidelines under which this scheme operates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not want to take the time of the House unduly, but I refer to a Press release, which was issued today by me, which sets out more of the details of the consultation process in which the Government will engage with community interests in the course of determining the future guidelines for the conduct of the scheme. Naturally, I do not wish to read out the whole of this statement, but I draw the attention of honourable members to the fact that the statement has been issued and, with good grace, it might even get some coverage in the newspapers so honourable members will be able, I hope, to read more details of it there. In any event, steps have been taken to bring to the attention of honourable members the Press release which was issued today. The Press release makes it plain that the Government has established within my Department a task force which will have the immediate responsibility of conducting the consultation process. </PARA>
<PARA> The task force will be conducting consultations. It will also be receiving submissions from community interests with respect to the changes which community interests suggest are desirable to be made to the scheme and changes, if any, which it is suggested should be made to the guidelines under which the scheme should be conducted. Furthermore, this week letters will be sent to community interests throughout Australia inviting them to make written submissions to the task force. Some of those letters have, in fact, already been sent. Many more are in the course of being sent now, particularly, but not exclusively, to those community interests and community representatives who made submissions and representations to the Government after the Budget decision with respect to this scheme was announced. So, those invitations have been sent to community interests. I urge all community interests who are concerned with this scheme and, indeed, concerned with the whole field of youth unemployment to respond to the Government's very genuine invitation that they should make submissions to the task force. Indeed, I hope that they do. </PARA>
<PARA> A further attempt will be made to bring this consultation process to the notice of a wider public by means of advertisements which will shortly appear in the newspapers. Those advertisements will invite community interests and individuals to make submissions to the task force. Once again, may I emphasise that the Government hopes that interested individuals and community organisations will accept that invitation and will, indeed, make their submissions. There will, of course, also be a consultation process in terms of discussion and interviews with individuals and with organisations. Indeed, I have done some of this already. I hope that I will be able to continue to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> I emphasise that the Government wants a full consultation. I make the point finally with respect to CYSS that that, of course, requires some reciprocity from those who are interested in this scheme, concerned about it and concerned about the young unemployed. I hope, therefore, that people concerned will apply themselves and will make a special effort to prepare submissions and put them into the task force so that the Government can have the benefit and the advantage of their deliberations and their suggestions. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Perth also referred to the Special Youth Employment Training Program, under which, by means of subsidies to employers, certain categories of young unemployed people are able to obtain practical work experience. This scheme has been successful. The scheme has, as a result of its operation, been able to give to many young unemployed people the work experience which they need so much and which is subsequently of very great value to them in obtaining employment and keeping it. The honourable member for Perth expressed the concern that that scheme, the Special Youth Employment Training Program, should not be used by employers as a source of cheap and expendable labour. The Government shares that concern. Not only does the Government share that concern, but also it is determined that any attempt to abuse the scheme will be brought, very smartly, to a halt. That has been the Government's practice through the agency of the Commonwealth Employment Service and it will remain the Government's policy and the Government's practice. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, therefore, agrees with the comments made by the honourable member for Perth that a special effort should be made to ensure that employers do not abuse the program. In those cases where it has come to the notice of the Commonwealth Employment Service that an attempt might have been made by an employer to abuse the scheme, those allegations have been thoroughly investigated. On those occasions where it appears that there has been such an attempt made, the employers have found, as similar employers will find in the future, that they will not have referred to them by the Commonwealth Employment Service any young unemployed people under that scheme. Such employers will not receive, as they do not deserve to receive, subsidies under that scheme. The Government, therefore, shares the concern of the honourable member for Perth about that matter. It will use its very best endeavours to ensure that that concern is continued to be put into practice. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, with respect to that scheme and with respect to other schemes, some further material has been put into the Table Office of the House in response to some queries put by honourable members during the hearings of the Estimates Committee. I refer only to one part of that material, although an important part, because it relates to the subject that I have just been discussing, and that is, that the Bureau of Labour Market Research, which is a body under my Department and which, as the name implies, engages in labour market research. It is undertaking a 'comparative study of national manpower programs which cater for youth' including an analysis of the characteristics of young people placed in the main youth programs in 1980-81. I am sure that honourable members will agree that that will be a worthwhile inquiry and will result in the Government's obtaining a quantity of very valuable information touching on the sort of problem which has been raised by the honourable member for Perth and, indeed, on the operations of the Government's manpower programs as they affect and cater for young people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise a couple of items on the expenditure of the Department of Education, some of which I raised in the course of the Estimates Committee hearings and a couple which have come to my attention since. Firstly, I want to deal with a matter which I did raise in the Estimates Committee on the question of payments to the States for the School to Work Transition Program and specifically, a small item of expenditure under that-the Education Program for Unemployed Youth. When one looks at the statistics for this program one sees what would appear to be substantial discrimination against Western Australia. I saw it in the Estimates Committee. I have sought since to discern which of the governments is responsible for the relative lack of generosity in this program to Western Australia. I think, in the course of my investigations, I have come to the conclusion that this is yet another, albeit a fairly small, but nevertheless significant, failure on the part of the Court Government to properly protect Western Australian interests as a result of its obsessive ideological position which causes it to try to get as little money as possible from the Commonwealth Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the Estimates Committee the Minister for Education (Mr Fife) revealed that under EPUY, $945,000 went to New South Wales, $918,000 to Victoria, $898,000 to Queensland, $878,000 to South Australia, $354,000 to Tasmania and $124,000 to Western Australia. We just managed to beat the Northern Territory which received $77,000. In population terms that bears no comparison. This is an extraordinarily low figure for Western Australia. When I sought advice as to why this should be the case, I was told that when EPUY was introduced in 1979 the Western Australian Government informed the Commonwealth Government that it lacked interest in the offer as it felt that it was dealing with the question successfully through its own programs. I sought to obtain from the Department what programs the Western Australian Government felt were so superior to anything else going on around the place that it could afford to do Western Australians out of a Commonwealth handout. The Department came back with the answer that in 1979 the Western Australian Government, in secondary schools, was offering pre-vocational options for secondary children with pre-vocational centres, provision of guidance and counselling officers in Western Australian schools, the provision of youth education officers and alternative courses for year 11 students not suited to academic courses. </PARA>
<PARA> In the technical and further education sector there were pre-apprenticeship courses and certificate of admission studies courses to upgrade school standards for those who did not have entry requirements for TAFE. If one looked around any education system anywhere in the Commonwealth, one would have found those programs or ones very similar to them operating. Yet they were put forward by the Western Australian Government as its reason for not encouraging the Commonwealth to provide it with a similar sort of grant to that which was being received by other States. One would also find, as one went through them, that some of those particular projects do not have as their main focus providing jobs for young students or encouraging them in the direction of vocational studies that will enable them to obtain employment. So what has been put up on behalf of the Western Australian Government is clearly a facade to conceal the very grave inadequacies that exist within its decision making processes. The Minister, when it all boils down, was compelled to admit, after subsequent questioning, the following:</PARA>
<PARA> As I indicated to you, the West Australian Government did in fact have transition programs in place, at the time of the commencement of the Commonwealth's transition program. That does not apply only to Western Australia. I am not sure whether it was all States but certainly, a number of States, had a vareity of programs running at the time the decision was taken by the Commonwealth in 1979. </PARA>
<PARA>Having been advised by an officer who sat near him at the time, he concluded:</PARA>
<PARA> I am advised it was all States. </PARA>
<PARA>So we have a situation where the Western Australian Government has once again failed to defend Western Australian interests. It is not the first time that the Western Australian Government has done this. It is perhaps one of the more blatant examples of the Western Australian Government becoming obsessed with right-wing ideology. It really is the only State government genuinely obsessed with the principles of new federalism. As far as the Ministers in the Western Australian Government are concerned, this ideological obsession, they believe, seems to impose upon them the obligation to go very easy when it comes to dealing with offers of assistance by the Commonwealth Government. They feel there is a loss of dignity on the part of Western Australians in accepting them. When the question of Federal-State financial relations has come to apply to things such as the operations of the Commonwealth Grants Commission and the determination of formulas under which grants will be made to Western Australia, then this ideological failure represented in these appallingly poor statistics of Western Australia comes well and truly to the fore. Our State has lost some hundreds of millions of dollars. I think that the Western Australian population is extremely poorly served by this Government. The only thing that I really appreciate about this Estimates Committee report is that it has provided members on this side of the House with the detail to present to the Western Australian Government and encourage it in the future to make some effort, on behalf of the Western Australian population, to secure its just desserts. </PARA>
<PARA> I proceed to look at a couple of items on assistance to students. One particular item stands out because it was the only area in which an increase in a degree of assistance to a large number of students was made. That was in the small and quite parsimonious increases to post-graduate students. I am in the process of checking this matter out. But from what I can see of the statistics my suspicion is probably correct. I am advised by a number of post-graduate students that, in fact, all that the increase has done-an increase which comes to about $8 a fortnight-is take the students over the allowable limit for free receipt of Commonwealth health benefits. So what that increase has done has put the average post-graduate student in a position where he on the one hand has that increase but on the other hand has to pay out at least for hospital insurance under the current health benefits arrangements. That is a stirring example of government generosity on that matter!</PARA>
<PARA> These estimates also contain the Government's first assessment on what it is likely to receive from its decision to charge fees for second degrees and other post-graduate tertiary qualifications. Its estimate is that in half a year it will be $4m and in a full year $8m. That estimate is based on the assumption that the normal amount of enrolment will take place in subsequent years to that which is the norm to this point. I think that that is a very shaky estimate indeed, a very optimistic estimate that will not be confirmed by experience. What will take place is that large numbers of students who would have entered universities and who sought an opportunity to provide themselves with qualifications to become useful participants in the work force are now going to be denied that opportunity. I have special knowledge of this matter because I taught, until last year, at a university which took a large number of students who were in precisely this sort of situation. In particular, I refer to women in their 30s who are attempting to re-enter the work force. They will be gravely discriminated against by this Government decision. They will find it extraordinarily hard to obtain the qualifications they need to work. They will be obliged, in many cases, to rely much longer, for example, on supporting mothers benefits than would otherwise have been the case. So this is going to be, at that level and at the level of the cost of the collection of these charges, an example of false economy-a false economy with which this Budget as a whole and the education expenditure in it is replete. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will say a few words about the estimates of the Department of Education which were dealt with by Estimates Committee E because this Government is constantly telling us about the wonderful future which faces Australia, due no doubt to the inspired economic policy followed in recent years. But I would have thought that a booming education system would go hand in hand with a booming economy. The Government must see things differently. The continued squeeze on Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme entitlements, the reintroduction of tertiary fees and the forced closures of colleges of advanced education can only serve to drive more prospective students out of the education system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will speak specifically about the amalgamation of the 30 colleges. Although the Minister for Education (Mr Fife) may try to tell us that this was recommended by the Tertiary Education Commission, I want it recorded that the Commission has been advocating a re-direction of effort away from teacher education and has advised that the amalgamation of some colleges can assist in this process. It has also recommended that colleges involved should have three years in which to adjust to the merger. It has never recommended the forced amalgamation of 30 colleges within such a short space of time. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Commonwealth Government is insistent that Melbourne State College should enter an amalgamation for the sake of amalgamation, the College has shown that it is prepared to continue discussions that it has been having with other institutions to find an appropriate amalgamation, which has a sound academic basis and which provides educational and other benefits. But calculations show that if the only staff appointed in 1982, 1983 and 1984 are those who currently have permanent appointments or who have tenure through 1982, 1983 and 1984 respectively, and if the allowances proposed by the Voluntary Youth Program sector to meet the special needs of colleges and to reduce teacher education enrolments are not taken into account, then the College will have deficits of the order of $2m in 1982, a further $3m in 1983 and an additional $3.8m in 1984. As the College has always taken a responsible attitude to employment of staff, particularly since information about teacher education reductions became available, the problem is not of its own making. The Commonwealth Government funding levels have been exacerbated by VYPSEC policies on enrolment allocations. Government assistance in finding solutions is essential. The financial problem forced on the Melbourne State College has affected amalgamation discussions and will substantially affect any further such discussions. No institution will wish to inherit a financial problem of the magnitude of this one. More importantly to the taxpayer, amalgamation does not provide a solution. </PARA>
<PARA> I also re-urge the Minister for Education, as I have done on other occasions, to reverse the decision to ask the Institute of Early Childhood Development to amalgamate with any other Victorian college. Australia should be willing to learn from the experience of overseas amalgamations. I suggest that there is overwhelming evidence from Britain and the United States of America to show that amalgamations in the field of early childhood development just do not work. The disappearance of specialist early childhood colleges and institutes in Britain, due to amalgamations and cut-backs, resulted in a loss of quality in early childhood courses. It did not result in any savings for the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has only one specialist centre for early childhood studies-the Institute of Early Childhood Development. The Institute is recognised throughout the world as a centre of excellence in the quality of its graduates and its capacity to undertake special studies related to early childhood development. I urge the Minister to reverse this decision. There will be no savings for the country in the amalgamation. If we do not reverse the decision, we will probably have to re-establish-as Britain is doing-and to rebuild the Institute in years to come. As in Britain, this will prove to be a difficult and costly exercise. We keep getting told that these amalgamations are going to save money. On page 201 of Hansard of Estimates Committee E, for almost a whole page, the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins) questioned the Minister for Education about how much money we were going to save. I might say that the Minister for Education avoided answering pretty carefully for almost a page, but at the bottom, for some odd reason, the Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> I cannot give you the figure now but I will be able to do so within the next 10 days or a fortnight. </PARA>
<PARA>How can he? According to his own words reported on the next page, there are still eight colleges which have not amalgamated and which have no amalgamation proposals before them. Although he is reported as saying on page 201 that there will be 650 fewer staff positions, we do not know which ones are going and so we do not know how much it is going to cost. From where is the Minister going to pluck this figure within the next 10 days or a fortnight? Further, the honourable member for Fremantle went on questioning him. He is reported on the top of page 201 as asking:</PARA>
<PARA> Do you imagine that a large part of the savings will be related to staff reductions, and, if so, who will pay the cost of shedding, say, tenured staff, where there are contractural obligations between the colleges and the staff?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Education answered:</PARA>
<PARA> Obviously a high percentage of the cost of running the institutions is directly attributable to staff costs and there will be some savings in that area. The Commonwealth will expect the institutions and, where appropriate, the State authorities, to meet those costs. </PARA>
<PARA>Already the States have had tremendous cut-backs in their grants for primary, secondary and tertiary education. Where will Victoria find the money to pay off $2m for Melbourne State College alone for one year? I suggest to the Minister that the amalgamations were a mistake. He could put his pride or his prejudice aside and reverse a decision which has been not only unpopular but which will also reverse our education trends for the future and take us into a highly technological age without the expertise to meet it. It is no problem to admit that one has made a mistake; everyone can make them. It is only those with courage who can admit that they have made mistakes. I believe this is a mistake, particularly with regard to Melbourne State College and early childhood development. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some other questions that I think the Minister has to answer. I will set them out here. Firstly, why was there a deadline of 17 August set for the amalgamation proposals when the Tertiary Education Commission suggested that arrangements be made over three years? I point out here that successful amalgamations elsewhere in Australia and overseas have been voluntary and taken up to five years to complete successfully. Secondly, if the Government insists that amalgamations are going to produce savings, why has it not produced costings of its proposals? I have pointed out that the honourable member for Fremantle tried hard to get an answer from the Minister for Education but did not do very well. Thirdly, why has the Government not indicated how access to tertiary education and the quality of tertiary education will improve when these amalgamations are completed when all the evidence points to the reverse? Fourthly, why has the Government ignored the selective impact of the cuts on women students and employees? I agree with the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley) that the effects on women students will be very great, particularly on the mature age students struggling to get a second qualification, having been out of the work force for some years, perhaps living on a widow's pension, wanting desperately to get back into the work force and not having the money to pay the fees that are proposed. Lastly, and importantly: Why has there been virtually no consultation with the colleges, councils, staff and students-those who are going to be most affected by the cuts-over the amalgamation proposals?</PARA>
<PARA> I still say to the Minister for Education: It is never too late to reverse. It is never too late to say: 'I have made a mistake in these areas. We will go backwards'. The Minister reversed the decision with regard to the Institute of Catholic Education. It was highly predictable that he would do so because there was in Victoria no other institution with which the Institute of Catholic Education could amalgamate. As one who has been closely associated with the nine State colleges in Victoria over a long period, I tell the Minister now that there is nowhere with which the Institute of Early Childhood Development can successfully amalgamate and continue to be a centre of excellence. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to direct my remarks to the report of Estimates Committee E in relation to the departments of Employment and Youth Affairs and Housing and Construction. The hearing of Estimates Committee E on the proposed expenditure for the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs was held on 15 September prior to the decision of the Government, taken on 24 September, to continue funding of Community Youth Support Scheme projects until 28 February 1982 and, after consultation with various interested organisations, to continue CYSS under new guidelines after 28 February 1982. That consultation was a matter of grave worry to many people because the significance of it was such that, unless the consultation took place, there was no way known that the new guidelines would have worked. I had intended to deal with that matter but I was very pleased to hear the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr N. A. Brown) announce a short time ago that the process had started to allow the consultation to take place. It is obvious that that consultation has to take place because the Minister and the Government had no idea of the background and the needs of the participants in the CYSS projects. However, it now appears that fortunately the Government has realised the error there and it is hoped that the consultation will cause to come into effect guidelines which will allow CYSS projects to continue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, today in this Parliament in answer to a question the saga of confusion on the issue of the CYSS projects continued. The current funding does not take into account increased expenses such as wage increases. This was indicated today by the Minister in answer to a question. It seems that the Minister is of the view that such wages are determined by local committees. The fact is that such committees are obliged to employ project officers pursuant to awards. The funding of the projects is a Commonwealth Government responsibility through the State committees, and it is absurd to suggest that the current funding will not take account of such increased items of expenditure as wage increases. The Government must be prepared to take the responsibility in this regard, and the answer from the Minister today was most disturbing. Does the Government expect local committees to go to the community pleading for money to pay wages? Despite the fact that the consultation referred to by the Minister has taken place, I think it imperative that the Government at this stage direct its attention to the question of current funding. What does it mean by 'current funding'? If that current funding is not going to cover increases in expenses between now and 28 February we have not made the advances we had hoped we had made in the Community Youth Support Scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> I now wish to turn to the expenditure of the Department of Housing and Construction. I would like to examine particularly the issue of home ownership. That is a matter we hear a lot about in this Parliament, particularly from the Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr McVeigh), the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and various other members opposite. Despite the claims by the Government on this issue, the rate of home ownership has decreased. This was, in fact, admitted by the Minister at the meeting of Estimates Committee E. This trend will continue unless this Government dramatically changes direction. Increased interest rates, together with a lack of funds, will guarantee that fewer Australian people will be able to purchase a home. Repayments on a 25-year bank loan of $30,000 have risen by at least 57 per cent in the past 11 years. The repayments on a building society loan of the same amount over that period have increased by at least 69 per cent. The value of loan approvals of banks grew by 5.2 per cent in 1980-81, of building societies by 2 per cent and of finance companies by a staggering 44 per cent. The increase in the value of loan approvals of finance companies has arisen to a large degree because so many people are now forced to borrow on second mortgages at exorbitant interest rates. The record of this Government in both the public and the private sectors of housing has been disgraceful. Unless the Government is prepared to fund adequately in particular the public sector of housing, the waiting lists will grow and grow in all the States. </PARA>
<PARA> On present figures the housing position in Victoria is absolutely desperate. It is not good enough for honourable members opposite, particularly for Ministers, to come into this House and talk repeatedly about the record home ownership in this country. That is a matter which relates only to the past. Given the problems arising with repayments at the moment and the lack of funds available, whatever claims the Government may have been able to make in the past in relation to home ownership will not continue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to refer to some matters which arose during the consideration of the estimates for the Department of Education, specifically to the areas of the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme, fees and student loans. It was pointed out at the meeting of Estimates Committee E that, while the number of enrolments at tertiary institutions is increasing, the number of students receiving the TEAS allowance is decreasing. The honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley) pointed out during the meeting that it is estimated that over the period from 1980 to 1982 enrolments in tertiary institutions will increase by about 4,000, whereas the number receiving the TEAS allowance will decrease by about 5,000. The reason for this, on the admission of the Minister for Education (Mr Fife), is that the Government has failed to adjust the conditions of qualification for TEAS, the marginally adjusted family income, in line with movements in average weekly earnings and, consequently, year after year more and more students are being cut off from assistance. In some years, in fact, this condition of qualification has not been adjusted at all. For 1982 it has been increased by 7 per cent, but that figure has to be evaluated against the background of wage and salary movements of about 14 per cent in the same period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The solution which the Government offers to bridge the gap is the loans scheme. There is a very real possibility that this loans scheme will not be ready for 1982. When questioned on this matter the Minister said that he hoped it would be ready, but he admitted that the Government had not yet determined the criteria. There has been no determination as yet as to who will be eligible, what interest rates will be charged and what the mechanism for repayment of student loans will be. All these matters have not yet been determined by the Government. The Minister said that he was hoping that the scheme would be ready for next year. If it is not, he said that there will be no review of the TEAS level. So we can anticipate a further increase in student poverty and a further restriction of access to tertiary education. </PARA>
<PARA> It is estimated that the re-introduction of fees for second and higher degrees will raise $4m in the current financial year. A couple of things need to be said on the fees question. The first one has been said many times, but it needs to be said often; that is, that the re-introduction of fees for second and higher degrees is a clear breach of the pre-election undertaking given by the Minister in September of last year. The Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> I have given an assurance both publicly and privately to a number of representative groups, and I repeat that assurance, that no proposals are being considered by the Government for the possible re-introduction of tertiary fees. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no fine print there. There is no reference to second and higher degrees. It was a blanket assurance on fees and that assurance, like so many pre-election promises of this Government, has been broken. The second point that needs to be made about the re-introduction of fees in tertiary institutions is that Australia already has a very low tertiary education participation rate compared with other Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. The re-introduction of fees certainly will not improve the participation rate. There is no doubt, in fact, that it will discourage people from taking courses in second and higher degrees. I must add that the Minister does not necessarily agree. At the Estimates Committee meeting he said:</PARA>
<PARA> We do not anticipate that-</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the drop-off-</PARA>
<PARA>but no one could be absolutely certain. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that we can be reasonably certain that numbers will fall. A survey was completed recently on the likely student response to the re-introduction of tertiary fees. It was a very thorough survey and covered over 2,800 students in four tertiary institutions in Sydney. It reached these conclusions:</PARA>
<PARA> The results have shown that significant numbers of students in need received no assistance from the Commonwealth, and that large numbers of students, both those in receipt of TEAS allowances and those not, are living well below the Henderson Poverty Line. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> From the results of this survey and others conducted in 1980-81, there is a strong indication that the reintroduction of tertiary tuition fees would have an enormous effect on enrolments. </PARA>
<PARA> Admittedly the survey figures are based on the question of the re-introduction of fees for all courses, not just second and higher degrees; but the response from the various institutions suggests that about half the students currently following courses would defer them or not enrol again with the introduction of a fee of around $1,000 a year. I think it is a good guide. It is strong evidence to support the contention of the shadow Minister for Education, the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins), that there will be a drop of around 40 per cent. The survey also indicated that fees would have a serious effect on those groups already discriminated against in terms of access to higher education. We are talking here about the enrolment of women, people of mature ages, part-time students and students from low income families. All these enrolments could be expected to decline significantly. The effect of such a move on any efforts to equalise opportunity in higher education would be extremely damaging, as would the effect on industry in this country. Industry is seeking people with increasingly higher qualifications. If we do not train them here we will simply have to import them to compete in a world market with people with higher qualifications. One can be certain that industry in this country will also suffer. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of the Queensland Grant (Special Assistance) Bill is to authorise the payment to Queensland of $58.5m in 1981-82 as special grants in respect of 1979-80 and 1980-81. The payment of this amount is in accordance with the recommendations of the Commonwealth Grants Commission contained in its forty-eighth report 1981 on special assistance for states, which was tabled on 23 September 1981. Successive Commonwealth governments, from time to time, on the recommendations of the Commonwealth Grants Commission following applications by States, have provided special financial assistance to the less populous States to compensate them for such factors as lower capacity to raise revenue and higher costs of providing government services of a standard comparable to those provided by the financially stronger States. </PARA>
<PARA> Since self-government, the Northern Territory has also had access to the Commonwealth Grants Commission on the same basis as a claimant State. The Grants Commission has recommended a special grant of $3.3m for the Northern Territory in 1981-82. However, by virtue of phase-in provisions included in the memorandum of understanding in respect of financial arrangements agreed between the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory governments, the Territory will receive an additional assistance grant of $20m in 1981-82 in lieu of the special grant. Provision for the additional assistance grant to the Northern Territory is made in Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 1981-82. When special grants were first paid they constituted the only regular form of general revenue assistance to the less populous States for this purpose. However, for many years now, the main way in which special compensatory assistance has been provided to these States has been through the payment of higher per capita amounts of other general revenue funds. This situation is reflected today in the fact that tax sharing grants paid to Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania are higher, in per capita terms, than similar grants paid to New South Wales and Victoria. Special grants are made available to supplement a State's tax sharing grants. </PARA>
<PARA> The overall distribution of general revenue assistance to the States is currently undergoing a fundamental re-assessment. The Grants Commission is itself closely involved in this exercise. Arising from consideration by the Commonwealth and the States of its report on State tax sharing entitlements 1981, the Commission will be asked to review its report and in so doing to take into account a number of matters including those that will be raised by the Commonwealth and the States. As an interim arrangement in 1981-82, the Commonwealth has provided additional general revenue grants to New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland in recognition of the likelihood that, following the further review, relativities could be adjusted in favour of these States. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly the role of special grants in the future will need to be determined in the context of the re-assessment of the distribution of general revenue funds. The interim funding arrangement for 1981-82 has therefore been adopted on the basis that there will be no applications by any State for special grants in respect of this financial year. As I mentioned earlier, the special grants which are the subject of this Bill are in respect of the years 1979-80 and 1980-81. Queensland has been the only claimant State in recent years. It has applied for and received special assistance in each year since 1971-72. </PARA>
<PARA> The practice of the Grants Commission, in arriving at its recommendations in relation to State claims for special assistance, has been to make an assessment in the financial needs of a claimant State. In making such assessments, the Commission compares in detail the finances of the claimant State with those of the standard States-the Commission has regarded New South Wales and Victoria as standard States for special grants purposes since 1959-60. Normally, special grants recommended by the Commission have consisted of two parts. One part is based on a preliminary assessment of the financial need of the claimant State usually in the financial year concerned, and is an advance payment subject to adjustment usually two years later when the Commission has compared in detail the finances of the claimant State and standard States for that year. The other part of the special grant represents the final adjustment to the advance payment made earlier and is known as the completion payment. This adjustment might be positive or negative and therefore might result in the final grant in respect of the year being higher or lower than the advance payment for that year. </PARA>
<PARA> The payment to Queensland in 1981-82 of $58.5m provided for by this Bill consists of a completion payment of $33.5m in respect of 1979-80 and an advance payment of $25m in respect of 1980-81. The completion payment in respect of 1979-80, when added to the $11m advance grant paid to Queensland in that year, brings the final grant in respect of 1979-80 to $44.5m, that is, $21.8m above the corresponding figure for 1978-79. </PARA>
<PARA> The advance payment in respect of 1980-81 normally would have been provided during that financial year. However, Queensland requested an advance grant only towards the end of that financial year, after the Commission's methodology for its review of tax sharing relativities and the processes surrounding the review became known. A completion payment in respect of 1980-81 will be assessed by the Commission in 1982-83. The Commission's recommendations in relations to the special grants arrangements have been adopted by the Parliament since the Commission's inception and the Government considers that they should be accepted on this occasion. I commend the Bill to the house. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The provisions of the Census and Statistics Amendment Bill (No. 2) before the House embody the results of a very thorough re-examination of the Census and Statistics Act, much of which stands as it was drafted in 1905. Successive amendments over the years have resulted in a patchwork of provisions which badly need pulling together. I invite the attention of the House to the following aspects of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Preservation of the confidentiality of information provided to the Australian Bureau of Statistics is regarded by the Government as of the utmost importance. Moreover, it is central to the relationship of confidence and trust that exists between the Bureau and those businesses and households which are asked to provide information for statistical purposes. Therefore section 19 would make it an offence for the Statistician or an officer, present or past, to divulge or communicate information furnished in pursuance of the Act, except to the person from whom the information was obtained. Section 12 would ensure that statistics issued by the Statistician shall not be likely to enable the identification of information relating to a particular person or organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> It has, however, emerged from the re-examination to which I referred earlier that literal adherence in all circumstances to those provisions is regarded by respondents to statistical collections as unnecesary and would in a number of respects curtail severely the statistical service which the Statistician can provide. For example, many businesses make publicly available figures on their monthly or annual production, as well as providing them to the Statistician. If they are the sole, or by far the largest, producer of a particular commodity in a particular area, release by the Statistician of producton statistics in the desired detail would show a figure which would be identifiable as necessarily relating to, or as a close approximation of, the production of that business. The Act ought to provide a mechanism authorising the Statistician to publish such figures collected under the Act, with the consent of the business involved. </PARA>
<PARA> Some information of this nature relating to businesses or government bodies is in fact currently released by the Statistician and the Government has taken the view that the precise categories of such releases and the safeguards by which they are accompanied should be spelled out. Because the intention is that there should be no weakening of the general principle of confidentiality of information provided to the Statistician, information which the Statistician is to be authorised to release needs to be specified in considerable detail. That degree of detail would be inappropriate in legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 13 would therefore provide that the Minister may, by means of a written determination, authorise the Statistician to release information of a specific kind under specific conditions. It should be noted that no determination may authorise the release of information of a personal or domestic nature in a manner that is likely to enable the identification of any person. It is also important to note that it remains the responsibility of the Statistician, within the specific authorisations, to decide whether to release particular figures. In making those decisions he will continue to be guided by an overriding concern to maintain the confidence and trust of respondents to statistical collections. A determination made under section 13 would be tabled in the Parliament, published in the gazette and be subject to disallowance. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the other provisions of the Bill. These do not alter the substance of the powers, functions and duties of the statistician or the method of operation of the Australian Bureau of Statistics. They retain the Minister's power to give general directions to the Australian Statistician to collect statistical information on prescribed matters. Instead of the present separate provisions for the population census and other statistical collections, the Bill substitutes one set of machinery provisions relating to both. Operational detail of the kind now included in the Act regarding the population censuses will in respect of future censuses be set out in regulations. Topics to be included in each population census will be prescribed in one regulation, rather than set out partly in the Act and partly in a regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> Maximum penalties incorporated in the Bill are similar to those enacted by Parliament in the autumn sittings, with the exception that the provision for imposing a sentence of imprisonment for the offence of knowingly providing false information has been omitted. Detailed explanations of the amendments are set out in the explanatory memorandum available to honourable members. I commend the Bill to the house. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I remind honourable members that on 27 August 1981 I tabled in Parliament the report of the Commonwealth Schools Commission on its recommendations for the calendar year 1982, which was in response to the Government's guidelines for financial assistance for schools in the States and the Northern Territory. The guidelines also included provision for some expenditure in the Australian Capital Territory for certain of the Commonwealth's specific purpose programs. Funds for these programs have been appropriated for Australian Capital Territory schools in the normal budgetary process for the 1981-82 financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has accepted all of the Commission's financial recommendations in its report for 1982, apart from changes in relation to the transition program which the Government itself has made following consultations with the States, the details of which I will be taking up later in this speech. The Commission's recommendations were based on the policy and financial guidelines for Commonwealth education programs issued on 4 June 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> The estimated overall value of the Commission's recommendations for 1982 is $1,008.1m, an increase of some 4.6 per cent in real terms over expenditure in 1981. Most programs will be at least maintained in real terms, while others will be increased. The only decreases relate to capital programs for government schools which have undergone a reduction of $6.3m in real terms, compared with a total Commonwealth expenditure on government schools of almost $400m in the Special Projects Program to reflect the discontinuance of the school-level Innovations Program and in the Capital Grants Program for non-government schools where the reduction in real terms is occasioned by the non-supplementation of the new places element. Part II of the Bill contains provision for programs in government schools. Part III deals with non-government school programs. </PARA>
<PARA> General recurrent grants to non-government schools have been increased in accordance with movements in the government school standard cost and also to accord with the Government's election commitment to compress the present six subsidy levels to three funding groups. Group 1, replacing Levels 1 to 3, will receive per capita rates of 20 per cent of government school standard costs. Group 2, replacing Levels 4 and 5 will receive 30 per cent and Group 3, replacing Level 6, will receive 38 per cent. Group 3 schools will receive 40 per cent of government school standard costs in 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> In the guidelines statement, the Government announced several changes to the procedures for assessing non-government schools' subsidies. These included changes in the ranges of expenditure from private scources and the consideration of schools' disposable income. It was also announced that the Minister will allow schools disadvantaged by the changes in expenditure ranges to remain at a higher subsidy level for up to two years until they adapt their resources to the new arrangements and that the Government will review any cases in which this is not achievable within two years. </PARA>
<PARA> New non-systemic schools, formerly assisted during their initial years of establishment by being categorised to Levels 6, 5, 4 and 3 in the first, second, third and fourth years of their existence respectively will, under the new arrangements, receive additional subsidies at the rate of 10 per cent, 7.5 per cent, 5 per cent and 2.5 per cent of average government school standard costs respectively in each of their first four years of operation. </PARA>
<PARA> General recurrent grants for government schools have been retained at their existing real levels, despite the fact that government school enrolments in 1982 are expected to continue the downward trend which became evident after 1977. In continuing to maintain this program at previous levels, the Government has in effect slightly increased the real per student allocation in government schools. Expenditure per student on recurrent resources in government schools has long since exceeded the expenditure targets set by the Karmel Interim Committee for the Australian Schools Commission in 1973. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to direct Commonwealth expenditure for government schools, through programs administered by the Commission, the Commonwealth provides untied revenue-sharing grants to the States. These grants are available to State governments to spend according to their own priorities and represent the bulk of the total funds for government schools-in fact, some 89 per cent- the States having the responsibility for the administration and delivery of educational services in government schools. </PARA>
<PARA> In November 1979, the Commonwealth announced the introduction of the School to Work Transition Program for young people aged 15 to 19 who were likely to be 'at risk' in the transition process. At that time the Commonwealth and the States had agreed that concerted action should be taken from both quarters. The Commonwealth undertook to provide a total of $150m in real terms over five years from 1980 for the program and asked the States to match this expenditure dollar for dollar for government schools and technical and further education colleges from 1982 onwards. This was designed to provide a total additional effort costing $250m over the five-year period. The program commenced in 1980, and the Commonwealth agreed to continue it in 1981 without a state contribution for that year. </PARA>
<PARA> In my statement to the House of 4 June 1981, I indicated that because the States had not at that time indicated their readiness to make additional contributions to match the Commonwealth's expenditure in 1982, we felt compelled to take special action to increase significantly the resources devoted to transition activities. We therefore proposed to earmark up to $27m within the Commonwealth General Recurrent Grants to the States for government schools for expenditure on transition education. From that sum grants at the rate of $10 per pupil were to be provided to each government secondary school. We also proposed to earmark about $19m of government schools capital funds for equipment and facilities for transition education. Following consultations with the States since 4 June, they have, in general, now indicated that they have increased or propose to increase their recurrent expenditure on transition programs in schools and TAFE over the base year 1979-80 by amounts which approximate, and in some cases exceed, the amounts proposed to be earmarked. </PARA>
<PARA> In these circumstances, the Commonwealth no longer needs to proceed with the recurrent earmarking, since its principal objective has been met. On 22 September, I announced that we did not propose to proceed with the capital earmarking or insist on the allocation of a cash component to each government secondary school. This means that the Commonwealth's own expenditure on the transition program of $27m in 1982 will now be provided on the same basis as this year, that is, a reasonable balance in expenditure will be observed between schools and TAFE. The Commonwealth will expect the States to continue their increased effort in transition programs and will seek the provision of information on a continuing basis to monitor progress with the combined Commonwealth and State contributions in schools and in TAFE. The Commonwealth hopes that, in appropriate circumstances, the States will arrange for school communities to participate in the development of transition projects. </PARA>
<PARA> In accordance with the guidelines, this legislation will no longer contain provision for State governments to request transfers of funds between the Commonwealth's general recurrent and capital allocations for government schools. The Commonwealth has allowed this provision over a number of years but as it tends to distort the basis of the Commonwealth's allocation of recurrent and capital programs it should no longer, in the Commonwealth's view, be applied. </PARA>
<PARA> A change in the administration of the Capital Grants Program for non-government schools involves the absorption of the annual allocation from the unsupplemented triennial allocation of $25m provided for new places in non-government schools from 1981 to 1983 into the existing new enrolments element of the general capital grants allocation. As each non-government school building project requires Commonwealth approval, there will be no difficulty in seeing that this element of the general capital program is properly applied, and separate provision for this element in the legislation is no longer considered necessary. A further change in this program allows for capital grants to new non-government schools to be applied to the leasing of facilities for a period of up to three years. </PARA>
<PARA> The present Contingency Program for Refugee Children administered by the Commonwealth Department of Education will from January 1982 become part of the Commonwealth Schools Commission's programs. It will become one arm of the Commission's English as a Second Language Program, with the Commission's Migrant Education Program, retitled 'General Education in English as a Second Language', forming the other. Within the limits of the available funds, up to $750 per eligible student will be made available for intensive English courses for newly arrived immigrant or refugee children whose first language is not English. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the difficulty in forecasting the number of such children arriving in Australia and their destination on arrival, no attempt has been made to provide a State by State allocation of the funds for new arrivals. These funds will be made available to both government and non-government schools in States as the Commonwealth is advised of the numbers of eligible students undertaking appropriate courses. Provision has been made to allow transfers of funds between government and non-government sectors and also from the new arrivals element to the general education element of the program. Funds provided for both elements of this program have been increased in both government and non-government sectors. The opportunity has also been taken of partially adjusting the distribution of general education in the English as a second language element among the States to accord with the results of a recent national survey of students of non-English speaking background. </PARA>
<PARA> Funds for English as a Second Language Program for non-government schools have not been allocated on a State by State basis in the Bill. This reflects the Commission's wish to give responsibility to State planning and finance committees for distribution of funds to non-Catholic schools. However, the Government intends that the allocations to Catholic schools in the various States and Territories will be in accordance with the recommended distribution in the Commission's report. </PARA>
<PARA> An amendment has been made to the definition of 'program of ethnic education' to clarify the position of part-time ethnic schools in providing some instruction in the political and religious aspects of culture, as an adjunct to language instruction which will continue to be the major component of the course as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> Funds for special education programs will remain at the same real levels as in 1981. There are, however, changes in the legislative provisions for these programs to enable funds to be more widely used to provide services to handicapped children beyond those provided in segregated special schools, centres and classes. In line with this philosophy, the former joint program for the Integration of Handicapped Children has been apportioned to each of the government and non-government special education programs as an identifiable element. To reflect the wider application of the funds, the basis of allocation of funds among States has begun to be changed from that of enrolments in special schools and classes to an overall school enrolment basis. The new allocation formula will be fully utilised within three years. </PARA>
<PARA> Non-government special schools will for the first time be eligible to participate in the General Recurrent Grants Program for non-government schools. They will not be subject to the assessment procedures applied to regular schools and will receive subsidies at the Group 1 primary rate. </PARA>
<PARA> In joint programs for both government and non-government schools, which are dealt with in Part IV of the Bill, major changes involve: The increase in funds for the Country Areas Program and relaxation of the criteria by which eligible areas may be selected for funding, and discontinuance of the school-level innovations element of the Special Projects Program; the widening of provisions relating to multicultural education to include projects involving instruction in Aboriginal language and culture which are to be eligible for funding; and revised provisions for programs of education for severely handicapped students to enable them to participate in educational activities outside the institution or private home in which they normally require constant care. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has approved the allocation of funds to programs of national significance in 1982 on the basis recommended by the Commonwealth Schools Commission as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>$,000  Choice and Diversity in Government School Systems  300  Gifted and Talented Children  199  Schools Exchange and Travel Scheme  150  School Evaluation  150  Schools and Community  100  Education of Girls  100  General Projects of National Significance  503</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>  Total  1,403</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>In accordance with the Government's guidelines, the Bill will provide for both educational and financial accountability statements to be supplied by State and non-government school authorities in relation to the expenditure of Commonwealth funds. The Commission has been asked to consult with State and non-government authorities in the development of the revised accountability arrangements. Allocations of grants for 1982 for the various programs for the States and the Northern Territory are detailed in Schedules 1 to 10 of the Bill. Grants as shown now include provision of a prospective allowance for forecast cost increases. The prospective allowance takes account of cost increases in all programs to the beginning of 1982. During 1982, the allowance is in respect of projected increases in the salary and wage components of recurrent grants. This means that the previous arrangements for cost adjustments have been converted in their entirety to a prospective basis. </PARA>
<PARA> Grants for current programs for the calendar year 1981 are also adjusted under Part VI and Schedule 12 of this Bill in accordance with Government policy. The salary and wage components of recurrent grants are adjusted to June quarter 1981 price levels, except the non-government general recurrent and migrant education grants which, in accordance with established practice, include provision for cost increases to the end of 1981. The additional cost of these adjustments is $40.8m. Finalisation of the adjustment of 1981 grants will be effected in legislation to be introduced during the autumn 1982 sittings of the Parliament. Part VI also contains an amendment rewording a provision in the legislation applying to programs of education of severely handicapped children for 1981 to allow education activities which involve the movement of such children from the institutions or homes in which they are normally cared for. </PARA>
<PARA> The education of children in all schools, whether government or non-government, is a shared responsibility of both Commonwealth and State governments. The continuing substantial overall level of support will enable further real improvements in schools' resource levels. The provisions of this Bill demonstrate the Commonwealth's continuing commitment to high standards in all Australian schools. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to amend certain provisions of the Non-government Schools (Loans Guarantee) Act No. 106 of 1977, which presently covers the giving of loan guarantees to non-government schools in the States. In September of this year I announced that the necessary changes to the current Act would be the subject of amending legislation in the present Budget sittings. The effect of the amendments will bring the arrangements for the giving of loan guarantees in the States more into line with those for non-government schools in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory which are contained in the Independent Schools (Loans Guarantee) Act No. 23 of 1969. The first amendment seeks to extend the coverage of the 1977 Act to include proposed as well as existing non-government schools in the States. In normal circumstances proposed new schools do not have the necessary capital assets to offer as collaterial in order to raise moneys for projects by borrowing. It is also the case with many proposed schools that they do not have an extensive parent body which can support heavy loan repayments. The widened definition of a non-government school contained in this amendment would then be similar to that used in section 3 (1) of the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Act No. 135 of 1980. The second amendment would extend the scope of a loans guarantee to cover the payment of interest moneys in addition to the repayment of principal moneys for the purpose of expenditure on an approved building project at a non-government school. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will continue to provide that a guarantee will not be given by the Treasurer unless the Minister for Education certifies that: Firstly, the terms and conditions of the loan agreement are satisfactory; secondly, in the absence of a guarantee a school authority would not be able to obtain a loan on satisfactory terms and conditions; and, thirdly, a guarantee will not cover any part of the cost of a project that is or is likely to be the subject of a Commonwealth grant, including a grant under the advance approvals scheme. The Bill also provides for an extension of the recovery provision to cover any payments made by the Commonwealth in respect of both the interest and principal components of a loan. These changes will result in the scheme being more attractive to both proposed and existing non-government schools in the States which are faced with increased enrolment pressure. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>On 4 June 1981 the Government announced the guidelines for the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission for the 1982-84 triennium and asked the Commission to recommend the detailed distribution of grants. On 23 September I tabled Volume 2 of the Commission's report, which responded to the guidelines. The purpose of this Bill is to provide a legislative framework for the allocation of funds following Government approval of the financial recommendations put forward by the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission in respect of State institutions, although some funds yet to be allocated for 1983 and 1984 will be included in subsequent annual amendments. The grants are for recurrent expenditure by universities and colleges of advanced education for the 1982-84 triennium and 1982 expenditure for technical and further education and for capital and equipment expenditure in universities and colleges. Amounts expressed in the Bill for the 1982-84 triennium reflect new cost adjustment procedures adopted by the Government whereby, from the beginning of 1982, a prospective allowance is made for cost increases. Grants for 1983 and 1984 are expressed in the same terms, on the basis that each year they will be adjusted for further cost movements. The Bill also amends the existing legislation for the 1979-81 triennium to provide for cost adjustment in respect of the existing tertiary education program. </PARA>
<PARA> Before describing the detailed provisions of this Bill, I should like to set the Government's funding decisions in context. Notwithstanding our overriding objective to contain public expenditure as an integral part of the Government's economic strategy, there has been a small increase in real terms in the sums made available in 1982 for tertiary education. Within the total funds provided for tertiary education there has been a reallocation of resources between the sectors. In real terms, while total expenditure in higher education has been slightly reduced by 0.4 per cent, funds for TAFE have been increased by 6 per cent. The additional funding provided for TAFE reflects the high priority which the Government accords to TAFE where enrolments are rising substantially and where important initiatives are being taken in relation to transition programs. The Bill provides for the continuation of a number of substantial TAFE capital programs. In total 72 projects will be under construction in 1982 at 58 locations. Of these projects 35 will require a Commonwealth contribution in excess of $5m. In 1982 the Commonwealth Goverment will provide more than $112m for TAFE capital. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also continued to provide priority for higher education in the context of its overall Budget strategy, notwithstanding that enrolment levels have stabilised. In this context, the Government has noted the concern expressed by the Commission on the declining proportion of young people who are proceeding to higher education. The Government will be asking the Commission to undertake a more detailed study of this decline against the background of the enrolment patterns and prospects for tertiary education as a whole. The Government has noted that the planning ranges originally proposed by the Commission earlier this year for enrolment levels for universities and colleges of advanced education, for the 1982-84 triennium, should be achieved.</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides funding consistent with the decisions taken by the Government for the rationalisation and consolidation of resources in higher education. The Commonwealth is firmly convinced that its policy of consolidation will not only improve the efficiency of the institutions and enable them to be more responsive to community demand but also improve the quality of education provided for students. Its program of consolidation was initiated following advice from the Commission and the Government will continue to look to the Commission, in consultation with the States and institutions concerned, for advice on the consolidation and rationalisation of tertiary education. I am pleased to inform the House that, of the 30 colleges of advanced education identified for rationalisation, at this stage acceptable arrangements have been received for all but seven. I pay tribute to the way in which State governments have co-operated with the Commonwealth over the consolidation of institutions. In Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia all of the consolidation proposals made by the Commonwealth have been agreed to by the States and action is in train in respect of the consolidations. Some particular issues in New South Wales and Victoria remain to be resolved, and I look forward to further consultations with these States on the outstanding issues. </PARA>
<PARA> In the meantime, funds for 1982 for those colleges of advanced education in New South Wales and Victoria, for which acceptable consolidation arrangements have not yet been received, have been included in the legislation in a national unallocated reserve. Should acceptable consolidation arrangements be reached before the end of the year the Minister, after advice from the Commission, will be able to allocate amounts from this reserve to the newly consolidated institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the terms of the Government's decisions on rationalisation the Commonwealth will continue funding for the Wollongong Institute of Education and Newcastle, Armidale and Townsville Colleges of Advanced Education only if they merge with the Universities of Wollongong, Newcastle and New England and James Cook University of North Queensland respectively. Allocations for Wollongong, Newcastle and New England universities for 1982 have been included in the Bill on the basis that amalgamations with the respective colleges will proceed. In order to ensure the maintenance of the two streams of tertiary education in these universities, however, the minimum amounts required for teaching purposes in advanced education, as recommended by the Commission, have been earmarked in the legislation. In the case of the James Cook University and the Townsville College of Advanced Education where acceptable arrangements for amalgamation have been developed, funds for 1982, 1983 and 1984 have also been appropriated in the Bill. For the other three universities and the related colleges where suitable amalgamation arrangements are yet to be proposed, grants have not been appropriated for 1983 and 1984. These will be provided by a subsequent legislative amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> Should suitable arrangements not be worked out by the end of 1981 it will be possible for those funds presently allocated to the three New South Wales universities for 1982 in respect of advanced education to be transferred to the national unallocated reserve. In those circumstances, the legislation would enable funding for the three universities and the related colleges to continue for 1982 only. Funds for 1983 and 1984 will have to be the subject of further legislation. The Government would be able to make similar funding arrangements in respect of the other outstanding colleges listed for amalgamation to which I referred earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill incorporates the funding recommendations for individual institutions and projects as recommended by the Commission. In some States not all of the funds available for advanced education have yet been allocated to particular colleges and the Bill provides that this can be done at the request of the States concerned. In accordance with the Commission's recommendations, provision will also be made to permit these funds to be transferred between years. These funds should provide added flexibility which will assist with the consolidation and rationalisation of higher education institutions that is already proceeding in the States. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for the limited reintroduction of tuition fees from 1982. The Bill specifically excludes the charging of tuition fees for students undertaking courses leading to first awards. It also exempts students who commenced second degree or diploma courses before 1982 from paying fees for those courses, and it sets a maximum fee, that is for full time students, of $1,000 per annum. Subject to these principles, the Bill contains a provision for the Minister to make determination as to the circumstances in which students are either required to pay tuition fees or are to be exempt. Subject to various exemptions, to be covered by the determination, students who have already gained a diploma or a degree, who enrol in a university or an advanced education course, will be required to pay tuition fees. Exemptions from tuition fees will apply, for example, where higher degree students are in receipt of Commonwealth awards or awards of at least $3,500 per annum from universities, colleges of advanced education and State governments. The States and institutions have been consulted on the detailed arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will contain a provision that, as a condition of recurrent grants, institutions charge fees in accordance with these arrangements and that they do not charge fees in other circumstances. The Bill provides for recurrent grants scheduled in the Bill to be offset by an amount equivalent to the money from fees which those institutions will be required to charge. The Australian National University Bill and the Canberra College of Advanced Education Bill, which are also being introduced at this time, contain provisions for the reintroduction of tuition fees in the same terms as this Bill, except where particular requirements necessitate differences. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has considered the Commission's recommendation that the arrangements for the disapproval of new teaching developments should be extended to cover such developments regardless of the source of funds. It does not propose to legislate in the way recommended by the Commission but will ask the Commission to continue to monitor new teaching developments and to bring to its attention any examples of proposed new teaching developments funded from other sources which, in the Commission's view, are not in the best interests of the balanced development of tertiary education in Australia. I will also seek the co-operation of State governments and institutions in this context. </PARA>
<PARA> In accordance with the Government's election undertakings the Bill contains a specific allocation of $16m over the triennium for research centres of excellence, and $900,000 in each year of the triennium for the development of community language courses in universities and colleges of advanced education. The allocation of funds to particular universities and colleges of advanced education for the development of community language courses will be approved by the Minister after taking account of the views of the Commission and the Australian Institute of Multicultural Affairs. Similarly detailed allocations for the research centres of excellence will be announced after the Government has considered the recommendations of the special committee established to provide advice on the implementation of this initiative. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides an increased level of support for those non-government teachers colleges in the States which, until now, have been in receipt of partial recurrent funding. The two institutions included in the Bill, McAuley College in Queensland and Avondale College in New South Wales, together with Signadou College in the Australian Capital Territory, are not recognised as colleges of advanced education. The Government's decision to increase the level of support for these institutions is consistent with its view that freedom of choice in primary and secondary education is dependent upon the preparation of teachers with a special commitment to teach in non-government schools. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides financial assistance to the Northern Territory for advanced education purposes. Following an inquiry into the proposal to establish a university in the Northern Territory the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission recommended that an external studies centre be established at the Darwin Community College, and that subject to the agreement of the Australian National University, the North Australia Research Unit of that institution be given the capacity to co-ordinate research directly related to the needs of the Territory. The establishment of an external studies centre is currently under discussion, but funds for the proposed centre have been included in the legislation in the national unallocated reserve. Provision for the North Australia Research Unit of the Australian National University will be included in the annual appropriations of the Department of Education. The matter of additional financial provision from 1983 for superannuation for staff in universities and colleges of advanced education, which was recommended by the Commission, is under separate consideration by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, the Bill provides evidence of the Government's continuing commitment to the development of tertiary education in Australia. Some particular parts of the tertiary education sectors have faced, and will continue to face, the need for substantial readjustment. This is required if valuable resources are to be allocated to the most urgent priorities. All governments would like to increase spending on education-it is an investment in the future of Australia. Resources, however, are not unlimited, and the Government's decisions are both reasonable and responsible. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to provide for the limited re-introduction of tuition fees at the Australian National University. In addition to this primary purpose, the Bill provides for two other amendments to the Australian National University Act, requested by the University, concerned with aspects of the administration of the University. These relate to the election of undergraduate and postgraduate representatives on the University Council, and the granting of status and exemptions in respect of courses at the University. In relation to its primary purpose, the same principles are involved in this Bill as in the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Bill and the Canberra College of Advanced Education Bill for the re-introduction of tuition fees. The three Bills are viewed as parallel legislation for this purpose and have been drafted in the same terms except where the particular requirements of the States Grants Act or the Acts of the two institutions necessitate differences. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is similar to the States Grants Bill in its provision which empowers the Minister to make determinations in the same terms and subject to the same general conditions, as that Bill. The same annual limit of $1,000 is set. The Bill differs from the States Grants Bill in that there is no specific provision for the adjustment of grants to take account of fees revenue collected. This power is not needed in either this Bill or the Canberra College of Advanced Education Bill. Whereas the States Grants Bill places the obligation on the State, as a condition of grant, to ensure that fees are charged in respect of those students required to pay fees, in the case of this Bill this obligation is placed on the Council of the University. In order to give effect to this obligation, the Council is empowered to make a statute in line with the requirements of the Minister's determination. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to its primary purpose, the Australian National University Bill also contains two amendments to the Act requested by the University. Clause 3 is intended to clarify the distinction between undergraduate and postgraduate students for the purpose of the election of representatives to the University Council. The Act provides for undergraduate students having two representatives on the Council and other students having one representative. Clause 4 broadens the power of the University to grant status or to grant awards to persons who have undertaken studies in other institutions. At present this power is restricted to students from other universities so that position of colleges of advanced education, for example, is not recognised in the Act. Clause 4 similarly includes a power for the University Council to grant exemptions in respect of particular courses. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Opposition spokesman on foreign policy matters, in the short time available I want to make a few remarks about matters relating to that policy in the light of the report of Estimates Committee A. One matter that concerns the Opposition is what we call the debasing of the international currency in respect of our international credibility. I will address my remarks to the Commonwealth Heads of Government Communique which had a number of splendid things to say and with which the Opposition agrees. For example, we agree with the Government's concern that substantial progress must be made in the North-South dialogue. But from the point of view of our aid performance to the poorer countries, even taking into account the recent increase, our overseas aid contribution still represents only 0.45 per cent of our our gross national product. Under the Labor Government in 1975, it had reached 0.65 per cent of our gross national product. Accordingly, it has declined dramatically since the Australian Labor Party was ousted from office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When dealing with aid, we need to talk about the overall review of our overseas aid commitment. I have raised this matter before. Notwithstanding the quantitative increase in our overseas aid, there is a need to reassess the quality of some of the projects and whether they are as essential as they might be deemed by the country receiving them. I have also indicated in which areas we are not giving aid but should be. Vietnam is perhaps the most outstanding example of a country in this category. If the Government wants to have peace and stability in our region but behaves as though we can ignore the necessity to assist in the reconstruction and economic rehabilitation of a country which we must include in all policy calculations, then it surely must relate to Vietnam. It is quite counter-productive to assist in a policy which will put an economic squeeze on Vietnam and which can cause massive numbers of refugees and at the same time suggest that there can be peace and stability in the region. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter related to the CHOGM Communique is that of disarmament. Again, it is important that we note in the Communique the statement:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . practical measures which are directed towards nuclear disarmament and the avoidance of all armed conflict, particularly nuclear conflicts, must have the highest priority on the international agenda. </PARA>
<PARA>Let us look at disarmament. It is important that we assist the poorer countries. We need to adopt a more independent foreign policy and to assert the necessity for de-escalation of the international arms race, particularly the nuclear arms race, because there is a finite limit to the capacity of the developed countries-even the super-powers. It is just not possible to go on spending well over $520,000m a year on weapons and at the same time devote the necessary resources to increase food production, agrarian reform and improved health and living standards. </PARA>
<PARA> The fine words of the CHOGM Communique are simply not reflected in the Government's actions. In other words, the total annual income of the 92 billion poorest people in the world would amount to the $520,000m being spent on armaments, that is, the poorest half of the world's population could well do with some of that money. But tragically at present, the biggest single business in the world is the arms trade. We are currently spending $1m a minute on armaments while many people in the world are starving, in need of medical care and in need of education. So it is quite wrong to be talking about these matters. One-half of one per cent of arms spending would pay for all the farm equipment needed to make food deficit countries virtually self-sufficient by 1990. For the cost of one tank we could build basic classrooms for 30,000 children, hundreds of whom at present will never get an education. For the cost of one modern jet fighter we could establish over 40,000 village pharmacies. The greatest danger we face is that our sense of responsibility will be dulled by the massiveness of these figures and the apparent incredible stupidity of the course on which we have embarked. </PARA>
<PARA> We talk about the Indian Ocean. The Communique states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . that despite the expressed wishes of the littoral and hinterland states there had been a further increase in the military presence of outside powers in the Indian Ocean. </PARA>
<PARA>It also states that this undermines the 1971 United Nations Declaration on an Indian Ocean Zone of Peace. Let us have a look at our record. We talk about peace in the Indian Ocean but we know perfectly well that we are allowing long range strategic nuclear bombers to land at and transit through Darwin and that their primary purpose is to project military might in the Indian Ocean, particularly through Diego Garcia. We should have known that the American military planners envisaged the use of a limited nuclear conflict in the Gulf region. So whatever the Prime Minister (Mr Malcom Fraser) thinks of having B52s in Australia, it is pretty clear that the Soviet Union sees this as a substantial increase of strategic power into the Indian Ocean and, of course, it will move to counter that escalation. So it goes on. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us have a look at another aspect of the Communique-El Salvador. The Government's only statement on this matter was a reaffirmation by the Prime Minister of endorsement of the Reagan Administration's support for President Duarte as being the right President, having the right sorts of policies. I doubt whether there is anyone in the world, including President Reagan's advisers, who agree with that. I do not pretend that Australia does have influence in El Salvador. But if we wish to maintain a credible and principled policy towards Central and Southern America, we must do more than just parrot Washington's Views. </PARA>
<PARA> The CHOGM Communique on Cyprus does not go far enough. The Cypriot leaders are disappointed. This Government and others were not prepared to call for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from that island. Perhaps this has something to do with the fact that the British have some bases there. But we should make it absolutely clear that the presence of Turkish troops is intolerable on that island. On the Middle East-the most difficult and sensitive issue for us in Australia-we note that the Communique, which is the view of all the Heads of Government at CHOGM, states:</PARA>
<PARA> They recognise that a just and lasting settlement-that is in the Middle East-should be on the basis of the relevant United Nations resolution and recognition of the rights of the Palestinian people, including their inalienable right to a homeland, as well as the right of all States in the region to live in peace within secure borders. </PARA>
<PARA>Has there been peace in that area? I think not. As we know, a number of matters have arisen since this subject was last debated in this House. We welcome the opportunity to debate this matter. But it is important to have another debate because since it was last debated, rather sadly and tragically, President Sadat has been assassinated. This certainly highlights the instability of the area-an area in which there has been warfare in recent months. Iraq's nuclear reactor was destroyed. In Beirut there has been bombing with the killing of 300 civilians and the wounding of another 500. In other words, tension has increased substantially. I call on the Government to have another full scale debate in this Parliament before any decision is taken as to whether we are going to commit any Australian presence in that region. It can have most serious medium and long term consequences for our nation. There are even more substantial reasons now than there were five months ago why Australian troops should not be committed. For example, the Israeli Chief of Staff said that, if anything happened to President Sadat, the entire peace process would come adrift. Since the Minister made his statement, might I refer to the remarks of a former American Secretary of State, Cyrus Vance, who said that it was agreed at Camp David that there should be full autonomy for the West Bank and Gaza and that it was understood by the parties that full-I underline 'full'-autonomy meant exactly what the words indicated. </PARA>
<PARA> We are told that any Australian peacekeeping contingent would be part of a Camp David process, but half of that process has been ignored, which is extremely dangerous. What of the CHOGM Communique and its reference to the rights of the Palestinian people, that is, that all states in the region have a right to live in peace within secure boundaries? Finally, what about doing something about Lebanon and not limiting attention just to Israel and Egypt, because that country has been torn asunder? There are at least 200,000 Lebanese people in Australia wondering why this Government never says anything about the disarray in Lebanon and its destruction. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If I may, I want to comment briefly about another aspect of the report from Estimates Committee A. For those who are listening, it might be worth commenting that the House is currently considering a report from an Estimates committee that examined not just the Department of Foreign Affairs but three other departments as well-the Parliament, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and the Department of Defence. My colleague the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) directed his remarks to the Department of Foreign Affairs. While I am tempted to enter into a debate with him on those issues which interest me and him alike, I want to comment really on the resolutions that pertain to the estimates relating to the Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before I do so, I suggest to the House that at the time when these matters come before us for a vote we might subdivide the questions. If honourable members care to identify them, they will see that paragraph (2) with respect to the Parliament has two sub-paragraphs and that paragraph (3) relating to the Department of Foreign Affairs has three sub-paragraphs. I think it may be beneficial to the House were the matters to be placed before us separately rather than as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make a couple of brief comments with respect to the resolutions relating to the Parliament. The first is in respect of paragraph (2) sub-paragraph (1), which reads:</PARA>
<PARA> That this Committee resolves that in appropriation procedures for 1982-83 the funds for Parliament should be contained in a separate single line Appropriation Bill and notes the support for this procedure contained in the recommendations of the Report of the Senate Select Committee on the Parliament's Appropriations and Staffing. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government at this stage is considering the report of the Senate Select Committee. Accordingly, the Government believes that it is inappropriate for the Parliament at this stage to agree to this recommendation. It is necessary that the report be considered not just in relation to that one question but also in relation to a number of other equally important matters which are before it. For that reason, without expressing a view on the substance of the resolution, the Government intends to oppose the recommendation. However, it will be the intention of the Government at a later stage to consider all the recommendations of the Jessop Committee report and at that time, of course, it will be possible for members to express their views and to consider the matter in a little more detail. Paragraph (2) sub-paragraph (2) reads:</PARA>
<PARA> That this committee registers its grave disquiet at many of the proposed cuts in real terms in the budget for the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>I had the opportunity of discussing this matter with the Department of Finance which had been through the estimates but, regrettably, at the time of the consideration of the matter by the Estimates Committee, I did not have the benefit of that advice. It seems that the position is that, as in all areas where the same real money is provided, there is excluded from consideration any areas where there is a non-recurring Budget item. In other words, where there is funding for a project which has a short life and where there is a non-recurrence of that item in a subsequent year, it is excluded in the consideration of the funds to be provided. Thus the same real money decision excludes one-off expenditures that took place in 1980-81. The advice that I have from the Department of Finance that I want to pass on to this Parliament is that the same real level of money has been provided for on going items of expenditure for which the Parliament's bid has been made. Accordingly, the Government disagrees with the expression of view that Estimates Committee A passed on to this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> However, there is certainly some concern by the Presiding Officers, Mr Speaker and Mr President, with respect to some items of the parliamentary estimates. The Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Carrick) and I, representing the Government, intend to enter into discussions with Mr Speaker and Mr President regarding their concern and to discuss details of the parliamentary estimates at an appropriate time. At this stage the Government will be voting against paragraph (2) sub-paragraph (2), but that vote is without prejudice to those discussions which, as I have indicated, will take place at an appropriate time. I hope and believe they will be held fairly shortly rather than at some date in the far distance. We wish to have that discussion fairly soon. Now that Senator Young has taken up his newly-assumed responsibilities as President, I hope that we can pursue our discussion and come to some mutually satisfactory conclusion regarding the parliamentary estimates. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not a member of Estimates Committee A, but I would like to speak about Australia's providing foreign aid to Vietnam which is the subject of one of the expressions of opinion agreed to by Estimates Committee A in relation to the Department of Foreign Affairs. However, I am a member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence which, in June of this year, presented a report to this Parliament called: 'Power in Indo China since 1975'. That report clearly stated in one of its recommendations that Australia should not give economic aid to Vietnam, a position I fully support. Certainly there was a minority suggesting the contrary, but that minority report represents a position I did not then and will not now support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at Vietnam since its so-called glorious liberation. Any rational assessment of Vietnam's domestic and foreign policies shows that, since 1975, it has deliberately decided not to help itself in economic reconstruction and in fact has undertaken policies which can result only in weakening the economic fabric of that nation. Vietnam has decided of its own volition and in conjunction with the wishes of the Soviet Union to commit a very large percentage of its resources to military purposes. In proportion to its population of some 53 million people, Vietnam has one of the largest armed forces in the world. Vietnam currently has some 200,000 troops in Kampuchea. It also has 40,000 to 50,000 troops in Laos. Quite apart from the effect that this has had on Vietnam's economy, it has also meant that Thailand is now confronted with 250,000 Vietnamese troops on two of its borders. This imposes major pres- sures on Thailand's allocation of resources to domestic and foreign purposes. It would be more appropriate for us, in my opinion, to look more sympathetically to countries such as Thailand, rather than Vietnam, when considerating aid allocations. It should also be recognised that the Soviet Union has been giving increasing military and economic aid to Vietnam, enabling a massive re-equipping of the Vietnamese armed forces. </PARA>
<PARA> I see no merit in putting Australian aid in to a country if it would have the effect of allowing that country to divert more of its resources to military purposes designed to meet Soviet wishes to destabilise our region of the world. Any economic aid we give would simply serve the regional foreign relations interests of the Soviet Union. The fact remains that Vietnam, following its reunification after a long period of warfare which destroyed the country's economic infrastruture and placed intolerable burdens on its population, made a conscious decision of its own within its own undemocratic political decision-making machinery to opt for guns instead of butter and to further its military imperialism in Indo-China rather than concentrate its resources on economic development and seek to raise the living standards of its people. If Vietnam chooses guns instead of butter, we do not have to provide the butter, particularly if the guns are pointed, however indirectly, in our direction. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, the Vietnamese Goverment decided to expel the Chinese middle class in its country, a class of merchants and entrepreneurs which formed an important part of the tertiary and secondary sectors of that country's economy. Apart from the deleterious effects this had on Vietnam's economy, it also placed enormous burdens on other nations in the region and throughout the world by creating the flood of refugees which other nations, including Australia, have had to accommodate for humanitarian reasons. In this sense, aid has already been given to Vietnam. I must say that I find it impossible to justify giving direct economic aid to Vietnam in these circumstances. More economic aid would allow Vietnam to divert more of its resources to military expansion in the region with the endorsement and with the support of the Soviet Union. To give economic aid under these circumstances to a country over which we have no influence, to a country which has itself decided to give priority to military expansion rather than economic development, and to a country which has strategic interests clearly against our best interests in this region is something I just cannot support. </PARA>
<PARA> Vietnam is just another of the great modern day liberations we hear about in international forums and in the propaganda outbursts of totalitarian regimes throughout the world. Far from liberating its citizens, the Vietnamese Government has brought despair, deprivation and repression to them. This is a tragedy for the people of Vietnam, but it is a result of deliberately taken decisions of a government which is committed to remaining on its present course with regard to both its domestic and its foreign policies. In these circumstances, I cannot support Australia giving economic aid to this country. I would not give it a cracker. I therefore disagree with that expression of opinion agreed to by Estimates Committee A. </PARA>
<PARA> To put my view on foreign aid in a more general and proper perspective, I say that as a matter of principle I fully support the obligations of relatively affluent nations, such as Australia, to provide aid to the poorer nations which, through no fault of their own, unlike Vietnam, have to cope with the problems of thousands and millions of their children and families facing death through starvation. Morally it is impossible for nations such as Australia not to play a role in alleviating this massive human suffering. In this regard, I was very proud of the opening comments of our Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Melbourne recently when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . our generation of leaders will ultimately be judged largely in terms of their success or failure in reconciling the interests of the rich and poor countries of the earth. For if they are not reconciled the world in which we shall live out our lives and which our children shall inherit will be an unhappy one, condemned to turmoil and bitterness. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . those who fail to recognise the gravity and drama of the issues disguised by the rather bland term 'North-South dialogue' are guilty of a serious failure of historical imagination. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that is a statesmanlike view of the world. It is a realistic view of the world and it is a morally proper view of the world. I think it is a magnificent statement which basically reminds the relatively well off nations of this world, such as Australia, that where equity is concerned national boundaries are irrelevant if we are to overcome the suffering experienced by so much of mankind, whether it be in Africa, South America, South East Asia or Asia generally. From a compassionate point of view and even from a pragmatic international point of view, to secure long term peace on this earth we have to meet these obligations. I therefore support the Government in its present efforts to increase our foreign aid vote along the lines referred to by the Estimates Committee, which stated that it was of the view that the Government should accept and work towards meeting the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product as official development assistance. That is the stated objective of this Government and it is an objective which I am very pleased to support. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight we are considering the report of Estimates Committee A which covers two departments of interest to the Australian Labor Party and certainly to me personally. One is the Department of Defence and the other is the Department of Foreign Affairs. We are at a disadvantage in discussing the estimates of the Department of Defence because we have not had a statement from the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) relating to the Budget. This, I believe, is a retrograde step. This Parliament should be completely informed of the significance of the figures in the Budget statement on defence. I regret that at this stage we have not had in the Parliament a statement from the Minister for Defence associating himself with the policies implicit in the Budget. We have also not had from the Minister for Defence the defence report. So, in any discussions of the matters associated with the Budget on defence, this House-not only members of the Opposition but also members of the Government-is at a marked disadvantage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to take up with the House the question of the Government's statements-one may call them the rhetoric of the Government-on defence and the Government's actual performance on defence. In Budget Paper No. 1 of 1980-81 the following statement appeared:</PARA>
<PARA> In keeping with the Government's policy, the outlays on Defence of $3541.4m represent . . . a real increase of at least 7 per cent . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In the Budget Papers the statement was made that in the following year the increase in the Budget expenditure on defence would represent an increase of 7 per cent. The House will recall that on a number of occasions this Government has informed the House that it is attached to a defence policy program that will incorporate in each year an increase of 7 per cent, but when we get down to the actual figures we find that in 1979-80, compared with the previous year, the increase in defence expenditure was only 3 per cent. We had some discussions in the Estimates Committee meeting about what the last year's percentage increase was, remembering that the Government had pronounced that it should be 7 per cent. In fact, it turned out to be, not 7 per cent, but 5.6 per cent. When we come to this year's Budget statements we find that the Government has provided a real increase in the current financial year over 1980-81 of only 5.3 per cent. We have the Government stating time and time again that its whole purpose is to have a growth in the defence expenditure, defence outlay, of 7 per cent, but in no year since it has been in government has it achieved the 7 per cent that it has so vainly promised. I believe that this Government's whole attitude to defence is seen only in relation to elections because that is the only time we ever hear any statements about defence from the Government. Nothing so concentrates the mind of members of the Liberal Party on defence as an upcoming election. The whole performance of the Government has fallen far short of any promises it has ever made. I believe this House should criticise and castigate the Government for the hollowness of its rhetoric about defence because it has not, at any stage since it came to power, undertaken its full responsibilities to the Australian people in regard to defence. After six years of the Fraser Government, expenditure on defence-in the only measurable terms that mean anything, and that is in relation to gross national product-has hardly moved from 2.6 per cent of gross national product. That is in fact lower than the last Labor Party Budget which arranged for expenditure on defence, in terms of gross domestic product, of 2.7 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> I now refer to the estimates of the Department of Foreign Affairs. Honourable members will note that three resolutions were brought forward from the Estimates Committee. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) pointed out again the lack of performance of the Fraser Government in relation to foreign aid. When we left office in 1975 the Australian contribution to foreign aid amounted to 0.65 per cent of gross national product and after six years of Fraser Government that has woefully gone down to 0.48 per cent. This again shows the hollowness of the rhetoric of the Fraser Government. It parades the world stage, for instance at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting and with other groups in the world. Its performance is lamentably short of its promises. So the Opposition moved in the Estimates Committee the resolution that has been circulated to the House. Another resolution that we raised in the Estimates Committee related to the expenditure of $150,000 on the Australia-Britain Society. At the same time funds to organisations of great repute such as the Australian Institute of International Affairs and the United Nations Association of Australia were cut. So these organisations finished up with $15,000 or $20,000 whilst the Australia-Britain Society received a vote of $150,000. We asked in the Committee that that matter be reviewed by the Government and that a more equitable distribution of funds for non-governmental organisations be made available. The honourable member for Perth (Mr McLean) raised the question of aid to Vietnam. I shall quote from a report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. We are both members of that Committee. In dealing with Indo-China and the dissenting report that was produced on that occasion in relation to the question of aid to Vietnam the report stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The cessation of Australia's small aid program to Vietnam following the Vietnamese invasion of Kampuchea is understandable, but in the context of our longer term interests, is counterproductive. For Australia to continue to maintain this position deprives us of attaining an identifiable position in the process of reaching a solution to the Indo-Chinese problem. This is not to say that the quantity of aid that we would be in a position to provide would lessen Vietnamese dependence on Soviet aid, but it would sufficiently demarcate Australia from the position taken by other countries and strengthen Australia's hand in . . . implementing the recommendations put forward by the report. </PARA>
<PARA>In the light of the resolutions that were passed by that Committee I wish to move an amendment to the resolution that has been put forward by the Government. The Government said, in relation to the Estimates Committee's report that, the expenditures be agreed to and that the resolutions and expressions of opinion be noted. I do not think that goes far enough. I think the issues that were raised in the Foreign Affairs Committee report are worthy of greater action than indicated by the phrase 'be noted'. On behalf of the Opposition I move:</PARA>
<PARA> Omit the words 'the expressions of opinion agreed to by Committee A in relation to the Department of Foreign Affairs be noted', substitute the following words: 'this House fully endorses the expressions of opinion agreed to by Committee A in relation to the Department of Foreign Affairs and requests appropriate action by the Government'. </PARA>
<PARA>Members of the Opposition already have indicated that they support the statement that the Australian Government should accept the goal of 0.7 per cent of GNP for foreign aid. What we are insisting upon, apart from the Government making the promise, is that the Fraser Government, for a change, should try to achieve what it promises. In relation to the other propositions, and looking at the questions I have already referred to, I think it is only fair and reasonable that this House should support those recommendations. Therefore I have much pleasure in submitting the amendment to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, Mr Deputy Speaker, I have pleasure in seconding the amendment. I think the various resolutions carried by the Estimates Committee which examined the appropriation for the Department of Foreign Affairs were extremely important and do bear the more detailed attention of this House than they would get under the proposition that is currently before it. I want to take points with respect to two of those resolutions. Firstly, that one which related to expenditure on the United Nations Association of Australia and the Australian Institute of International Affairs and, secondly, the resolution which referred to recommending aid to Vietnam. On the question of the United Nations Association and the Australian Institute of International Affairs we pointed out at the Estimates Committee hearing that there was discrimination on the part of the Government in its handling of the proposed expenditure in relation to those two organisations, and a number of other organisations that dealt with bilateral relations between different countries such as the Australia-Britain Society and one or two others.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the case of the Australia-Britain Society there will be a cut in real terms but not in absolute terms-in real terms in a sense that the expenditure budgeted this year will be the same as it was last year and therefore there will be no adjustments for anticipated inflation. But in the case of the Australian Institute of International Affairs and the United Nations Association there has been an absolute cut in the funds granted. In the case of the United Nations Association, it is a reduction from $25,000 to $20,000 and there is a similar reduction in the case of the Australian Institute of International Affairs. It is not as though those two organisations, as independent organisations supported by the Government, were the most expensive. In fact they are among the cheaper organisations offered government support. In the case of the Australia-Britain Society, for example, an amount of $150,000 was budgeted and in the case of the Australia Indo-China Society it was an amount, I think, of some $500,000. </PARA>
<PARA> There needs to be an explanation as to why these two organisations which to this point have been treated relatively ungenerously are treated even more ungenerously by the Government in this Budget. I cannot for the life of me figure out why that should be the case. Both those organisations, far more than other organisations I have referred to, have contributed in a major way to public understanding of foreign affairs issues in Australia for a very long number of years. The Government grant to the Australian Institute of International Affairs when it was instituted, reflected at that time the government decision that there ought to be in the Australian community a greater understanding of international affairs. In many ways the Australian Institute of International Affairs and its predecessor were contributing to serious discussion on foreign affairs in this country when governments in this country were most reluctant to believe we had a foreign policy at all. The Institute provided the Australian public with some sort of direction in foreign affairs when governments in the 1930s in particular, abdicated responsibility. That they should be cut in this way and at this moment, I think, is an insult to the record of those organisations and the contributions they have made. </PARA>
<PARA> The same applies to the United Nations organisation. That has been supported for a very long time and it started as a gesture of support by the Government overall to the concept of the United Nations. There has been no retreating from that under any government. We regularly send delegates and we participate in all United Nations affairs. There is no justification for the reduction in allocations for that body as well. I cannot work out why the Government should choose to treat those bodies like that. As far as I am aware, neither of those bodies has engaged in activities which are embarrassing to the Government. As far as I am aware, both of them have had representatives of the Government at their various meetings explaining government policy. There has been no reluctance by the Government to participate in the affairs of those bodies. There has been no assumption that a fair hearing will not be accorded them when they participate in affairs. Indeed, the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) opened the last major seminar on the Middle East of the Australian Institute of International Affairs. He was accorded, I thought at the time, a reasonably good reception. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that the Government will have the confidence of a large number of people in the independent-or outside, if you like-non-official foreign policy influencing community if, on the one hand, it is going to treat organisations such as the Australian Institute of International Affairs and the United Nations Association with an extreme of ungenerosity and, on the other hand, it is going to treat with a relative degree of generosity organisations of highly doubtful value in the case of the Australia-Britain Society and of some value in the case of the Australia-Indo-China Society, although it is not of substantially greater value than are the other two organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the second of the three parts of the proposition we put forward, that is, that part which dealt with the matter of aid to Vietnam. I had not intended to deal with this matter at any length, but I think some points need to be made on the remarks of the honourale member for Perth (Mr McLean). I think it is reasonable to say that when it comes to handling questions regarding Indo-China, historically this Government had had the Midas touch of failure. Everything this Government has decided in respect of Indo-China irrespective of the reasons or the validity of the reasons that were espoused for taking a particular action, has ended up detrimental to Australia's interests. </PARA>
<PARA> The two great advances, in territorial terms, made in communist power virtually since the Bolshevik revolution in 1917 were the First World War and the situation in Indo-China. The Second World War gains were made as a result of the policies of Adolf Hitler. The policies pursued by the Administration of the United States of America and supported by the Australian Government produced a situation in Indo-China in which the likely outcome of conflict there was definitely a communist government in Vietnam, but a communist government under which in the south of Vietnam there would be a degree of conflict at least with the North Vietnamese communists. The cadres need not have been wasted in the way in which they were during the war. So a North Vietnamese takeover was complete and neutralist regimes were established in Laos and Kampuchea. </PARA>
<PARA> What do we have in that situation? We have hard-line communist regimes in every one of those countries as a direct result of Australian Government and American government policies. I do not believe that that is a record which ought to give us any confidence in the sorts of propositions that will be put forward by the other side. It certainly is not a record that ought to give us any confidence in the propositions put forward by the honourable member for Perth. </PARA>
<PARA> When we come to look at the matter of aid to Vietnam we see yet another Australian government failure in the making. It is not as though Vietnam has pursued, with no internal debate and with utter consistency, the present policies in Indo-China since its success in South Vietnam. As the honourable member for Perth pointed out, in the evidence on Indo-China presented to the Committee-this is detailed in the Committee's report-between 1976 and 1979 there was considerable debate and uncertainty within the Vietnamese regime about what ought to be done concerning the situation in Laos and Kampuchea. Again, that information was presented to the Committee in evidence. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the factors which finally determined the course of the regime was the continuing hostility by powers which previously had been involved in Vietnam to the notion that Vietnam should receive the sort of aid which would permit its economic recovery. Of course, there are other factors, but that was one of them. It was that factor that we attempted to come to grips with in the minority report we submitted on this and also in the amendment before us. The Vietnamese had every reason, in the end, to be distrustful of Western motives in dealing with them. It must be said that the record of the West-Australia and the United States-is not all that good. None of us believe for one moment that if we were to give to Vietnam the sort of aid we were giving it before we cut if off there would be a dramatic change in Vietnam's policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The point made in the minority report, to which the honourable member for Perth referred, was that at least that would be a start, at least it would give the Vietnamese an American option to take them out of a situation in which they clearly do not want to be, namely, one of dependence on the Soviet Union. It would put them in a situation in which they could balance their Soviet relationship with a relationship with another nation. For them to be able to do that is in our interests. A Soviet Union influence in Vietnam is not in our interests. It is up to us to produce sensible policies to diminish Soviet influence in that area. The Government will fail in its policy, particularly if it encourages the United States to take a similar stance. The Government will fail in its policy on this, just as the coalition government of the 1960s failed in its policies on Vietnam.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to consider certain aspects of the estimates for the Department of Defence. The appropriations for the defence effort this financial year represent 10.1 per cent of total Budget outlays, compared with its representing 9.1 per cent of total Budget outlays in 1974-75. I want to make particular reference to the capital expenditure side and to examine some of the trends in expenditure in that area. The provision for capital expenditure on defence in this Budget represents an overall increase of about 7 per cent, in real terms, over the capital expenditure on defence in last year's Budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is very interesting to look at some of the components of that category of capital expenditure. For example, expenditure on naval construction is down by about 18 per cent in real terms reflecting probably the run-down of the FFG program. Expenditure on aircraft procurement represents an increase of about 27 per cent in real terms, which probably is dependent upon a Tactical Fighter Force decision, which we are assured by the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) can be expected in the next few weeks. Expenditure on the acquisition of armoured vehicles and artillery declined by about 11 per cent in real terms. Expenditure on non-specified capital equipment-that is, non-specified in the Budget Papers-represents an increase of 25 per cent in real terms. </PARA>
<PARA> When one looks through the details of some of the items included under the heading 'Other capital equipment' one sees that the Defence Integrated Secure Communications Network project, which was the subject of a recent announcement, is one of the projects listed. One of the issues I would like the Minister to deal with if he replies in this debate is that of the extent to which the delay in the DISCON project as a result of the Government's decision to call fresh tenders for the project will result in savings this financial year. The estimates for the Department indicate that the cost of new commitments to be met in 1981-82 on the DISCON project amount to $14.756m. It would be interesting to know to what extent savings might result from a delay this financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to discuss a little further the DISCON project, but before doing so I make this comment: It seems to me that what has happened in succeeding years with respect to acquisition projects is that, where there has been a delay in the acquisition of defence equipment-and that has been a fairly common occurrence-we have been able to save some money from the original allocation in the appropriations. We have not diverted that money to other projects in the defence program which perhaps could have been brought forward to accommodate some of the very real needs of the Defence Force. I think one of the reasons why we sometimes have a shortfall in defence expenditure compared with the allocation in the original appropriations is that we have delays in decision making as far as acquisition is concerned and that money which is thereby not spent in that financial year is not diverted elsewhere. If we want to keep up with our program of modernising and re-equipping our defence forces, I think we would do well to ensure that we bring forward other programs which could well fill the gap in expenditure terms and modernise other aspects of our defence forces. </PARA>
<PARA> On 10 September, the Minister for Defence announced that new tenders would be called for the DISCON communications project, that is, the communications project which would link every arm of the Defence Force throughout Australia-all the defence agencies-in a secure, integrated network. I should say initially that I have some interest in this project as the succesful tenderer earlier this year was in fact a company in my electorate, the Rockwell-Collins (Australasia) Pty Ltd company in Lilydale. I have no other interest in the project other than that the company is within my electorate. I should put that fact before the House so that other people may be able to judge the perspective which I bring to it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister said, in his statement on 10 September:</PARA>
<PARA> The first step in calling new tenders will be a public invitation to firms to register their interest. This is necessary in view of the time that has elapsed since the original list of four tenderers was agreed. A shortlist of companies will be selected from the responses and invited to tender. </PARA>
<PARA>I question the need to go right back to the beginning of the tendering process. It appears to me that there was no question that the company, which was originally the successful tenderer, was guilty of any impropriety. That is not being suggested at all. I know, from discussions that I have had with the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman) and the Minister for Defence that there is no suspicion of that whatsoever. There was a change in the nature of the project in that the successful tenderer sought to change a major sub-contractor. It was judged by our defence officials that that was a substantial change to the original tender that was put in. But there is no evidence of any impropriety. Indeed, it appears that it was as a result of protests being put in by unsuccessful tenderers on the shortlist that the Government reconsidered the matter and decided, in order to ensure that everything was above board, that tenders should be called again. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that, in view of the unfortunate history that we have in this country of delays in our acquisition programs, it would have been better, would have met any requirements of propriety and would have ensured that our tendering process was above board, if we had gone back to the shortlist of four and invited them to come forward with fresh tenders rather than to start the whole project over again and again delay our acquisition program. It is possible that the Government cannot change its decision announced on 10 September, but I believe that the suggestion that I have put forward would have met all the requirements that the Government had in mind and would have enabled us to get on with the job a little more quickly than we have been able to do. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at the expenditure program for new capital equipment in the defence area, one concludes that the Government has maintained a commitment to some real growth in the defence vote. There are some pleasing aspects, especially the increased outlay on new base facilities. That has gone up by about 30 per cent in real terms. However, it may be that projects in this field have been brought forward to take up the slack in others, especially in the capital expenditure area. Nevertheless, the projects are probably long overdue in the provision of an adequate infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA> The slowdown in capital equipment spending which I have mentioned already may get worse than the figures show if we continue with a persistent inability to make timely decisions and stick to acquisition timetables. In the long term, I believe that this problem is serious, leading to a bunching of projects and associated costs. It leads also to a growing obsolescence of the Defence Force and increased maintenance costs. However, I welcome the real progress that has been made in this defence vote and I trust that we will do even better in future years by sticking to our acquisition programs and meeting the original appropriation figures which were announced in the Budget Speech. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I endorse the amendment moved by my colleague the honourable member for St George (Mr Morrison) in supporting the expressions of opinion made by Estimates Committee A on the Department of Foreign Affairs. It is a significant pointer to the standing of the Government, particularly the standing of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) when the Opposition with only four members was able to have carried a three part resolution in that Committee. Although the Minister was there with some 20 advisers, he could not get three members of the Government to support him to vote against our resolution. I think it is a disgraceful situation. I feel extremely sorry for the Minister. But it reflects the state of the Government and its attitude towards these very important considerations. It reflects also its ignorance of the real position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to make a few remarks about the particular resolution that I moved that aid programs in Vietnam should be restored. The honourable member for Perth (Mr McLean) said earlier tonight what terrible people the Vietnamese were for diverting their resources to aggressive warefare in Kampuchea. Of course, if he had been there, had a look around, and had talked to people on the spot, he would have seen that that was not what was happening at all. In fact the Vietnamese forces in Kampuchea have brought peace and stability to Kampuchea. He knows that and the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) knows that. It is to the credit of the honourable member for Kooyong that he persuaded the Government that it should drop its recognition of Pol Pot. Pol Pot caused all the killing and the instability in Kampuchea. It was not the Vietnamese. I say the incursion by the Vietnamese in Kampuchea advisedly because it was not an invasion as far as the Kampucheans are concerned. If the honourable member for Perth had gone there, he would have found out very quickly that the Kampucheans welcomed the Vietnamese. They do not see them as invaders. They see them as their saviours because they have brought peace and stability to the greater part of Kampuchea. </PARA>
<PARA> The argument that we have wasted our economic resources in Kamuchea is nonsense because these people are very poorly paid. They do not cost much to maintain. They have to be paid and fed wherever they are, whether in Vietnam or Kampuchea. In fact, when we were in Kampuchea the agricultural position was better there than it was in Vietnam. So that is quite an irrelevant argument and it just does not stand up. To cut off those aid programs was a very petty action unworthy of the Australian nation. They were not of terribly great import; they were fairly symbolic gestures. But we spent money in sending cattle over there and then we cut off the program that would have established pastures to support the cattle. I do not know what has happened to the cattle now. So the money has been wasted. We spent money on putting down the foundations for a milk factory which was then taken away and put somewhere else. That is more of the Australian taxpayers' money that has been wasted by t's very petty action of cutting off two aid programs which had a symbolic value. This action of ours was very hurtful to the Vietnamese people. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we should reconsider that proposition. The Vietnamese need aid from wherever they can get it. Of course, the Soviet Union has been assisting them for many years, not just recently but since about 1968. The Americans, of course, who have caused all of the destruction there have not given them anything at all. They have been left in the lurch. Then we criticise them because they accept aid from the Soviet Union. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In Australia approximately 1.5 million people, or 10 per cent of the population, are over the age of 65. By the year 2001 the number will increase by over half a million. Most individuals will eventually suffer from some form of permanent impairment associated with aging, and so it must be in the ultimate interests of the community as a whole to encourage measures designed to minimise community disruption. As I described earlier this week, there are many studies available at present which show quite clearly the gains for the community in the greater freedom for elderly people living independently. Even patients who have suffered strokes are able to achieve and maintain significant gains in the activities of normal living through community rehabilitation. The savings resulting from returning patients to their homes or families, or to independent living, will more than pay for the costs of providing rehabilitation services in the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A Telecom Australia report on the disabled published recently states that approximately 20 per cent of those over 65 years of age suffer from some handicap. Within this group are the greatest concentration of people handicapped by rheumatism, athritis, strokes, hearing impairment and sight defects. One of the greatest fears of elderly disabled people living alone is that of suffering a heart attack or stroke and being unable to obtain assistance. It is estimated that over 50,000 persons would appreciate some sort of alarm system which enables a person either to obtain assistance when required or to have assistance dispatched when the subsriber fails to respond to checking calls. </PARA>
<PARA> In my electorate, a Bayswater man, Mr Norman Wiggett, has developed a new home help crisis intervention service which will provide medical and/or other emergency services at the touch of a button. This system is aimed at age and invalid pensioners and others in the community who are handicapped or isolated from rapid access to emergency help. There are, of course, many such systems being developed commercially at present and they are regarded by groups working with the elderly and the handicapped as extremely advantageous. The difference perhaps with Mr Wiggett's system is that he is determined to provide it as a community service-a non-profit organisation. To this end he has been involved in all sorts of lobbying and publicity efforts to try to convince State and Federal governments of the importance and value of their support for this scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> His 'visec-assist-alert' unit, once installed, provides an automatic dialling system which contacts a central monitoring point through normal telephone links. All the subscriber needs to do to activate the system in an emergency is to push a button on a wall unit or on a small hand held transmitter which is carried at all times. The system then contacts a central monitoring station, run by the Handicapped and Aged Emergency Telephone Answering Service, whose round the clock monitoring staff ascertain the nature of the problem and alert the necessary emergency services. The system is tested daily-or hourly if required-both to ensure that the equipment is working and to let monitoring staff know the subscriber is well enough to carry out the check procedure. If the check is not received at a pre-arranged time each day, the monitors make their own checks, ensuring that, even if the subscriber is incapacitated and unable to reach the wall unit or to work the hand unit, help is never too far away. </PARA>
<PARA> I have inspected and tested Mr Wiggett's system and find it most impressive. Each 'visec-assist-alert' unit comprising the wall unit and portable transmitter, costs around $300. Monitoring at this stage costs $78 a year, or $1.50 per week. Mr Wiggett would like to be able to provide the equipment free to every person who wishes to become a subscriber. To this end he has contacted Federal and State authorities and, although several departments have expressed great interest in his scheme, he has been unable to gain government backing. He has therefore had to spend many thousands of hours in publicising the scheme through various service agencies and businesses in the hope of attracting individuals and groups to donate a unit for the use of a subscriber. He has even contemplated a national system of raffles which he hopes would raise enough money to purchase a number of units each year for pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA> I contend that this is a disgraceful situation. We have an individual who has provided the research and produced a scheme which would undoubtedly save the Government a considerable amount of the funds allocated at present to institutional care. It would also provide security and independence for many thousands of our citizens. Mr Wiggett is keen to provide this as a non-profit service, and yet he cannot get the support of the Government. Such a system, coupled with a real commitment to community health and the provision of domiciliary care through municipalities, would provide elderly people with the freedom to remain at home in a familiar environment and yet retain the security of knowing that specialist assistance is only minutes away. It is time for this Government to re-assess its policies towards the aged and handicapped in our community. Modern research and new technology quite clearly indicate that the Government's present schemes are not in the best interests of the community, and that there are exciting and innovative ways available of ensuring that all our citizens are able to live full and satisfying lives, not just until age or infirmity catches up with them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, as you will well recall, earlier this afternoon I addressed myself to the question of the use of the excess capacity of Qantas Airways Ltd by domestic passengers on domestic sectors-for example, Perth to Sydney and Perth to Melbourne. I demonstrated that the use of that excess capacity has taken place when the domestic airlines have been caught in industrial disputes. I believe there is evidence that there are no practical problems to that practice being allowed to continue in normal times. In fact, the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) has recognised that the proposition is feasible in terms of administration. If the proposal were to be adopted in the longer term, it could certainly be improved in that at the exit point for domestic passengers there could be a separate queue so that those passengers would not have to join the longer queue of passengers returning from international flights originating outside Australia. The Department of Transport has estimated that when Qantas flies between Perth and eastern Australia up to 600 seats are available in each direction. The actual number of seats vacant in a particular week may be less than that figure, depending on a number of factors. The Department anticipates that the number of vacant seats will diminish as a result of recently announced reduced fares for international travel between Perth and the United States of America on Qantas services. My argument is a very simple one. Even if only one seat is going begging, I believe it is an economic and community social waste which should not be countenanced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Qantas has suggested to the Holcroft Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares and in other forums that it could offer its excess capacity to domestic passengers for a fare of $199 one way. When I asked the Minister about this in April he said that he had initiated discussions between the airlines to see whether Qantas's capacity could be used on the domestic routes. I can see two ways in which Qantas's capacity could be employed. Firstly, we could look at the recently announced decision by the Minister to allow East West Airlines Ltd to operate a specialised air service over the two-airline route of Sydney to Canberra. I believe Qantas could put forward a similar proposal to operate a specialised service which in itself would not directly threaten the two-airline policy, which the Government is keen to preserve and protect. Such a specialised service could simply involve passengers going out to the airport and purchasing their tickets on board the plane. Perhaps they would be allowed to carry only the luggage that they could on board the aircraft so as not to delay unnecessarily the incoming or outgoing international flights. </PARA>
<PARA> If it were deemed to be too detrimental to the two-airline policy for Qantas to be allowed to sell directly its excess capacity to the air fare paying public, I believe, there would be a second way round the problem. That would be for Qantas to be allowed to sell its capacity to the two airlines and they in turn could market the tickets to the public and gain the profit from those seats. The point is that, firstly, there would be bottoms on seats and the capacity would not be wasted. Secondly, we would have a two-tiered fare level. People could still travel across the continent by normal, regular domestic services but every now and then, depending upon the incoming or outgoing flights, excess capacity would be available for people at a cheaper fare. I do not in any way believe that this would strike at the two-airline policy. I do not believe it would lessen the demand for the services of the two domestic airlines currently flying across the continent as most of their planes are full. I believe the excess capacity of Qantas at the much reduced fare-about $100 cheaper than what is presently available-would, in fact, create demand and generate traffic. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the great problems in America when it experimented with deregulation and cheaper airline fares was that the services on the ground at the airports could not cope with the number of people who for the first time were able to fly. I believe that if Qantas were allowed to sell its excess capacity, either through the airlines or directly to the public, we would see the creation of demand along the same lines as we have seen in America. At present we have a wasteful situation which is denying to many people an opportunity to avail themselves of a lower fare in order to be able to travel backwards and forwards across the country. The Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) said in April that he was initiating discussions with the airline. I hope that, over the months that have expired since then, they have exhausted all the issues. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I speak briefly about Sir Keith Shann's statement that the Australian journalists who had been murdered by the Indonesians in Portuguese East Timor in 1974 had asked for it and got it. I think this statement was outrageously obscene. It was insensitive in the extreme and highly offensive to most Australians, and especially so to the relatives and friends of the victims of the Indonesian brutality. I find it very difficult to understand how a former senior diplomat could make such offensive, misleading and generally undiplomatic statements. To say that the journalists were told not to go to the area raises questions of who told them and when they were told. It is interesting to note that when Senator Gietzelt and I visited East Timor in August 1975 we were advised in Darwin by Department of Foreign Affairs officers not to go.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe now that they did not want us to go because they did not want the Parliament or the Australian people to know the truth of the situation in East Timor and because what was happening there was quite different to what they were telling the public was happening. I think the journalists went to East Timor for the same reason; they wanted to break the curtain of silence and deceit about what was going on and to inform the Australian people of what was happening in a friendly country, a country that had been our loyal ally in World War II, situated only 150 miles from Darwin. To do this they had to get as near as possible to where the action was and, of course, this always involves a degree of risk. But to say that they had deliberately and unnecessarily exposed themselves to risk is, in my view, a cowardly slander on a courageous group of young Australians who were there to do a legitimate job of informing the Australian people. I believe that if they had been in possession of all the relevant information which the Government had regarding Indonesian invasion plans they may have acted differently. I believe that if anyone is culpable it is those government officials who deliberately withheld from them vital information which might well have saved their lives. </PARA>
<PARA> The allegation that the journalists were wearing Fretilin uniforms is irrelevant and has no standing as there was no such thing as a Fretilin uniform. The Fretilin forces were wearing Portuguese uniforms in defence of sovereign Portuguese territory, which also happened to be their own country. Letters in the Press today indicate quite clearly that the journalists were definitely not wearing uniforms of any kind. To use this propaganda is just to parrot Indonesian propaganda. The film of the attack at Balibo shows quite clearly that the journalists went to great lengths to identify themselves as Australians by painting the Australian flag very clearly and prominently on the house they occupied. There is no question that the Indonesians knew that they were Australians, and they were murdered. </PARA>
<PARA> I have always had a favourable opinion of Sir Keith Shann and I am at a loss to understand the motivation for such strong and insensitive language. The answer could lie in Sir Keith's business interests. We know, for instance, that he is a former president of the Australian-Asian Business Council. I understand that he recently visited Indonesia on a lecture tour at government expense and addressed the Australian Confederation of Industry on his return. I believe that Sir Keith is also a director of Mount Isa Mines Holding Co. These are, of course, quite legitimate interests, but when an Australian citizen's interest in another country leads him to make harsh and unfounded judgments about citizens of his own country who have died in the service of their country I think we must seriously question that judgment. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me to be an occupational hazard of Australian ambassadors to Indonesia that they succumb to the seductive charms of their host country and finish up acting as ambassadors for the host country rather than for their own country. I hope that in this situation Sir Keith Shann sees fit to apologise to all whom he has so grievously offended. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This morning I chose to try to tell this House some matters of considerable importance and to give a comparison of the situation as it existed with the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding). It is very easy, as I have pointed out on many occasions, to be the accuser. It is interesting to know that I can tell the honourable member for Melbourne Ports how it feels to be accused and, in fact, to be accused incorrectly. There are many degrees of accuracy in this place, but it appears to me that at any time there are those who are prepared to conduct a form of kangaroo court: They stand and read newspaper articles and from those articles, they choose to prove that a person has done anything they like. We, as politicians, are pretty well aware that the Press chooses to publish parts of things and to give to them a context which suits the sensational nature of most newspapers today. If anybody wishes to continue to read pieces from newspapers referring to my activities in the past-in this case I am talking about 1967-I think it would not be bad if he did what I am about to do, that is, to read some extracts from the actual findings of Chief Justice Sir Albert Wolff.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I started to tell the House today that the case to which everybody refers actually was in two parts. When my enemies in Carnarvon discovered that the successful conviction and fine of $48 that they had achieved was insufficient to have me removed from the Shire of Carnarvon and that it was necessary to achieve a gaol sentence, it did not deter them at all from continuing with their arrangement. They consequently did so and their appeal was subsequently rejected. The fact is that the Chief Justice overturned quite a bit of the evidence which the local court magistrate said he believed. It is not possible to read the whole of his findings but I will read pieces. On page 4 he said, referring to me: 'He must know the disastrous consequences that may ensue should he ever take the law into his own hands again. The magistrate deals with the core of the matter. His findings on the main issue must be accepted, but on the question of the severity of the assault there was evidence that the only visible injury McGibbon received was a small laceration near the hairline on his forehead.' If the next speaker decides to get up to say that the laceration was three and three-quarters of an inch long I point out that it was, in fact, three-quarters of an inch long. McGibbon said that he had a lump on his forehead but nobody else substantiated this. The nursing sister-do not worry, he was carted immediately up to the hospital by the people concerned-who cleaned and dressed the wound just after the assault said that he had no other injury except a small laceration. The doctor who examined McGibbon some days later noticed a small laceration and was not able to find anything else. He said specifically that there was no bruising. We are talking about a bashing. Some of the evidence for the prosecution suggested that Wilson was raining blows-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad to think that this is the way that people see it. But I just thought I might go on quoting the Chief Justice. He said: 'Seeing that McGibbon was undoubtedly a nuisance and inclined to violence, this is a mitigating feature'. He went on. The point I want to raise there is to substantiate this matter. This morning honourable members opposite said I could not substantiate that the man was, in fact, both violent and dangerous. In fact, on numerous occasions he was known to have assaulted people of the Aboriginal race and members of the police force. I am sure that members of the Opposition, through sources that they seem to be able to provide at any other time, could check that. Letters were written to the newspaper. One was written on 18 December by a Mrs Samsa. She said: 'Recently you reported another case against McGibbon and referred to a disturbance. The sworn evidence was, briefly, that McGibbon had a fight with a man in the street, came inside the hotel and soon afterwards punched a coloured woman sitting with her husband. She ran away but was followed and punched again. Then McGibbon returned and punched the husband. When Tuckey was called McGibbon attacked Tuckey's brother striking him across the bar. Evidence supported Tuckey's claim of being hit in the face also. McGibbon was convicted. Five attacks in quick succession is quite a disturbance in my opinion and good reason to have protection when meeting a man like this man in the future'. I ask that that letter be tabled.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another letter that was sent to the West Australian was dated 13 December 1967. It was signed by a large group of Carnarvon businessmen. It is quite interesting because it says: 'However, what is now happening in the town is essentially of a political nature by a few people who wish to oust our elected president. As a prominent citizen and successful publican who is unafraid to speak out and fight for what he believes is of benefit to Carnarvon, he naturally makes certain enemies. However these are very much in the minority, the greatest majority knowing his value to this community and appreciate the large amount of good work he has done for Carnarvon's people. It is understood that after close investigation the Native Welfare Department considered the case closed. If this is so who is providing the funds for additional action now being taken and why if it is not for personal political gain? Also, why did the same people not rush to support the native concerned when he was involved in two assault cases this week? 'These were the people on the spot. These are the people who knew what was going on'. I have the original of that letter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If we consider that there was not a plot organised by the Australian Labor Party, we might ask ourselves why on 1 December 1967 another leading member of the Labor Party decided to write to the newspaper suggesting that things were not as they should be. It is quite interesting that he was able to get a letter in the paper in such a very short time when the actual statement appeared in the newspaper only on 29 November. One can say one of two things about the person who wrote the letter, the first one being that, as a politician, he should not judge by what was published in the newspaper and the second being that he had an ulterior motive. It might be interesting for the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley) to look at the article because his father wrote it. I have a photocopy of that letter here for his benefit. The point is that I still argue that if there was a basher of people around at the time it was Raymond McGibbon. I still argue that the action I took was, as the Chief Justice suggested, exaggerated. I still argue that it happened in 1967. As I said this morning, if we choose to keep up this type of innuendo and pressure, I am quite happy to play the game but I will not expect members from the other side of the House to jump up and scream their heads off if I interject on one of them.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr Howard</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1), (2), (3) and (4) Bank charges of this nature are a matter for determination by the bank concerned, but are generally designed to cover, at least partially, the administrative costs incurred in providing the relevant services.</PARA>
<PARA> The Managing Director of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation has advised that the Commonwealth Trading Bank's charges for its overseas services were reviewed by the Bank earlier this year. The $1 charge for 'small' foreign currency drafts had been unchanged for some five years. The results of that review disclosed that substantial losses were being incurred on the issue of foreign currency drafts for relatively small amounts. Accordingly, it was decided to apply charges for drafts that went some way towards recovering costs.</PARA>
<PARA> The new charges for drafts up to the equivalent of $2,000 in foreign currencies are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> When issued on the office of the Commonwealth Trading Bank of Australia at London or New York-$3</PARA>
<PARA> When issued on an overseas bank-$5</PARA>
<PARA> Drafts issued on the Bank's own offices are less costly to process because of more highly automated procedures. For drafts over the equivalent of $2,000 there is no charge.</PARA>
<PARA> The new charges were applied from 3 July 1981. There was no public announcement of the new charges. Customers are informed by staff at the Bank's branches.</PARA>
<PARA> (5), (6) and (7) It is understood that, when the CTB's new fees were introduced, charges by other banks for the same service ranged up to $2. The Managing Director is not aware of any recent announcement on charges for drafts issued by other banks.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) I am aware of a level of concern over the matters listed. Frequently reviews are carried out to rectify, if possible, any shortcomings. More specifically:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Rations and Quarters-The circumstances under which Defence Force members are required to pay for rations and quarters, is currently under review.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) &amp; (c) Uniform Maintenance Allowance and Clothing Charges-Although no adjustment was made to uniform maintenance allowance between 1975 to 1980, the rates have been increased twice recently. A 35 per cent increase was introduced in July 1980 along with an annual review adjustment of 3.028 per cent in July 1981. Another review is now in progress and changes to the rates, as prices change, will occur annually in future with adjustments to be effective in July of each year.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) Payments in Association with Postings-These payments include Disturbance Allowance, Vehicle Allowance, Temporary Rental Allowance, Temporary Accommodation Allowance and Travelling Allowance. On these issues:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Disturbance Allowance-A survey of expenses incurred on removal on posting was recently carried out, the results of which are now being analysed to ascertain whether variations to the current rates of Disturbances Allowance are appropriate, and whether other measures for meeting the problems of expenses during removal should be taken.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Vehicle Allowance-The rates of Vehicle Allowance are the same as those applying to all other Commonwealth employees. The rates are reviewed annually.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. Temporary Rental Allowance-Temporary Rental Allowance ceilings, which govern the payment of the allowance, are reviewed periodically for all localities. New ceilings have been recommended to take effect from 1 September 1981, as a result of the last review.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. Temporary Accomodation Allowance-This is a reimbursement allowance, based upon actual expenditure. It is, therefore, self-adjusting.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. Travelling Allowance-The rates of Travelling Allowance are reviewed annually in accordance with surveys carried out by the Public Service Board. The Public Service Board rates flow on to members of the Defence Force with the same date of effect.</PARA>
<PARA> (e) Married Quarters and Rentals-Scales and standards have been set for married quarters to ensure that new quarters are built to community standards. When funds are available, existing quarters are improved or modified as close as possible to the required standard. A Working Party is currently examining the development of programmes for replacing replacing quarters that cannot be satisfactorily improved, and a review of existing scales and standards is currently being undertaken. Rental housing for service members is provided through the Group Rent Scheme, which directly relates rents to the size and quality of each quarter. The scheme also contains a rental appeal and rebate system to which every tenant has access. Rentals have not been increased for some time, and are presently under review.</PARA>
<PARA> (f) Education Allowances-Education Allowance rates are reviewed annually by the Public Service Board, based upon fees charged at a selected range of private schools within Australia. The resultant rates flow on to the Defence Force. A Defence Standing Committee is available to assess the cases of individuals who believe their circumstances merit special consideration. In addition, the conditions under which Education Allowance may be available have been widened considerably over the last two or three years.</PARA>
<PARA> (g) Reunion Travel-The level, frequency and adequacy of reunion travel is continually under review and the rules applied to them closely follow those approved by the Public Service Board for other Commonwealth employees. Recently, the number of annual visits by children being educated in Australia, whose parents are posted overseas, was increased from two to three. In addition, family reunion and leave travel arrangements for members serving in remote areas have recently be widened.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Yes. I would, however, clarify an ambiguity in the honourable member's question; the reference to a former Prime Minister was not made by Mr Kealy.

<PARA> Mr Whitlam did not state that Australia had no knowledge of E Systems or TRW; neither did he state that no Australian politician entered the central computer rooms at Pine Gap.

<PARA> (4) (a) I refer the honourable member to my statement of 2 June 1977 (Hansard pages 2411-12) in which I said that those Australians and Americans at the site whose responsibilities so require have equal right of access to all parts of the Joint Defence Space Research Facility and to its activities.

<PARA> In the recent Budget the Government granted service pensions to Australian merchant seamen. However, this excludes the many British and other allied mariners who now live in Australia and possibly Australians who served in other allied vessels during the war. Will the Minister give this House an assurance that the Government will include all Australians and allied merchant seamen when legislation is brought before this House granting service pensions to merchant seamen?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Veterans' Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA>
<PARA> A Bill will be introduced into Parliament shortly to provide for the extension of service pension eligibility to Australian merchant mariners.</PARA>

<PARA> In considering the competing demands of various groups for the extension of Repatriation benefits, the Government decided that, in the present climate of financial stringency, extension of service pension eligibility would, at this time, be limited to Australian mariners.</PARA>
<PARA> This will include a mariner employed in sea-going service on any ship registered in Australia, which traded between Australia and any other port or on a ship registered in New Zealand which operated from an Australian port; and a mariner who was, or whose dependants were, resident in Australia for 12 months before his employment on a ship registered outside Australia.</PARA>

British Instantaneous (BIC) and Storz, were gaining world wide and Australian acceptance. The Board considered that the Storz design offered marginal advantages and therefore adopted it as their recommended coupling. My Department adopted the BIC as standard for the purpose of airport fire fighting circa 1953, and having assessed the Storz coupling has continued to regard the BIC as a superior coupling for this particular application. It is understood that the Department of Defence maintains a similar view. No change is therefore planned, but appropriate adaptors are carried. State and local government authorities also have to carry adaptors to enable them to make connections between water main hydrants and their appliances.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr Howard</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) A taxpayer negotiating with the Australian Taxation Office solely in relation to unpaid income tax would not normally have any right to undertake legal proceedings against the Taxation Office in relation to that unpaid tax. Accordingly the need to seek an undertaking of the kind referred to by the honourable member would not arise. However, negotiations aimed at achieving a compromise settlement of a disputed assessment may involve the question of the payment of tax ultimately agreed to be payable and it would normally be a condition of the settlement that the taxpayer would discontinue any legal proceedings instituted in relation to the disputed assessment.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Commissioner of Taxation has advised that the practice of requiring discontinuance of legal proceedings as a condition of settlement of disputes relating to assessments has not been specifically referred to the Attorney-General's Department. The settlement of disputes by way of compromise is a long established procedure in most forms of litigation. If, however, as frequently happens, a taxation dispute is settled by compromise after counsel has been engaged by the Crown Solicitor to represent the Commissioner of Taxation, the Crown Solicitor's officers and counsel will be involved in the settlement negotiations with the taxpayer and his representatives.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GH4">Mr Hunt</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) A preceding F27 made a slightly wider approach than was expected and was then delayed in clearing the runway after landing because of works in progress at the first turn-off and an aircraft holding on the intersecting runway.</PARA>
<PARA> The DC9 was instructed by ATC to go around from a position approximately two miles before touch-down.</PARA>
<PARA> This was a normal control procedure. Both aircraft were under visual control throughout and there was no breakdown in separation standards.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The term 'near miss' is not amenable to precise definition, but such occurrences are embraced in the air safety incident reporting system. Apart from the legal requirement to report incidents, pilots and other operational personnel are encouraged to submit incident reports concerning any circumstances which the originator believes to be undesirable or hazardous, including those in which an infringement of prescribed separation standards has been reported to have occurred. For the purpose of monitoring safety, no differentiation is made between those occurrences in which aircraft came into close proximity and those in which the separation reduction was relatively minor.</PARA>
<PARA> In the period under question there were three reported incidents at Adelaide which involved an infringement of separation standards or the potential for such infringement. The details are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Date</PARA>
<PARA>Circumstances</PARA>
<PARA>17.8.79</PARA>
<PARA>Inadequate separation between a departing Boeing 727 and a light aircraft because of a lack of co-ordination between air traffic controllers</PARA>

<PARA>A Boeing 727 executed a go-around from a landing approach when it appeared that there may have been inadequate separation from a light aircraft which had previously landed</PARA>
<PARA>15.3.80</PARA>
<PARA>Two light aircraft came into close proximity following the unauthorised entry into controlled airspace by one of them</PARA>
<PARA> During the same period there have been 10 additional incidents reported which involved a go-around from a landing approach, initiated because of problems associated with the operation of the aircraft and in which separation between aircraft was not a factor. In all cases the aircraft subsequently landed normally. The numbers are as follows:</PARA>
