<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I desire to raise a matter of privilege. First of all, sir, I apologise to you for the shortness of notice. The matter was brought to my attention only in the last half an hour. I conferred with the Clerks and felt that under the Standing Orders I was bound to raise the matter at the first available opportunity, which is now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I draw attention to your statement to the Parliament on 20 October 1981 in which you found a prima facie case of privilege in respect of an advertisement about the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and a motor car. I draw your attention and the attention of the House to an advertisement in News Weekly dated 14 October 1981. I have provided photostat copies of this advertisement to the Clerk and I understand that they are available to you. The advertisement has the heading 'Two Australian Prime Ministers-How they rate the N.C.C. and News Weekly'. It has a large picture of a former Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies, and a picture of the present Prime Minister, the Right Honourable Malcolm Fraser. It contains a quote from a letter from Sir Robert Menzies indicating that in the past he had been concerned to make a donation to News Weekly, and it has a general supporting statement by the Prime Minister of the objectives of the National Civic Council. Sir, if the matter had stopped there, it probably would not have infringed the criteria that you have established. But the advertisement then states:</PARA>
<PARA> When you support the News Weekly Fighting Fund you contribute to the future of Australia</PARA>
<PARA>Underneath that comment there is a cut-out so that any person desiring to make a contribution to the News Weekly Fighting Fund can do so. I understand that News Weekly is a journal of political comment. If in fact, as you have ruled, the previous advertisements concerning the Prime Minister involve breaches of privilege, it is not possible for the individual Prime Minister, as the case may be, to waive the privilege. Certainly in the case of Sir Robert Menzies, a Prime Minister long dead, I do not see how it is possible to invoke a general letter of support that may have occurred years back for the purposes of an advertisement which is designed to elicit financial contribution to and support for a particular journal of comment to assist it commercially. Sir, on that basis, on the basis of your previous ruling, and as the Privileges Committee is considering the question of advertisements and the way in which, presumably, Prime Ministers are involved, I believe that it is proper to raise this matter as a prima facie case of breach of privilege and to ask you to deal with it in the way in which you have dealt with the previous matter involving an advertisement and the Prime Minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should point out to the honourable member for Melbourne Ports that, in fact, I did not find a prima facie breach of privilege last week in the matter of the advertisement in which the letters 'PM' were used and which was raised by the Prime Minister. I was concerned on that occasion to have the Privileges Committee investigate the situation in which individual members of the Parliament could be asserted as supporting a particular product. I went beyond the basis of finding a prima facie case because I thought it would be in the interests of the Parliament to have the matter looked at otherwise, as I then said, any one of us could find ourselves unwittingly supporting a particular product. I felt that we ought to use the Privileges Committee for the purpose of examining it and recommending back to the House as to whether anything should be done about it by way of a code, a statement or something of that kind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to indicate to the honourable gentleman forthwith that there is no prima facie breach of privilege involved here. I will indicate to the honourable gentleman that I will consider the question of whether there ought to be a separate reference in the same context as the one of last week or whether, in fact, that is a matter which the honourable gentleman ought to pursue with the Privileges Committee itself. I will consider that matter and inform the honourable gentleman at a later hour. </PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That the burden of interest payments on housing loans is now at such record levels that most citizens paying off their homes are becoming severely financially distressed.</PARA>
<PARA> That the burden of additional expense together with increases in health insurance and hospital charges is putting increasing stress on family relationships.</PARA>
<PARA> That the policies of favouring overseas private investors to buy up our resources are causing inflationary pressures, declining public services and ever higher interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA> That we support all efforts to give relief to people making house repayments, particularly in the first five years of purchase, but also when expenses are higher after the first years of marriage.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Federal Government will give interest rate relief by way of tax concessions or a subsidy on mortgage repayments.</PARA>

<PARA> 1. The failure of the Federal Government to seek information from the census re disabled people-i.e. partial or total disability-to enable for adequate planning of, and for, types of services needed by disabled people to be undertaken.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. The failure of the Federal Government to lead the way in employment of disabled people by employing a greater number of such people within the Commonwealth Public Service-note the small number currently employed within the Service.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. The wastage of the Federal Government funds perpetuating large bureaucratic institutions and organisations where there are often few disabled people on their boards and little emphasis is placed on consumer participation in decision making.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. The failure of the Federal Government to encourage independence of disabled people, or to develop 'normalised' support systems-attendant care.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. The failure of the Federal Government to provide 'noninstitutionalised' specialised accommodation for those people who would not be able to benefit from, or cope with attendant care.</PARA>
<PARA> 6. Failure by the Federal Government to alter, or create a 'disability' allowance means test free for all disabled people-this would assist with necessary equipment and mobility costs.</PARA>
<PARA> 7. Failure to provide a national compensation scheme thus saving time and enabling people to be automatically covered in the event of a disability.</PARA>
<PARA> 8. Failure by the Federal Government to abolish tariffs on all equipment available to the disabled-e.g. Optacon.</PARA>
<PARA> 9. Mismanagement of Federal I.Y.D.P. Funds-e.g. non-receipt by some States of funds through unresolved negotiations.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister for Primary Industry aware of the passage through the United States Congress of the English amendment to the current Farm Bill? Is this amendment similar to the Melcher amendment that calls for a ban on imports to the United States of America of meat produced by the use of chemicals which are not in use in America? As these Bills are causing alarm to the beef industry in Australia, what is the Government doing to allay the industry's fears that meat exports will be severely affected if these Bills become law?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2468" SPEAKER="Nixon The Hon P.J." NAMEID="0N7" PARTY="NCP" ELECTORATE="GIPPSLAND" MINISTERIAL="PRIMARY INDUSTRY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0N7">Mr NIXON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A second amendment to the Farm Bill was moved by Congressman English and passed by the Congress. It is different from the Melcher amendment in that the Melcher amendment would prohibit the importation of beef which has been produced using chemicals not approved for use in the USA, whereas the English amendment refers to chemicals which are positively banned in the USA. The fact is, though, that both amendments-if either of them were carried-would cause considerable difficulties for the Australian meat industry. Representations are being made to the Congress in line with representations made previously to try to have these amendments knocked out. My colleague the Minister for Trade and Resources will be writing a letter on this matter to his counterpart in America. Of course, I had conversations on this matter both with Mr Brock, who is the United States Trade Representative, and with Mr John Block, Secretary of Agriculture, when I was in the United States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The amendments have the appearance of measures to protect consumer health. For that reason they have drawn a fair bit of support from Congress. We see them as being blatantly protectionist. The use of agricultural chemicals in Australia, as in the United States, is subject to procedures to protect health, including the establishment of safe residue standards. Australia is just as careful as any other country in respect of the use of chemicals in this way. The honourable member can rest assured that the strongest representations will be made to the United States on this matter.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Prime Minister whether it is a fact that the Government prepared a briefing paper for Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting delegates which provided a detailed, and reportedly a rather glossy, account of the condition of Australia's Aboriginal people.

Do these briefing papers for Commonwealth heads of government represent the Australian Government's considered view of the present situation of the Aboriginal people? Finally, in the interests of informed debate on a matter of great significance to many Australians, will the Prime Minister arrange to have both briefing papers tabled before the Parliament rises for the recess? Will he ensure that when tabling these documents he provides an explanation of how he justifies the extravagant claims about his Government's attention to Aboriginal welfare needs when, in fact, in real 1980-81 terms, the cumulative cuts in Aboriginal welfare expenditure since 1975 exceed $400m?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to the substance of the honourable gentleman's question in just a moment. Let me first say that I have said on other occasions in this House, and I said it to the two or three Commonwealth heads of government who raised the matter with me, that there had been a very significant history of neglect in Australia in past years but that over the last 10 years in particular and also over the last 20-odd years significant progress had been made. I had also made the point that this is not just a question of money; that it is a question of time and it is a question of people's attitudes; and that very significant resources have been made available especially over the last 10 years. I believe that this is understood because this is not the only country with problems of a similar kind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A document had been in preparation by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. It was prepared not specifically for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. It is, in fact, on sale in bookshops around Australia and was made available to Commonwealth heads of government who asked for information on this subject. I do not know how many copies might have been relayed to any of them or to members of their delegations. I will make sure that a copy of it is tabled. There are other documents that I understand were specific responses to three or four questions by Mr Mugabe and I will also make sure that the answers to those questions are tabled. I think the honourable gentleman will then see that the questions were factual ones, the responses were factual ones and that the honourable gentleman ought not be be too bemused by some reports of the nature of the questions or the nature of the answers.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable gentleman refuses to recognise that a very large part of the sums made available by the Labor Administration was totally and absolutely wasted and was not achieving any advance whatsoever for the Aboriginal people. What we have done is to provide very substantial funds over six years in areas of very real need for the Aboriginal people. If the honourable gentleman left his rhetoric behind to a certain extent and was even in part in touch with reality, he would know that the programs that have been administered under successive Ministers for Aboriginal Affairs are very much appreciated by the Aboriginal people. They recognise that the programs that we have administered have been very much to the advancement of the Aboriginal people. What hurts the Leader of the Opposition is that he knows full well that whereas the Labor Administration wasted funds, we have directed funds to the real needs of the Aboriginal people and achieved a significant advance and improvement as a result.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Melbourne Ports addressed a question to me last Thursday and I undertook to make inquiries concerning it. The information I provide to my honourable friend and to the House is as follows: On 26 February 1975 one of my predecessors, Mr Barnard, replied to a question concerning mustard gas. I table that reply. In that reply Mr Barnard referred to the 'Official War History' which devoted a full chapter to chemical warfare experiments conducted in Australia. On 15 April 1975 Mr Barnard answered another question concerning mustard gas. I table that reply. On 20 August 1975 another of my predecessors, the present honourable member for St George, Mr Morrison, answered a question concerning gas and chemical warfare experiments. I table that reply. As I said, on 22 October the honourable member for Melbourne Ports asked me a question and I undertook to make inquiries. I did that and on the same day I wrote to the honourable gentleman. Having notified his office of my intention to do so, I table a copy of the letter I wrote to him.</PARA></TALK.START>

I wish the House further to know that I have directed that any material held relating to poison gas chemical warfare experiments which took place during World War II and which has not already been placed in the National Archives should be placed there without delay. Finally, it remains for me to reaffirm the invitation extended by my two predecessors to those who were involved in those trials and who feel that they have a right to repatriation benefits to lodge their claims without delay to the appropriate authorities.</PARA>

<PARA>26 February 1975 REPRESENTATIVES</PARA>
<PARA>MUSTARD GAS</PARA>
<PARA> Mr RIORDAN: My question is direct to the Minister for Defence. There have been many reports in the media recently of allegations concerning training given to servicemen in the use of mustard gas during World War II. I ask the Minister: Will he inform the House of the nature and purpose of experiments with mustard gas? When and where were the experiments carried out? How many servicemen were involved? The second part of my question relates to chemical and biological warfare research in Australia. What research units are being used for chemical warfare purposes? What is the reason for such research? Will the Minister indicate whether chemical weapons are being produced or stockpiled in this country?</PARA>
<PARA> Mr BARNARD: In 1943 Cabinet took a decision, at the request of the Defence Committee, to establish a chemical warfare field experimental station at Proserpine in Queensland. It is quite clear that during this period mustard gas was used to train servicemen for defensive action. I understand that some 400 volunteers were used. There have been persistent reports in the media since the end of 1974 concerning this matter. The 'Official War History' published in 1958 devotes a full chapter-chapter 17-to this matter. It outlines the action and the decision of the Cabinet at that time. The Cabinet papers which were released in 1974 and the departmental papers which were made available for public scrutiny in 1973 added nothing to the information that was already available in the official war history.</PARA>
<PARA> I come now to the other point which has been raised in the media concerning the rights of those who volunteered during the period referred to. It is quite clear that this is a matter which comes under the jurisdiction of my colleague the Minister for Repatriation and Compensation. Any volunteer who was at Proserpine during that period and suffered a disability as a result of the use of mustard gas and has after-effects would have a prima facie cause to have that disability accepted as a war-caused disability under the Repatriation Act. I have asked my Department to ascertain, if it is possible to do so at this stage, the names of servicemen who volunteered at that time. It may not be possible for me to find the names of all those who took part in the experimental exercises at Proserpine between 1943 and 1945. However, repatriation records are usually most thorough. It is clear that the names of servicemen who volunteered to serve at Proserpine during this period would be clearly recorded in repatriation files. So any ex-serviceman who has been so affected should make an immediate application to the Repatriation Department. At the end of the Second World War the station was closed down and all stocks of mustard gas in Australia were destroyed.</PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the last question asked by the honourable member. Australia's obligations, both nationally and internationally, concerning chemical weapons are derived from the Geneva protocol of 1925 and the biological chemical weapons convention of 1972. These clearly outlaw the use of toxic chemical agents in war, except in retaliation, and also prohibit the production, development and stockpiling of biological weapons. As a matter of policy the Australian Government has decided, quite properly in my opinion, that the stockpiling, production or even development of chemical agents in this country is strictly prohibited. One final point in relation to this matter--</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Kelly: Do not hurry.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr BARNARD: As I have been asked by honourable members on the opposite side of the House for a full explanation on this matter following reports which have appeared in the media, I believe that they would want a comprehensive reply to the question, and they are getting it. Finally, I say to the honourable member for Phillip that we adhere strictly to the Geneva protocol and the convention of 1972 in relation to these matters.</PARA>
<PARA>15 April 1975 REPRESENTATIVES</PARA>
<PARA>MUSTARD GAS TRIALS</PARA>
<PARA> Mr FULTON: My question is directed to the Minister for Defence. Has his attention been drawn to a report alleging that 50 Australian pilots killed prisoners from an American gaol with poison gas bombs in a wartime experiment on an island off Cairns in 1944? Has the Minister investigated these allegations and, if so, what are the results?</PARA>
<PARA> Mr BARNARD: I have seen the allegations that volunteers, including prisoners, were used during mustard gas trials on a small island off the Queensland coast during the Second World War and that deaths resulted. The incident referred to is similar to one that is mentioned in the Australian official war history which was published in 1958 and concerns Brook Island which, as the honourable gentleman will know, is only 20 miles off the Australian coast and is located between Townsville and Cairns. The island referred to in the allegations is said to be 200 miles off the coast. Secondly, in the exercise to which I have just referred, Beaufort bombers were used and not B42 Liberators, as suggested in the allegations. I quote from the official war history concerning the exercise at Brook Island:</PARA>
<PARA> Over four tons of mustard gas were dropped from Beaufort aircraft on a small tropical rain-forest island off the north Queensland coast. The island had been prepared with gas defences, sampling apparatus to measure gas vapour concentrations and animals for physiological investigations. Volunteers clad in various kinds of British, American and Japanese and experimental impregnated and impervious clothing were landed immediately: jungle-trained Australian troops with the minimum of protection carried out manoeuvres for several hours over the contaminated territory.</PARA>
<PARA> The accounts of the Brook Island trials differ in several important details from the allegations that have been made. First, there is no mention of substantial American participation: No personnel were on the island when the bombs were dropped. The volunteers were drawn from scientific staff and Australian troops. Although severe injuries are acknowledged, no indication is given of deaths resulting from the trials, and the mustard gas used was not expected to cause death.</PARA>
<PARA> A search of the official Royal Australian Air Force and United States Air Force histories, and of Royal Australian Air Force operational records, as well as questioning of the scientific staff present during Brook Island trials, do not confirm the allegations that Australia was involved in a trial in which prisoners from American gaols were subjected to mustard gas bombing. May I say, in relation to the exercise on Brook Island, that the same situation would apply as to the one raised with me some time ago in relation to the gas trials at Proserpine in north Queensland. If any volunteer who participated in the exercise involving Brook Island is suffering from the after-effects of mustard gas, he would have a clear case to have that disability accepted as a war-caused disability under the Repatriation Act, and it should be referred immediately to my colleague, the Minister for Repatriation and Compensation. Finally, I have asked that additional inquiries be made through the United States authorities to determine whether any information available from that source would either confirm or refute the allegations that have been made.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6M7">Mr Morrison</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. A report on the activities of the Chemical Defence Board is given in Chapter 17 of 'The Role of Science and Industry-Australia in the War of 1939-45' by D. P. Mellor. Attention is also drawn to the answers given by my predecessor in the House of 26 February and 15 April this year to related questions.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Locations of trials were Townsville, Singleton, Forbes, Grafton, Innisfail, Tully, Cairns, Humpty-Doo, Darwin, Port Wakefield.</PARA>
<PARA> Trials took place at various times in 1943, 1944 and 1945. It is not known for how long individual servicemen took part in the trials.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Total not known, but it appears that at least 400 volunteers participated in trials.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) According to the records only two men who took part in the trials are known to have come from a Wollongong unit-the 34th Battalion.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) It is assumed that they did act as volunteers since the records examined show no evidence to the contrary.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) The records examined showed no evidence of their having done so for these experiments but it is expected that those volunteering would have been required to give undertakings not to divulge information to which they might obtain access. This procedure would conform to the normal and necessary Defence practice of holding individuals responsible for protecting information, the release of which would be prejudicial to national security. The requirement for those concerned in the chemical warfare trials to give security undertakings would have been no different from similar requirements in many other operations affecting national security.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) The term 'guinea pig' does not appear in any Departmental (including Service) records that have been examined, except when referring to the rodent of that name. However, the term is used by the author of the official War History (reference in (1) above on page 378) as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> 'When Gorrill moved to Townsville the physiologists became their own guinea pigs . . .'.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) No. It is understood, however, that all volunteers who participated in gas warfare trials were awarded commendation cards in recognition of their loyal and unselfish services. The Department of Repatriation and Compensation considers all cases impartially. Like my predecessor, I invite all who believe they are suffering from any disabilities resulting from chemical warfare trials, and have not already done so, to make applications to the relevant Deputy Commissioner for Repatriation in the State or Territory in which they live.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) Not known.</PARA>
<PARA> (10) Probably.</PARA>
<PARA>Minister for Defence Parliament House Canberra ACT 2600 22 October 1981 Dear Mr Holding,</PARA>
<PARA> I am responding to your question of this morning concerning the exposure of volunteers to mustard gas during World War Two.</PARA>
<PARA> A comprehensive account of these tests is given in Australia's Official War History 'The Roles of Science and Industry-Australia in the War of 1939-45' by J. P. Mellor. I am attaching a copy of relevant pages (Attachment A).</PARA>
<PARA> In 1975, my predecessor, the Honourable Lance Barnard answered two questions on this topic, and his responses (Attachments B and C) give further information. You will note that Attachment B lists the locations at which these tests were conducted. Attachment C indicates that U.S. personnel were involved only peripherally, and I am advised that there is no evidence that the U.S. ever conducted tests of this kind on Australian soil.</PARA>
<PARA> There is also an Army training film (AC241) 'The Symptoms of Blister Agent H (Mustard Gas)'. This film, which up to now has not been released outside of the Defence Force, is at present being made available to the media.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, on 28 May 1979 I personally answered a question on the storage of mustard gas containers in tunnels in New South Wales. This matter is only secondary to your interests, but I am attaching my reply for completeness (Attachment D).</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister for Health to the collapse last year of the Druids Hospital and Medical Benefits Fund and the financial hardship it has caused to many Tasmanian families. Is it true that those people who were insured with Druids and were treated at public hospitals have had their outstanding accounts written off, the write-off being financed jointly by the State and Commonwealth governments? Is it also true, however, that no similar action has been taken to provide relief to those unfortunate people who were also insured with the Druids fund and who were treated at private hospitals? If these assertions are correct, how does the Minister justify assisting one group and not the other when all are equally innocent victims of the mismanagement of a health fund registered under the Commonwealth Health Insurance Act?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="014">Mr MacKELLAR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a fact that people who were insured with Druids and were treated at public hospitals have had their outstanding accounts written off with the co-operation-I wish to acknowledge that co-operation-of the State Health Ministers from Victoria and Tasmania. But, as I announced in the Press in April last year in respect of outstanding accounts in relation to private hospitals, it was not legally possible for the Government to assist contributors with outstanding claims other than to pay the Commonwealth bed subsidy in the normal manner. As the House will understand, the present position is that the scheme administrator, who has been appointed by the Federal Court, is examining all claims following his advertisements calling for proof of debts. Once those claims have been received and the examination has been completed he will disburse the moneys available to the funds in relation to the prospective claimants in accordance with the order of priority which has been approved by the court.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact that a lot of claims from the public hospitals have been written off obviously means that more money is available within the organisation to be paid towards outstanding claims with private hospitals. A senatorial colleague of the honourable gentleman has been to see me in relation to the matter. I have asked him to supply me, if he can, with the names of individuals who have outstanding accounts with private hospitals. It may be that the respective private hospitals will look at these individual claims and make their own individual decisions as to whether any of those amounts can be written off. That is for the hospitals to make up their minds about. In relation to the legal position of the Commonwealth we have acted to ensure that as much money as possible is available for disbursement as I have set out.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment aware that the cutback of $20,000 in general grant funding from the Australia Council's Theatre Board to La Boite Theatre, Brisbane, has jeopardised the continued survival of the theatre through endangering the main house theatre, adult theatre workshop, youth theatre activities and the professional core of the theatre? Is it a fact that in April this year La Boite received congratulations from the Theatre Board on its submission for funding renewals in 1982 and that the characteristic of Theatre Board general grants is that they are used for recurrent expenditure?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0K4">Mr WILSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It should be pointed out that the Government has made available this year $29.3m to the Australia Council. It is for the Australia Council, subject to the decision of the Government with regard to the Australian Opera, the Australian Ballet and the Elizabethan Theatre Trust orchestras, to determine the allocation of the funds that are made to it. The Australia Council was established to provide advice to the Government and to make distributions of funds made available to it to various artistic endeavours. The Australia Council itself determines the allocation of its funds as between its boards. It made the decision to allocate the funds that were available to the Theatre Board. Its role is to determine priorities; that is one of the purposes for which it has been established.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On this occasion the allocations to the Theatre Board having been determined, that board decided to continue the support of certain theatres whilst indicating that it would not be able to make provision for assistance to a number of theatres this year. That is not to say that those theatres do not play an important part but there are other sources of funding that all theatres can look to. The matter of determination of priorities is for the Theatre Board itself. It has made those decisions. I hope that as a result of the careful determination of priorities and the incentive grants system it is adopting there will be an expanded community support of activity within the theatre area whereby the Commonwealth's substantial assistance will continue to play a significant role.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5E4">Mr SINCLAIR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no doubt that the introduction of the Australian domestic satellite will facilitate communications throughout Australia. It will be particularly helpful to those who are in remote and isolated areas of this continent where the non-availability of translators and other transmitters means that television is at the moment not available. Of course, with the introduction of the domestic satellite, through the availability of the Homestead and Community Broadcasting Satellite Service it will be possible for each individual to erect his own earth station and to receive everything that is on that domestic satellite. Tenders have, of course, now closed for the main construction of the satellite and are being appraised by the Overseas Telecommunications Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government is anxious that the private sector should be involved in the appraisal of those tenders and it is hoped to form within the next couple of weeks a proprietary company called Aussat Pty Ltd which will be a company owned wholly by the Commonwealth, having on its board a number of private citizens to try to ensure that there is a private sector overview of the tender appraisal until such stage as the public company eventually to own the domestic satellite can be established and listed on Australian stock exchanges. This week the Government has invited Mr Ernest Stanley Owens, C.B.E. to accept appointment as chairman of Aussat Pty Ltd. Mr Owens is a leading Sydney businessman who is, of course, chairman of Enterprise Australia and, I think, known to most members of this House. I believe he will be very well suited to the purpose of sitting in disparate judgment over those who will also represent the private sector but who will have a particular interest in the use of that satellite. All in all, informatics, which is the marriage of communications to computers, does seem to be advancing fairly successfully in Australia. It is very much in the mind of the Government that, in doing so, it should make its services available to all Australians. We believe that, by advancing in conjunction with the private sector, as we are in the appraisal off the tenders for the domestic satellite, this is being achieved in the most efficient way.</PARA>

Indeed, I received a communication from my colleague and honourable friend, the Minister for Defence, only in the last day or two suggesting that we should ensure that every effort is made to meet our timetables. Discussions will take place to ensure that that does occur. As a result of all the detailed planning that has been undertaken and the co-ordinating efforts under the guidance of the Department of Defence and the Department of Transport, I am sure that there will be a minimum of disruption in the course of the relocation of those civil aviation facilities at the Darwin Airport.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister for Communications to the recent market research study carried out by W. D. Scott &amp; Co.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no doubt that in recent years increasing pressures have been placed on the maintenance of the telegram system. I know the honourable member for Fadden has put forward a few suggestions in this House as to ways by which we might be able to alter the economics of the present system. Members from both sides have made representations to me and to Australia Post about the way in which this service can be provided. W. D. Scott was appointed by Australia Post, I think, not Telecom, to look into the operations of the telegrams system and to see to what degree it could be extended and to what degree there might be modifications to the present system to ensure its maintenance. I can assure the honourable gentleman that it is the Government's wish that a system of telegraphic communication in the form of telegrams be preserved and that it be provided at the most economic rate that the charges of those two statutory authorities, Telecom and Australia Post, will permit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I know that the number of telegrams dispatched in Australia has been very significantly reduced. Consequently, the cost of maintaining the service is becoming a significant charge to the authority responsible. The report by W. D. Scott is a basis from which forward decisions are to be taken. I will look at the suggestion of the honourable gentleman that the report be tabled in this House. Provided there are no difficulties in it, which I do not foresee, I hope that that will be possible. I point out that the report is not to the Government; it is to the statutory authority, and I have not yet seen it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs aware that in the last three years over two-thirds of the total number of refugees admitted into Australia came from Indo-China, mostly from Vietnam? Can the Minister explain whether the criteria by which refugees are admitted into Australia are discriminatory in that they operate in favour of people from particular countries and against people from regions such as the Middle East and Latin America? If no policy of discrimination applies, will the Minister act to achieve a more balanced program by making efforts to assist persons from the Middle East and Latin America who are seeking entry as refugees?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a fact that the intake over the last few years has been principally from Indo-China. That is for a number of reasons which I have mentioned before in the House. Firstly, that is the area from which the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has asked us to take people. Secondly, we have an acknowledged geopolitical interest in the area, we are part of the area and we have an obligation to take people from the area. We have not had many requests to take refugees from other parts of the world except from Eastern Europe. I have discussed with the honourable member the possibility of taking more refugees from South America, and we have indicated to the United Nations High Commissioner that we are prepared to do that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I point out that the difficulty which the honourable member always seems to have is that a refugee must be outside his or her country when making the application. Many of the people about whom the honourable member is most concerned are in his view-I do not dispute it in many cases-victims of a tyrannical government in their own countries. They need to get to a third country to be accepted by the UNHCR and classified as refugees before they are eligible for resettlement under a resettlement policy, whether it is that of our country, the United States or any other resettlement country.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During November I will be meeting all the State Ministers responsible for roads and they will have before them a report that has been prepared by the roads group of the Australian Transport Advisory Council. Of course, the distribution of funds between the States will be a matter for discussion at that meeting, and following that meeting I will report back to the Government. Last year the Government announced a five-year program for expenditure on roads. We increased the guaranteed funding period from three years to five years and guaranteed $3,650m to the States and local government over that period. A number of representations and complaints have been received from local government that the estimated increases for which we have allowed in the program will not cover the actual cost of road construction. Last year I asked the Bureau of Transport Economics to undertake a survey of the road construction index. I expect to receive a report from the BTE at the end of the year. When it has received that report the Government will be in a better position to make a real assessment of the road funding program that was announced last year.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-In the knowledge that debate on this matter will probably be resumed later this week I simply make straight comments without embellishment at this stage and reserve my other comments until later this week. However, the report which I have just presented to the House relates to an article by Mr L. Oakes and a printed reference to that article which were published in the Sydney Daily Mirror of 2 September 1981. The printed reference on the front page of the first edition of that newspaper was headed 'MP's BLUDGERS, DRUNKS!' and the heading to the article itself on page 9 of all editions used the words 'Bludgers on the backbench'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee has found unanimously:</PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, that the printed reference on page one of the first edition and the article on page 9 of all editions of the Daily Mirror of 2 September 1981 constitute a contempt of the House of Representatives by the author, editor and publisher. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, that having considered the reference and the article, the Committee is of the view that the article and its presentation are irresponsible and reflect no credit on its author, the editor or the publisher. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, that while finding a contempt of the House of Representatives has been committed, the Committee is of the opinion that the matter is not worthy of occupying the further time of the House. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's report goes on to deal in some detail with additional matters relating to the conduct of this inquiry and to broader issues involved in Parliamentary privilege generally. The Committee has strongly recommended the establishment of a joint select committee to inquire into all aspects of Parliamentary privilege as it relates to the Australian Parliament. In doing so, the Committee's report has highlighted some areas which it believes should be investigated by the proposed joint select committee. It further recommends that in the event of the Senate's concurrence in the establishment of the joint select committee not having been received within a reasonable period, the House of Representatives should proceed immediately to set up a select committee of its own members to carry out the proposed inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> As I stated in presenting the document, the report is accompanied by three dissenting reports. These reports do not dissent from the Committee's finding and recommendation in respect of the Daily Mirror inquiry. In the first dissenting report, that of the honourable member for Holt (Mr Duffy) and the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), and in the second by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding), the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi) and the honourable member for Phillip (Mr Birney), comment is made on the broader issues involved in dealing with privilege matters. The third dissenting report is by the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) in which he has raised objection to the Committee's decision to publish the evidence received during this inquiry. The Committee's report and the three dissenting reports raise issues of considerable substance for consideration by the House.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation, I present the Report of the Committee on Environmental Protection-Adequacy of legislative and administrative arrangements (2nd report), incorporating a dissenting report, together with extracts from the minutes of proceedings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Ordered that the report be printed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TE7">Mr HODGES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The report that has just been tabled is the second report on the Committee's reference on the adequacy of legislative and administrative arrangements relating to environmental protection and is the nineteenth report of the Committee since its establishment in 1973. The first report dealt with the impact of proposals and heritage legislation. This report covers the operation of the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act. In addition it dicusses the role of the Commonwealth in the Northern Territory and the need for reports on the state of the Australian environment. From the outset I emphasise that, while the report contains a dissent by Opposition members, the Committee unanimously endorses the need for a strong Commonwealth national parks service and the need for immediate measures to be taken to protect the Great Barrier Reef. I will leave it to my Opposition colleagues to advise the House of areas of disagreement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I now turn to the Committee's discussion of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service. The Committee believes that there is a major role for the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service to play in the development of national policies, co-ordination of State activities, and research and investigations which have national implications. In addition, the Committee strongly supports the use of the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act for nature conservation purposes in areas for which the Commonwealth has responsibility. The Committee found that the States are competent to manage parks and wildlife but that the Commonwealth must retain powers which would enable it to declare parks and reserves in the States if declaration of such areas is considered to be in the national interest. We believe that the Commonwealth Government should have access to independent policy advice relating to nature conservation matters and we support the continuation of a strong independent Commonwealth conservation authority, namely the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service, responsible through the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment to the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> In the course of the inquiry the Committee sought the views of the States on the role of the Commonwealth service. Most of the States were critical of some aspects of its operations and of the legislation. Of major concern were those sections of the legislation which allow the establishment of Commonwealth parks in the States. The Victorian Government, for instance, asserted that the Commonwealth has no powers to make laws with respect to nature conservation in the States, although the Committee received a legal opinion which provides contrary advice. Despite the criticism of some of the States it is apparent that the national parks service has been of assistance in park and wildlife management within the States. The Committee concluded that there was no need to amend legislation in this respect but clearly there is a need for formalised arrangements to be agreed to between the national parks service and its State counterparts. </PARA>
<PARA> Administrative arrangements have been agreed to between the Commonwealth and the States relating to environmental assessment and the Committee has recommended that similar arrangements be agreed to relating to nature conservation matters. The Western Australian Government was particularly concerned with section 18 of the Act, which relates to Aboriginal land. The Committee agrees that section 18 may cause conflict between the Commonwealth and the States, but does not support a repeal of the section. We have recommended that it be amended to require consultation before the section is invoked. The Commonwealth owns and administers considerable land in the States, much of which is of scenic and scientific interest. A considerable amount of this land is administered by the Department of Transport for navigation purposes. At present this land is not protected by either Commonwealth or State nature conservation legislation. We believe the most effective way to protect significant areas would be to declare them as conservation zones under the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act. Where Commonwealth officers are in residence we have recommended that these officers be provided with the necessary powers under the Act to perform the duties of rangers. Where no Commonwealth personnel are present we have recommended that the States be requested to provide staff to manage these areas. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Committee's discussion in the report concentrated on land administered by the Department of Transport, the Committee believes that its conclusions and recommendations should be applied to all land including defence land of nature conservation value which is owned by the Commonwealth. In the report of the House of Representatives Select Committee on Wildlife and Conservation and the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation on trafficking in fauna, comment was made that varying provisions of State and Territory legislation make a standardised approach to nature conservation in Australia difficult. In our report we have noted with concern the multiplicity of Commonwealth legislation relating to nature conservation and have recommended that the Government examine the feasibility of standardising legislation relating to nature conservation under the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act which is clearly allowed for under the present legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> We note that the Review of Commonwealth Functions stated that the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service is to maintain control of marine parks. At present the only Commonwealth marine park is the Great Barrier Reef. We have recommended that the Commonwealth Government consult with relevant State and Territory governments with a view to establishing as marine parks those areas considered of national importance. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act. The original Act passed in 1975 provided for the marine park to extend into the Torres Strait region. Because of the uncertainty of the border between Papua New Guinea and Australia the Torres Strait area was excluded in a subsequent amendment. We believe that now that the border has been agreed to the park should extend into the Torres Strait and we have recommended that the Australian Government negotiate appropriate measures with the Papua New Guinea Government. </PARA>
<PARA> In our report we noted the many occasions on which the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and other Ministers have expressed their commitment to the protection and preservation of the Great Barrier Reef. We believe that drilling for oil should be prohibited in the region and note that, once an area has been declared under the Act, section 38 provides that no operations for the recovery of minerals shall be carried out in these areas. We considered the desirability of the whole area being declared immediately but the majority of the Committee believes that a prohibition of mining activities, such as the extraction of gravel deposits, for approximately 80 per cent of the eastern Queensland coast would be unreasonable and not justified. Many of these activities would have little or no effect on the reef. </PARA>
<PARA> We examined a series of options which would provide protection to the reef from oil drilling but would allow reasonable operations for the recovery of minerals to occur on the Queensland coast. We decided upon immediate declaration of the whole region, with the exclusion of a narrow strip from low water mark on the Queensland mainland, except where there exist good reasons for the park to extend to the coast. The exclusion would have to be acompanied by an unconditional guarantee that no oil drilling or any other activity likely to damage the reef would be allowed within that strip. While the Committee believes that it would be unreasonable to declare the whole region as a marine park there will be many areas within the region where it is essential for the park to extend to low water mark. Under no circumstances should the Commonwealth Government enter into any agreement with the Queensland Government which would preclude such areas being declared. </PARA>
<PARA> I next turn to the Commonwealth's involvement in the Northern Territory. I should state at the beginning the Committee did not examine the question of uranium mining. When the Committee tabled its first report, evidence had not been received from the Northern Territory Government and accordingly its recommendations related to the States only. We note that the Northern Territory Government intends soon to introduce its own environmental legislation and is proceeding with the development of heritage legislation. With the introduction of complementary Territory legislation we see no reason why the Territory should not be treated in the same manner as the States and we have recommended that those recommendations contained in the Committee's first report relating to the States should be read to include the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> Uluru National Park and Kakadu National Park are Commonwealth parks declared under the Commonwealth National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act. The Territory Government advised that it believes that the Act be amended to provide for Territory administration of these two areas. We found that the problem associated with the management responsibilities for Uluru National Park have not improved since the Committee tabled its report on the Management of Ayers Rock-Mount Olga National Park in 1977. The majority of the Committee believes that the only way of overcoming the problem would be to define clearly the respective roles of the Commonwealth and Territory authorities in respect of the park's management. </PARA>
<PARA> We have recommended that a memorandum of understanding be agreed to between the Commonwealth Government and the Northern Territory Government which would delegate the management responsibilities of the Director of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service to the Chairman of the Northern Territory Conservation Commission and that the Commonwealth Government provide funds on an annual basis for capital works and running expenses to be spent at the discretion of the Northern Territory Government. We considered Kakadu to be of a different nature. Arrangements for the proclamation and management of Kakadu National Park arose from the recommendations of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry. We noted the obvious conflict between the Commonwealth and Northern Territory governments concerning the roles of each government in the park's management, but concluded that no changes should be made until the plan of management is reviewed in five years time. </PARA>
<PARA> The Northern Territory Government provided the Committee with examples of the existence of sound working relationships between the Northern Territory Conservation Commission and Aboriginal groups. Nevertheless, the Northern Land Council advised that it has not yet had time to assess the strength of the Commission's commitment to Aboriginal rights and would not support at this time any changes in the administrative arrangements. For the administrative arrangements to be changed it would require renegotiation of agreements reached between the Commonwealth and Aboriginals and we do not support this at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Committee's report discusses the availability of environmental data and the need for reporting on the state of the Australian Environment. In order properly, efficiently and effectively to protect the environment, data must be available to the decision makers. Environmental data is available from a variety of sources but on a largely unco-ordinated basis. Both the United Nations and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development have recently launched studies aimed at finding out how much environmental information is available in their member countries. A major conclusion of the Australian response to a United Nations questionnaire was that statistics relating to the state of the Australian environment were not systematically collected, collated or disseminated at the national level. A study conducted by the OECD shows that Australia lags behind most other OECD countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The problems associated with lack of or accessibility of environmental data have been noted by the Committee in many of its inquiries. The Australian Environmental Statistics Project is attempting, at the national level, to overcome these problems. The end result of the project will be to produce a statistically based state of the environment report. Although there were objections to the project in some quarters the Committee supports the project's continuation and has recommended that it be allocated the necessary resources to enable its completion. It is apparent that the study will concentrate on the collection of statistics related to the physical or natural environment. Whilst it is important to be aware of the impact of man on the natural environment, it is equally important to be able to determine the effect on man, particularly human health, of changes in the natural environment. The Committee has recommended that the project be expanded to include social, particularly human health, statistics. The Committee concluded that the statistical report is potentially the most significant environmental document yet to be produced in Australia because it is not project specific and can be applied to the whole range of environmental issues. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee noted that the report will contain no commentary. The United States Council of Environmental Quality produces an extensive report which contains many hundreds of pages of commentary. The Committee believes that a similar report should be produced in Australia and has recommended accordingly. With the production of these two reports the Committee believes that the present low level of environmental debate will be raised considerably. We note with concern that, in comparison with the majority of countries in the OECD, availability of national environmental data is poor. Every effort should be made to overcome these shortcomings to ensure that Australia is recognised as a responsible member of the international community in the area of environment and conservation. Finally, I would like to thank the members of the Committee for the time and effort they devoted to this inquiry. Additionally, I wish to thank John Cummins, the clerk to the Committee, and the Committee's staff. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>
<PARA> Motion (by Mr Sinclair) proposed:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Broadly speaking, this report is a very reasonable document. I also thank the members of the Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation and the Committee's staff for their work in its preparation. Despite some dissent, much of the report has received unanimous agreement. The Committee specifically and unanimously criticised the razor gang's decisions concerning national parks, which were made before this report was tabled. In fact, the report specifically states that management arrangements for Kakadu should not be changed. It criticises the total lack of co-operation from the Queensland Government in the Committee's inquiry into the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act. The Committee unanimously also recommends the immediate declaration of the Great Barrier Reef as a marine park and recommends continued Commomwealth involvement in national parks and wildlife activities in Australia. The Committee's report further recommends that environmental statistics be collected at a national level and that a statistical report of the state of the Australian environment be prepared annually and tabled in Parliament as well as that comprehensive state of the environment reports be prepared and tabled at regular intervals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I regret that in some other areas the Opposition must differ with the Government. The first point concerns the reference to Commonwealth involvement in national parks through the National Parks and Wildlife Service. The report states that the Committee does not accept the argument that there is no role for the Service to play in the States but because of its status as a national organisation the National Parks and Wildlife Service is in a position to provide advice and technical assistance which otherwise would be unavailable to a nature conservation authority. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee agrees with the view of the South Australian Government officials that the establishment of the ANPWS has enabled activities to be undertaken that are of benefit to all States and Territories. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say further in its conclusions:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee believes that the States are competent in managing parks and wildlife. While in general not supporting a parallel system of Commonwealth parks in the States, the Committee acknowledges that the Commonwealth must be able to use its powers to declare parks and reserves in the States if declaration of such areas is considered to be in the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA>I also draw the attention of the House to section 163 of the report, which is critical of the Review of Commonwealth Functions bringing forward a proposal progressively to hand over control of Uluru and Kakadu in the Northern Territory before the Committee's report had been tabled. The Committee is quite specific. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> It is unfortunate that the Government made its decisions relating to park management in the Northern Territory before this Report was available. The Committee's inquiry covered many of the matters included in the review and while the Government was aware of the inquiry no approach was made seeking the Committee's views. This report would have been of great assistance to the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>We oppose the intention to downgrade the National Parks and Wildlife Service. I draw the attention of the House to the Dissent in which it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Report itself does not address fully the concept of Commonwealth involvement in . . . areas of national and international significance. The term 'national park' is used throughout Australia to designate areas protected under Commonwealth, State or Territory conservation legislation. Apart from Uluru, Kakadu, the Great Barrier Reef and a park on Christmas Island, all are administered by State or Territory Governments. </PARA>
<PARA> . . . We firmly believe that some areas of national and international significance should be administered by the Commonwealth as truly 'National' national parks under Commonwealth legislation. A distinct advantage of such a system would be recognition of the national status of these areas. Areas so declared would be likely to receive more appropriate resources, and to be administered and protected in the national interest . . . We would envisage only a small number of these parks, but that as a group they would represent outstanding areas of Australia's national heritage. </PARA>
<PARA>Our intention in government regarding some of these areas of national significance, such as Uluru, Kakadu, the Great Barrier Reef and perhaps South-West Tasmania would be to retain control of Uluru and Kakadu in the Northern Territory and to seek full co-operation from State governments regarding parks within their borders. If an area of enormous environmental significance were in danger of despoilation, through the preparation of environmental impact statements, through public inquiries under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act and eventually by using constitutional means to enforce those recommendations-which even this Fraser Government has done in the case of Fraser Island-we would assert that these areas need to be protected and assert the need for a national declaration of the areas as a truly 'national' national park. I direct the attention of the House to paragraph 33 of the report which records the Attorney-General's Department's advice to the committee regarding the constitutional powers in this regard. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Constitution by creating the Commonwealth as a nation state implies in it the power to do those things which are incidental to its status and to the exercise of functions of a national government . . . are appropriate to be established by the Commonwealth Government having regard to its status as a national government. </PARA>
<PARA>So there is no question about our power to do this according to the advice provided by the Attorney-General's Department to this Committee. I wish also to place on record our dissent, as outlined, with the agreement indicated in the report with the Western Australian view that section 18 of the National Parks and Wildlife Act needs to be amended to provide for further consultation with the States before the Commonwealth, through the National Parks and Wildlife Service, can confer with Aboriginals about assistance and advice to those groups that are in control of Aboriginal lands in the States regarding environmental matters. I think the Western Australian attack on section 18, which after all is subject to veto anyway by a State Minister, as the dissenting report simply points out, is in line with the Western Australian Government's firm refusal to endorse Aboriginal land rights in any shape or form in Western Australia. It does not believe that there should be any Aboriginal land rights or access to land at all, let alone that there should be any consultation with Aboriginals and Aboriginal groups who may be in practical control of Aboriginal land in Western Australia. It is significant to note that Western Australia was the only State that placed with the Committee any objection with regard to the operation of section 18 of the National Parks and Wildlife Act. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw the attention of the House to the dissent that we expressed with regard to the handing over of Uluru-Ayers Rock National Park to the control of the Northern Territory Government. We set out the reasons for our dissent quite plainly. It is a recommendation of the Committee that a memorandum of understanding be agreed to between the Commonwealth Government and the Northern Territory Government which would delegate management responsibility of the Director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service for the Uluru park to the Chairman of the Northern Territory Conservation Commission. We cannot accept this recommendation in any shape or form and draw attention to the fact that it is in direct contradiction of what is proposed for the Kakadu National Park, where the report says there should not be any change. It is difficult to understand why there should be any difference between our approach to Uluru and its approach to Kakadu. On the one hand, the report says that Uluru should be handed over to the Northern Territory to administer. On the other hand, the report draws attention to the extreme national importance of the Kakadu park and suggests that it should be kept under Commonwealth control. </PARA>
<PARA> The World Heritage Committee, a committee of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation, in Sydney only yesterday included the Kakadu National Park and the Great Barrier Reef in the World Heritage List and expressed the need, if possible, for a buffer zone to exist around such a park as Kakadu. The point to make here is that the Koongarra uranium mine is an enclave within the Kakadu National Park under the policies of this Government. The Ranger area has been excluded from stage one of the Kakadu National Park and is thus in an area round the park which might be regarded by the World Heritage Committee as a buffer zone. Jabiluka will be excluded, if this Government has its way, from stage two of the Kakadu National Park, because Jabiluka contains a 200,000-tonne body of uranium ore. I repeat, the World Heritage Committee, a committee of UNESCO, has now added Kakadu to the World Heritage List but has said that there should be a buffer zone around it. In effect it is saying that uranium mining should not take place within that buffer zone. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude my remarks in support of the report and the dissenting report that we so carefully prepared by drawing the attention of the House again to the section regarding the Great Barrier Reef. The report says that the whole area should be declared a marine park now. But it then says that we should allow an area 5 kilometres eastwards of the coast to remain in the hands of the Queensland Government and thus subject to the power that it will have over it which is derived from the Coastal Waters (State Powers) Act, which is itself an integral part of the historic sell-out package of off-shore legislation by which this Government handed control, difficult as it was to win through the Connor legislation as validated by the High Court, back to the States. We give a resounding 'no' to that because we do not trust the Queensland Government to have control of the whole of the Queensland coast adjacent to the reef, for five kilometres out to sea. Accordingly we have dissented. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a resolution passed the other day in Christchurch by the Fifteenth General Assembly of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, as a prelude to the decision of the World Heritage Committee in Sydney yesterday. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable members will see in Hansard the two vital sections of the resolution, which notes that the Australian Government has retained the option to allow oil exploration and exploitation in proximity to the Barrier Reef. It expresses concern that in the six years of operation of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act only 2.4 per cent of the reef region has so far been declared a marine park. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) said yesterday to the World Heritage Committee in Sydney that it was not a matter of if but when the Barrier Reef would be declared a marine park. We ask him where it will be declared, how far, and over what area. We cannot accept the report's recommendation that the Queensland Government be allowed to control the coast for five kilometres out to sea, to permit oil drilling, and then if a blowout occurs perhaps place thousands of square kilometres of the reef at risk, as has occurred in other parts of the world when delicate ecosystems have been subject to oil blowouts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I conclude by stating the points we make in the dissent. It is absurd to allow the Queensland Government to control this five-kilometre area. The Queensland Government has opposed declaration of the Cairns section of the Barrier Reef Marine Park and has consistently supported oil exploration. The Ministerial Council is merely a means of formalising delays and obstructing the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, which is the proper body under the Act to make recommendations-direct to the Government, not the Ministerial Council. We further deplore the Federal Government's amendment to the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act which will allow oil drilling within 30 miles of the Reef, in the Coral Sea. It is not good enough for the Prime Minister to tell the UNESCO World Heritage Committee in Sydney that it is not a matter of if the Great Barrier Reef is declared a marine park, but when. As I have said we want to know where, and over what area. Will it be the low water mark?</PARA>
<PARA> The Council took 13 months to carry out the former Minister's pledge that the Cairns section would be declared before last Christmas and then it declared less than .01 per cent of the proposed section. I am afraid that the Federal Government talks 'doublespeak' on the Barrier Reef. It tells the United Nations that it will protect the reef and wants it on the World Heritage list. Then it refuses to call the Queensland Premier's bluff and declare the reef to the low water mark. The Government also amends the Petroleum and Submerged Lands Act to allow oil drilling on the eastern side of the reef. This is pure misrepresentation. We applaud the decision made yesterday to include the whole of the reef on the World Heritage list, but we now call on the Fraser Government to treat this region with the importance that the whole world, the Heritage Committee, and the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation believe it deserves.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, I expect that the Standing Committee will present many worthwhile and supportable reports, as it has in this case. I conclude by congratulating the staff and all members of the Committee. It is the first report in which I have been involved since I became the shadow Minister that has been tabled in this way in the House. Perhaps I should offer my appreciation to the Minister and even to the Government for allowing this report to be tabled and debated in the last sitting week of Parliament, thus giving all members of the Committee who wish to put forward their views an opportunity to do so.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation has operated since 1973. It would be acknowledged that, as far as Australia is concerned, environmental legislation that has any substance has occurred only since 1973, and a lot of it has been shaped on overseas experience. I think the Standing Committee has an obligation to carry out examinations of how that environmental legislation is operating. Essentially I will speak to the dissent in the report on environmental protection. In speaking to the dissent, I would not want that to hide the considerable degree of consensus amongst the members of the Committee. Those who read the report will see this. One must acknowledge the role in the discussion of those who presented what one could call the majority report. They have been keen in discussion. They have tried to reach a consensus, to agree, and to find as much common ground as possible. However, there are these few areas where it was obvious a consensus could not be reached.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first of these is in the concept of a national park. I think it is unfortunate that this terminology is used. In many States there are national parks which are merely recreation reserves. I am not knocking recreation reserves, but national parks should be those of a truly national character. The United States of America tackled this problem in the latter part of the last century, when the Federal Government took over responsibility for national parks and the States had their own State park systems. They were clearly defined. I passionately believe, and have believed for many years, that this Parliament should concern itself with a few areas of overwhelming national and international significance. I believe that those areas should be under the control of the Parliament and of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose it is unfortunate that two of these areas happen to be in the Northern Territory, where there is great sensitivity about control. I understand that. But I believe that the Uluru National Park and the Kakadu National Park are of world significance and that the National Parks and Wildlife Service should have control of them. That Service need not necessarily be a large body but it should be a very expert and technically trained one that takes responsibility for these parks and may share their management with State or Territory authorities, but will not lose control. My colleague the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West) mentioned other areas. I believe the Great Barrier Reef is one of those. I suspect there may be some argument in the near future over South West Tasmania, which I believe is of international significance. </PARA>
<PARA> There are probably arguments for an alpine national park which would straddle the Victoria-New South Wales border. I suspect that some wetland area should be preserved in the same way. Probably six areas would form parks of national and international significance for control by the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service. As I said, I am not suggesting a complete cutting out of co-operation with State and Territorial services but there is no doubt that national parks should be preserved in the national interest and not be subjected to the sorts of local and State pressures that may occur, particularly when timber or minerals are involved. The attraction of a national area for the economics of a State may not necessarily protect it. There is a corollary in that Roosevelt during World War II would not allow some of the giant redwoods in a national park on the west coast of America to be harvested for timber during war time when there was a great need for that resource. He recognised their national and international significance. We need to take this sort of attitude. </PARA>
<PARA> Another point of dissent related to the Western Australian Government's complaint about the intrusion of the Commonwealth into certain areas under section 18 of the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act. It was the only State that put forward this submission. Protection exists for State interests. The State Ministers for Aboriginal Affairs must agree to such measures before the Director of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service can carry out management on State land. I believe that gives them protection. Just as the States distrust us in some areas, I think we are entitled to distrust the States in some areas. My colleague has dealt substantially with the Great Barrier Reef. To illustrate my point of view on this matter I will quote briefly from paragraph 15 of the dissenting report. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> While any portion of the reef region is not protected as a marine park then all of the reef is at risk. The reef ecosystem does not end arbitrarily at the edge of the 5 kilometre territorial sea but extends to the shoreline and is influenced greatly by coastal land use, water runoff and other factors. </PARA>
<PARA>These are the sorts of things we have to watch, not just oil drilling. We have to watch measures even more simple than that. At a coastal resort in Fiji just a fortnight ago an artificial island was constructed out from the shoreline. It has had a disastrous effect on the neighbouring reef because of the effect on current flow. We may well find that the dangers to the reef, if we allow this part of the coastline to be excluded, may not only be the great dangers of oil drilling and blow-out but also simple measures, such as the one to which I referred, which are supposed to increase the enjoyment of such an area. I thank the House for allowing me this brief intrusion into the debate. Once again, I reiterate my conviction that the Parliament should be big enough to stand up and say: 'There is a place for truly national parks in Australia, limited in number and able to be managed by an expert Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This report has quite major significance for the Northern Territory and for many people in the Northern Territory. It is unfortunate that I have had an opportunity to glance only quickly through the few paragraphs that relate to the chapter headed 'Commonwealth Involvement in the Northern Territory'. However, I will make a couple of brief comments at this stage and come back to them when debate allows on another occasion. It concerns me that the Committee has looked into this issue but yet seems not to have grasped the nettle of what self-government is doing for the Northern Territory and what the ultimate objective of Statehood means to the Northern Territory. The recommendations of this report are not consistent with the political moves in other areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The report takes note in paragraph 148 that the Northern Territory Government intends to introduce its own environmental legislation. Those plans are well prepared and well documented. It surprises me, therefore, that the Committee has not accepted that the Northern Territory will be able to enact the full and parallel legislation of the States. It concerns me also that paragraph 166 of the report recommends that the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service should maintain full control of Kakadu National Park at least until a plan of management is reviewed in five years' time. No alternative is given or suggestion made that these powers and functions should be progressively transferred to the Northern Territory Government well before that and within five years. </PARA>
<PARA> The other area that I will address relates to relationships with Aboriginals and relationships between the Northern Territory Government and the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service. Very significant advances have been made in recent times towards sound working relationships with Aboriginals, particularly in the Cobourg Peninsula National Park area. To be consistent with the Government's proclaimed objective of Statehood, national parks in the Northern Territory should be managed by the Northern Territory Government and the Northern Territory Conservation Commission. This report, perhaps because of timing, is not consistent with the recommendations of the Lynch Committee. That concerns me, and the report should be looked at in that light. I believe there should be much more discussion between the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (Mr Wilson) and the Northern Territory Chief Minister before the implementation of any recommendations in this report. I seek leave to continue by remarks at a later hour. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The one hundred and eighty-eighth report is the annual report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee of Public Accounts. It contains a review of examinations conducted by the Committee during the period to June 1981, issues arising out of its inquiries and other matters which the Committee regards as significant in its development during the year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In reporting to Parliament, we have recognised our responsibility as a statutory body to report on our activities. We have always taken the view that bodies established by the Parliament should report to the Parliament and the Committee has been in the vanguard of encouraging higher standards and regularity in reporting in all areas of government endeavour. </PARA>
<PARA> The year contained two significant milestones in the development of the role of the PAC. Firstly, the inquiry into the pharmaceutical benefits scheme-chemists' remuneration was the first matter to be referred from this House to the Committee under section 8 (1) (a) of the Public Accounts Committee Act since the Committee was reformed in 1952. I commend this practice to the House as I firmly believe that it is an extremely worthwhile method through which matters of concern may receive proper scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA> The second major innovation for the Committee has been the preparation of discussion papers so our first on internal audit was our one hundred and eighty-fourth report. The discussion paper was the product of the Committee's long-standing interest in public administration, particularly those aspects of management which have a significant impact on the quality of financial administration within the Public Service. For the information of honourable members, I will be tabling two more such reports tomorrow. One is a handbook on Commonwealth financial administration and the other is on the collection and dissemination of statistics. </PARA>
<PARA> As this House no doubt would be aware, through our inquiries, the Public Accounts Committee often uncovers areas of neglect which are common across the complete range of government administration. In our annual report we have attempted to identify a number of these to the Parliament in the hope that they will stimulate greater discussion and consideration of those important matters. I refer here specifically to three issues:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Accountability of statutory and other authorities. The Committee has been concerned for a number of years with the number of statutory authorities, government-owned companies and other bodies which fail to submit, or submit late, financial statements formally to the Auditor-General's Office for audit examination. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. Follow-up of Committee's recommendations. The Committee is aware that within departments there is a very real desire on the part of officers to avoid where possible coming under the scrutiny of the Public Accounts Committee. However, we are not sure that departments apply their resources with the same degree of vigour to overcoming defects which have been identified in our reports. For this reason we are currently implementing mechanisms to monitor more closely the consideration of our conclusions and recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. Senior management in the public sector. The Committee has become increasingly concerned through its inquiries, of an inadequate level of professional management capability in the senior echelons of the public sector. Accordingly we will be examining the selection and training of senior management in departments during 1982. </PARA>
<PARA>The 1980-81 period has been particularly demanding in terms of the breadth and urgency of inquiries undertaken by the Committee. We would like to record our appreciation to the Secretary, Mr Michael Talberg, and to all our advisers and seconded and permanent staff for the outstanding support they have given the Committee as well as, of course, the support we have received from the members of the staff of the Public Service Board, the Auditor-General's Office and the Department of Finance who have given us considerable professional assistance during that period. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer now to the 189th report. The Committee's inquiry into the purchase of airport fire tenders by the Department of Transport grew out of the unfavourable comments of the Auditor-General in his report for 1978-79. Those comments were fully substantiated in the course of the public inquiry, and leave the arrangements for contracts between the Walter Motor Truck Co. of New York and the Department of Transport open to considerable criticism. In all 25 ultra-large fire tenders were ordered from the overseas manufacturer, which went into liquidation in October 1980, leaving one contract incomplete. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Transport has consistently expressed its own satisfaction with its choice of the Walter fire tenders. It was not the object of the inquiry to question this view, but rather to examine the circumstances leading to their purchase and to investigate the problems and cost of repairs associated with their early operation which received public attention in the media and Parliament. We understand that the vehicles are now operating most satisfactorily. </PARA>
<PARA> The Public Accounts Committee was particularly concerned to investigate allegations that specifications prepared within the Department of Transport gave a distinct advantage to an overseas manufacturer. The advantage was exacerbated when tenders from 11 manufacturers were assessed by a small committee whose composition was essentially the same as that which drew up the specification in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA> As the report reveals, the practices followed by the Department of Transport in ordering 25 fire tenders to the value of $4.2m where not above reproach. Our inquiry has already brought about a review of these procedures aimed, I am sure, at preventing further circumstances which call into question the personal and professional integrity of some of the employees of that Department and reflect badly on the management as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> The saga of the purchase of fire tenders for the 31 airport facilities managed by the Department of Transport around Australia, goes back to 1972. Changing budget priorities, cancelled contracts, excessive delays in finalising contracts and problems in manufacture and commissioning had disrupted efforts to modernise and adequately equip the full time airport rescue and fire fighting service. </PARA>
<PARA> When tenders were eventually called in November 1975 for vehicles with a 6,800 litre capacity, it was to a specification which the Public Accounts Committee considered to be developmental and which should have been managed in two stages, separating the development and testing of a prototype from a contract for the delivery of the number of vehicles, of proven design, required. The Committee had previously made this requirement known in reports tabled in 1972 and 1976. </PARA>
<PARA> Throughout the inquiry the Department maintained that it had not engaged in the production of a prototype and that an order for the full number of vehicles required was the appropriate procedure. Semantics aside, this action resulted in a situation where the Department of Transport received 16 vehicles, all of which required essential modifications and repairs during training and in their early operational life. It is significant that modification and repairs were particularly needed for the power-divider, a new feature in the Walter line of fire tenders. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost to the taxpayer of repairs, modifications and maintenance to put 16 new vehicles into duty approached a quarter of a million dollars in the period from their arrival in August 1978 until 30 January 1980. Most of this considerable cost was attributable to the initial order for 10 vehicles delivered in 1978. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth pointing out also that in the period from their commissioning until 30 June 1980, the 16 vehicles in question were out of service for a total of 1,542 days. In defence of the manufacturer, it should be made clear that many repairs and all modifications were honoured under warranty arrangements and often beyond the requirements of the warranty. Labour costs, however, were met by the Department. </PARA>
<PARA> The aspects of the initial contract which were of concern to the committee included the failure to meet the then requirement for Australian industry participation in a large overseas contract. Urgent delivery was a more prominent consideration. Relations between the Department and Australian manufacturers are poor, partly attributable to inadequate consultation on the part of the Department and its judgment that they could not meet the technical requirements of the specification. </PARA>
<PARA> The report draws attention to the fact that the Department of Transport failed to check the financial viability of the contractor. In view of the fact that poor quality control during manufacture was a major contributor to vehicle defects, it is worth noting that no arrangements were made for the monitoring of production. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer now to the 190th report. The Committee's report refers to an inquiry into petroleum royalties and excise. This inquiry was undertaken in response to questions raised in the Auditor-General's reports on a number of aspects of the assessment, collection and verification of revenue due to the Commonwealth in respect of production from the Bass Strait oil fields. </PARA>
<PARA> In particular, the Auditor-General was not satisfied that the procedures followed in accounting for and sharing royalties and fees between the Commonwealth and the State of Victoria complied with the relevant Commonwealth legislation or indeed that sufficient action was being taken to ensure that all revenue due to the Commonwealth was being collected and accounted for by the appropriate authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the difficulties to which the Auditor-General drew attention was the failure by the then Department of National Development and the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs to finalise satisfactory arrangements for the verification of the value of production from the various fields in Bass Strait and consequently of the royalties and excise payable by producers to the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee was appalled to find that it had taken 12 years, from 1968 to 1980, for a determination to be made by the designated authority as to the wellhead value of the petroleum produced and that for this period the final assessment of payments to be made by producers was left unresolved. The Committee regards this situation as completely unsatisfactory. It is convinced that the whole episode reflects unfavourably on the administration of off-shore petroleum development in Australia and on the attitudes of the departments concerned which should have acted more promptly to establish the role of the designated authority and to protect the interests of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee was also informed that because excise varies according to the size of the field by which it is produced it is necessary to draw up a systematic method by which end products are allocated back to the various gas and oil fields in the Bass Strait production area. In addition a mass balance procedure is required to measure the difference between the assumed total input of components to the processing plant and the measured output of end products. These complicated procedures, although by no means precise, are essential for the calculation of royalty and excise payments. However, the Committee found that these procedures had not been properly documented and it is only now in the process of being completed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee concluded from this evidence that departments had given advice to Ministers in the mistaken belief that the information required to enable ministerial decisions to be carried out was available. It was obvious to the Committee that there had been inadequate liaison between the policy departments developing the program and the department which had to administer it. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of the significance of the excise levy the Committee believes that departments have been negligent in not ensuring that adequate procedures were in place. Errors in the collection of excise could exceed plus or minus $10m per year and the Committee strongly condemns an administrative system which allows such a situation to occur and remain unresolved for so long. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee, during its inquiry, considered the legislation passed in 1980 following the agreement reached between the Commonwealth and the States as to the administration of off-shore petroleum resources. In essence the legislation which has not yet been proclaimed is intended to give effect to the Government's intention to share power over and title to the seas surrounding Australia with the States and the Northern Territory. Commonwealth legislation is to apply beyond the 3-mile limit and State legislation within the 3-mile territorial sea. Mining operations beyond the 3-mile limit are to be under the control of a joint authority consisting of the relevant Commonwealth and State Ministers. In the event of disagreement, the views of the Commonwealth Minister will prevail. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's examination of this legislation has raised doubts as to the extent to which its stated objectives will be achieved. Having regard to the powers retained by the Commonwealth and the overall constitutional situation it is the Committee's view that ultimate authority and responsibility over the territorial sea remains with the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly the Committee considers that it would have been more appropriate for the legislation to have provided for the Joint Authority to function both in relation to the territorial sea and the adjacent areas, with particular functions being delegated to the State Designated Authority as appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has therefore recommended that, prior to proclamation, the legislation enacted in 1980 be re-examined and discussed with the States with a view to amendment to extend the powers of the Joint Authority. The Committee was also concerned that the position of the Commonwealth in relation to the collection of money does not appear to be adequately safeguarded under the legislation. Those responsible for the collection of royalties are State government officials who are under no obligation to furnish full explanations to the Commonwealth. While the Committee believes that the State officials have co-operated fully in exercising their responsibilities, we have noted recent evidence given to the Victorian Public Accounts Committee indicating that the State authorities are unable to verify information provided by the producers upon which royalties are assessed. The Committee is strongly of the view that new methods should be determined to make relevant authorities accountable to both Commonwealth and State Parliaments. We have suggested that future reviews be conducted jointly by the relevant Commonwealth and State parliamentary committees. </PARA>
<PARA> The wellhead value concept of assessment of royalties and excise is an unnecessarily complicated procedure and one which has not been favoured in other countries which exploit off-shore oil resources. In the Committee's view further consideration should be given to the procedures followed overseas with a view to adopting a simpler and more administratively satisfactory solution to our own needs. </PARA>
<PARA> Our report contains a number of recommendations which we believe will assist in overcoming the delays and complications which have characterised the administration of off-shore petroleum resources up to this time and will help to prevent similar difficulties arising in the future. I commend the reports to honourable members. </PARA>
<PARA> Motion (by Mr Hodgman)-by leave- proposed:</PARA>
<PARA> That the House take note of the reports. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to quote firstly from what the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee had to say when he referred to the 189th report of that Committee. Before doing that, on behalf of the Opposition I commend the Public Accounts Committee on the thoroughness of its 189th report, the painstaking manner in which it went about its inquiry and the excellent example that this report has provided to the Parliament and the people of Australia of the operation of the parliamentary processes of questioning and assessing departmental performance, public expenditure and ministerial accountability. Having carried out that analysis, those inquiries and those assessments, the Committee has presented to the Parliament a report on its activities. I join with the Chairman in expressing my gratitude, appreciation and congratulations to the staff of the Committee. As in so many cases of parliamentary committees it is the staff that carry out the leg work, the dog work, the painstaking detail and inquiry and attend to the myriad of matters that have to be examined, checked over and looked into.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In my view this report will go down as a milestone of the failure of a department to carry out its proper responsibilities. The Committee, having examined the performance of the Department of Transport, has exposed the manner in which the Parliament was misled, not only by the Department but also by the responsible Minister, apparently on the advice of the Department, and has set guidelines on how those things should have been dealt with in the first place and for bringing about a desirable change in the procedure of that Department. As I mentioned at the outset, the Chairman has probably best summarised this matter by stating that the comments of the Auditor-General in the 1978-79 report:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . were fully substantiated in the course of the public inquiry, and leave the arrangements for contracts between the Walter Motor Truck Co. in New York and the Department of Transport open to considerable criticism. </PARA>
<PARA>That is putting it mildly. The Chairman further said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Transport consistently expressed its own satisfaction with its choice of the Walter fire tenders. </PARA>
<PARA>It expressed satisfaction all the way through the inquiry and all the way through public debate. He stated also:</PARA>
<PARA> As the report reveals, the practices followed by the Department of Transport in ordering those 25 fire tenders . . . were not above reproach. </PARA>
<PARA>Those were the critical words in the Chairman's statement to the House a few moments ago. He goes on in the same paragraph to say 'they call into question the personal and professional integrity of some of its employees.' He is calling into question the personal and professional integrity of senior officers of the Department of Transport, and rightly so. Their performance on this issue reflects badly on the management of the Department as a whole. He mentioned also that the saga of the purchase of the fire tenders for the 31 airport facilities goes back to 1972. He could have added to that statement that the fiasco of the purchase of these tenders goes back to 1972. The Department deliberately misled the Parliament on information that was sought by the Parliament. The Parliament was misled in statements made by the Minister to the Parliament. Even in evidence there was a deliberate reluctance on the part of departmental officers, having been caught out, to tell the truth. Those honourable members who take the time to read the report in detail will find that what I am saying is validated, word for word almost, in the contents of the report. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish quickly to go back to October 1979 when the Opposition drew attention to the problems associated with the purchase of these fire tenders. Originally we had started directing attention to this matter in February 1979. As the matter snowballed information provided to the Parliament by the Department, firstly in respect of the number of days these vehicles were out of service once they came on line, was inaccurate. It conflicted later with information provided by the Auditor-General and conflicted with information provided in answers to committees of the Parliament. But that information was deliberately put to the Parliament to mislead and to cover up the long period of unavailability of this equipment. It was done by using the departmental jargon 'out of service'. In departmental jargon that definition 'out of service' meant the recorded time for which the unit was off the 'fire line'-again using the jargon-and a reserve vehicle was brought in on standby. If a reserve vehicle was not brought in then the unit was not recorded as being 'out of service'. Again, avenues available to the Department, but not known to the Parliament, were used to conceal what was happening. </PARA>
<PARA> Throughout 1979 the Opposition pointed to the faults of these vehicles, to the incompetence of the Department in its purchase of them, to the waste of public money in the repair of the vehicles, the unavailability of the vehicles and to the fact that the Parliament had been provided with false information on the performance of the units. Probably the classic example was in relation to the availability of the unit at Canberra airport, about when it was supposed to come on line, about when it did not come on line, about when the Auditor-General drew attention to the fact that it had not on line although it was to have come on line. There was total confusion within the Department. But again the critical thing was that the information provided to the Parliament was not accurate. I have already referred to the number of hours out of service. I do not want to go back into all that detail in the time that is available to me. </PARA>
<PARA> On 30 October 1979 we asked for an urgent and exhaustive investigation to be conducted into the selection and purchase of these new Walter ultra-large fire tenders that were to come into use at Australian airports. We pointed to the record of brake failure, power-divider breakdowns, pump and hose leakages and electrical problems that have been experienced since those units came into service. Our comments on all those points are vindicated in the report of the Public Accounts Committee. We showed that at the time the Department was attempting to conceal what we chose to refer to as a $1.5 billion bungle. In other terminology, again the Committee has vindicated our comments. We showed that those units had been modified from the standard design. In my quick reading of the report I did not see that point brought out. When we get down to the nub of the whole issue, the reason for this departure from the standard design of a twin-engine airport fire rescue appliance to a single engine unit was to save money. Later, in answer to questions on notice, it was established that it was for factors such as the manoeuvrability, weight, operational costs and so on. But in the first stages it was done because of cost. The difference in the cost of a $135,000 unit was $1,500. That was the difference in cost between the standard twin-engine design and the modified single engine design. When the single engine design came in-as was pointed out by the Committee-it was a prototype, a new concept which had not been tested or tried. The Department, having selected that design, stuck with it and tried in all sorts of ways to defend it. But the difference in price was about $1,500. The report indicates that that cost the Australian people something in the order of $250,000 in additional repairs and breakdowns. That figure does not take into account labour costs and later manufacturers costs because the Committee, in its deliberations and investigations, was unable to ascertain those additional costs. </PARA>
<PARA> We pointed out at the beginning of last year, on 2 March, that after the tragic accident at Mascot when an Advance Airlines aircraft crashed with the loss of some 13 lives, one of the Walter fire trucks that attended the scene failed in operation a few minutes after it had completed its task. Because of the unreliability of this equipment, that unit would not have been available had there been other accidents or a recurrence of the fire at the site of the crash. That unit failed because it was untested. It was still having teething troubles and had not been treated as a prototype. When the Committee was looking at the performance of these units the present Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) came into the Parliament on 6 March 1980 and answered a Dorothy Dix question, which is recorded at page 737 of Hansard, in his usual style from coward's castle-it was a prearranged question and a prearranged answer. I want honourable members and members of the public to listen to what the Minister had to say about this unit then, compare it with what the Committee says about this fire tender in its report and judge for themselves how the Minister misled this Parliament and how obviously he was misled by his own Department. He was conned by his Department. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> I am aware of the concern that is surrounding the purchase of those fire tenders. </PARA>
<PARA>He meant the Walters. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, a parliamentary committee-I think the Joint Committee of Public Accounts-has applied itself to the issue. I await its report with considerable interest. </PARA>
<PARA>I am sure he does. I recommend that he read the report that has been presented this afternoon. I recommend that he fire the fellows who were involved in providing the answer to that question of 6 March 1980. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> These highly complex vehicles were the lowest priced, technically acceptable fire tenders offered. </PARA>
<PARA>Later, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> There were technical problems-minor technical problems mostly-with these tenders when they first arrived. They were a quite new tender. </PARA>
<PARA>He concluded:</PARA>
<PARA> But, on present indications, they are undoubtedly the best technically and the most modern fire tenders available at the price that was acceptable to the Government at the time. </PARA>
<PARA>That was false information. The report of the Committee shows that on the evidence that is false information. Other comparable units were available at very close to the tender price of the Walter fire tenders. I will not go into the detail now; it is in the report. The report shows that the information given by the Minister on 6 March was not accurate, and that, again, the Parliament was being misled. We said at the time that the Minister was treating the Parliament in a cavalier way. On the same day the Minister issued a Press statement in which he attacked me for the view I took then, a view which has been vindicated by the Committee. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately Mr Morris was engaging in a politically motivated campaign against the Walter fire tenders by capitalising on some of the early technical difficulties which were now being overcome. </PARA>
<PARA>I put it to the Minister that he ought to sack that speech writer also because the Committee has vindicated the legitimate, responsible and accurate comments we made in drawing attention to defects in those appliances. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me refer to a few of the references in the Committee's conclusions because the time should not pass without them going into Hansard rather than being buried away within the report. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The initial submission from the Department of Transport . . . was lacking detail and inadequate for its purposes. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Department was treating the Parliament and the Committee with contempt-its usual arrogance-up to that point. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the Department of Transport appeared to have withheld relevant information on an earlier contract . . . </PARA>
<PARA>. . . it did not fully inform the Committee on matters relating to the Walter contracts which had been the subject of seventeen questions on notice in Parliament as well as about twenty critical articles in the press . . . Purchasing procedures of the Department of Transport needed to be reviewed. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Department of Transport said it did not feel bound to undertake a two-phase contract . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That referred to the fact that this unit was a prototype and, in the Commitee's view, it should have been dealt with as a prototype. Firstly, it should have been developed and, secondly, the number required should have been purchased. Conclusion 8 refers to the method of evaluation and how preference was not given to Australian industry involvement, or not to the extent that it should have been. Conclusion 10 refers to the urgent delivery being the major factor in the selection of the successful tenderer. It concludes:</PARA>
<PARA> It was the view of the Committee that this situation reflected deficiencies in the management of the Department. </PARA>
<PARA>The cost of essential repairs totalled $246,840 which were extraordinary additional costs to the original contract. Conclusion 14 states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Department did not carry out what the Committee considers to be usual commercial credit checks on the financial viability of the overseas contractor whose company failed some three years after the first contract was let and before the second contract was completed. </PARA>
<PARA>So, all conclusions deal with deficiencies, incompetence, and failure fully and properly to inform the Parliament and the Committee. That is a damning indictment of departmental failure to carry out its responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to mention the role of the former Department of Transport officer in this, one William Charles Harris. Reference to him appears in answer to question upon notice No. 5148 and in paragraphs 3.16 and 3.17 of the Committee's report. William Charles Harris was the superintendent of fire services in the Department of Transport at the time. He played a principal role in the development of the specification and, as I understand it, in the awarding of the contract. He later left the Department after retirement and established his own business, an international airport fire rescue consultancy business. It is unfortunate, as the Committee points out, that it was not able to locate Mr Harris to determine what role he played in the awarding of contracts. I hoped that it would have achieved that because the Insight team of the Melbourne Age was able to locate Mr Harris abroad. Mr Harris played a principal role in this whole exercise. As I said, it is unfortunate that the Committee, with the resources available to it, was not able to find him and further investigate his involvement. This Parliament needs to direct its attention to the matter of what an officer who has participated in the preparation of specifications and the awarding of contracts does after he leaves a department. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Transport was once a great and respected department. It was a department renowned for its quality of service to industry, its efficiency and its expertise. It has degenerated into a disaster area under a disaster Minister. If air safety, marine safety and road safety are to be restored in this country that Department has to be investigated fully. It has to be overhauled; it has to have reinjected into it enthusiasm and confidence in the job it is doing. It is for these reasons that I thank the Committee for the valuable work it has done in presenting this report to the Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has been my pleasure to be associated with the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and the Chairman and the staff of that Committee through the development of these three reports which have been presented to the Parliament today. Report 188, of course, is the annual report of the Public Accounts Committee. It summarises the work of the Committee over the past 12 months. The other report, which the Chairman has spoken to and which he explained quite adequately, is report 190 relating to petroleum royalties and excise. But, like the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris), I will spend a few minutes on report 189, which deals with the purchase of the 25 Walter fire tenders which commenced in about 1976 and which ended up as some sort of disaster.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me put into context the additional expenditure to which the taxpayers of Australia were put as a result of the purchase of something that turned out to be unsatisfactory. It has been stated already that almost $250,000 had to be spent on the 16 ultra-large fire tenders immediately after they arrived here to make them serviceable. That is about $15,000, in 1978 money terms, on each vehicle. That we needed to spend an average of $15,000 on each new vehicle to make it serviceable shows that some sort of a problem existed in the way in which the contract was let. All through this inquiry-the Chairman has made mention of this-one could not help feeling that specifications had been written to suit something that was available rather than being written around the end use to which these vehicles were supposed to be put. In the Committee's report on airport fire tenders recommendation 7 states:</PARA>
<PARA> In its choice of the Walter single engined vehicle with a power divider, the Department of Transport appeared to have bought a vehicle involving a technology not yet fully proven by that manufacturer. The power divider unit on the 6,800 litre tender proved to be the major fault among sixteen . . . </PARA>
<PARA> That in itself indicates that somehow or other a specification was written to suit this vehicle available from the Walter fire tender company and which excluded many other proven vehicles available, some from within Australia and some well proven from overseas countries. I draw attention to this matter because I think there exists at times, through many government tendering arrangements, a degree of overspecification. Instead of government departments in their specifications stating that they require something to do a certain job and with certain limits, they tend to try to rewrite the design of whatever they are purchasing. These fire tenders represent a clear example of that being exactly what was done. I suggested it was done with the knowledge of what a company could produce. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter that came out during this inquiry was the difficulty-this often happens in inquiries-of interviewing officers who had worked on this project. I speak of the ease of portability of staff within the Australian Public Service system. I show this concern being well aware of the advantages-I am familiar with the broad outline of Public Service duties-that can be obtained through portability. It has been proven that there are many disadvantages involved in the portability of staff. When one conducts an inquiry the officers who appear at the start of the inquiry sometimes are not there at the end of the inquiry; someone may have been transferred to another department or overseas. There is some difficulty in reaching the final conclusions or determining the correct opinions of people because of this. Within a department this must cause some difficulties. When projects span over a period of five or six years as this one has and come under the authority of different officers, surely there must be some difficulty in work or knowledge being transferred from one to the other. That is a matter that should be considered. It is a problem that the Public Accounts Committee faces from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, it has been a pleasure to be a member of the Public Accounts Committee and to be involved in such a large work load. Together with the other speakers in the debate, such as the honourable member for Shortland and the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, I pay tribute to the dedication of the staff. They are busy people. The work load they have carried has been the reason why this committee has had yet another effective year. The committee plays an important part in the accountability of the Public Service to the Parliament. This is something that is always important in making sure that the taxpayers' money is well spent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make some comments on the work and the reports of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. It needs to be emphasised that the Committee performs an important function for this Parliament. It scrutinises the expenditure of public moneys by all government departments and by statutory authorities. After one year's service on the Committee I have learned a great deal about the administration of Government departments and other public bodies. The Chairman in his report referred to three problem areas which warrant investigation and consideration by members of parliament. These related to, firstly, the accountability of statutory and other authorities, secondly, the failure of departments to remedy defects identified by the Committee and, thirdly, the inadequacy of professional management personnel in senior levels of the Public Service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While undoubtedly these problems exist, especially at the senior Public Service levels, one should not allow these facts to detract from the professionalism of the Australian Public Service. I believe that, contrary to an unfortunate impression which is often created, the standards achieved in most of the public sector are quite high and generally to be commended. This is certainly the experience of the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's work over the years has assisted greatly to tighten up procedures of financial accountability. The report on internal audit produced earlier this year and circulated to all departments should further accelerate this process. It is true that problem areas remain and some departments have been tardy in adopting recommendations. The proposed mechanism to monitor the implementation of recommendations is thus deserving of the support of this House. I believe that it will further accelerate the accountability of departments to the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a recurring theme which passed through the various inquiries and which has been mentioned in specific reports, but unfortunately it has not been given a prominent place in the annual report. I refer to the creation of inefficiency in Government departments because of the way in which Public Service staff ceilings are being implemented in those departments. Many senior public servants in giving evidence to the Committee complained about the detrimental effects which such ceilings are having on their capacity to perform the duties required of them by Ministers. This is an area of policy and, of course, there is no agreement between the Government and the Opposition. Undoubtedly, this will remain. However, we in the Australian Labor Party believe in a more generous and flexible attitude to the Public Service ceilings and to the provision of sufficient staff so that Government functions can be performed properly. </PARA>
<PARA> The way in which staff ceilings are implemented is also a serious problem. This appears to be affecting key areas of administration. It is common to find accounting and auditing functions suffering in these circumstances. For example, the Committee has identified what has happened in relation to the overseas section of the Department of Foreign Affairs. In my view, the Public Service Board and permanent heads need constantly to re-evaluate where the burden of Public Service cuts is placed in order to ensure that the loss of two key people does not disrupt major operations and programs. From the Committee's observations, I believe it can be concluded that this is one aspect of departmental management which Ministers ought to keep under close scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA> An illustration of the importance of the Committee's work has been given with the one hundred and ninetieth report. Our inquiries into the collection of petroleum royalties and excise established the existence of administrative confusion in the measurement of the quantity of oil extracted from Bass Strait. The problem was identified 12 years ago but repeated requests for changes in procedures have been ignored. As a result, it is possible that the Commonwealth has lost up to $100m in the last 10 years. The administrative system which has existed is totally unsatisfactory and needs to be changed as a matter of urgency. The Committee in fact considers that various departments have been 'negligent in not ensuring that adequate procedures were in place'. We in the Opposition are seriously concerned about this negligence which could have cost the people, as I say, up to $100m. I ask the Government to investigate the matter to determine who was responsible for this negligence. We demand explanations from the Ministers concerned as to why a situation of this kind was able to continue for such a long time and in fact remains still unresolved. </PARA>
<PARA> From the report it appears that one major cause of the problem is the fact that mining responsibilities are divided between the State and the Federal governments, depending on whether the areas involved are within the 3-mile limit. Oil from outside the limit is subject to measurement by a joint authority. If there is a need for such a joint State-Commonwealth authority-I, for one, am not convinced that this task could not be more efficiently performed by the Commonwealth alone-its powers and responsibilities need to be strengthened to ensure that there is an accurate measure of this valuable resource and that the Australian people receive the revenue which is due to them. It should be a matter of some alarm to the Government that the Committee was forced to conclude in relation to this matter:</PARA>
<PARA> Although the current oil excise levy policy was introduced in the 1978-79 Budget the documentation of procedures has not yet been finalised. The Committee recommends that the Departments of National Development and Energy and Business and Consumer Affairs give this matter urgent attention and expects to be advised of substantial progress in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA>I hope that the Government will act immediately on these serious findings. Finally, I thank fellow members of the Committee for their dedicated work on complex matters. I wish also to thank the excellent staff of the Committee for their wonderful efforts. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The annual report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts is a report of significance to this Parliament and the electorate. It represents a full report of the activities of the Commonwealth in line with the view of the Committee that disclosure and accountability are essential for the effective operation of this Parliament. The annual report indicates particular concern by the Committee regarding the relationship between Ministers and statutory authorities. This relationship is, indeed, unclear as organisations are created for a particular purpose free from the usual Public Service controls, for example, the Public Service Act. As indicated in paragraph 4.1 of the report, problems have arisen in various statutory authorities. The current inquiry into the Government Aircraft Factories, although not yet completed, has emphasised a particular problem of that authority. It appears that the Government Aircraft Factories are placed in a most unsatisfactory situation in that decisions taken by the management are at least to some degree subject to approval of the Department of Industry and Commerce, which department does not have the responsibility of carrying out such decisions. As indicated in paragraph 4.4 on page 22 of the report, the Committee believes:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . that the fundamental principle of 'letting the managers manage' is basic to an effective inter-relationship between Ministers, departments and statutory bodies and accountability must be founded on this principle. </PARA>
<PARA>The recent ministerial Review of Commonwealth Functions-better known as the razor gang-recommended the establishment of a committee of this Parliament similar to the Public Bodies Review Committee of the Victorian Parliament. This committee would review the effectiveness, structure and role of public bodies. It is worth noting that it is the opinion of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts that the establishment of such a committee is not needed. This opinion is supported by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations and the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure. If these three committees were given more resources they would be able to carry out effectively the role suggested for the proposed committee. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts is of the view that it would be more cost effective to use the procedures of the existing committees and that, subject to the provision of more resources for those committees, there is no requirement for a further committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The 189th report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, on airport fire tenders, as indicated by the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) as Chairman of that Committee, related to the circumstances of the purchase of the Walter fire tenders and the subsequent costs of repairs, modification and maintenance of the new vehicles. I propose to deal briefly with two aspects of the report. Firstly, it is a matter of great regret that the report has indicated that the relationship between the Department of Transport and Australian manufacturers is most unsatisfactory. This situation arose because of inadequate consultation by the Department, which formed the view that Australian manufacturers could not meet the requirements of the contract. This relationship deteriorated further because of allegations that the specifications of the Department of Transport were, in fact, advantageous to overseas manufacturers. As a result of the inquiry by the Committee procedures have been reviewed which, it is hoped, will prevent these problems occurring in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> The second matter which I refer to relates to the failure of the Department to carry out normal credit checks. The fact that Walter went into liquidation indicates the significance of the procedure. It was indeed fortunate that parts for the vehicles were available as, if this had not been the case, what was in fact a fiasco could have turned into a financial disaster. Once again, as a result of the inquiry, before future contracts are entered into by the Department of Transport it is hoped that the Department will, in fact, carry out normal credit checks which we would expect would be carried out in any normal commercial enterprise. In relation to that matter, the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris) indicated that sometimes it is unfortunate that these matters are buried in the report. I draw attention to the summary of conclusions of the Committee, which states:</PARA>
<PARA> 14. The Department did not carry out what the Committee considers to be usual commercial credit checks on the financial viability of the overseas contractor whose company failed some three years after the first contract was let and before the second contract was completed. </PARA>
<PARA> 15. The Department failed to consult the Trade Commissioner Service in New York, and appeared to have made inadequate use of its Transport Counsellor in Washington, D.C. </PARA>
<PARA> 16. Production of the vehicles in the USA was not monitored by Australian officials based in either New York or Washington. Quality control during manufacture was subsequently found to be inadequate and was a major factor contributing to the repairs and modifications of the vehicles before commissioning. </PARA>
<PARA>The other aspect which I mention is that the Committee is of the view that the Department must make a considerable effort to improve its public relations with Australian industry and certainly its co-operation with the Fire Fighters Union on safety and other operational matters. The honourable member for Shortland canvassed many of the areas that I intended to deal with. In closing, I think it must be said that this inquiry indicated very clearly that, despite the fact that the Department made many errors which were obvious and which, in fact, were not known to this Parliament until the inquiry was conducted, it confirms the necessity of this type of committee within this Parliament. The matters that came out in this inquiry were matters which were not able to come before the Parliament in the normal course of the conduct of the business of the Parliament. I also express my appreciation to the other members of the Committee for their assistance during the past year and particularly to the members of the secretariat, who have worked very hard throughout the year. As the House would be aware, it is impossible for these committees to operate unless they have the sort of backup that we have had on this Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter now brought before the House by the Opposition is one of fundamental importance to the present and future welfare of this country. Indeed, I believe that no single issue is more significant than this one. I will go to the facts in this matter but I say at the outset that the Government's record in this matter warrants the condemnation of the Australian community on three counts: Firstly, its deliberate and successful determination to bring about a slackening in employment growth and an increase in unemployment; secondly, the cynical manipulation of its economic powers in this area for its own perceived electoral advantage; and thirdly, its exercises in cosmetics as exemplified by the Sunday effort of the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr N. A. Brown) which sought to rest the responsibilities in this matter with others, in this case with the employers of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at the outset at the facts which establish this very significant slowing in the rate of employment growth in this country. In the September quarter of 1980 the rate of growth in employment was 208,200 on an annual basis. In the September quarter of this year-the figures for the month of September have just been released-the rate of employment growth had been drastically reduced to 119,800. That reduction from 208,000 in the September quarter of 1980 to 120,000 in the September quarter of 1981 represents a decline of 42.5 per cent in the rate of growth of employment in this country. Of course, in the period when the rate of growth was considerably higher, the Ministers in this Government claimed responsibility as properly attaching to the policies of the Government in that regard. I refer to two statements made by the Minister in the House. On 5 May this year, when reporting on the increase in employment figures, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> They show the value of the Government's employment and youth programs . . . Finally, they show without any doubt whatsoever that only through sound economic policies will permanent and productive jobs be generated. </PARA>
<PARA>He said the same sort of thing on 27 May when he stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . there has been a continuous improvement with regard to the employment of young people . . . </PARA>
<PARA>. . . There is no doubt whatsoever that the Government's economic policies are working. </PARA>
<PARA>So it is very clear that in the earlier period when there was a measure of economic growth and a measure of growth in employment opportunities, the Government, through its Minister, was saying: 'This increase in employment, this rate of growth, is attributable to the operation of the Government's economic policies'. I point out that if we are to understand this drastic reduction in the rate of employment growth between the September quarter of 1980 and the September quarter of 1981 we have to remind ourselves that 1980 happened to be an election year. In that period the Government deliberately turned around from the restrictive policies that it had been following previously. In the event, in the first half of 1980-81 we had an annual rate of economic growth of 6.1 per cent and employment growth at the rate of 3.5 per cent. What were the factors in that part of 1980 which operated to produce this high rate of economic growth and this high rate of employment growth? Those factors were an accelerated growth in Government expenditure, which created an expansion in the public sector, and there was a growth in the money supply. Mr Deputy Speaker, I hope that I am not interrupting you. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was making the point that I was being interrupted. There was an accelerated growth in Government expenditure which created an expansion in the public sector, there was a considerable growth in the money supply at rates well above the 11 per cent policy ceiling, which had previously been set by the Government, and there was an accelerated growth in real wages and disposable incomes which underpinned an upsurge in business investment and consumer spending. In other words, in the period which led up to the election in 1980 the Government deliberately reversed its previous restrictionist policies because it wanted to create a situation in which there would be economic growth and a significant growth in employment opportunities. That is what happened. It produced the sorts of rates of growth in employment to which I have referred-an annual rate of growth of 208,000 in the September quarter of 1980. Of course, with the election won in the latter part of 1980, the Government reverted to its restrictive policies which are now reflected in the figures before this House which show this reduction of something like 43 per cent in the rate of employment growth. Let me put further facts before the House to establish the situation in regard to what has happened to employment in this country. In the period from 1975-76 to 1980-81-that is, in the five years in which this Government has been in power-there has been an increase in employment of only 384,000, which is a rate of growth per annum of a little over one per cent. More than one-third of the miserable increase of 384,000 in the number of jobs in this country in the lifetime of this Government is made up of part time jobs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at what has happened with regard to teenagers, the young unemployed. In the period of this Government from 1975-76 to 1980-81 only an additional 55,000 jobs have been created. There were only 55,000 more jobs for teenagers at the end of 1980-81 than there were in 1975-76, and only 12,000 of those were full time jobs. In other words, after five years of this Government there were only 12,000 more full time jobs for teenagers than there were when it came into office. In the last few months that situation has deteriorated further. In the year to September 1981 there was a drop of 2,000 in total teenage employment. There was an increase of 7,700 in part time teenage employment, but in the year to September 1981 there was a decline of 9,600 in full time employment for teenagers. In other words, in this last year there have been 9,600 fewer full time jobs for teenagers than there were a year ago. Those are the facts of the employment picture. There has been almost a halving in the rate of growth of employment and the situation is particularly bad with regard to employment for young people. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, when we talk about this abysmal performance in respect of employment, naturally that coin has as its other side what is happening with regard to unemployment. The situation there can be briefly put, and it is a tragic situation. The facts are these: The latest figures show that in September of this year 393,000 people were unemployed, which is 5.8 per cent of the labour force, the highest figure since March of this year. That figure of 5.8 per cent compares with 4.5 per cent in the year 1975-76. Further, and more disturbing, there is a decline in participation rates, which means that hidden unemployment is obviously increasing. By the most conservative calculations that would be agreed to by economists, whatever point they occupy on the political spectrum, that means that there are between 200,000 and 300,000 hidden unemployed. If we add those figures to the figure of 393,000 we can see that there are in this country between 600,000 and 700,000 people who are unemployed in the sense that they would wish to work were there a job available. That is the essential economic and social statistic that we must take into account. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the most recent picture? On the latest statistics, in September of this year 115,000 teenagers were unemployed-about 15 per cent of the teenage work force-which means in simple terms that in this country at the moment between one in six and one in seven of our young teenagers who want to work cannot get a job. In the last month there has been a 21 per cent increase in the number of unemployed teenagers looking for their first job. Those are the devastating statistical reflections of what is happening with regard to employment and unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> The third factual area to which I refer to establish a case is the duration of unemployment. We see a steadily worsening situation there. In 1975-76 the average duration of unemployment was 13 weeks. The latest figure is 35 weeks. In this country there are about 76,000 people whose duration of unemployment is longer than one year. In these matters one tends to be overwhelmed in a sense by the statistics in the aggregate. I bring to the attention of this House what those statistics reveal in terms of personal tragedy. I refer to a report in last Friday's Newcastle Morning Herald headed: 'Jobless man sought jail sentence'. The article stated:</PARA>
<PARA> A 22-year old man stole a car because he wanted to go to jail, where he could be employed and save money, Newcastle District Court was told yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA> Public defender Mr S. Flood said that Peter Robert Gould wanted to go to jail for six months. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Gould would be paid $25 a week for working in . . . jail and he should save enough money in six months to 'put him on his feet' and be able to live in society. </PARA>
<PARA> He had been unemployed for 3 1/2 years. </PARA>
<PARA>The public defender said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government must be responsible when a man wants to go to jail to find employment. </PARA>
<PARA>The report continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Judge Cooper said he had not wanted to send Mr Gould to jail but 'if he wants me to send him to jail I will'. </PARA>
<PARA>This is what the judge said:</PARA>
<PARA> There seems to be something terribly wrong when this happens to a young man of 22. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what those aggregate statistics hide-the tragedy of people who have been unemployed for these long periods and who cannot get work. In that factual context the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs launched last Saturday his national job drive for youth. The Press release of the Minister contains some remarkable observations. Let me preface my comments on this aspect by saying that we have no objection to the Minister trying to stimulate employers to take on young people, but it is an absurdity to try to sheet home the responsibility for the situation not to the Government but to the employers. The Minister said: 'We are asking employers to make additional job opportunities available. What we need in Australia is a commitment to our youth'. He referred to the fact that his Department was spending a record $197.2m this financial year on its package of manpower and training programs. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the facts. The facts are that between 1975-76 and 1980-81 total government expenditure on manpower training and support programs was reduced by almost 50 per cent in real terms. It is true that in this year's Budget there has been an increase in real expenditure, but until that time there was almost a 50 per cent reduction in real terms and there was a reduction of almost 80 per cent in the Government's expenditure per unemployed person on manpower training and support programs. Of course, this creates the absurd obscenity of reductions in expenditure on training programs since this Government came into office and having to bring people from overseas to fill shortages of skilled labour. We have over 100,000 young people unemployed, a 50 per cent reduction in expenditure on training programs in that period and bottlenecks of skill shortages, and we are bringing in people from overseas. The situation has been reached when we can no longer talk about the cost of job creation programs, which is what the Government has been doing when it has tried to ridicule job creation programs. We have reached the point when this country has to ask: Can we tolerate any longer the cost of not having job creation programs? The level of unemployment in this country, particularly amongst our young people, has passed beyond being an economic scandal to being a social tragedy. This country can no longer tolerate this Government's policies. In election periods it will lift economic growth and the rate of employment growth and when it has won the election it refuses to undertake specific job creation programs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) seemed determined to inflict upon us a mass of statistics to prove a proposition about which there is no debate. Let us make it perfectly plain at the outset that there is no debate about the extent of unemployment within Australia. The Government has never sought to disguise the fact that there is within Australia a major problem of youth unemployment. Indeed, we have asserted on several occasions that the rate of youth unemployment in Australia is higher than it is in a number of other countries comparable with Australia. At the same time we ask people to accept in fairness that the rate of unemployment in Australia across the board-that is, for adults, for the whole work force-is in fact lower than it is in many other countries. In fact this country has a very creditable record in employment and unemployment across the board.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The burden of the honourable member's complaint, and the fact that seemed to spark off this matter of public importance, is that there is an attempt by the Government to disguise its responsibility for the employment situation in Australia. There is no such attempt to disguise anything, nor is there anything we would want to disguise. We assert positively that there is a problem with respect to youth unemployment, and we are embarking on constructive policies to resolve that problem. The basis of the attack seems to be that we have had the audacity to launch a program in the community this week to encourage employers to take more young unemployed people into their work force. We have had the gall, the Australian Labor Party says, to appeal to community interests, to appeal to community concern, and to say to the employers of this country: 'We urge you to use our training programs. We urge you to use our subsidised work experience programs, and by means of those programs to give a job to a young person'. I should have thought that that call would meet with universal approval within this country. It has been supported by the community, to its credit, and indeed has been supported by large sections of the media which is assisting us in this campaign. We say without any qualification whatsoever that the campaign is commendable and should be encouraged and supported by the community at large. </PARA>
<PARA> We are saying in this campaign, firstly, that we want to promote and identify employment and job opportunities for young people, particularly school leavers. Secondly, we are saying that we want to highlight the services that my Department, which includes the Commonwealth Employment Service, can offer both to employers and to unemployed people. They provide very useful services indeed to both groups. Thirdly, we are saying that we want to focus attention on finding jobs, and again I would have thought that was a commendable concern on behalf of the Government which we hoped, reasonably, would be supported by the whole community. But the Labor Party apparently will not support it, and it will not support it for the most base of political reasons. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Wills towards the end of his speech drew particular attention to this matter. If there is bipartisan support on this campaign let it be said clearly that the members of the Opposition support us. Let them go out to the media and, instead of criticising the Government, support it in the campaign and urge employers to take on more young unemployed people. To this point they have not done that, and we invite them to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This debate brings home the essential difference between the Labor Party and the Government on the issue of employment and unemployment, and there is an essential difference. The difference is this: People will employ other people if it is profitable to do so. They will employ them if it is economical to do so. They will employ other people if the potential employee has the skills, ability and experience needed to do the job. So in response to those very basic principles, which the Labor Party as a whole does not seem to be prepared to accept, we say that the role of the Government is to create a sound economic environment in which it will be profitable and is profitable for employers to take on more employees and where there are programs which can give the unemployed people of this country, particularly young unemployed people, the skills and ability and experience they need to get a job and keep it. I thought that the honourable member had learned his lesson when he gave a radio interview in July of this year. I do not criticise the honourable member for Wills for saying what I am about to attribute to him. In fact, I praise and commend him. The honourable member gave an interview on radio 3UZ in Melbourne in July of this year in which he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Because there's no doubt that if wages do explode too quickly, it can have adverse economic impacts on unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> That was a true statement. It was true then, it is true now, and it will always remain true. Wages and the cost of wages do affect employment, as the honourable member for Wills conceded on that occasion but apparently will not concede today. I should have thought there was a role for the Labor Party to improve employment in this country. The role of the Labor Party should be to take that statement of the honourable member for Wills and say: 'Here is one of the factors which affect unemployment in Australia. If wages do increase too rapidly, if the wage element does find its way into the economy with overwhelming force, as it does on occasions in this country, then employment will suffer and unemployment will increase'. That should be abundantly clear. I wish the Labor Party would pay more heed to that statement made in July by the honourable member for Wills because it has within it the solution, at least in part, to our unemployment problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead of raising matters of public importance such as this, the Labor Party can do a great deal to assist in the area of employment and unemployment. Firstly, it can encourage some restraint in wages through its presumed influence in the trade union movement. Secondly, it can encourage some restraint in the moves for reduced working hours, which can lead only to an increase in costs to industry and commerce and hence to a reduction in the profitability of industry, which so much determines the employment potential of industry in this country. The Labor Party can certainly do that. Thirdly, the Labor Party can encourage support of our training programs for young unemployed people in particular instead of criticising them, as it has done on this day and on other days, when it attempts to show that those programs are not working and are not useful programs to have. Fourthly, the Opposition can use again its influence in the trade union movement to encurage less industrial disputation. The most recent figures available, which came out only last week, show that in one month there was an increase of 200,000 in the number of working days lost in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Is it any wonder that we heard today that the Japanese are sick and tired of delays in delivery of the coal they buy from this country? Is it any wonder that other countries are looking elsewhere when there is no reliability in deliveries? Is it any wonder that businessmen within Australia have doubt whether, if they go into business, they will be able to continue their businesses because of the never-ending industrial disputation in this country? We say that the Labor Party can do a great deal to improve business and industry in this country and, with it, employment in this country by encouraging a more responsible attitude on industrial disputes and a reduction of industrial disputes. If industry and commerce are allowed to function without continuous disruptions, people will go into business, they will expand their businesses, and they will employ more people. That is what the Labor Party can do, but apparently it is not what the Labor Party is prepared to do.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Wills, in support of his case, cited some selective statistics. In reply I will look at the present position so far as employment is concerned. The figures for September 1981 came out only recently. They show a record on employment of which this Government is proud and of which this country should be proud. I will come to the Labor Party's performance in a few moments. Let me look at the Government's performance at the moment. So far as annual performance is concerned, in September this year as compared with September last year, there had been an increase of some 140,800 jobs, or 2.2 per cent. That is a very commendable performance so far as the growth in employment is concerned. Let us look at the month of September alone, when there was an increase of 109,000 jobs. When did the Labor Party in this country, or in any other country where the Labor Party has been in government, achieve a result like that? We have always said that there must be caution about taking one month's figures, that a case should not be built on one month's figures, but that we are entitled to point to them if the growth in employment is demonstrated by such figures and when there is a continuous improvement in employment growth, as there has been. </PARA>

Although we say again and again: 'Do not put too much reliance on one month's figures because the statistics are not necessarily repeated in the following month', nevertheless we say that here is a good result and it shows, without any shadow of doubt, that the employment situation in Australia is sound. So let us hear what the next Labor Party speaker has to say in reply to that. The honourable member turned to unemployment. The full time rate of unemployment in September this year was 5.7 per cent. That is the lowest rate for four years. It is a substantial improvement. We are confident that that situation will continue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What incenses me is the gall of the Labor Party in bringing this matter into the House. What is the Labor Party's record? It introduced the great job creation scheme in 1974-75. It was the culmination of the socialist dream in this country personified in the Regional Employment Development scheme. Job creation schemes are what the honourable member for Wills asks for now. What did his predecessors achieve by implementing that part of the socialist dream? They created 64,300 jobs at a cost of $60m. Not one of them was permanent. They created artificial, temporary jobs under the RED scheme. While they created 64,000 temporary, false, imaginary jobs under the RED scheme, in roughly the same period total employment in this country actually dropped by 13,900. Full time employment dropped by 18,000. As employment went down, while they were artificially creating jobs, unemployment doubled. What a record that is for the socialists. They introduced artifical job creation schemes. Employment went down and unemployment doubled. What a gall members of the Labor Party have to say now that they have any answers to the problems of unemployment. They have no answers whatsoever. The Government has made at perfectly clear that unemployment is a problem but the problem will not be solved by the Labor Party's solutions which we heard today such as increasing the money supply, increasing government expenditure and increasing wage costs.</PARA>

Let us again look at what the Labor Party did. In the last year of the Labor Government when, presumably, it was at its peak of perfection, full time jobs in Australia dropped by 81,000. What a discreditable record that is for the Labor party. It has no solutions whatsoever to unemployment. Firstly, we believe that we are on the right course. As I have said, it is only by a sound economy that employment will expand and unemployment will reduce, as it is now reducing. Secondly, we have a wide-ranging series of programs for which expenditure and the number of places have been substantially increased. Those programs are giving to young unemployed people in particular and adults the skills, ability and experience they need to obtain employment and keep it. We reject this matter of public importance. The Labor Party with its discreditable record has no right to pretend that it has any answers whatsoever to the problem of unemployment. If we continue with sound economic policies we will see a steady improvement in employment and a reduction in unemployment.</PARA></TALK.START>

That is something which the Minister ignores or does not know. It is a pity that he did not get his facts straight but the Government is not known for its pursuit of truth.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to endorse the remarks of my colleague the honourable member for Wills, I wish to draw the attention of the House to the tragedy that is caused by the Government's obsession with so-called small government. One of the effects of this policy is the loss of one very important means of creating jobs, namely through government sponsored projects. The result of this is that the Minister now faces the prospect of presenting to the people a number of ill-co-ordinated projects that, in the spirit of hope springing eternal, will supposedly alleviate the unemployment horrors facing the youth of this country. The rather obsequious attitude that he and the Government adopt towards the moguls of industry is nauseating. It is even more so for the unemployed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In September 1981 the level of youth unemployment-those aged 15 to 19 years-was 115,000 or 14.6 per cent of the youth population. That compares with the figure of 136,400 or 16.8 per cent of the youth population in September 1980. The Minister uses these figures to demonstrate that an improvement has been made. How does he explain away the apparent demographic shift in our population? The teenage labour force which was 809,800 in September 1980 has actually fallen to 786,400 in September 1981. In other words, the pattern of youth unemployment is not as the Government would have the nation believe. There were 23,000 fewer young people in the work force in September 1981 than there were in September 1980. When the Government claims that there has been a heartening reduction in youth unemployment of 21,400 it is not telling us the true story-not surprisingly. The total number of teenagers employed in September 1981 was actually 2,000 fewer than in the corresponding period of 1980. Anybody can do things with Commonwealth Employment Service figures. Added to this picture of deceit, there has been a reduction of 9,600 in the number of teenagers in full time employment to 515,000. That is a reduction of 1.8 per cent. Yet the number of people in part time employment is 155,900, an increase of 7,600. The Minister is obviously proud of the possible career opportunities for part time employees in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> We have not been given the true picture of youth unemployment by the Minister. I wonder whether he is satisfied with it. Does the picture clearly illustrate the direction of Government policy? In all the figures which the Minister cites there is no evidence of the assortment of job training and creation programs. A lot of rhetoric is associated with them but nothing concrete. If these has been an increase in the number of participants in these programs, obviously the tide of unemployment has not been stemmed. I refer, for instance, to the pattern of unemployment for those aged 20 to 24 years. People in that group are unemployed, something which the Minister conveniently forgets. In September 1980 the figure was 85,700. In September 1981 it was 87,500, an increase of 1,800 or 2.1 per cent in the unemployment rate. The Minister harks back to 1975. If I recall, in the 1975 election campaign the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) made a promise to the nation that he would return it to full employment. Perhaps the Minister conveniently forgot that too. For those over the age of 20 who are unemployed-these people are more likely to have major financial and family commitments-the situation continues to grow worse. In September 1980 the number of people aged 20 and over who were registered for employment was 269,000. In the corresponding period in 1981 the figure was 276,100. The Minister conveniently forgets that too. This represents an increase of 7,000 persons or 2.6 per cent. The Minister is no doubt proud of that. </PARA>
<PARA> I have dealt at some length with those figures because I believe my anger at the Minister's apparent lack of concern for the plight of the unemployed reflects that of a great majority of the people in this country. It is also important to have those figures placed on the record because the national job drive for youth week which has been announced by the Minister indicates just how little he comprehends the nature of his own portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me ask him a series of questions which quite obviously trouble those who work with so much frustration in the job centres of the Commonwealth Employment Service. Is the Minister suggesting that employers have been functioning inefficiently in that they have not seen the need for new jobs? Is he saying that the CES has been inefficient in its own job search? Is the Minister concerned at the types of jobs which might be noted during this week? Will he be satisfied with a further increase in the tendency towards part time jobs? What steps has the Minister taken to ensure that jobs posted are not just normal Christmas or holiday jobs? Will notification of these jobs be taken as jobs filled? How will the Minister discriminate between those jobs normally expected to become vacant during the job search and those that would have been expected in the normal course of events? What a pity that the Government has no specific job creation programs. </PARA>
<PARA> There is some evidence that the Government's training programs have not created new jobs but that, in many instances, programs such as the Special Youth Employment Training Program have resulted in a loss of jobs for older workers. In other words, some employers have taken advantage of the scheme by using young people at lower rates of pay at the expense of older workers. Of course, the Government really knows little about this because the last evaluation study of the SYETP was undertaken in 1979. </PARA>
<PARA> On 6 October 1981, the Minister visited Ballarat to officiate at the opening of the relocated job centre where he went through the usual, and by now tedious, exhortation to employers to create new jobs. Employers in my electorate say that they are doing that anyway. But in addition to the task of opening the job centre, the Minister met a deputation of Ballarat people from a range of groups concerned with job creation. The request of the deputation concerned the need for current unemployment and employment figures. It was recognised by this group that for regions such as Ballarat, for cities such as Maryborough and for towns such as Kyneton and Daylesford, these statistics are invaluable. We need those figures for manpower planning, to understand changes occurring in manpower planning, the participation rate of various groups in the work force and the needs of industry as matched with manpower resources on a planned basis. </PARA>
<PARA> We in that area believe that these figures help us also in planning the provision of supportive services for the unemployed. We also believe that the current monitoring of the State and composition of the work force is vital to the future of these cities and towns. The obstinacy of the Government in this matter of refusing to provide these necessary statistics places the welfare of businesses, workers and their families in jeopardy. When last the statistics were provided 10 per cent of the work force was unemployed in Maryborough, 8.7 per cent was unemployed in Kyneton and 9.5 per cent was unemployed in Ballarat. Youth unemployment in Ballarat was 45 per cent of the total and was in excess of 20 per cent of the possible youth work force. I, and many others, cannot but believe that the Government's refusal to provide these figures is based not upon deficiencies in the statistics claimed, but rather on its reluctance to recognise that the problem of unemployment owes so much to the Government's own obsessively myopic policies. </PARA>
<PARA> Our people in Ballarat have consistently tried to make the Government's policies work but because programs such as the SYETP and the extended SYETP are reactive only and not preventive and because each program is temporary and is not being monitored, the people of Ballarat feel that they have been let down seriously, and that echoes the opinion of people throughout the length and breadth of this nation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on this matter of public importance with a feeling of deep disappointment, disappointment that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) in public statements, and other members of the Opposition, should continue to oppose incentives undertaken by the Government to try to decrease unemployment. In trying to put forward my argument I will not cite statistics because I can put forward statistics as good as those put forward by the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke). To do so would tend only to confuse people listening to the debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are all aware in Australia that although we have an economy that is the envy of the world, we have problems brought about by a number of complex factors, including monetary pressures which exist outside Australia but which nevertheless have an effect on Australia. The present Government is, by a number of strategies, trying to tread a path which, although not popular with some, will stand Australia in good stead in the years that lie ahead. It is a fact that not only do today's monetary problems face us but we have also been left with the debt legacy of 1975 which we are still trying to overcome. </PARA>
<PARA> No person, no community and certainly no government or Opposition likes unemployment. There are still some amongst us who remember the Great Depression and others like me, too young to remember, who are aware of the great scars it placed on their parents and grandparents. We all have people in our electorates who, to a greater or lesser extent, cannot find work, and I mention in particular the young. If we have any feelings at all, and I believe we have, we are affected daily by this fact. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government is exploring a number of avenues to overcome, where possible, the aspects of unemployment. Over the last few months we have heard in this House of the dramatic increases in youth training projects to be funded by the Federal Government. For example, in 1981-82 this emphasis will continue through work experience programs, spending on which will be increased from $41.3m to $65.1m-a 58 per cent increase over the last financial year. All the promises made by the Government in its 1980 policy speech in this area have been honoured to the letter. A higher level of subsidy is available to employers under the Special Youth Employment Training Program to assist longer term unemployed young people to obtain work experience over 34 weeks. This measure was introduced in February 1981 and it is expected that some 12,000 young people will be approved for it in the present financial year. The transition allowance was also introduced in February 1981 to provide an incentive for young unemployed people to return to relevant education and training in technical and further education colleges. Expenditure on this allowance will increase from $4.7m to $13m in 1981-82. It is estimated that this will enable some 17,000 young people to be approved to take advantage of the expansion in the School to Work Transition Program which the Commonwealth has set as its objective in 1982. We could go on and on about such measures. </PARA>
<PARA> Some criticism has been made of this area for one reason or another but it should be remembered that it is the employer who determines what skills his employees are required to have. In most cases no skills means no jobs. So in the difficult employment situation in which this nation finds itself, although minimal compared with the situation in other countries, any unemployment is still abhorrent to all Australians worthy of the name. Any responsible action to try to find employment, particularly for the young and more importantly for family bread-winners, is worth a try. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be pointed out, however, that the labour market has performed much better under the policies of this Government. Over the last 12 months full time employment has increased by a very substantial 115,800 or 2.2 per cent. This can be compared with the loss of 81,000 full time jobs in the last year of Labor government. I do not blame the Labor Government for this. It found itself in a difficult situation and, in trying to overcome it, used a philosophy on which the Australian Labor Party is based. This experiment failed but surely the Labor Party has learnt from its experience. We are looking for a long term employment situation, not a short term facade propped up by government funding which can only harm the long term job prospects of the Australian population. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been in this Parliament only a short time and I am still viewing the Parliament and its processes very much with an outside eye. I am one who agrees with the general public that there is too much grandstanding by politicians on matters which are too important for that liberty to be taken. This is one such subject. I believe that the Government in its national job drive for youth, in its campaign Job Week '81, will contact a number of those employers who may have become blase about the whole unemployment situation and will make many people in the community think about the problem. One of the main strengths of the Community Youth Support Scheme, which most of us agree was an outstanding success, was the degree of community support and involvement that it engendered. In fact, if it had not been for that community support and involvement CYSS could no longer exist. It is because the Government has challenged the community to take part in Job Week '81 that it will be a success. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the statement by the Leader of the Opposition about the scheme which was taken from a transcript of the Australian Broadcasting Commission national news of 26 October. He called it a phoney undertaking drummed up for publicity. The Leader of the Opposition uses, in fact overuses this word 'phoney' and, as a fellow member of parliament, I worry about that. As far as his criticism of publicity goes, of course we need publicity to get the message across to potential employers. I think everyone would acknowledge the use that publicity plays in that field. The honourable member said that the Government will achieve nothing by putting the responsibility for jobs on employers or the unemployed. I think every Australian has to accept responsibility for his or her neighbour's welfare. We know from a number of areas that too much Government involvement has caused more problems than it has solved. </PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition said that the Government should create jobs for the unemployed. As job creation tends to indicate the making of something out of nothing, as good as this Government's management may be, the concept of creating jobs is unreal and recent history has shown it to be undesirable. We all remember that the Leader of the Opposition's Budget terminated the Regional Employment Development scheme less than a year after its introduction simply because of a number of policies at the time which placed a tremendous strain on the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot remember any abuse being directed towards the unemployed by any honourable member of this House. I am sure that the term 'dole bludger' was not coined in this House. We need policies to get the economy going. The Government has these policies but they are not policies which will be short lived and result in greater long term unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Government's action in undertaking Job Week '81. I thank and congratulate all those who are taking part in accepting their share of community responsibility. I am sure that it can only have a good effect. I am one who believes that all of the best bowlers are not on the one side. I hope that in the future we will hear some realistic and constructive suggestions from the Opposition, particularly from its leadership, so that Australia's unemployed feel that they are not just a statistic over which government and opposition parties can score points. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA> The main purpose of this Bill is to authorise the payment of interest-free non-repayable capital grants totalling $435.75m to the States in 1981-82. This amount represents the grant component of the Loan Council program for State governments in 1981-82 and is one-third of the total program of $1,307.25m agreed at the June 1981 Loan Council meeting. The Bill also provides for the payment of capital grants in the first six months of 1982-83 up to an amount equal to one-half of the 1981-82 amount, pending passage of legislation to authorise grants in 1982-83. In keeping with past practice, payments authorised under this Bill may be made from the Consolidated Revenue Fund or from the Loan Fund, and appropriate borrowing authority is included. </PARA>
<PARA> These proposed grants represent a continuation of arrangements initiated by the Liberal-Country Party Government in June 1970, which provide that a proportion of the State governments' Loan Council program should take the form of interest-free non-repayable grants instead of what would otherwise be interest-bearing borrowings by the States. The effect of the grants is to relieve the State of debt charges, that is, interest payments and sinking fund contributions, which they would otherwise have to pay, and the grants accordingly have a substantial beneficial effect on the States' financial positions. The grants were introduced to help States finance works such as schools, and other capital works from which debt charges are not normally recovered. The States are, however, entirely free to apply these grants as they choose. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the general context in which this Bill is being introduced. As I have mentioned, the grants which are the subject of this Bill comprise one-third of the States' Loan Council borrowing programs in 1981-82. The Loan Council, at its June 1981 meeting, approved a State governments' program of $1,307.25m for 1981-82, of which two-thirds, namely $871.5m, comprise borrowings and one-third, $435.75m, is to be provided as capital grants to the States. These amounts are the same as approved in 1980-81. </PARA>
<PARA> It is misleading, however, to consider the States' Loan Council borrowings in isolation. As with all forms of funds made available to the States, a direct comparison with last year can only be made in the overall context, including total Commonwealth budget funds provided to the States and borrowings by State authorities. Funds to the States from the Commonwealth Budget are estimated to total $12,791m in 1981-82, an increase of 8.5 per cent. This represents nearly one-third of estimated Commonwealth Budget outlays this year. Payments to or for the States in addition to the general purpose capital funds and borrowings are expected to increase by 9.6 per cent to $11,484m in 1981-82. All but $4,477m of this involves general purpose funds which may, of course, be spent by the States however they see fit, including on capital works projects. Moreover, the arrangements this year see a considerable reduction in the relative importance of specific purpose payments, so much so that overall Commonwealth general purpose payments to the States-payments which can be allocated by the States themselves between recurrent and capital expenditure-are estimated to increase by 28 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> At its June 1981 meeting, the Loan Council also approved an increase in the larger State semi-government authorities' borrowing programs of 11.2 per cent to $2,098.3m for 1981-82, which includes infrastructure borrowings for such authorities of $806.7m. The decisions of the June 1981 Loan Council meeting on public sector borrowings must finally be seen against the background of re-emerging inflationary pressures-pressures which if allowed to grow unchecked could quickly undermine the current recovery and threaten further development that is in the pipeline. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, the package of funds to the States in 1981-82, including the Loan Council borrowing programs, has been carefully designed both within the constraints of the Commonwealth's continuing policy of responsible restraint on public sector spending and with a view to giving the States further flexibility in determining their own priorities. This Bill is an important measure in these overall arrangements for Commonwealth assistance to the States. I commend it to honourable members. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill embodies the Government's main Budget proposals for improvements in the field of social service pensions and benefits. The Bill reflects the priority given by the Government to ensuring assistance is provided to high need groups. It provides additional assistance for the children of large families and refugee children, pensioners who are paying high private rents and for certain unemployment beneficiaries. </PARA>
<PARA> The major provisions of the Bill will: Increase the maximum rate of supplementary assistance and supplementary allowances for pensioners and supporting parents and sickness beneficiaries who pay private rent, and vary the method of calculating entitlement; extend to wife's pension the same general requirements as to physical presence and residence in Australia that apply for age and invalid pensions; increase the rates of family allowances for third and subsequent children and for children in institutions; extend the circumstances in which double orphan's pension is payable in respect of refugee children; prevent payment of unemployment benefit to the spouse of a person, where the person is engaged in industrial action or has had benefit refused, cancelled or postponed in certain circumstances but in cases of severe financial hardship provide for payment of special benefit to the spouse at the single rate; and increase the rate of unemployment benefit for those aged 18 and over without dependants. </PARA>
<PARA> These measures and those announced in the Budget but not requiring amendment of the Social Services Act demonstrate the Government's continuing commitment to assisting those in the community in greatest need. In this Budget alone the Government has allocated $9,865m to pensions, benefits and other welfare payments and services provided through the Department of Social Security. Notwithstanding overall restraints on Government expenditure, this represents an increase of $1,265m on what was spent in 1980-81. The main reason for this rise, apart from increases in the numbers of pensioners and beneficiaries, is the automatic indexation of the major pensions and benefits introduced by the Government in 1976 to maintain the base rates of these payments. The full year costs of pension indexation are estimated to be $716m for increases that will be payable from November 1981 and May 1982 and the Budget allocation includes a sum of $281m to provide for these rises during the remainder of the 1981-82 financial year. These figures illustrate not only the cost but also the degree of the Government's commitment to its policy of protecting basic pensions against inflation. The Government regards automatic rises in the basic rate of pensions and benefits in line with consumer price index increases as a crucial element in ensuring social justice for people whose major or only source of income support is their pension. Since coming into office in 1975 the Government's application of its indexation policy has meant that the standard rate of pension has risen by $27.90, or over 70 per cent, in line with consumer price index movements. Sickness benefits for single people aged 18 years and over and unemployment benefits for those single people aged 18 years and over with dependants have been adjusted in the same way Pension and benefit rates for married persons have also been indexed. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the area of supplementary assistance and allowance. As honourable members are aware, a pensioner, including a supporting parent's beneficiary, who has little or no income apart from the pension and who pays rent or for lodgings may presently receive supplementary assistance to a maximum of $5 a week: One dollar of assistance is payable for each $1 of rent with a maximum payment of $5 a week; but $1 of assistance is withdrawn for every $1 of income in excess of a $1 'free area' for single pensioners and $1 for every $2 above the first $2 for pensioner couples. Supplementary allowance is payable on a similar basis to a sickness beneficiary who has been in receipt of benefit for a continuous period of six weeks. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is conscious that low income pensioners paying unsubsidised market rents are among the most needy groups in the community. Accordingly, the Government has decided to act to increase the maximum level of assistance available from $5 to $8 a week and to change the income test. It will also remove the overlap created by the independent development of supplementary assistance and rent rebates-or equivalent subsidies-as dual forms of assistance to pensioners renting public housing. As I have indicated, we have decided to increase the maximum rate of assistance from $5 to $8 a week and to liberalise the income test on it. Under the existing income test arrangements a single pensioner or a sickness beneficiary eligible for supplementary assistance-allowance loses all of any income between $1 and $6 a week. To provide some incentive for pensioners to obtain small amounts of private income this provision will be replaced by a tapered income test. The maximum amount of supplementary assistance-allowance otherwise payable will be reduced by one-half of income. In future, supplementary assistance-allowance will be payable at the rate of one-half of rent above $10 a week to the maximum of $8. For example, a person paying $14 a week rent will be entitled to maximum assistance of $2, at $20 he will receive $5 and the maximum of $8 when rent is $26 or more. The maximum rate at which the assistance may be payable having been established, the income test will then operate to reduce this maximum rate by half the amount of any income. </PARA>
<PARA> The rent rebate formulae used by State and Territory housing authorities mean that such pensioners are required to pay only 17 to 20 per cent of their incomes as rent. The average value of rent rebates for State public housing at June 1980 has been estimated at over $16 a week. Since pensioners renting from State housing authorities receive rebates in excess of supplementary assistance on rents which are often, before rebate, less than private rentals it is proposed to concentrate assistance on pensioners paying high private rentals. Consistent with this, it was also decided to take action to direct supplementary assistance away from pensioners and beneficiaries who pay only nominal rents. Pensioners paying rents of $10 a week or less would not generally be any worse off than home owners and could be expected to pay rents of this level from their basic pension. Those paying rents of between $10 and $20 a week would receive assistance under the new arrangements although less than at current rates. Rents in this range are still well below market rates. In addition, because a subsidy rate of $1 for each $1 of rent paid may encourage landlords to increase rents in line with any increase in supplementary assistance, the rate of subsidy has been changed to one-half of rent above $10 a week. This is intended to reduce incentives to increase rent while increasing assistance to pensioners paying higher rents. </PARA>
<PARA> Even with the redirection of available assistance, the increased rate and liberalised income test will mean an increase in expenditure of some $50m in the first full year. This cost also reflects the Government's decision that the changes will not operate to the disadvantage of those already receiving supplementary assistance-allowance. All current recipients, when the new provisions commence, will be able to continue to receive payments according to present rates and conditions until such time as they cease to qualify under these conditions or would benefit from the new arrangements. The estimated cost of protecting the current entitlements of recipients of assistance who would otherwise have been made worse off is of the order of $30m. Over 300,000 pensioners and beneficiaries paying rents in the private sector are estimated to benefit from the new arrangements. Approximately 130,000 current recipients are expected to continue to receive their current rate of supplementary assistance due to the savings provision. </PARA>
<PARA> The new provisions will take effect from February 1982. The Government has decided also to increase the rate of the incentive allowance which is payable in lieu of supplementary assistance-allowance to everyone receiving a sheltered employment allowance. The rate of this income test free allowance will also be increased in February 1982 from $5 a week to $8 a week. Some 8,300 handicapped people in sheltered workshops will benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill contains provisions to overcome certain deficiencies in the existing legislation relating to a wife's pension; this is a pension payable to the wife of an age or invalid pensioner who is not qualified for an age or invalid pension in her own right. To qualify for all other pensions a person must both reside in Australia and be physically present in Australia at the time of lodging a claim. Prior to 1973, pensions generally could not be paid to people outside Australia. With the introduction of portability provisions this situation changed and, as it was not necessary to lodge a claim for a wife's pension, it became possible for a wife's pension to be granted to a woman living in another country. This unintentional consequence became apparent upon the receipt of legal advice. Thus, as presently drafted, the legislation permits the automatic grant of a wife's pension without the need to make a claim and regardless of the wife's place of residence. Thus, we have the rather anomalous situation whereby a wife's pension can be granted to a woman who has never been to Australia and has no intention of coming here. To overcome this anomaly the Bill proposes to extend to a wife's pension the same general requirement as to physical presence and residence in Australia for the grant and commencement of pension that apply for age and invalid pensioners. As a result, a wife's pension will not be payable overseas unless pension is granted prior to departure from Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one exception to the rule that an applicant for an age or invalid pension must be residing in and physically present in Australia on the date the claim is lodged. This exception applies where a person who is in special need of financial assistance ceased to reside in Australia before 8 May 1973, the date the general portability provisions were introduced. Where a pension is granted to such a man, the Bill proposes that the wife's pension will be payable to his wife. The changes in relation to a wife's pension will come into operation on 1 November 1981. Women overseas in receipt of a wife's pension at that date will continue to receive the pension. The Government's commitment to the welfare of Australian families is reflected in the Bill, which provides real and very substantial increases in the rates of family allowances payable in the case of larger families as from January 1982. The rate of family allowances payable in respect of the third and fourth children of a family has been increased from $26 to $39 a month, an increase of 50 per cent. The amount of $39 a month will also be payable in respect of children in institutions. In respect of the fifth and subsequent children of a family, the increase is from $30.35 to $45.55 a month. Additional family allowance will be paid in respect of some 780,000 children in 540,000 familes-containing almost half of Australia's children. The cost of this initiative will be $62m in the current financial year, representing $124m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA> To meet a particular problem with respect to refugee children who are not technically orphans but whose contact with their parents is effectively broken, the conditions governing double orphan's pension will be altered to extend the provisions to them. As honourable members will be aware, a person who has the care of a child both of whose parents are dead, or where one parent is dead and the whereabouts of the other are unknown, is entitled to a double orphan's pension of $55.70 a month. In the case of a refugee child, it is often a question of not knowing whether the parents are alive or dead or not knowing where they are. In some cases the parents are known to be overseas, but the parent and the child cannot be reunited and the parent cannot provide economic support. The circumstances of these children are similar to those of a double orphan and so the Government proposes to pay a double orphan's pension to people who are caring for refugee children whose parents are not in Australia or whose whereabouts are unknown. The rate of the pension is $55.70 a month and, like family allowances, is not subject to an income test or to income tax. Payment is made in respect of children under 16 years of age and dependent full time students aged 16 years and over and under 25 years of age. </PARA>
<PARA> I would now like to deal with the provisions of the Bill relating to unemployment and special benefits. Honourable members will be aware that, prior to October 1979, the Social Services Act precluded payment of unemployment benefit to a person who was a direct participant in a strike. However, it enabled unemployment benefit to be paid at the married rate to the spouse of a person ineligible for unemployment benefit on those grounds. The Act was subsequently amended to provide that unemployment benefit payable to the spouse of a person engaged in industrial action was to be at the single rate. A further amendment precluded payment of special benefit to a person not qualified to receive unemployment benefit because of industrial action. The present legislation permits a situation in which trade unions can choose to strike knowing that through the operation of the social security system their members will be largely insulated from the effect of their actions. The Australian public for its part is attacked from two directions. First, it has to bear the personal disruptions, inconveniences and associated cost brought about by the strike. In addition, it is then called upon to meet the cost of providing ancome support for the families of those involved in that industrial action. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, there is no good reason why the community should automatically and immediately be expected to assume the normal financial responsibilities of those who are not willing to work, who voluntarily and without good reason give up their job or who are dismissed through misconduct. This is happening at present where the spouses of such persons register for employment in their own right and, if unable to obtain employment, attract unemployment benefit both for themselves and for their dependent spouses. There have been numerous cases where wives of strikers who have appeared to have no genuine intention of joining the work force have registered for work in places such as mining and construction towns where there is no real possibility of employment for them. This has enabled them under the present legislation to obtain unemployment benefit thus transferring to the taxpayer some of the real cost of the industrial action taken by their husbands. Accordingly, the Bill proposes that a person will be ineligible for unemployment benefit for as long as the person's spouse is disqualified from receiving unemployment benefit because of the spouse being involved in industrial action or being unwilling to undertake suitable work or not taking reasonable steps to obtain such work. Additionally, a person will be ineligible for unemployment benefit for as long as payment of that benefit to the person's spouse is postponed due to misconduct as a worker, becoming voluntarily unemployed or failing to accept an offer of suitable employment. </PARA>
<PARA> Consistent with this approach concerning payment of unemployment benefit, special benefit will be withheld from persons not eligible for unemployment benefit in these circumstances, although the Government has decided that the spouse of a person precluded from unemployment benefit and special benefit may be eligible for special benefit at the single rate, with additional benefit for any children of a couple. The basic rates of unemployment benefit for those aged 18 years and over with dependants, and those under 18 years of age who are married, are subject to automatic increases twice yearly as a result of the indexation provisions introduced into the Social Services Act by this Government. However, the maximum rate of unemployment benefit for persons aged 18 years and over without dependants is not indexed. The Government has decided to increase this rate by $4.65 a week from $53.45 to $58.10 a week. The Bill makes provision for this increase, which will apply from the first payment period after 1 November 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the matter of people disposing of income or arranging their affairs in such a manner that they avoid the receipt of income in order to qualify for a pension or for fringe benefits. Pensions are paid subject to an income test and the Government is determined to ensure that the income test operates as it was intended to operate. In other words, it is committed to see that the income test remains an effective mechanism for directing taxpayers' funds to those in greatest need. The Social Services Act already contains provisions which are designed to counter attempts to circumvent the income test. However, due to the proliferation and active marketing of sophisticated and contrived schemes in recent times, these provisions have been found to be inadequate in certain respects and accordingly the Government intends to strengthen these provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) has already announced that it has been found necessary to delay the introduction of these amendments. The delay has been necessitated because of the Government's commitment to see that the proposed measures will work equitably in practice, will not affect the normal everyday financial transactions of bona fide pensioners and will not impose undue restraints upon the way in which such pensioners manage their normal financial affairs. Given these policy parameters and the extremely wide range of financial arrangements which are available to individuals in a free market economy, the preparation of legislation which achieves these ends, yet prevents abuse of the system, proved more complicated than was anticipated. As the Minister for Social Security has already indicated, work is continuing on this matter and he is confident that the legislation will be introduced during the next session of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is aware, however, that there is a deal of concern as to the likely structure and impact of the proposed legislation. In an earlier statement of 18 August, the Minister for Social Security indicated that the proposed provisions would not penalise people who liquidate income-producing assets for such reasonable purposes as the purchase of a home or a car or to finance a holiday. Similarly, the Minister said that there would not be any restriction on people keeping reasonable amounts of money in non-interest bearing forms, such as cheque accounts. The Director-General, with whom the discretion in this matter resides, has indicated that he would not regard it as unreasonable to retain in a form such as a current cheque account amounts of less than $2,000 for a single person and $3,000 for a married couple. He still has under consideration whether higher amounts would be regarded as reasonable. Some flexibility would, of course, be necessary to cover situations where amounts held in a cheque account could be higher than the levels indicated for reasons not related to pension entitlement, for example, between the sale of one home and the purchase of another. I point out also to honourable members that it is not proposed that the legislation should penalise people who choose to hold their investments in savings accounts, even though higher rates of interest might be obtainable elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst it is necessary to postpone the announcement of the details of other operational aspects of the proposed legislation, I would hope that the outline I have given will prove to be valuable in setting to rest the minds of many of our elderly citizens. This Bill reflects the Government's concern to assist those in greatest need in the community at a time when the Government is conscious of the need for overall expenditure restraint. Our approach has been to maintain a steady course while introducing worthwhile improvements for those whose circumstances are such as to justify a special focus of assistance. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill combines two measures relating to health expenditure. First, it provides for an amendment of the National Health Act 1953 to increase the general patient contribution for pharmaceutical benefits. This was announced by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) in his Budget Speech. The other matter was foreshadowed by the Acting Minister for Health (Senator Peter Baume) in his announcement in the Senate on 16 September and relates to the supply of pharmaceuticals in public hospitals under the new health funding arrangements. Honourable members will be aware that these arrangements came into operation on 1 September this year. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the increase in the general patient contribution for pharmaceutical benefits, I draw honourable members' attention to clause 3 of the Bill. That clause will increase from $2.75 to $3.20 the maximum amount that approved pharmaceutical chemists may charge for the supply of a pharmaceutical benefit under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. This increase will take effect from 1 December 1981. As in the past, pensioners holding a pensioner health benefits card and their dependants will not be charged for pharmaceutical benefits. Similarly no charge will be made for sickness beneficiaries holding a health benefits card, and their dependants. It is now over two years since the patient contribution was set at $2.75 and this increase of 45c is broadly in line with movements in prices and incomes since then. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the supply of pharmaceuticals in public hospitals. Under the new health funding arrangements, annual grants are paid to each State pursuant to the States (Tax Sharing and Health Grants) Act 1981 for the provision of health services by the States. The grants include an amount towards the cost to the hospitals of supplying pharmaceuticals to all patients. The amount is related to the expenditure by States for Pharmaceuticals under the previous hospital cost sharing agreements which in most States expired on 30 June this year. To synchronise with the new health insurance arrangements the agreements continued without formal agreements until 31 August. The States are being funded for pharmaceuticals under the new arrangements to the extent that can be justified by past experience. </PARA>
<PARA> Within the National Health Act there is an alternative provision whereby hospital authorities could be reimbursed for their expenditure on pharmaceutical benefits. Section 94 authorises the approval of hospital authorities to supply pharmaceutical benefits and those authorities are entitled to a reimbursement at a level determined by the Minister under section 99. This arrangement operated until the commencement of the Commonwealth-State cost sharing agreements in 1975. Under those agreements States had agreed not to claim under section 99. In States where those agreements are no longer in force it is again open to those hospitals which have been approved to claim reimbursement. Clause 4 of the Bill would allow the Minister to revoke those approvals. In the absence of such a provision there would be no legal impediment to a duplication of funding as regards pharmaceutical benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> As announced by the Acting Minister, the amendments would allow the revocations to take effect from 16 September. He has already written to State Health Ministers to advise them of the intention to introduce this amendment into the House. As it is desired to provide discretionary powers to suspend or revoke approvals of hospital authorities it is intended that such power should rest with the Minister for Health. As a consequence it is appropriate for the power to approve hospital authorities to rest also with the Minister. Clause 4 of the Bill would effect a transfer of the power to approve hospital authorities from the permanent head to the Minister. I commend this Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill provides for amendment of the Repatriation Act and associated Acts to give effect to the Government's Budget decisions and for certain operational and machinery amendments intended to facilitate administration. In the Budget context, the service pension is to be extended to Australian mariners; repatriation benefits are to be extended to all representatives of Australia who suffer death or incapacity while serving with peacekeeping, observation and monitoring forces of the United Nations, or other recognised international body; disability pensions are to be paid to former members of the Royal Papuan Constabulary and the New Guinea Police Force; and the proportion of disability pension to be disregarded in determining eligibility for service pension and fringe benefits is to be increased. In addition, the pensions payable for amputations or loss of vision and the amounts payable for many other repatriation benefits are to be increased. Supplementary assistance known as rent allowance is to be increased. The operational and machinery amendments are simply to correct certain operational shortcomings, to clarify certain provisions and to align the legislation with modern drafting practice. I will deal with these briefly after I give details of the Budget initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA> As announced in the Budget, eligibility to receive service pension is to be extended to Australian mariners who served in a theatre of war during the 1939-45 War. An Australian mariner is broadly defined as any mariner employed under agreement in sea-going service during the 1939-45 War on a ship registered in Australia. It includes Australian mariners employed in seagoing service in a ship registered outside Australia. Persons who served in a lighthouse tender, pilot ship, hospital ship, troop transport, tug, cable ship, salvage ship, dredge, supply ship, fishing vessel or fisheries investigation vessel are included in the definition. These men were not members of the Forces but civilians who, in undertaking their normal occupation, were subject to dangers from enemy hostility. This extension of service pension will be effective from 4 February 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> Repatriation benefits are also to be extended to all representatives of Australia who serve overseas with peacekeeping, observation and monitoring forces raised or organised by the United Nations or any other international body. At present, for a member of the armed forces to be eligible to receive repatriation benefits he must have had three years effective full time service, or have been discharged medically unfit. Civilian personnel, such as members of police contingents, have no repatriation cover. This proposed amendment of the Act establishes a mechanism whereby Australian representatives performing peacekeeping or similar duties in areas outside Australia where a state of tension exists will be eligible for repatriation benefits. The extension will apply only to those members with service after 1 November 1981 in any force which on the authority of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs is designated in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette as being a peacekeeping force for the purposes of the Repatriation Act. Currently Australian peacekeeping forces are serving in the Kashmir region, the Middle East and Cyprus. Following the announcement of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) on a possible commitment of Australian forces to the Sinai peacekeeping force, the provisions in this Bill have been examined. The provisions of the Bill in relation to peacekeeping forces would not extend to such a force. The Government has agree that it will bring forward legislation in the autumn sittings to cover such a force if it is sent to Sinai. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members will be pleased that the Bill gives formal recognition by Australia of the outstanding service of former members of the Royal Papuan Constabulary and the New Guinea Police Force who, although not strictly members of the forces, served under Australian Army control from 7 December 1941 to 31 December 1945. Disability pensions will be paid to these verterans from the date the Royal Assent is given and under the same conditions as apply to other Papuans and New Guineans who served as members of the Australian forces during World War II. Last year, the Government introduced a measure that was widely welcomed by the ex-service community. It provided that only half of a disability pension be taken into account in determining eligibility for fringe benefits. The Government has decided that the proposition of any disability pension disregarded when assessing eligibility for fringe benefits and service pension is to be increased to 60 per cent from 1 January 1982, thus enabling more persons to become eligible for the service pension and still retain fringe benefits. In addition, this measure will increase that amount of service pension paid to many veterans receiving disability pensions for incapacities suffered because of their service. </PARA>
<PARA> Provision has been made in the Bill for increases in many other repatriation benefits to severely disabled veterans and pensions paid to orphans with effect from 12 November 1981. Over each of the past three years these benefits have been increased and thus protected recipients against the effects of inflation. The pension paid for amputations or loss of vision, which is payable in addition to the repatriation disability pension or service pension, is to be increased by approximately 9 per cent in respect of the various categories of disablement. Also, the rate of attendant's allowance is to be increased from $19.32 to $21.02 a week in the case of a veteran who is blind or is suffering a cerebro-spinal injury. In the case of a veteran who has had both arms amputated or is blind and has lost hearing or speech, the allowance is to be increased from $38.65 to $42.05 a week. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for the maximum amount of supplementary assistance, known as rent allowance, payable to a service pensioner to be increased from $5 to $8 a week from the first pension payday in February 1982. From that date supplementary assistance will be made available only if the amount of rent paid by a veteran exceeds $10 a week, at a rate of 50c for each $1 of rent above that amount. These changes are similar to those which will apply to pensioners of the Department of Social Security. The Government recognised that some pensioners currently receiving supplementary assistance could be financially disadvantaged because of the changes to the eligibility criteria and decided that payments would continue to be made to them at the existing rate. Overall the increased benefit will assist many who face increased rent charges. Other increases affecting veterans announced in the Budget, including increases in funeral benefits, clothing allowance, and recreation transport allowance, are to be provided for by the Regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> I now will refer briefly to the operational and machinery amendments contained in this Bill. Provision is made to bring the terms and conditions of service of persons appointed to the Repatriation Commission and Repatriation Boards into line with those currently applied to other statutory appointees. Provision is also made to simplify and facilitate the processing and hearing of applications for the review of decisions of the Repatriation Commission and Repatriation Boards by the Repatriation Review Tribunal. Certain provisions relating to the review of decisions by the Repatriation Review Tribunal and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal will be clarified. In addition, the Bill corrects certain operational shortcomings and aligns the legislation with modern drafting practice. In conclusion, this Bill reflects the Government's continuing concern to see that those who have served their country in times of war or war-like operations, are appropriately compensated for any losses they have suffered or sacrifices they have made. It reflects this Government's belief that the main pensions and allowances directed toward the more seriously incapacitated and needy veterans should be kept under continuous review to ensure that these are not permitted to be eroded as a result of inflation. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA>On behalf of the Government I have made a reference to the Grants Commission to review its report on State tax sharing entitlements of June 1981. The matter has been settled with the Premiers with a view to having the Commission's report available for consideration at the June 1982 Premiers Conference. The Commission has been asked to report by 31 May 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> The report was the work of an enlarged Commission, consisting of the Chairman, the two part time permanent members, and three associate members. With the lapsing of the enabling legislation on 30 June last, the appointments of the associate members lapsed also. State governments have expressed the view that for the purpose of the review the Commission should have the same composition as for the report. This Bill will enable sufficient appointments to be made for the Commission to be constituted on that basis. As the Act presently stands the Commission is limited to four members in addition to the Chairman. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment will also open the way to make appointments for any other inquiries the Commission may be called on to undertake. Currently the Government has decided to request the Commission to undertake an inquiry into the finances of the Australian Capital Territory, and the amendment will permit the appointment of further members specifically for that inquiry.

<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to extend the operation of the Nitrogenous Fertilizers Subsidy Scheme, which is due to expire on 31 December 1981, for a further six-month period until 30 June 1982. The existing subsidy rate of $20 per tonne of nitrogen content will continue to be payable for the new period. This subsidy was first introduced in 1966, with the aim of reducing costs to the users of the fertiliser, and to encourage its use in new applications. The fertiliser is used extensively by sugar and grain producers in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of the future operation of the nitrogenous fetilisers subsidy is currently under inquiry by the Industries Assistance Commission. The reporting date on the inquiry, which was to be 16 October 1981, has been extended to coincide with the reporting date of 28 February 1982 for the associated IAC inquiry into phosphatic fertilisers. This action was taken because of the commonality of the issues involved in both references. </PARA>
<PARA> The extension of the operation of the nitrogenous fertilisers subsidy as proposed by this Bill will give the legislation the same expiry date as the phosphatic fertilisers legislation. It is also expected to provide sufficient time for the Government to reach a decision on both fertiliser reports and introduce any resulting legislation into the Parliament before the common expiry date of 30 June 1982. The cost to the Government of this subsidy for the further period is estimated to be between $2m and $2.5m. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> Other provisions go to matters of substance in varying degrees-as indeed did the Statute Law Revision Act 1981-but they are regarded as suitable, in the interests of legislative expedition, for inclusion in an omnibus measure of this kind. The provisions of the present Badl that deal with the matters of statute law revision in the narrowest sense do not call for particular comment. I propose to explain in some detail the nature and effect of the other provisions, taking them in the order in which they appear in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>Aboriginal Councils and Associations Act 1976</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The principal purpose of the proposed amendments to the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Act 1976 is to remove a constraint which prevented, even with the Minister's approval, councils and associations incorporated under the Act from selling, mortgaging or otherwise disposing of their assets to non-Aboriginal bodies or individuals. (Quorum formed). Although originally included in the Act to protect land provided for Aboriginals by the Commonwealth against unwarranted disposal, the constraint has been counter-productive to the social and economic development of Aboriginals. The consent of the Minister will be required in the situations dealt with by the amendments. I should add that nothing in the amendments would place in jeopardy land held under the Aboriginal Land Rights Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Australian Capital Territory Evidence (Temporary Provisions) Act 1971</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Clause 11 amends the Australian Capital Territory Evidence (Temporary Provisions) Act 1971 so as to allow the provisions of the Evidence Ordinance 1971 of the Territory to be amended or repealed by an ordinance of the Territory. The Evidence Ordinance 1971 contains comprehensive rules of evidence for civil and criminal proceedings in the Australian Capital Territory. The Ordinance was disallowed by the Senate in 1971 but its provisions were kept in force by the Act because the disallowance had left the Territory without adequate evidence laws for criminal trials. However, the Act did not provide for any amendment of the provisions of the Ordinance. At present those provisions have the status of an Act and can be aeended only by an Act of the Parliament. Moreover, difficulties can arise in the inclusion of desirable evidence provisions in other Territory ordinances because of possible invalidity due to inconsistency with the Evidence Ordinance. The amendment will remedy this situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Early in 1972 the then Attorney-General introduced a Bill for an Act to replace the Ordinance but the Bill was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs for consideration and was not enacted. Following a recommendation of the Committee, the law of evidence applicable in proceedings in Federal and Territory courts was referred to the Law Reform Commission in 1979 for review and report. The Commission's report is not expected for some time. The amendment proposed by the Bill is an interim measure only, pending the report of the Law Reform Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court Act 1933</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Part VI of the Bill makes four amendments to the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court Act 1933. Clause 14 amends section 10 of the Act to enable a new judge of the Court to take the oaths or affirmations of allegiance and of office before another judge of the Court, a justice of the High Court or a judge of the Federal Court of Australia. This amendment will remove the need for the Governor-General to appoint, each time a new judge is appointed, a person before whom the judge may take the oaths or affirmations. Clause 15 inserts a new provision dealing with the delivery of reserved judgments. The new provision will enable reserved judgments of the Court constituted by three or more judges to be delivered by any one of them, thereby removing the need to reassemble the whole of the Court merely for the purposes of delivery of the judgment. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 16 deals with prosecution of indictable offences triable before the Supreme Court. Section 53 of the Supreme Court Act now provides for such offences to be prosecuted by information in the name of the Attorney-General or such other person as the Governor-General appoints if that behalf. The amendment to be made by clause 16 will remove the need for an appointment to be made by the Governor-General and enable an appointment to be made by the Attorney-General by instrument in writing. Clause 17 inserts a new section 53A, which provides that, unless good cause is shown to the contrary, upon application, the Court is to include, in any judgment for a pecuniary amount, an amount in respect of interest. The amount of interest is to be within the discretion of the Court and the interest is to be calculated, as the Court thinks fit, on the whole or any part of the money for the whole or any part of the period between the date the cause of action arose and the date of judgment. A lump sum may be ordered in lieu of such interest. </PARA>
<PARA>Australian Overseas Projects Corporation Act 1978</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Part VII of the Bill provides for cetain amendments to the Australian Overseas Projects Corporation Act 1978 to rectify a number of legislative deficiencies which have become apparent in the course of the Corporation's operations. The amendments embrace four particular areas of concern and propose: (i) an expanded definition of 'development project' as contained in the Act to include projects concerned solely with the supply of services; (ii) the inclusion of a provision to enable the Corporation to engage directly in negotiations on overseas projects with overseas clients at the request of the Australian Government; (iii) the inclusion of a provision to enable the Corporation under certain circumstances to act at the request of an authority of the Commonwealth or a State government; and (iv) the replacement of the maximum contingent liability concept in the Act which has proved difficult to define precisely in terms of the Corporation's activities with the concept of assessed net commercial risk. The effect of implementing these amendments will be to enable the Corporation to operate more effectively and in line with the original objectives of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>Bankruptcy Act 1966</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The South Australian Government has asked that bankruptcy matters in that State should be taken over by the Federal Court of Australia. At present bankruptcy matters there are heard before the State Court of Insolvency, in which a judge of the South Australian District and Criminal Courts sits part time. The purpose of clauses 28 to 30 of the Bill is to transfer all matters pending before the State Court of Insolvency into the Federal Court from a date to be proclaimed. At the same time, it is convenient to remove the bankruptcy jurisdiction presently vested in the Victorian Court of Insolvency, which has not sat for some years. The Supreme Courts in those two States will be invested with jurisdiction in bankruptcy, bringing them into line with the Supreme Courts in the other States. In practice, however, all bankruptcy matters in Victoria and South Australia will be dealt with by the Federal Court. </PARA>
<PARA>Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> In a statement to Parliament on 7 May 1981 the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Macphee) foreshadowed amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act in relation to requirements to enrol, to vote and to nominate as a candidate for election to Parliament. Following close consultations with State governments, it has been determined that Australian citizenship is the appropriate basis for the franchise and for nomination as a candidate for election to Parliament. The Government considers that migrants, irrespective of their country of origin, should be treated equally in relation to these matters. Part IX of the Bill gives effect to these decisions. It is to come into operation on a day to be proclaimed. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to the requirements to enrol and to vote, the changes to legislation will not of themselves confer a right to vote upon any further categories of people. The only group of migrants affected by the changes will be British subjects who are not Australian citizens and who have not enrolled before the coming into operation of the legislation. In future, only Australian citizens will be entitled to enrol. I should emphasise, however, that the changes will not disenfranchise anyone. Compulsory voting will continue for all those who are on the roll at the date of commencement of the legislation. Not only will their rights be preserved, but also they will be obliged to maintain their enrolments. From date of commencement of the new provisions, membership of the Australian Parliament will be restricted to Australian citizens. </PARA>
<PARA> The introduction of these changes will constitute a further milestone in the social and political development of Australia. The changes reflect the Government's commitment to enhancing the value and status of Australian citizenship and to the consistent and non-discriminatory treatment of all migrant groups. Most States have already agreed to introduce similar legislation. It is desirable that there be a uniform commencement date across Australia for the new arrangements and it has been agreed in principle that this should be early in 1982. The actual date will be determined in conjunction with State governments. </PARA>
<PARA>Designs Amendment Act 1981</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Part X of the Bill amends the Designs Amendment Act 1981. Clause 39 operates to insert a definition of 'legal personal representative' into the Designs Act 1906, the effect of which is to remove the requirement for the executor or administrator of the estate of the deceased owner of or applicant for a design registration to obtain in the Australian Capital Territory, or elsewhere in Australia, a resealing of the grant of probate or of the letters of administration. Clause 40 first makes it clear that a separate application for design registration is to be made in respect of each article, or set of articles, for which the owner seeks design protection and, secondly, sets limitations on the type of amendments which may be made to an application for design registration. Both these provisions embody the long-accepted interpretation of the Designs Act 1906. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 41 amends the provisions allowing restoration of lapsed design registrations. Under the procedure established by the Designs Amendment Act 1981, a design registration is in force for one year from registration and can be extended, on request made in due time, for three further periods expiring six, 11 and 16 years after the date on which the application for registration was lodged. If the owner fails to meet the deadline for requesting the second or third extensions the registrations can nevertheless be restored on late application. This is not possible if the deadline for requesting the first extension is not met, but this situation is now remedied by the amendments in clause 41. The amendment in clause 42 specifically provides that the legal personal representative of the deceased owner of a design may be registered as owner, while clause 43 enables the making of regulations requiring persons to furnish statutory declarations in relation to proceedings under the Designs Act 1906. </PARA>
<PARA>Minerals (Submerged Lands) Act 1981 and Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Amendment Act 1980</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Part XIII of the Bill revises section 92 of the Minerals (Submerged Lands) Act 1981 to take account of the fact that the principal Act, which is not yet in operation, provides for imprisonment for a number of offences under the Act. The effect of the amendment is to provide that such offences shall be indictable offences, and thus triable by jury, unless the defendant and the prosecutor consent to prosecution in a court of summary jurisdiction and the court is satisfied that this is appropriate. The maximum penalty a court of summary jurisdiction may impose is imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or a fine not exceeding $10,000 or both. Part XVII of the Bill makes a similar amendment for similar reasons to the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Amendment Act 1980 concerning prosecution of offences under section 132 of the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967. The amendment has the effect of inserting a new section 132 in the 1967 Act, which is to come into effect when the 1980 Act comes into operation. </PARA>
<PARA>National Labour Consultative Council Act 1977 and Trade Union Training Authority Act 1975</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> In September 1981 the Council of Australian Government Employee Organisations-CAGEO-merged with the Australian Council of Trade Unions-ACTU-and the former body ceased to exist. The amendments in Part XV of the Bill provide for the abolition of CAGEO representation on the National Labour Consultative Council, established under the National Labour Consultative Council Act 1977. Provision is also made by Part XVIII of the Bill for the abolition of CAGEO representation on the Australian Council for Union Training and on each of the State Councils for Union Training, established under the Trade Union Training Authority Act 1975. At the same time, the amendments increase by one the number of persons representing the ACTU on the National Labour Consultative Council. They also increase by one the number of ACTU representatives on the Australian Councils for Union Training and the number of State Trades and Labor Council-TLC- representatives on the respective State Councils for Union Training. The TLCs are State branches of the ACTU. </PARA>
<PARA>Patents Act 1952</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The amendments in Schedule 1 of the Bill include amendments of the Patents Act 1952 following from Australian membership of the Patent Co-operation Treaty. The Treaty provides for Regulations to be made to prescribe matters of form, times, procedures and fees in relation to matters under the Treaty. Since Australian accession to the Treaty, the Regulations made under the Treaty have been amended and further frequent amendment is expected in the early stages of its implementation. To give effect to these amendments it is necessary that the Australian legislation be amended as the Treaty is a Schedule to the Patents Act 1952. The amendments in the Bill enable effect to be given to amendments to the regulations made under the Treaty by modifying the definition of 'Treaty' in section 58A of the Patents Act to include the Treaty Regulations as amended, subject to the amendments being declared in the Patents Regulations. The clause then empowers the Patents Regulations to make such declarations. The Schedule of the Bill also amends sub-section 58C (7) of the Patents Act 1952. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill, which is based upon a model Domicile Bill agreed upon in the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General, makes four important changes to the common law of domicile. Those four changes are:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) abolition of the rule of dependent domicile of married women;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) abolition of the rule of revival of domicile of origin;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the age of capacity to have an independent domicile is fixed at 18 years;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) new rules are provided for determining the domicile of certain children. </PARA>
<PARA> Similar legislation has been passed in the Northern Territory and all States, other than Western Australia, where it has been introduced. A person's domicile is, broadly speaking, the place where the law regards him as having his permanent home. A number of matters affecting personal capacity, such as capacity to marry and to make a will, are determined according to the law of the place in which a person is domiciled. The question where a person is domiciled is now determined according to a number of complex common law rules. At birth, a person acquires his father's domicile, if his parents are married, or his mother's domicile, if his parents are not married. </PARA>
<PARA> Other rules relate to change of domicile, for example, where a person moves from one jurisdiction to another. The common law rules do not take account of modern social attitudes relating to the rights of parties to a marriage or the custody of children, nor do they adequately reflect the increased mobility of individuals, particularly in a federation such as Australia. The Standing Committee of Attorneys-General has for some years had under consideration proposals to reform some of these common law rules to reflect more adequately modern requirements. With a view to implementing reform on a uniform basis throughout Australia, the Standing Committee prepared a model Bill. The substantive provisions of the Domicile Bill give effect to that model Bill. The successful implementation of this important project is an example of the valuable contribution the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General is able to make to law reform in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the four major changes the Bill makes to the common law rules. First, clause 6 abolishes the common law rule that a married woman has the same domicile as her husband. At common law, a woman acquires, upon marriage, the domicile of her husband and thereupon has no capacity to have an independent domicile. A wife continues to have the domicile of her husband throughout the duration of a marriage, even if the spouses permanently separate and the husband acquires a domicile, for example, in a foreign country with which the wife has no connection. It is clearly no longer appropriate that a wife's domicile should automatically be the same as that of her husband. Accordingly, the common law rule is abolished and a married woman will have an independent capacity to acquire a domicile of her own. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, clause 7 abolishes a technical common law rule known as the rule of revival of the domicile of origin. Related to this provision is the provision in clause 10 concerning intention for acquisition of a domicile of choice. Clause 10 provides that the intention a person must have in order to acquire a domicile of choice in a country is the intention to make his home indefinitely in that country. This provision overcomes some problems that have arisen at common law in establishing the acquisition of a new domicile of choice. 'Country' is defined in clause 4 to include any state, province or territory that is part of a country. </PARA>
<PARA> Special problems in relation to domicile can arise in a country such as Australia which comprises a number of States and Territories. A person may come to Australia with the intention to settle permanently here but because he works, say, in the construction industry and regularly moves between States he may be domiciled in Australia for the purposes of Commonwealth law but not have sufficient connection with any particular State to acquire a domicile of choice in any State for the purposes of State law. The result is that for some purposes he may retain his domicile of origin, even though he has no intention of returing to the country of his birth. Clause 11 of the Bill deals with this situation by providing that a person who is domiciled in a union, but is not domiciled in any particular part of that union, is to be domiciled in that part of the union with which he has for the time being the closest connection.</PARA>
<PARA> The third major change made by the Bill relates to the age at which a person is capable of having an independent domicile. Clause 8 provides that a person is capable of having an independent domicile if he has attained the age of 18 years or he is or has at any time been married. This change reflects modern developments relating to the age of majority. </PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, the Bill makes a number of changes relating to domicile of certain children. Under the common law rules relating to domicile, a child born in wedlock acquires the domicile of his father while an illegitimate child has the domicile of the mother. It is not appropriate that a child should automatically have the domicile of one parent if the parents are separated and the child is in fact permanently living with the other parent. The Bill provides that in such a situation the child has the domicile of the parent with whom he has his principal home. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also contains provisions for determining the domicile of an adopted child. If, upon his adoption, he has two adoptive parents, his domicile is that which he would have had if he had been a child born in wedlock to those parents. If, upon his adoption, he has only one adoptive parent, his domicile is the domicile of that parent or, if that parent dies, the domicile that parent had at the date of death. Where an adoption order is rescinded the court may provide for the domicile of the child. </PARA>
<PARA> The changes made by the Commonwealth Bill will apply for the purposes of the laws of the Commonwealth, the Australian Capital Territory, the Jervis Bay territory and any external territories to which the Act is extended by regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> The enactment by the Commonwealth, the Australian States and the Northern Territory of the model domicile legislation prepared by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General will bring about, on a uniform basis, important reforms in a complex and technical area of the law. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill will update and revise a number of the provisions of the Crimes Act 1914 to take into account modern concepts, particularly in the area of sentencing, and to remove anomalies and defects revealed in the recent administration of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments will firstly require courts to consider whether some form of non-custodial punishment may be imposed instead of imprisonment on offenders against Commonwealth and Australian Capital Territory laws and the laws of prescribed external Territories. It is provided, in relation to offences described in the Bill, that a court is not to pass a sentence of imprisonment unless the court, after having considered all other available sentences, is satisfied that no other sentence is appropriate in all the circumstances of the case. This accords with modern thinking that imprisonment should be imposed only as a measure of last resort. The amendments will also make available to the courts, when dealing with Commonwealth offenders, sentencing options such as community service orders now available in relation to State and Territory offenders. </PARA>
<PARA> The provisions of the Act dealing with the conditional release of Commonwealth offenders have been remodelled. Conditions upon which an offender may be released include the condition that the offender make restitution or pay compensation to the victim of the crime, and the condition that the offender will submit to probationary supervision. In addition, the court may order that the offender is to pay a pecuniary penalty in a lump sum or by instalments. This condition and the condition relating to restitution, when combined with probationary supervision, will provide a practicable alternative to imprisonment. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation additionally revises and updates pecuniary penalties in the Crimes Act. The Bill, as introduced in the Senate, would enable offenders, on whom a fine has been imposed, to apply either for time to pay the fine or for payment of the fine by instalments. During the Committee stage debate on the Bill in the Senate, amendments were made to the provisions of the Bill concerning the payment of fines. The main thrust of those amendments was to ensure that, in the event of non-payment of a fine, modes of punishment other than imprisonment could be imposed by the court. The Government accepts this principle but has concluded that certain adjustments need to be made to the provisions as amended to remove difficulties in their practical application. With this in mind, the Government will be moving an amendment at the Committee stage debate on the Bill in this House which, while accepting the principle inherent in the amendment made in the Senate, gives effect to it in a different manner. </PARA>
<PARA> In line with the laws of several States, provisions are to be inserted into the Crimes Act under which a court, when sentencing a Commonwealth offender, will be empowered to take into account, for the purpose of imposing sentence, other offences in relation to which the defendant has admitted his guilt. Where a defendant before a court on one charge has also pending against him charges in relation to other and less serious offences in respect of which he admits guilt, the amendment will remove the need for the defendant to be convicted in relation to all the offences and enable the court when sentencing him for the primary offence also to take into account the commission of the other offences provided the defendant consents. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation also affects amendments to the bribery provisions of the Crimes Act as recommended in the report of the Committee of Inquiry concerning Public Duty and Private Interest-the Bowen Committee report. As recommended by the Committee, the amendments will remove present uncertainty as to application of the criminal law to bribery of members of parliament. The amendments will also, as recommended by the Committee, extend the application of the Crimes Act to Commonwealth officers obtaining or attempting to obtain a bribe for a third party or agreeing to accept a bribe. </PARA>
<PARA> The Attorney-General (Senator Durack) has been aware for some time of the need to revise the Crimes Act to provide the courts with a better range of options when dealing with Commonwealth offenders. The need to stress to the Courts that they should regard imprisonment as a punishment of last resort when sentencing Commonwealth offenders has also been apparent. </PARA>
<PARA> At the first conference of Australian magistrates held in Sydney in June 1978, a number of deficiencies in Commonwealth law in relation to sentencing were aired in considerable detail. The Attorney-General pointed out to the attending magistrates that he had a major personal interest in the whole policy of sentencing and in providing alternative punishments to the punishment of imprisonment. He undertook to initiate a review of the relevant sections of the Crimes Act, particularly those relating to the conditional release of offenders. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1978, the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General considered a paper submitted by the Attorney-General, in connection with preparations for the Sixth United Nations Crime Congress, on the subject of sentencing. That paper recommended, among other things, that consideration be given by a Law Reform Commission of the Commonwealth or the States to the revision of the laws with respect to sentencing to promote the greater use of alternatives to imprisonment, having regard to the costs and other unsatisfactory features of the punishment of imprisonment. The paper also stressed the need for legislation to be introduced to provide that no person be sentenced to imprisonment unless the court is of the opinion that, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, no other sentence is appropriate. The Standing Committee agreed that the matter be submitted to the Commonwealth's Law Reform Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> On 11 August 1978, the Attorney-General referred the question of the sentencing of federal offenders to the Commission, and in 1980 the Commission delivered an interim report on the reference. Certain of the Commission's recommendations are given effect to in the present Bill, and other provisions of the Bill reflect the experience of the Attorney-General's Department in the day to day administration of the Crimes Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Another important question is the development of sentencing guidelines. The development of guidelines on a systematic basis to provide a greater consistency and uniformity in sentencing should, in the Attorney-General's view, be encouraged. He has therefore written to the State and Northern Territory Attorneys-General proposing that a Sentencing Council consisting of federal, State and Territory judges be established administratively to discuss sentencing guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA> The present Bill does not represent a complete revision of the Crimes Act. A number of other aspects require review and these will be undertaken by the Attorney-General's Department next year. The Bill does, however, deal with the more pressing matters requiring attention and effect practical reforms of real worth and significance. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill will give effect to the Government's decision to establish the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research-ACIAR-which I announced in my statement to the House on 20 August 1981. It may assist honourable members in their understanding of this proposal if I again briefly explain the essential background. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is one of the world's leading agricultural countries. Our agricultural production has long exceeded our own requirements and our agricultural exports have been and continue to be a major source of Australia's wealth. As a result we are perhaps a little complacent on the subject of food security. At no time since our very early history have we needed to be concerned about where our basic food supplies and other agricultural products are to come from or whether we will have enough. Certainly we have had good years and bad years but these have affected only our relative wealth-not whether we will have enough to eat. </PARA>
<PARA> That is not, however, the situation in many other countries. It is one of the major tragedies of our times that each year millions still die simply because they do not have enough to eat. As the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) recently mentioned at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting:</PARA>
<PARA> Lack of adequate food probably affects 250 million people in the Commonwealth and maybe 500 million worldwide. </PARA>
<PARA>Again the Prime Minister alluded to this problem when he stated:</PARA>
<PARA> World per capita food production declined in 1980 for the second year running and the carry-over of cereal stocks at the end of 1980-81 was at the lowest level for about five or six years. </PARA>
<PARA>The international community has recognised this situation since the end of the Second World War and tried to deal with it through a number of programs. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation and the World Food Program, both substantially supported by Australia, are visible proof of international concern. </PARA>
<PARA> More recently, in 1971, the international community established the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research-CGIAR-which is an association of countries, international and regional organisations and private foundations dedicated to supporting a system of 13 international agricultural research centres around the world. In our region the best known of these is IRRI, the International Rice Research Institute, in the Philippines. The achievements of these centres are already very considerable, but a great deal more needs to be done by the international community to achieve food security. By food security I mean nutritionally adequate food supplies, and effective food storage and distribution. </PARA>
<PARA> The Brandt Commission report spells out the need for a continuing major effort for many years to come. The Harries report on Australia's relations with the Third World re-emphasises this point. Commonwealth heads of government also identified the lack of food security as one of the major issues facing many countries of the developing world. </PARA>
<PARA> The agricultural surpluses we and other developed countries produce can never be a long term solution to the food security problem, no matter how concessional the terms upon which food aid is provided. For developing countries to improve their situation and to produce more themselves will require the introduction or discovery of techniques and plant and animal strains which make more efficient use of available land resources. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is uniquely placed to assist developing countries in the area of agriculture. We are recognised as having particular expertise and experience in agricultural research and development over a wide range of climatic and environmental conditions, from dry-land farming to tropical livestock and agricultural production. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1980-81 our spending under the aid program on agricultural research and related activities was estimated to have been about $12m. This is quite significant. It was however, based to a considerable extent upon ad hoc requests for assistance from aid recipient governments. While the activities supported were each worth while in themselves, they lacked co-ordination. The reason this was so is that no mechanism presently exists to foster a more systematic approach. There are other factors that inhibit the most effective application of Australian expertise to the agricultural problems of developing countries: The lack of an effective mechanism within Australia for systematically identifying the agricultural problems of developing countries, including the identification of those areas of research which warrant Australia's support; the lack of a satisfactory mechanism for marshalling the collective expertise of bodies such as universities, State departments of agriculture, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and suitably competent private individuals and organisations to assist in solving the identified problems; the failure of Australian laboratories to provide support for scientists engaged in agricultural research in developing countries; the reluctance of the Australian research system to give proper credit to research performed in developing countries by Australian scientists, who are therefore disadvantaged compared with scientists who remain in Australia to pursue more recognised lines of research. </PARA>
<PARA> Research in industrialised countries tends to be concentrated on those agricultural commodities that are important to their own economies. Consequently little attention is given to new ideas and techniques specifically related to agricultural production in developing countries. This is a limiting factor to increased food production in the developing countries. In order to overcome these difficulties, consideration has been given to how to develop an expanded, better co-ordinated and more identifiable Australian effort aimed at achieving nutritional self-sufficiency in developing countries. After very widespread consultation within the Australian scientific community and with other interested parties, the Government has decided to establish the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the particular provisions of the Bill before the Parliament. The functions of the Centre, as set out in clause 5 of the Bill, are to mobilise and expand Australia's research capacity so as to assist developing countries in agriculture and related areas. The Centre will provide what is not currently available, namely a capacity to fund research by Australian persons and institutions specificially to benefit developing countries. At this point I should emphasise that the Centre will not itself engage in research activities. It will not attempt to emulate or duplicate the resources of existing institutions and indeed it will be expressly debarred from becoming a research institution in its own right. It will, however, be charged with contracting research work to appropriate bodies of the kind to which I referred earlier-that is, universities, State departments of agriculture, CSIRO and suitably competent private individuals and organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members will note that the Bill does not attempt to define the term 'agriculture' for the purposes of the legislation, but instead indicates that the term will be specified by regulation. I should state, therefore, the Government's view on this point. In short, the Government sees no activity that has as its objective the production of a commodity that grows on or depends upon the land, or lives in or depends upon the water, as being excluded from the Centre's possible attention. The regulations will therefore define the term in the broadest possible way and will not confine the Centre to that discipline we know as agriculture to differentiate it from other forms of land use. Nor will the Centre's activities be confined to arranging research to be undertaken solely by Australian persons or institutions, although all the research contracts it enters into will be with Australian persons or institutions. A key element of the research programs the Centre commissions will be the involvement in them of developing country scientists and institutions. Collaborative arrangements of this kind will be fundamental to the success of the work commissioned by the Centre. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no reference in the functions of the Centre to a responsibility to arrange training. This is no oversight. Clearly the training of agricultural research scientists from developing countries is of basic importance to the development of their own indigenous research capacity. Provision already exists, however, within the development training programs conducted by the Australian Development Assistance Bureau, for Australia to provide assistance with the formal academic training of scientists from developing countries. The Centre will have no responsibility for extension programs through which the results of its research could be applied in the field. Again this is no oversight. Extension activities normally require the commitment of significant resources and often the active involvement of the host government. While the Centre will be able to develop and promote close contacts with and between research institutes, it is not appropriate that it deal directly with foreign governments. The Australian Development Assistance Bureau is an agency which has precisely this mandate on behalf of Australia, and it is that agency which should pursue the matter of extension programs in the context of the aid program for which it is responsible. </PARA>
<PARA> The Centre's activities will result in the need for projects to implement research findings in the field. Accordingly there will need to be close liaison between the Centre and the Bureau to enable such projects to be developed and funded. This has been provided for formally by the inclusion of the Director of ADAB on both the Policy Advisory Council and the Board of Management of the Centre in an ex officio capacity. In addition, the Centre is expected to be located close to the Bureau and its support services will be provided, in common with those of the Bureau, by the appropriate areas of my Department. This will ensure adequate communication between the two organisations so that the successful results of the Centre's activities are backed up where necessary by appropriate extension programs. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the staffing of the Centre. ACIAR's administrative expenses will be kept to a minimum. As already explained, all research work will be contracted out. However the Centre will require the capacity to identify needs and priorities for agricultural research in developing countries, prepare briefs and commission contracts for research and to monitor critically progress of the research and the contracts under which it is conducted. I envisage that the Centre will eventually need a staff of about 10. Although they will be employed under the Public Service Act, they may be recruited from outside the Commonwealth Public Service while remaining fully within the Centre's own control. Clearly the operation of the Centre working under the constraints of the long term nature of agricultural research and the long lead time required to obtain results calls for flexibility, stability in funding arrangements and above all, staff of such stature as to command respect among scientists in Australia and in developing countries. The chief executive officer of the Centre-its Director-will be critical to its success and will need to be a person of outstanding ability, recognised for his professional and managerial capacities. </PARA>
<PARA> In the consultations we have had that have led to the establishment of the Centre, a consistent and strongly expressed preference by the Australian scientific community has emerged for the Centre to be a small statutory body. The success of ACIAR will depend on the enthusiastic co-operation of the scientific community and this will be assured with a statutory body with firm funding commitments. ACIAR will be responsible to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The Government has, of course, in reaching this decision recognised the potential for statutory authorities, once established, to lead a life of their own and to continue after the need for them has disappeared. The Government has guarded against this eventuality in three ways. First, the Centre's internal administration will be managed through my Department. This means that a close, direct and continuous oversight will be maintained on resources required to administer the Centre. Secondly, the Centre is to have a finite life of 12 years. Clauses 43 and 44 require that the Centre should cease to operate after that period unless amending legislation is introduced by the Government, that is, a so-called sunset provision. In order that the Government can reach a decision on this matter, it is proposed that the need for the Centre as well as its operations and effectiveness be received in the tenth year. The review should be completed in sufficient time to enable a copy of the report of the review to be tabled before the expiration of the period of twelve years. Thirdly, the funds of the Centre will be handled through a trust fund within the public account and under the provisions of the Audit Act. </PARA>
<PARA> These elements of the legislation, together with the more normal controls requiring the Centre to submit annual reports, estimates of expenditure, financial statements, annual parliamentary appropriation of funds and ministerial power of direction, will ensure that the Centre functions in accordance with the Government's objectives. The Centre will have a Policy Advisory Council that will be representative of developed and developing country expertise. The Council will be so constituted as to ensure Australian control but at the same time provide developing countries with a real opportunity to influence the Centre's activities. This is an innovation of great importance which has already attracted favourable international comment. The Council will meet at least once a year and members will be selected on the basis of the contribution individual members will be able to make to the work of the Centre and to provide a balance between disciplines and skills. The term of office will be up to three years. Membership will be rotated to bring in fresh skills and expertise and to ensure the continuing relevance of the Council to the changing needs of developing countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The Council will consist of 17 ministerially appointed members, one of whom will be its President, as well as the directors of the Centre and ADAB in their official capacities. While in a minority, a substantial number of members will be representative of developing countries or other overseas research institutions. The majority of council members will thus be representative of Australian institutions and organisations, in particular the universities, State departments of agriculture and the CSIRO. My colleagues the Minister for Primary Industry and the Minister for Science and Technology will each nominate one member of the Council. The composition of the Policy Advisory Council reflects Australia's determination to direct the Centre's attention specifically and directly to the needs of developing countries. The Centre will not become a means of supplementing the funding of Australian institutions engaged on agricultural research related to Australia's problems. Other avenues for funding this already exist. </PARA>
<PARA> In recognition of the importance of the Centre's role the Government has decided to establish an interim council pending passage of the legislation that will formally establish the Centre. I am grateful to Sir John Crawford for agreeing to chair the interim council and to the other members, whose appointment I announced on 6 October, for agreeing to serve on it. In addition to the Policy Advisory Council, the Bill provides for the establishment of a board of management which will be responsible to the Minister for the conduct of the affairs of the Centre. It is proposed that the board should consist of the President of the Council, the directors of ACIAR and ADAB, all ex officio, and three other members appointed by the Governor-General from among the members of the Council. One of these the Governor-General will appoint as chairman. </PARA>
<PARA> ACIAR will benefit both giver and receiver. While its primary purpose is to assist developing countries, Australia too will gain in the following ways: Enhanced contact between our agricultural scientists and their overseas colleagues; the increased information Australia will have at its disposal on the agricultural problems of developing countries; by strengthening the links between Australian and overseas scientists and institutions; and, finally, some of the solutions the research sponsored by the Centre produces will be of direct and practical benefit to Australia, even though that may not have been the original intention. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government believes that ACIAR represents an important new element in our assistance to developing countries. It is already being seen internationally as a practical demonstration of Australia's concern for and commitment to one of the major objectives of the North-South dialogue-the achievement by developing countries of greater self-reliance in agricultural production and increased food security. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Broadcasting Stations Licence Fees Bill 1981 and the Television Stations Licence Fees Bill 1981 represent an extraordinary about-face by the Government. Almost identical legislation was introduced into this House on 18 August. It was passed by this House on 27 August. That legislation introduced on Budget night was an integral part of the Budget proposals of the Government and it was a revised mechanism for increasing revenue to the Government from broadcasting stations and television stations. Those Bills went to the Senate and at about that time the Government caved in to the heavying from the broadcasting and television industry. To put it more politely and in the terms of the second second reading speech of the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair), the Government responded to representations made by the industry. Of course, the Government, having decided to make these changes, discovered, with some red faces, that the Bill then before the Senate was not amendable as it was a money Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government was caught in a situation in which it wanted to respond to the fairly forcefully put overtures from the industry but it was in the position that once the Bills were in the Senate it was powerless to do anything about them in that chamber. Consequently the Government decided to abandon those pieces of legislation and start all over again. That is why on 21 October the Minister introduced new Bills containing provisions almost identical to the ones introduced into this House on Budget night. The great and, indeed, the only change included in this legislation is that an upper limit is placed on the amount of fees which can be collected from broadcasting and television stations. The explanatory memorandum issued in respect of the Television Stations Licence Fees Bill 1981 states:</PARA>
<PARA> Under the new schedule, a licensee's annual fee will be calculated as a percentage rate of the gross earnings of the station to which the licence relates. The scale of rates is progressive, that is to say, every increase in a station's gross earnings renders its licensee liable to pay a higher percentage in licence fees, subject to an upper limit of 7.5 per cent of gross earnings. However, with the removal of the lump sum component of the fee, and the restructuring of the scale, licensees with low growth earnings will pay less than under the existing schedule. </PARA>
<PARA>When the original Bills were before this House the Opposition did not oppose them. The reasons we gave for not opposing those proposals were that we thought that the proposals were an improvement on the existing means by which fees were collected from broadcasting and television stations; that is, there was a greater amount of equity applying in the revised scales. Under the proposals the licence holders with the smallest revenues were going to pay less than they did under the existing legislation and those with the largest revenue were going to pay more than they did under existing legislation. The Opposition accepts that licence holders ought to be taxed in respect of the access they have to the air waves; that is, the access which the licence bestows. We accept, and we have always accepted, that there is a high degree of economic rent involved in the holding of these sorts of licences. Therefore, some of the revenue which is generated from that ought to be returned to the public who, after all, bestow that right on to an individual licence holder. </PARA>
<PARA> We made the point also that profitability in the industry is important. We accept that quite clearly. If the industry is going to be in a position to respond to the demands for ever-improving program quality then the industry needs to have the sort of profitability which allows it to improve the quality of its programs. For those reasons we do not oppose the recast version of this legislation involving as it does a superficially trivial change; that is, to impose a ceiling on the percentage of gross revenue which the licence holder would have to pay as a fee. However, in saying that it is important that a number of points are made. The first point, of course, is that this represents a further Budget back-down by the Government. There is no question but that this is as central a proposal to the Budget as was any other revenue-raising proposal announced at the time of the Budget. It is true, of course, that the amount of extra revenue the Government proposed to raise as a result of these measures is not as great as that which will be raised as a result of the changes, say, to the sales tax legislation and the introduction of new sales taxes. Nevertheless, the principle is exactly the same. It is an integral part of the Budget. Therefore, this legislation represents a significant back-down by the Government in relation to its adamantly put position that all aspects of the Budget will proceed through the Parliament without change, without deviation. What this really demonstrates is that it is amazing how subtle this Government can be in some respects. We can see how flexible it is when it is confronted by a very powerful interest pushing a particular point of view on the Government. The Government was well and truly leant on in relation to this legislation. As a result it decided to change this piece of legislation which is an integral revenue-raising part of the 1981-82 Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important and instructive to compare the flexibility which the Government has demonstrated on this occasion with its intransigence in relation to the sales tax proposal. When the Government is faced with taxes which affect books, newspapers, shoes for children, sweets for children, building materials in respect of people attempting to buy their first homes, pet foods and safety belts and safety equipment, we find that it sticks rigidly to its principle that once a measure is determined to be part of the Budget then the Government will not resile from the ambition of getting that legislation through the Parliament. Therefore, the Government has demonstrated where its priorities really lie. It is not going to back down in relation to the hardship which it has caused to kids, to families, to a variety of people throughout the community in relation to the new sales taxes and the increased sales taxes which were part of the Budget. But when it comes to doing favours for powerful friends the capacity of this Government for flexibility is unbounded. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point that has to be made is that on the calculations which we have been able to make these measures will involve some cost to revenue. The Minister said on 21 October in his second second reading speech on this legislation that this would not involve any cost to revenue this year. Our calculations suggest that there will be a small cost to revenue this year. I do not want to make much of it, but it appears that the cost to revenue as a result of this change will be about $100,000 a year. That is, probably only one licence holder, perhaps two, will not pay as much under this change this year as they would have paid had the original legislation introduced on Budget night proceeded on its course through the Parliament. In any case that is not the most important point, the most important point is that there is absolutely no question that there will be a substantial cost to revenue over the next couple of years. By 1983-84 the cost to revenue as a result of this superficially trivial change will be about $3m. That is the revenue which will be forgone as a result of this apparently small change. I will press the Minister in other ways to find out exactly what the cost to revenue is for this year and to discover whether the Minister was being absolutely candid when he said on 21 October that there would not be a cost to revenue as a result of this change. </PARA>
<PARA> The third point that has to be made about the change is that it will not be felt equally throughout the industry. The fee that licence holders pay is determined by two factors. One is the actual level of earnings and the second is the percentage which applies to each particular level of earnings. As indicated in the explanatory memorandum from which I quoted, the fee can increase both with an increase in earnings-that increase may be illusory to the extent that it might just be a money increase and not a real increase in earnings-and as the licence holder shifts from one bracket to another in terms of the percentage which will be paid in fees. That is, with each shift into a higher bracket the percentage of earnings which will be collected as fees will increase also. </PARA>
<PARA> The point is that with the imposition of a ceiling with respect to the largest of the licence holders that licence holder will be insulated from one of the effects which would lead to an increase in the fee to which that licence holder would otherwise be subject. Whilst the earnings of that licence holder may increase, and therefore the amount of the fee would increase, the percentage of his total revenue which that represents would not increase whereas all the other licence holders, until they reach this ceiling, would be subject to more rapidly escalating increases in their fees. To that extent this is clearly unfair. One licence holder in this case will be insulated from one of the factors which lead to an increase in the fee whereas all other licence holders, some of which are competitors with the largest licence holder, will be subject to the effects of both factors in the determination of the fee which they will be charged. Of course, as the stations which are just below the level of the largest stations approach the level of revenue of the larger stations and reach the ceiling, of course they too will be insulated in the same way as is the largest earning licence holder at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> The position for television stations is that at a level of a bit less than $50m in gross revenue the 7.5 per cent ceiling begins to cut in. But all those stations which are in receipt of just below that amount of gross revenue, or even substantially below, will see the fees that they pay escalate at a far higher rate than the escalation which will be experienced by those stations which in future years reach the ceiling and therefore have the rate of increase of their fee slowed down as a result of the imposition of the ceiling. That means that the smaller stations which are competing with the larger station or stations in the future will have to take into account the increasing burden of those fees and therefore will be placed in a disadvantageous position as far as the largest licence holder is concerned. At present the benefit of this legislation will go only to the largest licence holder, that being Channel 9. In the future, as the revenue of the other licence holders increases, they will also receive the benefit. That is why in the year 1983-84 the cost to revenue or, to put it another way, the benefit to those largest licence holders will be in the order of $3m. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall mention one other thing. We note, agreeably, that the Minister has said that in 1984 there will be a review of this question to see whether the proposals in this legislation are appropriate for the circumstances at the time. That is a sensible provision because in view of recent history and, indeed, the predictions for the future, the revenue of these licence holders, particularly in the television industry, is likely to increase quite rapidly. Therefore it is important that by 1984 there should be a review to see whether the mechanisms which are being legislated for here are still appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another question which must be mentioned in this context. Because of the very selective way in which this legislation has been drafted-the way in which it seeks to benefit in the first instance just one licence holder and a small number of other licence holders as their revenue increases-and when one compares the way in which the Government has been prepared to bend, to cave in in respect of this industry and this revenue raising measure, whereas it has not been prepared to make the same sort of concessions in relation to many other inequitable and, one might say, objectionable new revenue raising measures and increased revenue measures which were introduced as part of the Budget, one is forced to ask whether some sort of pay-off is involved in this whole exercise. The pay-off may be explicit, it may be implicit; it may be direct, it may be indirect; it may be now or it may be in the future. But whenever a Government acts in this way selectively to benefit in this case one enterprise and in a couple of years a very small number of enterprises and at the same time is determined not to relax the new penalties which it has introduced in respect of a whole range of other industries, one is forced to ask: What is in it for the Government and what is in it for the politicians who make up the Government?</PARA>
<PARA> Our concern is only heightened when we recognise the personality of the Minister for Communications, who has been responsible for introducing this legislation and who has quite clearly backed off, caved in, made this concession to one of the very powerful friends of the Government. I think one is entitled to ask: What is in it for him, what is in it for the Government and what is in it for the Government parties? Having said that, we repeat that we were not impressed about the way in which the Government has gone about this change in the legislation-the muddle-headedness involved in introducing the legislation which only a month later the Government had to abandon-but we have been prepared to examine the matter on its merits. Having done that we maintain our original position in relation to this question and do not oppose the passage of this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true that this legislation has been debated previously in the House. It is not my intention to take up the time of the House tonight by going over some of the arguments that were canvassed previously, but after listening to the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins) tonight one would almost think that it was the greatest give-away in history. The plain facts of the situation are as follows: In terms of the revenue to the Government this year, the licence fees will reap not $21m as they did last year but $30m. I was a little sorry that the honourable member for Fremantle did not state the other section of the briefing notes that he had obviously received. They clearly set out the very great benefit that will be received by a number of radio and television stations in Australia. I think we should be very aware of the fact that these changes will mean that some 120 radio stations in Australia pay less for their licence fees than they did previously and that only 30 of the commercial television stations in Australia will pay greater licence fees than they did previously.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it is terribly important that we realise that the radio and television industry is a most volatile industry and that although it can be very profitable now things can change very quickly. I suggest that the honourable member for Fremantle have a look at the Labor station in Brisbane, station 4KQ, which has been at the bottom of the ratings for some years. Having been in a terrible loss situation, in a matter of days it has come up to No. 2 place in a survey in Brisbane radio and no doubt it will be highly profitable over the year. But it has been through the doldrums; its management knows what it is all about when stations are struggling for money. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members should take the opportunity to read some of the reports of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. The latest one that is available to me, that for 1978-79, indicates that-even forgetting the country commercial stations, which obviously we cannot-in terms of the metropolitan radio stations, in that year one Sydney station was in the red, one Melbourne station was in the red, two Brisbane stations were in the red and one Adelaide station was in the red. I understand that 29 or 30 country stations were not making a profit. That fact must be remembered because radio is a tremendous form of communications. It is a vital link for so many people in remote areas. Anything that governments can do to help, to encourage and to promote the well-being of those country radio stations obviously is very much for the benefit of the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that the scale of rates set out in this legislation is progressive. It is true that every increase in a station's gross earnings will render its licensee liable to pay a higher percentage in licence fees. In the case of television up to 7.5 per cent of gross earnings will be payable. In the case of radio up to 5 per cent of gross earnings will be payable. I believe that those charges are justified. I think one very good point was made. I am glad that the honourable member for Fremantle agreed with the Government on this matter. I refer to the provision that this legislation must be reviewed. I too welcome the provision for a review in 1984. It is important that we keep a continual monitoring process on the situation in the media. I do not know how often the situation of Australian programs and Australian content has been debated in this House but it comes up quite regularly. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that one thing we should always be doing is making sure that the stations have the capacity to experiment, to promote and to produce Australian content in order to make sure that we in this country can take our part-we are certainly heading towards that now-as one of the major production houses of the world. Indeed, we have a great deal to offer to the world. I would hate to think that we should ever get into a situation in which we could not afford to experiment with programs, in which television stations could not afford to go into subcontracting arrangements with some of the big production houses of the nation to make sure that our standard increases. To my knowledge-and I have found this in my discussions with the industry-there has been no real adverse reaction in the industry to the imposition of these licence fees. I think that that in itself augurs well for the situation that we have developed here, providing that we maintain that continuing review and that we review the whole situation in 1984. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the other point that should be raised relates to some of the more direct financial benefits that will go to radio and television stations. I refer to the fact that although the fee for the initial grant of a licence has been raised to $500 from $200, we have removed the $200 lump sum component of the annual fee. Even a figure as small as that can be quite significant in many of the country areas of Australia. I commend the legislation. I am glad that it is going through on this basis. Most importantly, I think we should all stress the fact that this situation must be reviewed in 1984. Indeed, this House should be most aware of the very delicate situation that this industry can find itself in from time to time. We should be most aware that it is quite easy for it to get into a situation in which it may not be able to develop Australian programs as well as we would like. It is an industry that deserves all our promotion and, indeed, all our support. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One could say: 'Here we are again'. I thought we had debated these Bills several weeks ago. We are here debating what appear at first sight to be the same Bills with, as the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins) has already stated, a slight variation in one clause to put a ceiling on the amount of revenue that can be taken from the bigger stations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it is pointed at mainly the bigger television networks. While we support this legislation because it is an improvement on the present situation, I still prefer the legislation that was presented to the House in August. This is a genuine case of an about-turn by the Government under extreme pressure from its big media monopoly supporters who, as it was put nicely in the second reading speech of the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair), 'made representations' to him. Subsequently the legislation was changed to include a ceiling to benefit the major networks in the long run. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Minister said in his speech, the variations will not substantially alter the position of stations in the short term-the money coming into the Government will be approximately the same-but in the long term they will help the larger stations as they will be paying less than they would have paid under the provisions of the Bills that were presented in August. The incredible about-turn by the Government just shows that it is able to make changes when it wants to, when it suits it to bow to the pressures of its king makers. It is not willing to change the sales tax Bills that affect the vast majority of the population and in the next financial year it will in fact rip $900m from people all over Australia by way of inequitable Bills which affect the families, pensioners and the underprivileged alike. Thousands of represenations have been received on the sales tax issue. The Government is not bowing to any pressure in that case. Yet in this case there is an incredible about-turn when certain pressure is brought to bear. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to quote from a speech I made on 27 August in a debate on the previous broadcasting licence fee Bills because it is apt to this debate tonight. I quoted from the B &amp; T Advertising, Marketing and Media Weekly of 20 August, as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> The rate increases in Brisbane and Perth follow similar increases in Sydney and Melbourne which have attracted strong criticism from national advertisers.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, we are talking about commercial revenue from television stations. The quotation continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Sydney stations announced their 10 per cent rate increases last week, effective in October, just months after announcing 15 per cent rises in rates for this year. </PARA>
<PARA> In Melbourne, the TV stations will increase rates by 10 per cent from October 4. This follows a rise of about 12 per cent last April/May. </PARA>
<PARA>I then said:</PARA>
<PARA> That means that the rises in Melbourne and Sydney will range from 22 per cent to 25 per cent. But by compound arithmetic it is in fact more; in Melbourne it is about 23.2 per cent and in Sydney it will exceed 26 per cent-and that is only in a matter of a few months. These seemingly very big rises must put a rather heavy strain on advertisers, although one could just as easily assume that the industry could well afford it. Of course, the gross revenue of all commercial radio and television stations would be close to $700m. I arrived at that figure when I studied the latest figures available. Unfortunately they are in the 1978-79 annual report of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. At that time the gross revenue was $532m; so $700m would, I believe, be a quite realistic figure at this time. </PARA>
<PARA>All that is still relevant in this debate. As the honourable member for Fremantle said-I think he was misrepresented a little by the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Jull)-the parts of this legislation which we support most heartily are those which benefit the many smaller radio and television stations. I take the point about radio made by the honourable member for Bowman. I think we really must look at radio in a slightly different light from television. Radio does not generate the same revenue as the big television networks. The Minister recognises that fact because the upper ceiling of the broadcasting licence fee is 5 per cent of gross earnings, which is lower than the upper ceiling of the television licence fee, which is 7.5 per cent of gross earnings. We support that rationalisation to support the many smaller stations, in particular the radio stations, because they are a fundamental part of our communications system. </PARA>
<PARA> Why are we not debating here tonight, and why have we not done so at other times in the Parliament, other reports or aspects of the communications industry instead of rising, as I am told, at the end of this week? For instance, what has happened to the Dix report? Why are we not debating the McKinsey report, cable television, subscription television or the satellite-all very big issues which will affect all Australians for many years to come? They are probably some of the biggest issues in the communications field that this country has ever faced. Yet we really have no communications debate in this House. The Minister mentioned in the Estimates Committee that he hoped to have a full debate on the Dix report before the House rose. That really does not seem possible unless it is going to be on at about 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning. That is a shame because there should be a full debate before the Government brings down recommendations. The Government could look at the ideas put forward and then bring down its recommendations, acting on the Dix report and the debate that occured in the Federal Parliament. But it does not seem that that is to happen. </PARA>
<PARA> I can foresee the Government bringing in recommendations next year when really we will be faced with a fait accompli about what the Australian Broadcasting Commission will have to wear. I am not against changing parts of the ABC. As I think I have mentioned in the House before, there are 273 recommendations in the Dix report. Some of them are very good and I believe we would support some of them, but there is a whole range of very big issues in the communications area that we should be debating. I ask the Minister whether at some time in the future we could have a full and comprehensive debate of all the issues in the communications area which will be affecting every Australian for many years to come. I think it is a shame that we will not be having those debates as we will be rising this week to have what is laughingly called four months holiday. </PARA>
<PARA> I support the Bills only because they are better than the existing situation. As I said earlier, I would have preferred the former Bills that were introduced in August to have been passed through the Senate and into law. Be that as it may, we believe it is important to support the smaller stations, especially the smaller radio stations and the country stations that are very important for the rural areas. For all those reasons, we support this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable members who spoke earlier in this debate outlined the amendments to the Broadcasting Stations Licence Fees Bill and the Television Stations Licence Fees Bill. The effect of the amendments is to impose a ceiling on the licence fee by the introduction of a fee of 5 per cent of gross earnings for broadcasting stations and 7 1/2 per cent of gross earnings for television stations. I am told that the amendments are the result of lobbying by the major metropolitan television stations, particularly the Channel 9 network. Regional television station managements, with whom I have spoken and discussed these amendments, consider that the amendments are reasonable because without them the increase would be open-ended, would and could be enormous, and could be seen as a super profits tax rather than a licence fee. In other words, if a station is successful it is hit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government's reasonable attitude to the major metropolitan television networks appears not to be the case with regional television. I refer to the new rates for radio communication licence category fees which were introduced on 1 July. The effect of these new fees will be far greater on regional television than on metropolitan television because regional television stations usually require several licences. A typical example is one of the television stations in my electorate, where the radio communication licence fee has increased from $40 to $5,200. I am told that is an increase of 12,900 per cent. That would be about the best to go through this Parliament for some time. The station requires three licences, so the increase in total is from $120 to $15,600. I acknowledge that these licences probably have not been increased since television began. If one takes what I am told is the cost of a taxi radio licence at $36, obviously $40 for a television station was too low. I believe that the regional television networks would have to expect an increase of several hundred per cent, which is fairly significant. </PARA>
<PARA> When one considers licence fees, basically they are for the registration of frequencies or whatever the other licence may be. Now we have a new concept of the user pays. The philosophy has been changed, and in my opinion it has been changed far too harshly and abruptly. Furthermore, it is being done without any accountability. </PARA>
<PARA> It is acknowledged that at the present time the Department of Communications is overloaded with work; but with this type of user-pays principle, the user has no ability or opportunity to be involved in any sort of accountability process on how that money is spent. This particular example is not unique. The matter has been raised before with, for example, the new inspection charges for a range of primary industry products which are exported, and with the Department of Transport and the increased licence fees, et cetera, for commuter operators. A serious principle is involved. I understand that people from the Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations have seen the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair) and I am told that he has expressed some sympathy with the argument that has been put forward. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the Government and the Minister to look at this aspect of increased fees for television stations in the same way that they have looked, correctly, at the proposed charges, the greatest effect of which is on the major metropolitan stations, and give some of the same justice to regional television stations. I ask the Government to reduce significantly the licence fees that have been introduced and to arrange for some sort of accountability process so that these people, if they are required on a user-pays principle to pay for the running of the Department or that part of it which covers the work pertaining to them, will have some reporting to them on how their money is being spent. Otherwise, I believe an unjust principle will operate of the user being required to pay the licence fee without there being any accountability to him. I ask the Minister and the Government to look again at this other series of licence fees, because of the effect they have on regional television, in the same reasonable manner in which they looked again at the licence fees we are debating tonight, which affect the major metropolitan stations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair) has indicated that the new Broadcasting Stations Licence Fees Bill 1981 and Television Stations Licence Fees Bill 1981, which we are debating today, are to replace the previous Bills which were debated in the House on 27 August. We are told that the reason for this change of heart by the Government is the representations from the broadcasting and television industry on the regressive long term financial effects of the fees. In consequence, the Government has set a ceiling on these fees. In the debate on 27 August I drew attention to the urgent need for funding to support television services, particularly where there is a need to remedy deficiencies in television reception, as presently occurs in the Dandenong Ranges in my electorate of La Trobe. I had hoped that the Minister would give some assurance that the increased revenue from the fees could be anticipated and that funds would be provided to install the UHF translators which are necessary to improve reception in the Dandenong Ranges. However, no such assurance has been given. Once again I call on the Minister to honour the promise given by the previous Liberal member for La Trobe, Mr Marshall Baillieu, and the previous Minister for Post and Telecommunications, Mr Tony Staley. At a public meeting held in Ferntree Gully in late July 1980, Mr Staley was reported by the Lilydale and Yarra Valley Express of 5 August as having said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It's just not good enough. The hills people have a right to good television reception and we'll make sure they get it. </PARA>
<PARA>In a letter which was sent to many hundreds of residents in the Dandenong Ranges area in October 1980, just prior to the last election, Mr Baillieu wrote:</PARA>
<PARA> The new system will be in operation in the early part of next year, and I will continue to take all possible steps to see that it is introduced without delay. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to incoporate the letter in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The letter read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>October, 1980 Dear Resident,</PARA>
<PARA> About 20,000 residents of the La Trobe electorate have poor television reception. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently I was able to announce that the Government has agreed to the installation of Translator equipment to direct a television signal into areas of bad reception. </PARA>
<PARA> Translators will be located at the lookout tower in Belmont Crescent, Upwey; in Bruce Crescent, Ferntree Gully; and in Best Street, Belgrave. </PARA>
<PARA> These Translators will provide for reception on every channel, and to every home, but will not affect those homes that now have good reception. </PARA>
<PARA> To ensure that no area is overlooked, and to assist with planning, I would like you to fill out and return the enclosed questionnaire to my electorate office at the above address. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Post and Telecommunications will call for applications this month for the channels to install translators. </PARA>
<PARA> The new system will be in operation in the early part of next year, and I will continue to take all possible steps to see that it is introduced without delay. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Isaacs says, it is a disgraceful matter. I wish to quote from a letter I received from a constituent in Kallista, which is in my electorate of La Trobe. It is similar to many hundreds of complaints I have received in the past year, by letter and telephone, in relation to this matter. The letter states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Dear Sir,</PARA>
<PARA> Some time ago you appealed for the people in your electorate to tell you of their problems with their TV reception and I have finally got around to it. When we bought a TV we bought it with the UHF frequency channels on it in the mistaken belief that soon, soon, soon, UHF would be used in the Dandenongs. Yet another Liberal joke?</PARA>
<PARA> We are able to get both 0/28 and 2 on the 'rabbits' ears on the set, though this is of course improved by using the roof antenna. But the other three channels are almost unwatchable. We have at present invested in a Fringe Area antenna, a monstrous thing which perches on the roof and my husband, a Ham, has a system of pulleys and directional winches which can be used to try to get maximum visibility. The best method is obviously to have one of these aerials tuned specifically to each channel. Expenses apart I have no real wish to have any more aerials festooning my roof, especially when success is not assured. Weather conditions usually play a large part in good visibility, when there is a good movie or something that we particularly wish to watch on 10 or 9 or 7 we have two alternatives. Pray for a smog inversion layer in Melbourne or rain, or visit a friend on the other side of the mountain. </PARA>
<PARA> Luckily most watchable programs are on Channel 2 but it would still be nice to watch only one bowler bowling in cricket matches, though Ballet Pas des Deuxs are fascinating, for a while. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps I could also use this opportunity to add that I am a Dr Who fan and would relish the opportunity to watch it again though this may be a little out of your area. </PARA>

How can the Minister avoid giving some assurances to persons who can put their case as cogently as the writer of that letter? The present Bill will restrict the licence fees which will be received from television station owners such as Mr Rupert Murdoch. The moving of his station from the Channel 0 frequency to Channel 10 aggravated the reception problems in the Dandenong Ranges. I consider the least the Government could have done was to seek a prior assurance from Mr Murdoch that the move from Channel 0 to a different frequency would not inconvenience viewers. Perhaps Mr Murdoch will be prepared to assist the Government in speeding up the installation of the translators now that a ceiling limit on the fees that his station will be required to pay has been set out in the new Bill. The Minister is not in the chamber tonight, I regret to note. I hope he will take some action on the urgent matter of television reception in the La Trobe electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of this Bill is to authorise the payment to Queensland of $58.5m in 1981-82 as a special grant. The payment consists of $33.5m to complete the special assistance of 1979-80 and an advance grant of $25m for special assistance in respect of 1980-81. The payments were recommended by the Commonwealth Grants Commission in its forty-eighth report which was tabled in this House on 23 September 1981. Page 4 of that report states that special assistance is granted to States 'for the purpose of making it possible for a State, by reasonable effort to function at a standard not appreciably below the standards of other States'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In its forty-sixth report in 1979 the Commission recommended that an advance grant of $11m be paid to Queensland for the year 1979-80. With the availability of much more statistical data for that year, the Grants Commission has now been able to calculate more carefully what further assistance Queensland should receive so as to be able to provide services at about the same standard as other States. The grant of $33.5m was recommended for that year. The Commonwealth has accepted the recommendations and the Australian Labor Party supports the legislation now being debated to implement that proposal. Similarly, the Commission recommended an advance grant of $25m for 1980-81. The Government has included this in the legislation being debated and the Labor Party supports the legislation. Therefore, this Bill when it becomes an Act will provide $58.5m of special assistance to the Queensland Government. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be no special payment for Queensland in 1981-82 because of a review being conducted by the Grants Commission of the States' tax sharing entitlements. The Commission gave its rigorous and highly sophisticated report to the Government early in June. The Commonwealth Government and State governments met at a Premiers Conference on 20 June and decided to ask the Commission to produce a further report on States' relativities. This was clearly because three States would have lost a considerable proportion of their funds if the Commission's recommendation had been accepted. The Treasurer (Mr Howard) announced that the Commission would be asked to present its further report early in 1982. However, four months later the Commonwealth has still not resubmitted the issue of the States' relativities to the Commission as promised after the Premiers Conference. Clearly, it is not possible for the Commission to report early in 1982 as the Treasurer said he expected in June simply because of the Commonwealth's excessive delay in resubmitting the issue. This delay will cause increased uncertainty for all the States and may well lead to renewed conflict over the allocation of funds next year. </PARA>
<PARA> In recognition of the likelihood that following the further review relativities would be adjusted in favour of the three most populous States, the Commonwealth announced at the Premiers Conference in June that it would give additional grants to New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland in 1981-82 provided that there would be no application by any State for special assistance in respect of the 1981-82 year. Queensland, for example, was given an additional $20.5m on this basis. However, due to the deferral of the resubmission of the States' relativities issue to the Commission it will forgo $109m. There was an unusual feature of the announcement of the special assistance for 1979-80 and 1980-81 which we are now debating. Rather than waiting until the Commonwealth Grants Commission report was tabled, the special assistance was announced on 10 August. It is usual to announce the special assistance some weeks after the Budget. Also, the announcement was made by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) rather than the Treasurer. Doubtless this change had to do with some perceived political advantage which the Commonwealth Government or the Queensland Government considered would follow from an early announcement. </PARA>
<PARA> The special assistance being provided to Queensland through the Bill we are discussing is calculated by comparing the cost of providing services in Queensland and the opportunities for revenue raising in Queensland with the same factors in the two standard States, New South Wales and Victoria. The Commission first modifies the published budgetary accounts of the standard and claimant States to make them as comparable as possible. On the basis of these modified accounts and other relevant information it makes an assessment of the need for each of the various categories of revenue and expenditure. From the aggregate of assessed needs it deducts the amount of the claimant State's needs which is met by way of differentials and revenue payments from the Commonwealth, other than the special grants recommended by the Commission, and the remaining amount becomes the amount of the assessed special grant. The difference between the assessed grant for 1979-80 and the advance grant is the amount which is paid as the completion grant for the year which, in this case, is $33.5m. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the terms of the Commonwealth Grants Commission Act 1973 and in accordance with section 96 of the Constitution, Queensland has been a claimant State since 1971. Due to the fact that it has been less populous than the standard States, Queensland has had in the past and still has access to less taxation revenue. Factors such as the sparsity of population, age distribution and the taxpayer population mix, together with Queensland's vast geographical area, combine to place heavy demands on social services and the social services budget. As at 30 June 1980 the proportion of Queensland's taxpaying population aged between 19 and 64 years was 57.56 per cent which was lower than in every other State bar Tasmania where the figure was 56.59 per cent. At the same time the proportion in Queensland of that section of the population most dependent on social services, the aged, was way out in front of all States. As at 30 June 1980 the proportion of Queensland's population aged 65 and over was 10.39 per cent. In 1980 Queensland's new interstate migration gain was 21,896, a figure which was way ahead of the other States. This phenomenon was not an isolated occurrence but part of a growing trend. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. It can be seen from the foregoing that Queensland does not need to look outside the Grants Commission findings in regard to the fiscal equalisation process to establish its credibility as a claimant State or to contrive sophistic arguments to ensure that it receives its slice of the cake. The aim of the exercise of which this Bill has been a component part in the past was to achieve fiscal equalisation between the States. In its strivings to achieve this happy balance, the contribution made by the Commonwealth Grants Commission has been valuable. It has earned a reputation of impartiality and objectivity. This year, the Commission concluded that a more unified approach to fiscal equalisation was in order based on a system of annual relativity reviews with no separate provision for supplementary assistance in the form of grants or special assistance for any State.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is indicative of the Federal Government's arrogance that it has ignored that accumlated wisdom and exhaustive examination of State finances that the Grants Commission brought to its 1981-82 examination of tax sharing and State relativities. The Federal Government's deferral of the Grants Commission recommendation has, as I mentioned before, meant that Queensland will forgo $109m given that the Grants Commission recommendations are acted upon in 1982-83. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is meaningless to consider this Bill in a vacuum. The Bill has to be considered in the overall context of Commonwealth-State tax sharing arrangements and particularly in regard to new factors for assessing State relativities raised by the Commission this year. On 9 June, the Commission advised the Government that a change in State factors was desirable. On the basis of the fiscal equalisation principle and in accordance with section 13 (3) of the States (Personal Income Tax Sharing) Act 1976 new factors were deduced.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. When the Commonwealth's deferral of the Grants Commission recommendations is seen in conjunction with the decision to end 50-50 cost-sharing for State hospitals, it is obvious that an onerous burden has been placed on the States' abilities to provide social services. The States have collectively been deprived of $253m in health funds which they would have received had the present agreement been maintained. When these factors are seen in the context of the Federal Government's divine plan, otherwise known as federalism stage two, the fiscal equalisation process will become an impossibility. The States will have no truck with this electorally unpopular face of Commonwealth-State relationships. New federalism cannot succeed, not only because it is in its very essence unjust, but also because the States perceive it to be totally unnecessary. Mr Deputy Speaker, if you consider the following reasons, I am sure you will see why this is so. In a year in which the Commonwealth expects to receive $3,400m through its crude oil levy, an additional $810m in sales tax, pay-as-you-earn tax receipts of $18,640m and company tax receipts of $5,170m, the Commonwealth is squeezing the States as it never has before. To illustrate this in percentage terms, the Commonwealth's total tax revenue is up by 16.3 per cent while payments to the States are up by only 8.2 per cent. While all power and no responsibility resides in the Commonwealth, the States will pursue de facto methods of revenue raising in view of their inability to secure an equitable distribution of the national cake.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In Queensland, these methods have led to the current brouhaha over casino licences. Even the dogs are barking but if one wants a licence for a casino in Queensland, it would be advisable for one to invest in the Bjelke-Petersen Foundation. The Queensland Treasurer has forestalled the introduction of State income taxes but he has surreptitiously hit Queensland taxpayers in other ways. In his recent Budget speech he is on record as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> The refusal by the Commonwealth to recognise road funding needs of the States and of Queensland in particular has been the cause of the recent substantial increase in Queensland's motor vehicle registration fees. </PARA>
<PARA>The shortfall in road work funding has meant that car registration fees have risen by 60 per cent in the recent State Budget. The Queensland Treasurer, in his recent Budget speech, might also have drawn attention to the standards of metropolitan transport in Queensland, particularly Brisbane's metropolitan rail passenger operations. However, the silence was deafening. To successive Liberal-National Party coalition governments in Queensland providing a viable railway system has always meant that non-metropolitan rail transport and, in particular, rail freight operations receive priority. Overcrowded peak hour rail services, bus transport losses and massive freeway costs could have been reduced substantially if electrification of Brisbane's suburban rail system had gone ahead when it was first mooted. The famous Labor Premier, Ned Hanlon, instigated a commission to inquire into the electrification of the suburban railway system as far back as 1947. The net cost then was estimated at $2.5m. However, in 1958 the Liberal-National Party coalition Government dismantled the electric rail program and today this, easily the most short-sighted political decision concerning Queensland transportation, is again under consideration. The failure of the Government to implement that Ned Hanlon idea in 1947 has cost Queensland taxpayers another $300m. With the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane now only a year away, Brisbane residents and interstate and international visitors commuting on suburban rail transport will encounter the most outdated metropolitan rail system in the country. </PARA>
<PARA> Queensland's Treasurer might equally well have told the real story about education. Education, he said, continues to be given a high priority by the Queensland Government. For the edification of the Federal Parliament, I would like to set the record straight. In fact, Queensland's State school education sector has never been worse off. Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek permission to table a letter from the President of the Class Size and Staffing Campaign, 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FH4">Mr HUMPHREYS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. The letter makes the point that in both primary and secondary State schools in 1980 Queensland had the worst student-teacher ratio of all States and Territories. The Commonwealth's decision not to renew hospital cost-sharing agreements has changed the basic character of Commonwealth assistance for health from assistance specifically related to health costs to payments for general purposes. In translating this change into pragmatic terms, that is, how it has affected services available to Queensland taxpayers, it is instructive to look at community health programs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1975-76, under the Whitlam Government, Commonwealth payments towards Queensland's community health capital program stood at $1.8m and at $3.6m in recurrent payments. The Commonwealth's single block grant to the States covering hospitals, schools, dental programs, community health and women's refuges effectively removes the assurance of funding for community health centres and women's refuges. The Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar) can protest all he likes that the continued viability of women's refuges has not been threatened. The fact of the matter is that no longer is there any onus on the States to spend this money on specific purposes in a responsible manner. I have about another 15 pages of notes for this speech but I will finish on that note so as to allow my other Queensland colleagues some time in this debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I speak in support of the Queensland Grant (Special Assistance) Bill 1981 as the member for Queensland's prosperous and wealthy electorate of Dawson. The situation in my electorate possibly emphasises some of the difficulties that this State faces which give rise to the need for the extra financial assistance of $58.5m. For instance, the sugar, beef, tourism and coal industries in Dawson have been the major causes for decentralising the State. Decentralisation means extra costs, particularly in transport needs. My comments on the road system of Queensland are contained in the speech I made during the grievance debate last Thursday in this House. It is significant, however, that the major deficiency of the Queensland road system and the insufficiency of funds are not covered by the special assistance under this Bill. This inequity must be adjusted by way of extra funds being appropriated by the Commonwealth each year to the national highway system. I believe that Queensland alone needs an extra $50m each year to rectify the imbalance in national road funding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Decentralisation carries with it also the cost of more education and health facilities. The extra grant recognises assessed needs of $60.914m for education and $33.493m for health. Development means that provision has to be made for new schools and new hospitals even though other schools and hospitals become under-utilised following the transfer of population within the State. Some people would say that this would be a natural off-set against the coal levies of over $40m a year collected from the Bowen Basin coal fields and from the company taxation collected from such mining giants as the Utah organisation and Mount Isa Mines Ltd. If this is so this grant redresses the position considerably. Maintenance of State and local roads in developing areas also becomes a major cost item, as does the construction of those roads.</PARA>
<PARA> The State of Queensland has recently legislated to make developing companies provide for some of these infrastructure costs. I see the provision of roads, schools and hospitals as developmental costs that can and should be costed into the final product to be regained from an increased market price that an energy hungry world should be able to afford for an energy resource. I see coal, for all its various uses-for coking, steaming, and providing electricity-as being no less valuable than oil. It should be priced accordingly. In fact, as there is an Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries to set realistic prices for its finite product, Australia should encourage an organisation of coal exporting countries to establish the proper price for that finite resource. The recovery of costs from companies for infrastructure and development would allow more Australians and more Queenslanders to share in the revenue created by this industry. At present, apart from those people immediately involved, I suggest that few Australians feel the real benefit of mining development. </PARA>
<PARA> The other difficulty faced by constituents in the Dawson division is the penalty paid by the consumer for the protection of southern industry centred mainly in New South Wales and Victoria. It is reasonable that those two States should set the standard to compare the degree of financial inequity that Queensland suffers in judging the amount of the grant made. Many of the differences generate from the obsession of this Government to protect inefficient industries, which is a cost borne by northern consumers. It perpetuates a state of inefficiency in industries that have no encouragement to reconstruct or become more efficient by adopting technology available to, and used by, their international competitors. The grant assesses also the need for reimbursement of losses on the railway system which possibly is fair, particularly when it is appreciated that the Tasmanian and South Australian railways are conducted by the Commonwealth which bears the rather substantial loss of about $60m each year. This system and the national system are currently under review by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure. I suggest also that the Queensland railway system could well do with a similar review or parliamentary investigation. </PARA>
<PARA> Realising that there are certain public service obligations facing the Queensland State railway, particularly for pensioner travel and the maintenance of unprofitable lines where no alternative road, air or sea transport is available, it appears that there is a strange desire for that railway department to depress freight charges just to keep the road and sea competitors out of the service. This discounting of prices and the prohibition against the transportation of certain goods other than by rail exists to such an extent that the Australian National Line, the Commonwealth shipping line, has had diminishing services along the coast and, in fact, has threatened to pull out altogether. Road transport operators are then forced to demand reductions in licences and in the tax payable towards road maintenance, with which the Government agrees. As my friend the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Fisher) has just said, in spite of the recent increases in licensing fees in Queensland-as in Tasmania-they are still among the lowest in Australia. As a result many of the companies charging hire fees want to register their own preference to other States. This highlights the fact that licence fees are too low in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> All this time State Ministers complain bitterly about road conditions. The main damage is done by road transporters racing their cargoes the length and breadth of that State with little concern for road conditions, other travellers or the lives of those travellers. They make little contribution to the construction or maintenance of those roads but must take the major blame for the damage done to those State roads. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1979-80 the Queensland railway system lost I believe an amount of $69m. This resulted from a loss in the southern division-that is, the Brisbane area-of $113m. It still wants to electrify the railway system and thus increase the loss. There was a loss in the far northern end of $16m. That end is almost self-supporting. The only profit was from the central Queensland division and that amounted to $60m. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is in the electorate of Dawson and the electorate of Kennedy, as the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) has just reminded me. The central Queensland profit was made from the substantial freight from the coal developments of Dawson and Kennedy but it was used to cover losses from the southern division. The Queensland taxpayers and the Commonwealth combined to cover the balance of the losses. Where has been the gain to Queenslanders from the coal rail freights and the mineral development? It does not exist because of an outdated policy that does not allow the railway system to move into the 1980s. To exacerbate the mischief, recently the general manager of Queensland railways blamed the Commonwealth for the inability to provide refrigerated freight cars for vegetable products within my division because of the restriction on loan borrowings. If the central division of those railways can provide the major profit of $60m, surely management can afford the few thousand dollars required to bring its rolling-stock up to date. In fact, through this grant, the Commonwealth is subsidising that transport system. There has to be acceptance on the part of our State counterparts to properly shoulder their constitutional responsibilities not only in respect of railway services but also in respect of all their services-such as State roads-and not continually to lay the blame on federal shoulders.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Federalism appears to me to mean that maximum funds are given to the States and the Federal Government gets the maximum blame and criticism for any shortcomings in State services. Probably the Bill that we are debating tonight, more than any other Bill, should alert the Commonwealth to a realism of the major problem in co-operative federalism. Whilst never enough can be given to the States, according to them to satisfy their requirements, the Commonwealth will have to bear the blame for any deficiency or shortcoming in any service in a State where the Commonwealth is a contributory in any manner whatsoever, whether it be in the area of roads, water, education, health or whatever. </PARA>
<PARA> Besides the tax sharing grants and this special assistance for Queensland, I acknowledge with thanks the Commonwealth's contribution to water projects in that State. I mention in particular the Dawson electorate where funding well in excess of $3m has been provided for restoration work in the Don River at Bowen caused through flooding in early 1980. The Commonwealth, in addition to picking up the major portion under the natural disaster funds, provided additional amounts under the Water Resources Act. The people of Bowen are appreciative of this Commonwealth assistance being given to a vital agricultural area of the State. The Burdekin Dam project is one in which the State and the Commonwealth will join to provide for storage of water vital to the development of north Queensland and one that has captured the imagination of all north Queenslanders because it will service many of the northern electorates. The honourable member for Kennedy will appreciate that. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been some comment in recent days by the Queensland Premier that must be of concern to many people. On a morning news broadcast on Monday, 26 October, it was said that the Commonwealth should cease its foreign aid program and fund this project, apparently the whole of it, from Commonwealth sources as the Commonwealth Government would be the greatest beneficiary from the taxes that would flow from the further development. Comments such as this must confuse people. Let there be no confusion. The water storage in Queensland is a constitutional State responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the original proposal was put to the Commonwealth by the State for assistance. The Commonwealth accepted that proposal, as is evidenced by an exchange of letters between the Premier and the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), by public Press comments of 26 August 1980 and also by the Prime Minister's response to a question of mine on the previous day. The Commonwealth has agreed to fund, by way of a grant, the cost of the headworks for the dam on the Burdekin in Dawson at an estimated figure of $84.6m in June 1980 prices. It was, and still is, intended to provide the first of these funds during the 1982-83 financial year. There has been no indication that there will be a change in this timetable, as was indicated by the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) in this House last week in answer to a question by the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Dean). </PARA>
<PARA> Queensland, under that agreement, was to provide for arrangements for the proper land usage of that area to be captured by the irrigated waters. It was to provide for the channelling and distribution to water to the sources of the various users at a cost, in mid-1980 terms, of $109.3m. The State is also to meet the cost of $14.9m for drilling and planning and documentation, and also for access roads and on-site employee facilities. The Commonwealth can scarcely commence or escalate its work until these preparatory works are completed. It is only by questioning these very firm initial agreements that confusion and concern will arise. To my knowledge there is no change of heart on the Commonwealth's part to participate in this truly national scheme. I hope that there is no change on behalf of Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> I have visited the area four times, the last visit being during the recent parliamentary recess with my colleagues, the honourable member for Barker (Mr Porter), the honourable member for Paterson (Mr O'Keefe), the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) and my Senate colleague Senator Collard-</PARA>

As I understand it, although the dam is to be in Dawson the waters it will hold will extend into Kennedy and water that great electorate too. I was impressed with the progress that had been made. If only more parliamentarians, particularly our State colleagues, would visit I feel it would revitalise and re-enthuse them towards the project. There is some confusion about whether the amount arrived at for the grant for 1979-80 was greater than the grant now legislated for. There should be no confusion. The amounts are exactly what the Commonwealth Grants Commission suggested. The Commission suggested that the amount of assessed special grant be $44.5m less the advanced grant paid in 1979-80 of $11m, leaving an amount for the assessed completion grant for the 1979-80 year at $33.5m, to which has been added, by this legislation, a further advance grant of $25m for 1980-81. As the honourable member for Griffith (Mr Humphreys) mentioned, there will be a change in the formula. Perhaps it is the figure that is being assessed for the current year by another body that is being confused, but the amount that is being given by this legislation is exactly the same as the amount the Commission arrived at in its calculations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I insist that Queenslanders are not different. This amount is not a hand-out. It is a grant conditionally made in view of that State's scattered population in decentralised areas. There are difficulties in developing industries for the benefit of all Australia where the population cannot properly provide the necessary services. The honourable member for Griffith spoke about this also. I have much pleasure in supporting the legislation, and I recommend it to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before coming to the thrust of my speech I will make some comments on the matters that have been placed before the House by the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite), dealing with them seriatim. He dealt with the road funding in Queensland. I totally agree with what he said about that. Earlier this year I had the opportunity of travelling in New South Wales and Victorian country areas. It is certain that the quality of the highways-I am not talking about the principal roads, but the main roads in those country areas-is much superior to the quality of the country roads in Queensland. I remind the honourable member for Dawson and the Government that, of course, in real terms, road funding has been cut very substantially under this Government. Road funding has been cut once again in the current Budget. The honourable member for Dawson raised the question of road taxes and expressed the view that road transport operators who use the roads and who render such a pounding to the roads-one thinks of the disgraceful state of the Bruce Highway-should make a greater contribution to their maintenance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is the policy of the National Party in Queensland to reduce road taxes and eventually to eliminate them. It has done that to a substantial degree with the exception of taxes imposed on school buses. The former Chief Justice, when a barrister, used section 92 of the Constitution to break down the machinery whereby the States levied taxes on road hauliers. Government members and their counterparts in the State governments should carry the responsibility for the fact that the road hauliers and transport operators in this country do not pay a sufficient contribution towards the maintenance of roads. This burden presses very heavily on Queensland because of its vast size. </PARA>

The Australian Labor Party believes that it should be possible to make railways in Queensland profitable. We do not agree with the comments that have been made about the electrification of suburban lines. In relation to the electrification of lines in the Brisbane metropolitan area, I express my sadness at the fact that the Commonwealth's contribution under the States grants legislation for urban public transport has been withdrawn by this Government and terminated in the present Budget. The lines that have been electrified are receiving a greater level of passenger patronage and, indeed, through the Metropolitan Transit Authority and the Enoggera bus-rail exchange and the like it is obvious that electrification is one of the ways in which those railways can be made more profitable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The final matter I want to deal with in relation to the matters raised by the honourable member for Dawson is the Burdekin Dam. The Labor Party and I are delighted to see some progress being made on the Burdekin Dam. I well recall that in October 1949 Sir Arthur Fadden-he was then Mr Fadden-who was to be the Country Party Treasurer in a coalition government that was about to be elected, made a very solemn promise that if his government was elected it would build the Burdekin River Dam.

<PARA> This legislation is supported by the Labor Party. It arises out of the forty-eighth report of the Commonwealth Grants Commission on special assistance to the States, and the Commonwealth Grants Commission report on tax sharing entitlements of the States gets more than an honourable mention. Since 1975-76 when South Australia withdrew, Queensland has been the only claimant State, having first claimed in 1971-72. I quote from the forty-eighth report of the Commonwealth Grants Commission, which reads in part:</PARA>
<PARA> 4.2 A large proportion of the total of these revenue and expenditure needs has been met through Commonwealth financial assistance other than the special grant recommended by the Commission. In the aggregate this assistance represents a larger amount per head of population for Queensland than for the standard States, although within the aggregate a large positive contribution towards Queensland's needs, represented by its larger per capita income tax sharing entitlements, is partially offset by smaller per capita schools grants and payments for the recurrent costs of public hospitals. The assessed special grant, . . . represents the Commission's assessment of the additional amount needed by Queensland to bring the total amount of assistance up to its needs as assessed by the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>On the basis of the fiscal equalisation principle the report recommended an increase of the State factor as compared with Victoria, standard one, from 1.39085 as presently applies in the 1976 tax sharing legislation to 1.487 now proposed. To take into account the views of the Queensland Government one can do no better than turn to the financial statement by the Queensland Treasurer, Dr Lew Edwards, made on 17 September 1981. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA> All indications are that Queensland is growing and will continue to grow at a rate much faster than any other State in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is the wonderful climate. Dr Edwards continued in his statement:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>First forecasts show that our population will grow at a similar or faster rate in 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> Our workforce is expanding at an even faster rate. Last financial year, our workforce grew by 3.8 per cent compared with 2.3 per cent for Australia as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>. . . retail sales in the March quarter 1981 were up 15.2 per cent on the same period last year compared with 12.6 per cent for Australia as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, new motor vehicle registrations for 1980-81 were 10.2 per cent up on the previous year compared with only 4.5 per cent for Australia as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA>Dr Edwards continued further on in his statement:</PARA>
<PARA> I draw attention to several areas of concern which have particular relevance for this Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> The most important has been the non-acceptance by the Commonwealth for 1981-82 of the new State relativities for Tax Sharing purposes as recommended by the Commonwealth Grants Commission. The proposed new relativities were determined by the Commission after an exhaustive examination of relative State finances over several years. </PARA>
<PARA> Considering the Commission's long history and record of expertise and impartiality in the area of fiscal equalisation, it is surprising that the Commonwealth has as yet given such little weight to the Commission's findings in determining the States entitlements in 1981-82 under the Tax Sharing Arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst the recommendations have not yet been rejected, they are nevertheless deferred for at least twelve months and under further review. If they are then accepted in total, this delay alone will have cost Queensland almost $100 million. </PARA>
<PARA> Another cause for concern has been the unilateral action by the Commonwealth in changing the basis of determining the amount to be distributed to the States in 1981-82 by way of Tax Sharing. The decision to broadly increase last year's States' 'pool' by only 9 per cent has meant a loss to the States collectively of some $375 million on what they would have received had the States received 39.87 per cent of the previous year's Personal Income Tax collections, as applied previously. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite clearly, an increase of only 9 per cent in a very substantial portion of the State's revenues which have to meet cost increases plus cater for a population growth of around 2.5 per cent will cause budget difficulty. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> While the decisions of this body affected Government services in a number of areas, the most pertinent was the changed funding arrangements in relation to hospital and other health care services. The decision by the Commonwealth to end 50-50 cost sharing under the terms of the old Hospital Cost Sharing Agreement and to scale down its contribution to a cost sharing for disadvantaged patients only, has required the State to find additional funds of about $50 million this financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> The full impact of the Commonwealth's decision will become more apparent in 1982-83 when, on current estimates, the States will have to find in excess of $140 million of additional funds to maintain the hospital system. </PARA>
<PARA>In order to explain the financial relationship between the Commonwealth and Queensland in the current year one needs to take into account the fact that Commonwealth Budget receipts for the 1981-82 year will increase by $5,569m, an increase of 15.8 per cent on the preceding year, the largest single component of which is an increase in personal income tax of $3,317m, an increase of 18.9 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill grants $58.5m to Queensland in a year in which the reduction in assistance to hospitals will cost Queensland $50m, with a cost of $140m in the year 1982-83. There have been significant reductions in real terms in revenue assistance to government schools and other programs. While this legislation deals with payments to the Consolidated Revenue Fund one cannot ignore the effect on the State of this Government's year by year decrease in the value of payments for capital purposes. If we make comparisons over the five years tabled in the Budget documents-that is the Budget documents presented in this House-and compare the year 1977-78 with the current year 1981-82, capital expenditure on schools was $34.26m in 1977-78 and will be $25.37m in the current year; for welfare housing capital expenditure has been reduced from $39.81m to $14.15m; for urban public transport it has been reduced from $15.65m to nothing at all in the present year; and for rural adjustment it has been reduced from $9.48m to $2.81m. </PARA>
<PARA> The uniform tax introduced in 1942 has proved to be of great benefit to Queensland and the smaller States. Certain historical factors and the tyranny of distance have meant that Queensland has never at any time received the assistance it should have received from the Commonwealth Government. The most generous assistance which Queensland ever received was during the term of the Whitlam Government. This is borne out by the fact that the States have been struggling to preserve the value in the Labor Government's tax sharing arrangements. We know that the States have come to the Premiers Conference every year to preserve the Whitlam formula. To understand the dimension of the problem I shall quote from a chapter by Dr J. H. Holmes entitled 'Population' in Australia-a geography edited by Dr D. M. Jeans. This passage, which deals with the spread of population in Queensland, appears at page 335:</PARA>
<PARA> Of the mainland States, Queensland shows the greatest degree of dispersion away from the State capital, both in terms of absolute distance . . . and relative to the distribution of land away from the metropolis . . . Queensland's distinctiveness is most apparent for absolute distance, with the State's profile being entirely different from those of all other States. For example, 12.6 per cent of Queensland's population is located over 1,127 km . . . from Brisbane, a percentage which is surpassed at the 322 km . . . distance interval only by New South Wales, where 13.9 per cent of the population live over 322 km from Sydney. Queensland's greater spread of population away from its modal centre can be partly attributed to Brisbane's off-centre location, which leads to a highly skewed population distribution. However, much more influential is the extent of Queensland's ecumene for more than 1,600 km along the coast and the scatter of population over the vast inland pastoral zone, so that almost the entire State is inhabited. </PARA>
<PARA>No formula so far evolved has adequately taken into account that disability brought about by the tyranny of distance. No other State has the assets of climate, resources and soil that Queensland enjoys. Those resources belong to Queensland as part of our nation. This orderly development is part of the birthright of all Australians. The Commonwealth Government has responsibility in this area, and all Australians look forward to the development of more equitable tax sharing arrangements in the future. This Bill grants $58.5m to Queensland. The assistance is welcome and the Opposition supports the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier today the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) raised as a matter of privilege an advertisement published in News Weekly date 14 October 1981. The advertisement featured photographs of former Prime Minister Sir Robert Menzies and the present Prime Minister (Mr Malcom Fraser) and purported to quote comments made by each in support of News Weekly. When I informed the honourable member earlier today that no prima facie case of breach of privilege exists the honourable gentleman referred to my decision on 20 October 1981. On that day I allowed precedence to a motion to refer to the Committee of Privileges an advertisement for Preston Motors Pty Ltd published in the Melbourne Herald of 16 October 1981. The honourable gentleman drew an analogy between the two advertisements. Last week I said that I wished the Committee of Privileges to look at advertising which purported to show members of the House, without their knowledge, advocating a particular product. I did not find that the matter raised constituted a prima facie breach. I believe that the Committee of Privileges will look at all aspects of this type of advertising in its inquiry into the Preston Motors advertisement. Accordingly, I see no need to allow precedence for a motion to refer this matter to the Committee of Privileges. Such a reference would only duplicate the existing reference.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, do I understand from what you are saying that the Committee of Privileges looks at this reference in its own right? It seems to me that the analogy that I raised with you, sir, with respect, was relevant. In the instant case we have a particular publication seeking a commercial advantage by using the photograph of the present Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the photograph of a past Prime Minister. I take the point that you have made, but it seems to me that if on a previous occasion you made a reference to the Committee of Privileges this statement is placing a burden on the Committee of Privileges. That Committee is ultimately the instrument of this House. With great respect, I do not know of any authority by which the Committee of Privileges, in examining the instant reference that you, sir, made to it, is entitled on its own motion to say that in deliberating upon and considering the issues in what might be described as the Preston Motors advertisement it will take unto itself consideration of the particular matter that I raised with you. I do not believe that is competent for or open to the Committee of Privileges. Ultimately, the Committee is an instrument of this House and can act only on instruction from this House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With respect, if what you are saying is that the generality of the reference of the previous advertisement to the Committee of Privileges entitles the Committee to look at these matters at large, this places a burden upon the Committee of Privileges which I think might be too great having regard to its particular responsibilities to this House. There are differences between the cases. I concede those differences in respect of this advertisement. </PARA>

That was a course of action which I took in the interests of the House. The interests of the House, I think, will be adequately coped with by the Privileges Committee in consideration of that matter.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In my comments this evening, in the interests of ensuring that those who wish to speak in this debate may do so, I shall be brief and confine myself to only a couple of points. We are considering here the Queensland Grant (Special Assistance) Bill which gives special assistance to Queensland in respect to 1979-80 and 1980-81. The Treasurer (Mr Howard) in his second reading speech stated that as an iterim arrangement for 1981-82 the Commonwealth has now provided additional general revenue grants to New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland in recognition of the likelihood that, following a further review by the Commonwealth Grants Commission, relativities in relation to the Commission's latest report will be adjusted in favour of these States; that is, of course, including Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I come to this proposition: There is special consideration, in respect of those previous years, being given to Queensland. It has been acknowledged by the Treasurer that further additional general assistance may be required. I wish by reference to these two points to state that there are instances where such special assistance is needed. The two points I raise briefly in my contribution to the debate are, firstly, roads and, secondly, the issue of the Burdekin Dam. Firstly, on the question of roads, I refer in particular to the national highway system. Two very long stretches of road make up the national highway system in Queensland. One is the Bruce Highway, which runs along the coast from Brisbane to Cairns, and the other is what is essentially the Warrego Highway, which runs through the centre of the State. I refer particularly to the national highway system because that is the road system in the States for which the Commonwealth accepts 100 per cent of funding for approved projects. Those are the areas where in my view some of the greatest deficiencies can be seen. These national highway lengths are the ones which serve to a very large extent some of the great needs of a growing and decentralised State, as is Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer for the sake of brevity to a speech given in this House by the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) on 22 October 1981. He spoke in a grievance debate. He referred in particular to the Bruce Highway and the national highway system in Queensland. He made many points which I have supported in the past. I can do no better than to endorse what he said. Let me isolate a couple of points that he made to reinforce what he said and to reinforce my view about the national highway system. There is an injustice in the split up of the allocation of national roads funds to the disadvantage of Queensland as against other States. Let us consider the length of national highways in the three eastern States back in 1977. Victoria had 690 kilometres, New South Wales had 1,335 kilometres and Queensland had 3,922 kilometres. Yet the division of Federal funds for the national highway system comes down to this: Victoria, with 12 per cent of the highway system, gets 24 per cent of available Federal funds, New South Wales, with 22 per cent of the national highway system, gets 48 per cent of available funds; yet Queensland, with 66 per cent, gets a meagre 28 per cent of the funds. So there is an enormous misallocation in that respect. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="B87">Mr DEAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I remind my honourable friend that it is not just a question of where people are. It is a question of where roads are, where needs are, where development is and where tourists go. We are not talking about just a simplistic population basis. It is a question of what is needed in the national interest. The national interest has been accepted as a concern for the national highway system. It follows from that that the whole basis of dividing available funds between the eastern States in particular needs to reassessed. I do not deny that some other States, South Australia in particular, also have particular needs but there is certainly a need to reallocate available funds for the national highway system. Why is that so? As I said earlier to my honourable friend, it is not just a question of people; it is a question of recognising that Queensland is much more decentralised than any other mainland State. It is a question of recognising the tourist potential and development that exists in that State. There is a need to recognise the resource development that is taking place in that State. In the national interest, when one concerns oneself with a national highway system, and taking into account the very considerable mileage that exists in the Queensland system, there is a very clear and obvious need to reallocate the existing resources as between the States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is a second leg to the problem; that is that, while the Commonwealth minister has a power to, as it were, veto projects on the national highway system in the States, nevertheless the practice in the States is to accept what the State main roads departments wish to do on the national highway system and to which projects they allocate priority. In my view that is not happening properly in Queensland. The Queensland Government's allocation of existing resources for Queensland to the national highway system has not weighted heavily enough in favour of the developing regions where all the narrow bridges, all the narrow bitumen surfaces, all the indifferent surfaces, all the potholes and, indeed, all the gravel roads are. That is something that is not just a Commonwealth concern, therefore. It is something that the Queensland Government has to be worried about. It is up to the Queensland Government, with whatever funds it has-and as I have said, there ought to be more funds-to make sure that it gives proper recognition to all the other factors I have mentioned in addition to sheer population factors. I just make the point that the national highway system in Queensland as against the other States has suffered. More needs to be done. In conclusion on that point I can only again support the comments of the honourable member for Dawson on 22 October. </PARA>
<PARA> At long last-I am pleased to see that the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Cross), who has now left the chamber, recognises this fact-we in Queensland are all delighted to see progress on the Burdekin Dam project. I remind the honourable member for Brisbane that that progress is the result of coalition government decisions, in Queensland and federally. Nevertheless, it is at last going ahead. It is therefore with some concern that I noted comments of the Premier of Queensland in a Press statement issued on Sunday evening of this week, which was reported widely in the northern media on Monday and again, I believe, today. I shall firstly quote some of the comments that he made. The Press release began as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Government had a duty to escalate the development of the Burdekin Dam project in the interests of Australian federalism . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That was the opening comment in the Press release. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA> In the interests of federalism, the Commonwealth Government has a duty to help the Queensland Government get on with the Burdekin project. </PARA>
<PARA>He stated further:</PARA>
<PARA> The taxes that could be eventually raised from this project would not only assist the Commonwealth but would be a major stimulator to both State and local government. </PARA>
<PARA>He stated further:</PARA>
<PARA> We want to accelerate the Burdekin scheme so the people of the region and the economy generally can benefit sooner from the anticipated advances. </PARA>
<PARA> This is largely dependent upon the provision of Commonwealth funding. </PARA>
<PARA>Let us look at that rather extraordinary statement. He started off by talking about the Commonwealth Government having a duty to escalate the development of the project. Let him be reminded that it is his Government and his Irrigation and Water Supply Commission which has the control of this project. It is, after all, a State Government project to which the Commonwealth has made a very substantial commitment. It is the Irrigation and Water Supply Commission in Queensland which has established the timetable for this project. It has already set down the planning and the preliminary works for the project, when construction of the dam wall, for which the Commonwealth will pay, is to start, how long that will take and how long it will take to do the irrigation works. So how can he say that the Commonwealth has a duty to escalate the development when the planning and the timetable is in his or his Government's hands? That is a very curious statement. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA> In the interests of federalism, the Commonwealth Government has a duty to help the Queensland Government get on with the Burdekin project. </PARA>
<PARA>I agree wholeheartedly. I have argued that ever since I became a member of this place in late 1977. Of course the Commonwealth Government has that duty. Hence I was delighted to see the Commonwealth commitment to the project in June or thereabouts of last year in which the Commonwealth said: 'We will pay for the costs of the dam wall itself'. That cost was then estimated to be about $84m. I have no argument with that matter. I have no argument with the Premier that the taxes which will eventually be raised from this project will assist the Commonwealth. I have no argument with him that they will be a major stimulator to both State and local government. But that comment of his indicates the co-operative federal nature of this project. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> We-</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the Queensland Government-</PARA>
<PARA> want to accelerate the Burdekin scheme</PARA>
<PARA>And:</PARA>
<PARA> This is largely dependent on the provision of Commonwealth funding. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the most curious comment of all. As I have already said, he or his Government has the responsibility of actually planning, timetabling and carrying out the project. If he thinks that the project ought to be accelerated, let him prove the case. Let him put the proposition. Let his Irrigation and Water Supply Commission plan it that way. In general response to the Premier's quite extraordinary statement I say that I agree, as I always have, that it is in the interests of federalism-in the interest of the Commonwealth as a whole and in the interests of Queensland, both state-wide and locally-that this project be proceeded with. I totally agree with that statement. But I say to the Premier of Queensland: 'If you think it ought to be accelerated, then you and your Government must do something about having it accelerated'. To that extent the ball is back in his court. Having indicated in my comments on these two matters the general approval I have for this measure, I draw my comments to a close. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will follow the example of my colleague the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Dean) in limiting my remarks to enable following speakers to say their piece. This legislation is as important for what it excludes as it is for what it includes, for while the Bill before the House provides a substantial grant to the Government of Queensland, it does not include a special grant to that State for the current year. That is significant because this will be the first year since 1975 that Queensland has not formally received assistance through the Grants Commission. As well as this year being the International Year of Disabled Persons, it will be long remembered as the year when the Queensland Government hung up its claimant State poor man's cap. Instead the Australian public in 1981 was treated to one of the most unedifying political displays of horse trading ever witnessed at a Premiers Conference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> An established procedure, which I will not enumerate in my limited time, is usually followed to determine the amount to be paid to claimant States. This year, however, special circumstances have created a different situation. The Queensland Government withdrew its application for special assistance as the claimant State because of an agreement reached after much back stabbing and back scratching at the infamous May Premiers Conference and later ratified at the June Conference. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will recall that it was the case of the missing $68.5m-not that it was really ever missing. Both the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Treasurer (Mr Howard) knew where it was all the time-in the Federal Treasury-and that was precisely where they wanted it to stay. But both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer were forced to admit publicly after the May Premiers Conference that the Commonwealth negotiating position would have allowed them to pass on to the States an additional one per cent of tax revenue had the Premiers been prepared to fight tooth and nail for it. I recall this briefly because I find this a very unsatisfactory manner of determining the amount of money to be paid to the States. In fact the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Jull) described it in this way:</PARA>
<PARA> The whole Government handling of this thing is madness. </PARA>
<PARA>This is one of the few times I would agree with the honourable member. I have dealt only briefly with the highly questionable background to the Commonwealth tax sharing arrangements this year with Queensland, but I have done so for the purpose of highlighting the difference between an orderly, equitable, controlled and co-operative analysis of Queensland's expenditure needs and revenue raising capacity which is the hallmark of the Grants Commission and the depressed level of politics or Federal-State horse trading to which both the Prime Minister and his nemesis in the north are equally prepared to stoop. To witness this political manipulation must strike horror and outrage in the hearts of those earnest members of the Grants Commission. After all, they exist for the purpose of objective inquiry into a claimant State's positive expenditure needs. Considering the situation in Australia, this would not be an easy task. In fact I would like to pay tribute to the Commission for its overall success in determining grants to the States. </PARA>
<PARA> Without becoming bogged down in the Commission's methodology, let me say that it is symptomatic of the Federal structure which our founding fathers-perhaps I should say 'foundering fathers'-left as their legacy that one of the first obstacles the Commission must overcome is the lack of uniformity in budgetary procedures adopted by the respective State governments. It never ceases to amaze that of the three levels of government-national, State and local-the most natural political units are the national and local levels of government. Yet the States are the ones proclaiming their so-called rights. Local government authorities revolve around clearly defined local communities. Similarly national governments represent a clearly defined national unit. State governments are a throwback to the colonial nineteenth century. They are not individual and clearly defined geographic, demographic, ethnic and economic units. Apart from Tasmania, State borders are arbitrary, drawn up by some London-based bureaucrat in the British Home Office in the last century. We are left with the ludicrous situation where life in a community such as Tweed Heads depends almost entirely on which side of the imaginary State border one happens to live. Given this colonial albatross, we are left to make the whole thing work and the Grants Commission has been established to make it work equitably, the guiding principle being that all Australians, regardless of the State in which they live, reserve the right to receive equivalent government services and to enjoy as near as practicable the equivalent standard of living. </PARA>
<PARA> At governmental level, the Grants Commission's function is to ensure as much as possible that all States are able to function at a standard not appreciably below that of other States. There are restrictions on the Commission's effectiveness in this respect. It depends to a great extent on reliable, objective statistical information provided by such sources as the State governments themselves and the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The Queensland Government is notoriously secretive when it comes to public accountability. The Queensland Premier has successfully stood in the way of the formation of a public accounts committee for years, ignoring the Opposition's appeal for its establishment and the plaintive bleating of the Premier's Liberal coalition cohorts. One can understand the frustrations of the grants commissioners when the data they so very much need to assist Queensland's needs simply is not available. As well cutbacks in the Bureau of Statistics certainly have not helped. How can a government rationalise severely cutting back its single most important source of statistical information on which it relies to base its planning and policies for the future? It is not logical. What sort of madness is it that makes governments deny themselves as well as the public the benefits of this information?</PARA>
<PARA> There is method in the madness of the Queensland Government's approach to the public release of accounts. The trepidation with which the Queensland Government greets the disclosure of its accounts is easily explained by the reports in today's Press. Mr Neville Warburton, the State Labor member for Sandgate, which falls within my Federal electorate, rightly points to the Queensland Government's unique system of unlimited expenses as an example of how the Queensland Premier has mauled and perverted the Westminster system to the point where it is a national scandal. Clearly the Queensland Government thrives on ignorance. Perhaps this is the reasoning behind the Federal Government's cutbacks within the Bureau of Statistics. </PARA>
<PARA> On the issue of statistics, I make this point: Certain comparative statistics made available by the Commission are worth nothing in the context of the Bill we are discussing. For example, in 1975-76, of the specific purpose payments for capital purposes indicated in tables in Budget Paper No. 7, $1,770,000 went towards community health compared with this year's allocation of $450,000. There are more examples of degenerate trends in Commonwealth allocations. The allocation for housing for servicemen in 1975-76 was $7.5m. In 1980-81 it was $800,000. The allocation for universities was $6,453,000 in 1975-76. In 1980-81 it was $6,253,000-a very dramatic fall in real terms. The same applies to expenditure on schools and colleges of advanced education. Senior citizen centres have also had a fall in real terms of about 25 per cent. Expenditure on urban public transport is down from $8,985,000 in 1975-76 to $7,875,000 in 1980-81. Road expenditure has fallen in real terms from $8,980,000 in 1975-76 to $7,764,000 in 1980-81. Honourable members should ask Russ Hinze how he feels about that. There are a number of areas where funding has been cut dramatically and this has definitely affected Queensland in housing, Aboriginal advancement, the school dental scheme and transport planning and research. In 1975-76, $13,767,000 went to Queensland earmarked for sewerage. In all of the six and a half years a mere $100,000 has been allocated to and spent on sewerage. The list of reduced Commonwealth Government allocations to Queensland goes on and on. </PARA>
<PARA> I have little in common with the Queensland Premier. We share the same State, however, and as a Queenslander I find myself in sympathy with the Queensland Government in respect of the treatment meted out to it by the Federal Government. Yet for its own part the Queensland Government exhibits an appalling attitude to its own allocations to the three areas of health, education and welfare services. In 1979-80 Queensland expended a higher average per head of population on education than did other States. The same thing happened with health and with welfare services. Expenditure in these three areas is less in Queensland than in any other State. It is $37 per head less than the Australian average for education, $30 per head less than the average for health, and $6 per head less than the average expenditure of the six States on welfare services. Compared with States such as South Australia and Western Australia, which spend $32.40 per head on welfare services, Queensland spends under $20. On top of this scandal, in 1979-80 household disposable income per head in Queensland was the second lowest of all the States. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to add to the statement I made a moment ago. Life is great in the sunshine State, as we are often told, but it is great if you are healthy, employed in a well paid job, educated in a private school, and are a card-carrying member of the National Party. The Grants Commission will compensate Queensland for factors beyond its control. I welcome this assistance but, sadly, neither the Grants Commission nor the Federal Government can control the disbursement of the funds allocated in this Bill to ensure that they are distributed to the sick, the handicapped, children, pensioners, Aboriginals, unemployed, and all of those who suffer from this Government's policies and the twin evils of Queensland's natural disadvantages and the tyranny of the Queensland Premier. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8C7">Mr GILES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I said except in Queensland. I am not here to deny the legitimacy of this grant. It is made up of a completion grant dating to 1979-80 of $33.5m and an advance grant for 1980-81 of $25m, totalling $58.5m to go to Queensland. I think what has struck other States with absolute amazement in relation to this section 96 grant from the Commonwealth Grants Commission is that we are told, through the Press and elsewhere of the enormous mineral resources of that State, in addition to these of Western Australia, and the tremendous royalties that flow from that source back into State coffers. As to the other States-over a period of years under Premier Playford 97 per cent of South Australians were granted State water supplies. In South Australia 97 per cent of the people-I believe that is the highest proportion in the world-turn on a tap for government water. Of course, the number in Queensland is minimal. Perhaps it rains more often in Queensland than it does in other States, which accounts for the lack of hair on the tops of some Queenslanders' heads, with the leather-looking countenance below, with respect to you, Mr Deputy Speaker. The Else-Mitchell report states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Commission recommends that a grant of special assistance be paid to Queensland in 1980-81. </PARA>
<PARA>I have already mentioned the amounts to the House. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> The completion grant recommended for 1979-80 is a final assessment of the grant recommended for Queensland for that year, after deducting the amount of $11m which the State received as an advance grant in that year. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not think I am misquoting the honourable member for Lilley (Mrs Darling). When I came up from my office I think I heard her say that there appeared to be no record of any payments for Queensland for the year 1981-82. If that was a bare statement, perhaps I ought to reply to it. The fact is that Queensland is the only State in Australia during recent years that has been a mendicant State under the Grants Commission. On that basis it has been awarded this sum, which is made up of those two components totalling $58.5m. I repeat that it is to the complete amazement of the rest of Australia. If people are going to express amazement, and I am in this difficulty tonight, obviously they have to look at the criteria under which Queensland was awarded this sum of money in addition to the general disbursement grants that affect other States. </PARA>
<PARA> The Grants Commission adopts a complex series of mechanisms in order to arrive at this conclusion. Perhaps the overriding one is that in assessing Queensland with respect to New South Wales and Victoria, those States have been used as the standard. If there is a discrepancy, and I am not saying in any way that there is, it is that in the last two years Queensland has been assessed in an overall sense in respect to the standard of New South Wales and Victoria. I am not aware that Western Australia, Tasmania or South Australia have applied to be mendicant States and have been so assessed. The excellent forty-eighth report of the Commonwealth Grants Commission, which deals with special assistance for the States, when assessing expenditure needs of claimant States, not revenue-producing within those States, points out in relation to criteria:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the Commission has adopted a number of approaches which it describes as the direct assessment, factor assessment, per capita difference, modified per capita difference and equal per capita methods. </PARA>
<PARA>I note that a Bill was introduced today that will give us an opportunity, on a future occasion, to come down with a more rational assessment of some of those criteria and whether they are the correct criteria that ought to apply at a later date in relation to the way the Commonwealth Grants Commission sees the new breakdown of grant disbursements to the States. Once again, and there are altered criteria, I notice that Queensland comes out with a most favoured position by comparison with many other States, with perhaps Western Australia and South Australia suffering most. </PARA>
<PARA> I put the proposition to the House tonight that since the Grants Commission came down with these altered criteria, which are not yet applicable, as a result of the last Premiers Conference, but may well be in future, a lot of new information has become available to the Commonwealth Government. I refer to the need in some State Budgets to increase revenue tremendously during this financial year. I know that in my State of South Australia that is so. I do not see the same need to raise increased revenue in New South Wales or Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> Whether or not that is a criterion, the fact still remains that South Australia, in spite of increasing its revenue raising decisions quite enormously in this last Budget, is still budgeting on a deficit in the upper $30m area, as I remember without having the figures before me, while Queensland is budgeting for a credit of around $28m. Something is odd in the state of Denmark. All these things cannot be correct. </PARA>
<PARA> If I were to go too far at this stage I would show myself, quite plainly, as not being competent enough on the spur of the moment to absorb the criteria I just read out. I must simply point to the fact that a lot of criteria will be applicable after the recommendations in the Grants Commission report. Quite frankly, the Federal Government in combination with the State Premiers must look again at the criteria to be adopted in future for the disbursement of Federal grants as recommended by the Grants Commission. I have sought leave from the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) to incorporate in Hansard a chart, Table 7 from Budget Paper No. 7 of this year, which deals with the estimates of identified health grants to States and the Northern Territory in this year. It deals with cost sharing grants for 1980-81 and with a 10 per cent escalation. It deals with the special additional grant to Queensland, the basic health grant in respect of 1980-81, the assessed additional revenue raising capacity from specified hospital charges, State by State, it adds 60 per cent to the latter item and it deals with the estimated grants for 1981-82. I seek leave to have the table incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>

Let me grant two things that I think are fair in this field. First of all, Queensland has always aimed at providing a free hospitalisation program, to its great credit. But let us consider that identified health grants from the Federal Government put Queensland in a very favourable position. Perhaps it is also fair to recall that Whitlam, in a moment of temporary generosity-I will not say madness-bought South Australia's country rail services. Grants to South Australia currently range from $25m to $60m. The sale of the rail services was something that the Grants Commission wished to be taken into account in any new look at the formula for judging the disbursal of funds. But many other things also ought to be taken into account.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was unable to discern from the speech of the honourable member for Lilley (Mrs Darling) whether she was in favour of the Bill before the House tonight. I certainly am in favour of that on the basis that this is a completion grant and the last donation to a mendicant State-it is an asinine situation for Queensland to be a begging State-from the Grants Commission. What an absurd situation it is if all the Press reports about the revenue that flows to that State Government are true. On another occasion I wish to have a much closer look at the criteria. I believe the Federal Government should do so because, ostensibly, it is a patent absurdity that Queensland should be getting an advantage over every other State in Australia to the tune of $58.5m. </PARA>

Mr Speaker and Mr President have provided the following details in respect of the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff, the Department of the Parliamentary Library and the Joint House Department.</PARA>
<PARA> (1) The Review of Commonwealth Functions did not have any particular application to the Parliamentary Departments. However, in the statement outlining the main features of the Review of Commonwealth Functions, the Executive's decision to aim for an objective of a further 2% reduction over the next 2 years in the number of Commonwealth Government employees in the areas subject to staff ceilings was announced.</PARA>
<PARA> Interim provisional ceilings for 1981-82 notified to the Parliamentary Departments have reflected this 2% reduction. Provisional reductions were:</PARA>
<PARA> Department of the Senate-3 positions</PARA>
<PARA> Department of the House of Representatives-3 positions</PARA>
<PARA> Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff-2 positions</PARA>
<PARA> Department of the Parliamentary Library-3 positions</PARA>

<PARA> (2) As in most instances negotiations with the Executive are envisaged concerning the maintenance of current staff levels or expansion in staff ceiling cover, it is not possible to identify any such positions.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Any reduction in staff ceilings will in most instances result in diminished service to Members of Parliament. However, in accordance with the general philosophy of the Review of Commonwealth Functions, the Parliamentary Annexes of the former Hotel Canberra and Hotel Kurrajong are being cleaned by private contractors and a private security firm is assisting with security.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Department of the Senate-As part of the Review of Commonwealth Functions, the Department of the Senate was requested to effect a 3% reduction in real terms on the current level of expenditure on its estimates for items other than salary items. This reduction in real terms was applied to all Administrative Expenses and Other Services in the Department of the Senate's Budget bids for 1981-82.</PARA>
<PARA> Department of the House of Representatives-The Executive announced as part of the Review of Commonwealth Functions its intention to effect a 3% reduction in real terms on the current level of expenditure on administrative and operational items. A 3% reduction in real terms was applied to all administrative and operational items on which proposed expenditures for the Department of the House of Representatives were sought in 1981-82.</PARA>
<PARA> Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff-No reductions were made in the Department's appropriation for 1981-82.</PARA>
<PARA> Department of the Parliamentary Library-The most noticeable effects are in the area of collection development and the capacity to apply technological advances.</PARA>
<PARA> Across the board cuts on administrative expenses, freight, postage, stores etc. will inhibit the Department's capacity to maintain its existing level of services.</PARA>
<PARA> Joint House Department-Total appropriations of the Joint House Department were reduced by $167,000 without Presiding Officer-Leaders of the Houses consultation. Discussions are to be held between the Leaders and the Presiding Officers on the effects that the cuts will have on the provision of services to the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA> The Joint House Department's estimates for Administrative Expenses were exempted from the 3% real reduction guidelines. Estimate bids were limited to the same real level of expenditure in 1981-82 as in 1980-81. Estimates accordingly were reduced by $50,000 under Item 105.2.02, Office Services and $117,000 under Item 105.2.03, Other Administrative Expenses.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="014">Mr MacKellar</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) A three-tier structure of health fund contributions has not been considered as it is not regarded as being consistent with the community rating principle, which is the basis of the health insurance arrangements. The application of the principle does accept that single people pay half the family rate but any acceptance of family size as a factor in setting contribution rates would be regarded as contrary to the principle. It is of significance to this question that, for the majority of couples, the community rating principle would have worked in their favour at some stage during their period of insurance coverage e.g. before their own children became independent. The principle, therefore, not only works to keep contributions within reasonable reach of all persons at any point in time but also provides, during the contributor life of an individual member, for an even spread of contributions regardless of varying potential benefit utilisation.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) It could generally be expected that, under a system that took family size into account as a factor in determining contribution rates, families with dependants would pay relatively higher rates than they do at present. Further, the greater number of dependants could mean further higher contribution rates; a situation which could well disadvantage large families. However, data are not available to my Department that would enable an accurate assessment to be made of the effects of such a change. It is also likely that the effects would vary between health funds, depending on the composition of their membership.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Has his attention been drawn to allegations that Conzinc Riotinto of Australia Ltd is negotiating for the De Beers organisation to gain control over the marketing of diamonds from the Argyle project; if so, is it a fact that (a) such a contract will mean that Australians will lose control over the pricing, production and marketing of these Australian minerals, and return to Australia prices substantially below world prices; (b) the extent and value of Australian diamond resources at Argyle are unknown to any Commonwealth agency and (c) the Argyle deposit is substantially foreign-owned with its value being at least $1,000 million.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Has his attention also been drawn to an article in Barrons magazine of 6-12 September 1981 intimating that Australia now represents the greatest single challenge to the De Beers stranglehold on the international diamond wholesaling business and that Australia could set up its own marketing mechanism which might some day rival De Beers.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BU4">Mr Anthony</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. However, the Ashton Joint Venture management stated publicly on 28 August 1981 that no decisions had been taken about possible arrangements for the marketing of diamonds from the Argyle deposit.</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Since no contract with the De Beers organisation has been negotiated or is in the process of being negotiated, any statement about the possible effects of such a contract is speculative.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The extent and value of the Argyle deposit will not be able to be estimated until the evaluation of the deposit is completed. What can be said on the basis of the evaluation to date is that Argyle is a large, high grade deposit but the average quality and size of the diamonds is low by world standards so that the return from their sale can be expected to be below the world average. A large proportion of the diamonds so far recovered is of industrial quality with a value far less than gem quality diamonds.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) The major partners in the Ashton Joint Venture are substantially foreign owned but the two companies involved have been granted naturalising status. As well as having given the required undertakings to increase the level of their Australian equity to 51 per cent, the companies were also required as a pre-condition for the granting of naturalising status to have ensured that their company articles of association provide for a majority of Australian citizens on their board of directors. This is in line with the Government's intention that a naturalising company should be able to operate with a predominantly Australian board and should be controlled by that Board.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) and (4) It is not intended to conduct any such inquiry. The partners in the Ashton Joint Venture are well aware of the general Government objective that resource development should be conducted in the national interest as well as in the interest of the companies and shareholders involved. The AJV partners have been advised that the arrangements for the marketing of output from the project and the question of any effect that may have on the equity and control will be examined by the Government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (a) No. A draft environmental impact statement (EIS) covering the Airport Development Works was prepared by the Department of Transport in 1978 and released for public comment in December 1978 in accordance with the requirements of the Commonwealth's Environment Protection Administrative Procedures. This document was available to the public through the Australian Government Bookshops. The final EIS was published by the Department in February 1979 following review of public comments received.</PARA>
<PARA> Commencing in 1974, a series of studies was undertaken by Commonwealth and State government authorities and academic institutions to assess the potential environmental effects associated with proposals for the redevelopment of Brisbane Airport. Reports on those background studies were published as Volumes 1-5 of the Brisbane Airport Development Project Environmental Study in 1977. A further volume of reports on continuing studies was published as Volume 6 in June 1979.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) No further environmental impact statement has been published since 1979. Major sand dredging and site reclamation were considered in the 1979 EIS. Current proposals for further dredging and site reclamation associated with the proposed 14/32 cross runway were the subject of a Notice of Intention submitted to the Department of Home Affairs and Environment on 30 September 1980 in accordance with the requirements of Paragraph 2.1 of the Environment Protection Administrative Procedures.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Home Affairs and Environment advised the Department of Transport on 17 November 1980 that preparation of a further EIS would not be required.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr Howard</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes, according to news media reports.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The incidence of a wholesale sales tax as between the suppliers and the final consumers of the taxable article depends on the extent to which suppliers are able to pass the tax forward to consumers. This, in turn, depends on the degree of competition among suppliers and the level of demand among consumers. Against this background, it would be impracticable to attempt to estimate the aggregate cost to consumers of the proposed 2.5 per cent sales tax on books. At the same time, having regard both to conventional mark-up practices and to the additional administrative costs which the Association claims the new tax will impose on the book trade, I have difficulty in reconciling a 2.5 per cent increase in price at wholesale level with a 15 per cent increase at retail level. Such a movement suggests that the book trade would pass forward to the final retail purchaser up to 12 times the tax imposed at wholesale level.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) and (4) Yes, according to news media reports.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Books, magazines and newspapers are not the only goods now exempt that are to be brought under tax at 2.5 per cent and it is quite misleading to refer to them in isolation. The fact is that a major element of the 1981-82 Budget strategy was to reduce the overall deficit by almost $1,000m. As I said in my Budget Speech, this is a decisive move which symbolises the Government's determination not to endanger the gains already made with regard to containing and reducing inflation and to sustaining growth in the private sector. To ensure that reduction in the deficit, it was found necessary to raise additional revenue. This is to be done in part through increases in the existing rates of sales tax and the subjection to sales tax at 2.5 per cent of a range of currently exempt items including books, magazines and newspapers. This move also accords with the Government's view that such a change in the mix of direct and indirect taxes will increase the potential for desirable reductions in direct taxes, and particularly personal income tax as future economic and budgetary conditions permit.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) and (2) In September 1978 a smelter belonging to the Government-owned Iron and Steel Mills (NISM) of Singapore was contaminated by radioactive material. Contamination was thought to have resulted from the inadvertent inclusion of an industrial radioactive source in a consignment of scrap metal from the Kambalda plant of Western Mining Corporation. After decontamination of the smelter, NISM was left holding a quantity of waste material containing radioactive caesium. The bulk of this material is contained in 119 steel drums.</PARA>
<PARA> Following protracted negotations between the Australian and Singapore companies regarding disposal of the material, the Singapore Government formally sought Australian assistance in February 1981. In late March 1981 the Singapore Government was advised that the Australian Government and the Western Australian State Government had agreed in principle to provide the necessary approvals which would allow the companies involved to transfer and store the material in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) A site approximately 29 kilometres in a direct line south-south-east of the Kambalda Post Office has been proposed by Western Mining Corporation for disposal of the material.</PARA>
<PARA> The Western Australian Radiological Council has approved the suitability of this site and its proposed method of use from a radiological point of view, and the Western Australian Government is arranging for company use of the site. The relevant local government authority, the Shire of Coolgardie, has been advised.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Clients referred to the National Acoustic Laboratories (NAL) by the Department of Veterans' Affairs may encounter delays of 3 to 4 months in obtaining appointments at some NAL centres throughout Australia. In the past Veterans' Affairs' clients were given a higher priority than those of the Department of Social Security (i.e. pensioners). It has now been necessary to bring the priority allocated to the former into line with that allocated to pensioners. (This has taken place in all States except New South Wales where it will be implemented as soon as possible). As a consequence, Veterans' Affairs' clients now experience waiting times longer than formerly. The need to rearrange priorities stems from the increasing demand for NAL services placed on finite staff resources.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Other referrals to NAL include: children (up to 21 years) with confirmed or suspected hearing loss, many of whom are fitted with hearing aids; new pensioners; eligible adults with NAL hearing aids; and small groups such as Department of Transport and Commonwealth compensation clients.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) In all hearing centres the delay encountered by pensioners is either equal to or exceeds the delay encountered by Veterans' Affairs' clients. In most hearing centres the delay encountered by eligible adults with NAL aids (this includes both pensioners and Veterans' Affairs' clients) is equal to or less than for new Veterans' Affairs' clients.</PARA>
<PARA> In all hearing centres children 4 years and under and children over 4 years with an aid encounter less of a delay than Veterans' Affairs' clients.</PARA>
<PARA> The comparison of delays encountered by Veterans' Affairs' clients to those for children over 4 years without an aid varies from State to State. Generally children in this group wait an equal or lesser period of time than Veterans' Affairs' clients. However there are a few centres where this group of children is waiting longer than Veterans' Affairs' clients.</PARA>
<PARA> The other small groups of clients experience delays equal to or only slightly less than those encountered by Veterans' Affairs' clients.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Following a Joint Management Review of NAL activities a number of its recommendations for a more efficient service have been implemented and further recommendations will be progressively adopted. However, with the ever increasing demand on NAL services, it is inevitable that there will be some delays in providing appointments to clients.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Exploratory discussions and correspondence took place between representatives of the Australian and Belgian governments in the second half of 1972, with a view to negotiating a social security agreement for reciprocal portability of pensions.</PARA>
<PARA> In view of planned amendments for general portability of Australian pensions, in February 1973 the Belgian authorities were formally advised that Australia did not wish to proceed to conclusion of an agreement of the type then contemplated. Belgium did not respond affirmatively to a subsequent Australian invitation in July 1973 to consider the possibility of entering into a comprehensive reciprocal agreement, but a brief exchange of information between officials occurred on a courtesy basis in June 1975.</PARA>
<PARA> The general matter of reciprocal agreements on social security is currently under consideration. As part of that process, the possible terms upon which Australia might be prepared to conclude agreements with a number of countries (which could include Belgium) are being examined.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) From time to time articles in the ethnic press and other newspapers, which relate to the payment of pensions for people of various backgrounds, come to my attention. I am not able to ascertain from the question to what particular article it refers.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) and (3) I have indicated in the Senate on a number of occasions that the general matter of reciprocal agreements on social security is currently under consideration. Any policy review on the feasibility of entering into additional agreements would be incomplete without taking account of the conditions for payment of pensions in Australia and overseas. But there is no basis in fact for any speculation that the Government intends to do away with portability of pensions.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The information is not available.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Statistics relating to the value of overseas pensions brought to Australia by immigrants are not available. However:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Using information on income from overseas pensions supplied by pensioners, it is estimated that some 60,000 Social Security pensioners of United Kingdom origin were in receipt of overseas pensions at September 1980. The value of such overseas pensions was estimated to be in order of $50 million in a full year. Statistics for other years are not available.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) New Zealand pensions are not paid to persons residing permanently in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Discussions initiated in 1972 led to the conclusion of reciprocal agreements for portability of pensions with Malta, Italy, Turkey and Greece in that year. Although still extant those agreements became redundant, so far as payment of Australian pensions overseas is concerned, when general portability of pensions was introduced in 1973. Invitations to other countries to complete similar agreements were withdrawn early in 1973.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) The information is not available.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) Between 1972 and 1981, exploratory discussions were held with representatives of a number of countries on the possibility of entering into comprehensive bilateral reciprocal agreements. Since becoming Minister for Social Security, I have had discussions with the Ambassadors of Italy, Greece and Spain on the subject. In general, the outome of those discussions was that Australia would further examine its position in the matter. That examination is proceeding.</PARA>

<PARA> (11) Persons in receipt of Australian pensions overseas are subject to entitlement reviews similar to those carried out in respect of pensioners living in Australian. Failure to respond to the review results in payments being suspended until the case is investigated.</PARA>
<PARA> Additional control is provided by the issue of pension cheques to a nominated residential address, as the facility of direct credit to bank accounts overseas is not offered to pensioners and it is difficult to cash a cheque, in Europe for example, without acceptable identification. In addition, postal authorities normally do not deliver mail where doubt exists that the addressee resides at the address shown. Experience has shown that a great deal of information is provided by postal authority notations on returned cheques. In the Geneva office of my department, more than 50 per cent of initial death notifications are received in this manner.</PARA>
