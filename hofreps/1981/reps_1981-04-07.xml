<PARA> To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That continued use of animal ingredients in cosmetic products, and the inhumane use of animals in scientific research for cosmetic products is abhorrent and barbaric.</PARA>

<PARA> The Federal Liberal Party policy objective of selling Trans- Australia Airlines within 5 years is contrary to the national interest.</PARA>

<PARA> That your petitioners are gravely concerned at the prospect of any legislation regarding Plant Variety Rights.</PARA>
<PARA> The reasons are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. We believe it would transfer control, the key aspect of agriculture in this country, to overseas interests not responsible to the Australian Government.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. We believe it would restrict the growing and trading of many seeds.</PARA>

<PARA> That we protest at the many unwise decisions of our National Government which have resulted in discrimination against Australians in many ways.</PARA>
<PARA> That unwise immigration has introduced into Australia crimes characteristic of certain races and which through an environmental impact is influencing the behaviour of some young Australians.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Government act immediately on the advice of the people as expressed through many public opinion polls and bring to a halt the present huge intake of non Anglo-Saxon-Celtic people, thereby retaining some portion of the fast diminishing goodwill and public confidence in that Australians have not given the government any mandate to populate the country with people of alien stock.</PARA>
<PARA> That the government give practical effect to the views so earnestly espoused by the recent Immigration Minister Mr M. J. R.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. What is the Government's response to the recent escalation of fighting in Lebanon and in particular the heavy fighting going on in and around the cities of Beirut and Zahle with appalling losses of civilian life? Has the Government taken any action to convey its views to the parties concerned? Has the Government, through its representative to the United Nations, called for an immediate meeting of the United Nations Security Council to take action with respect to the seriously deteriorating situation in Lebanon? Does the Government support the replacement of all foreign peace-keeping armies with a legitimate United Nations peace force?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FS7">Mr STREET</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government shares the concern of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the Lebanese community at the recent outbreak of fighting in Lebanon, particularly around the cities of Beirut and Zahle. The fighting appears to have been the most serious to take place since about 1978. We call for an immediate ceasefire and urge that all parties to the conflict commit themselves to negotiations leading to national reconciliation. The Government accepts that an ultimate solution to the conflict in Lebanon depends on all factions in that country, as well as the Syrian and Israeli governments and the Palestinians, making all possible efforts to avoid violence and to achieve a solution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australia is limited in its capacity to influence events in Lebanon directly. Our primary link with that country has always been the large and long-established Australian Lebanese community. As I said a moment ago, we share the concern of members of the Lebanese community about the increasing violence in their homeland. Past Australian contributions to a betterment of the situation in Lebanon have been of a humanitarian nature. As honourable members will know, Australia has a very strong record in that respect. The Government, of course, will resume its humanitarian role if it becomes necessary. We are willing to work actively within the United Nations to assist in moves to resolve the problem in Lebanon, including the consideration of any proposal for a United Nations peace-keeping force.</PARA>

<PARA> Opposition members-Oh!</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WM7">Mr NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a very important subject about which all honourable members should be concerned. The police commissioners' meeting in Adelaide reviewed the present laws regulating the licensing, sale and ownership of firearms. This is basically a State responsibility although, of course, my colleague the Minister for the Capital Territory has responsibility in the Australian Capital Territory. The police commissioners were concerned about the lack of uniformity in the relevant State laws which would lead to weaknesses in the control of the licensing and ownership of firearms. They made particular reference to the availability of military-style weapons, such as automatic weapons and submachine guns, and pointed out that in recent times the police have actually seized such weapons from organised crime elements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whilst this is basically a State responsibility, the Government feels that in the wide national interest it has a real responsibility to ensure that the sort of problem that the police commissioners rightly pointed out does not exist in this nation. We do not want to go any way down the track to the situation which presently exists in the United States of America and which in recent days resulted in a most unfortunate incident. Therefore, we accept the responsibility of ensuring that there is a tighter control over the licensing, purchase and ownership of these sorts of weapons. My colleague the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs will be looking at the matter. He will try to find out exactly what is coming into the country and whether, from the Federal point of view, some customs regulations could be tightened up to ensure that those weapons cannot be imported. I will be raising the question of uniform approach to the licensing of firearms with my colleagues from the other States at the meeting of the police Ministers council which will be held on 29 May.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Prime Minister to yesterday's announcement about shelving the Rundle shale oil project in Queensland. I also refer the Prime Minister to his claim of 28 February last year in announcing the Esso, Central and Southern Pacific arrangements, that it was the Government's import parity oil pricing scheme which had created 'the circumstances in which this project is economically feasible'. The quote was made without caveat. On the basis of what advice did the Prime Minister make this claim? Does he now concede that the claim was false and that he and his Government, not the Esso consortium, are responsible for creating the false expectations about the viability of this project?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1345" SPEAKER="Fraser The Rt Hon J.M." NAMEID="QS4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="WANNON" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QS4">Mr MALCOLM FRASER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The statement made on 28 February last year indicated plainly on the second page 'if a pilot plant is successful'. Plainly, with a project as large and as substantial as this, the companies concerned need to make sure that they get their figures right. As the project could end up being two or three times the size of the North West Shelf project, it would not be surprising if some difficulties were to arise along the way. I think it is an unhappy fact, of which the Government had been aware for some little time, that there were difficulties in relation to the Rundle project. It is unfortunate if honourable members run from a state of optimism to one of extreme pessimism. The honourable gentleman in his question indicated-as have some of the media reports this morning-that in fact the Rundle project has been shelved. I believe it is too early to come to that conclusion. The Rundle partners and Esso itself would not be coming to that conclusion. Certainly there are many matters that need to be examined but the Rundle partners would still be hoping very much that a modified project in fact would succeed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I can add very little to the statement which was made yesterday in relation to these matters. Obviously, it is a matter of significant importance but also it is worth noting that what was said about oil parity pricing remains true. If it had not been for that the project would have had no chance of initial examination. The continuing examination to which the project is being put clearly would be put aside until other policies prevail. It is oil parity pricing which underpins the totality of the Government's approach to energy and which, at the same time, has encouraged much greater exploration and development for fuel oils and for natural gas than was the case a few years ago. That greater exploration and development which is now under way and which is forecast over the next 12 months is encouraging indeed to those who want to see Australia's reserves expanded in the years ahead.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was concerned to see the report of the Auditor-General. I have asked the Public Service Board to give me a report on its examination of that aspect of the Auditor-General's report and to let me have the Board's views in relation to it. In administering the policy of staff ceilings the Government has always insisted that, for example, over the counter services to the public ought to be maintained and ought not to be prejudiced. That has been part of the general business of setting guidelines for staff ceilings. In addition to that, on more than one occasion, for example, the Taxation Office has had substantial increases in staff ceilings so that it may pursue its efforts to curtail and prevent tax avoidance more vigorously than would otherwise be the case. We have had a very real concern to make sure that the true functions of departments are maintained and pursued in a proper and efficient way within the staff ceilings set by the Commonwealth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What the policy of staff ceilings does on a continuing basis, and what I believe it ought to do, is to make sure that permanent heads and those in charge of various statutory bodies cast a constant and rigid eye over their priorities so that they can make sure that the priorities of government are met in the fullest possible way. Clearly there needs to be the capacity to react to changed circumstances in terms of redeployment of staff from one function to another. I repeat that I was concerned to see the Auditor-General's report. If the guidelines which have been established in recent times had been pursued as clearly as I would have wanted I do not believe that that report could have been made with accuracy. I will get a report from the Public Service Board and examine the matter.</PARA>

I ask the Prime Minister: Why did he say on the program AM on 20 August last year: 'The pilot plant is going ahead'? He did not say 'if it is successful' but that it was going ahead at a cost of some hundreds of millions of dollars and that the Government's objective was to have oil from Rundle coming onstream at about the time Bass Strait oil production started to run down. In the light of yesterday's announcement about the Rundle project and given the Government's failure to produce a comprehensive energy policy, from where does the Prime Minister envisage Australia's liquid fuel supplies coming after the late 1980s? What action will the Government take to provide for Australia's energy independence?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whatever was said on account of the Government at the time was said on the basis of advice from the companies concerned, and be that as it may. The honourable gentleman also asked what the Government is going to do about the future of energy policy. He has been trying to suggest that, as a result of a difficulty-albeit a significant difficulty-in relation to Rundle, the Government needs to reassess the totality of its energy policies, but I suggest that the honourable gentleman has no evidence to sustain that claim. For example, it is estimated by the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association that this year there will be a record expenditure of $400m on oil exploration. The figure for 1980 was $286m, but under the policies of the Labor Administration in 1975 it was only $65m. In addition, it is expected that in 1982 some 202 exploratory wells will be drilled, compared with 137 in 1981 and 25 in 1975, indicating quite plainly that under the policies of the Labor Administration these matters were not proceeding at all. Indeed, under the policies of this Government I am advised that expenditure on exploration and development will reach $1,400m in 1981-$430m on-shore and $970m off-shore. For 1975 the expenditure was $150m. Quite plainly, that indicates how the policies of the Labor Government had stifled exploration and development in Australia and how our policies are getting this important activity moving ahead in a very real way.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FS7">Mr STREET</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Petrie for his question because it involves what has become a painful dilemma for the Australian Government and the Australian people. I have seen the calls which have been made for firm action. I accept that they reflect a view on the part of editors that the staging of the Commonwealth Games is an honour for Australia and an exciting event which no one wants to see spoiled by the absence of significant groups of Commonwealth competitors. I believe that, in expressing these views, the Press is correctly reflecting the thinking of large numbers of Australians, particularly Australian sportsmen and sportswomen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The problem confronting the Government is complex. New Zealand is our closest neighbour in every sense of the word. The degree of mutual respect and friendship between the two Governments and the two peoples imposes on each side obligations of forebearance and understanding. From time to time, each side has to make its views known plainly to the other. I am sure honourable members will appreciate that, in such a close relationship, there is no room for any suspicion whatever that Australia is interfering in New Zealand's domestic affairs or telling New Zealanders what to do. If I say that the Government wants to observe the proprieties of the relationship, I do not mean that remark to detract in any way from the seriousness of our concern because a clear Australian interest is at stake here. Our views are being clearly stated to the New Zealand Government.</PARA>
<PARA> I draw to the attention of the House that essentially the dispute is not one between the Australian Government and the New Zealand Government. The real dispute is between the organisers and supporters of one sport in New Zealand and the other sporting groups which seek to sustain New Zealand's full and active participation in international sport. Supporting that latter group of New Zealanders are the New Zealand Government, I am sure a large segment of the New Zealand public, and our African partners in the Commonwealth. There are dilemmas. There is no perfect solution. I believe the issue can be resolved because there are encouraging signs that the magnitude of the price to be paid for the Springbok tour is coming to be appreciated by the responsible sporting authorities in New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA> As I am advised, the newly elected chairman of the New Zealand Commonwealth Games Association has said publicly that New Zealand may have to keep its athletes away from the Games because, if the Springbok tour takes place, their presence seems likely to wreck the Games. That would be very regrettable indeed. Honourable members will note that the New Zealand chairman's remarks exemplify a growing recognition in New Zealand that, as matters now stand and unless New Zealand ultimately takes some sort of initiative of that kind, Australia and Australian sportsmen and sportswomen, as well as those of other Commonwealth countries, will have to pay a very heavy price for the Springbok tour of New Zealand. I can assure honourable members that the Government will keep this matter under the closest possible review and will do all in its power to ensure that the Brisbane Commonwealth Games are a success. The visit by the president of the Supreme Council for Sport in Africa, Mr Ordia, has been successful in drawing attention to the issues at stake. I would also like to add--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BU4">Mr ANTHONY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Minister representing the Minister for National Development and Energy, I would like to answer that question. Not only has the Minister for National Development and Energy made some comments about the Rundle project but also I have made some comments about it. I have had the advantage of visiting the site of the Rundle project. Having visited the Rundle project, I have pointed out that it is a massive project which will need an enormous amount of study, that it has great complexities and that it will have problems before the massive amounts of money required for the development to take place are available. The Australian Labor Party seems to take a great joy in the fact that the Esso organisation is asking for a reassessment of the agreement that it has entered into. It is not shelving the project; it is looking more closely at the sort of plant that will be built in the initial stages.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The heads of agreement entered into between the two companies was for a demonstration plant to be put in. Having investigated the site over the past 12 months and spent $30m doing so, Esso now wants to make some alterations to that agreement. Why should it not do so, having spent that amount of money on a project which will run into billions of dollars? Why is there great joy in the fact that there has to be some alteration? Surely there is pride amongst all Australians that here we have a resource that could provide us with alternative forms of energy when our own resources tend to become depleted. That is what this is all about. I have no doubt at all that, sooner or later, this project will be developed, as will the Condor and Julia Creek projects and other projects in Queensland. Why not allow these companies to look at the question more closely so that an agreement can be entered into which will be sound and practical? Perhaps the Labor Party really does not want money to be spent on these projects. Is that what it is looking to or is it merely trying to find some embarrassment in a few words that have been spoken? I really do not think it is worth even debating in this House.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0N7">Mr NIXON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The decisions taken by the EEC Council of Ministers to increase agricultural subsidies by $1,000m in the ensuing year are very serious for agriculture not only in this country but also in other countries. At a recent meeting I attended in Bangladesh, a number of Third World agricultural producers also expressed concern at the activities of the EEC in overproducing agricultural products and dumping their agricultural products on third markets around the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact is that the decision taken by the Council of Ministers amounts to an 11 per cent or 12 per cent increase in the agricultural budget of the EEC. This will lift the total amount of support of some $13 billion by another $1 billion. This does not augur well for efficient agricultural producers, such as Australia, New Zealand, Canada or the United States. Each of those countries, in its own way, will be making its views on this matter known to the EEC. The most glaring example of the policies of the EEC is the way in which sugar has been dumped, for example, on the New Guinea market which is the nearest country to the most efficient sugar industry in the world which is in Queensland. That demonstrates an example to the world of the damaging policies that the EEC is following on agricultural products. I am sure that both the Prime Minister and my colleague the Minister for Trade and Resources will keep up the level of representation that they have been making to the EEC councils on this matter, either individually or collectively, in an effort to get them to change their views. Obviously, because of that decision, other countries, with Australia, have a long fight ahead of them.</PARA>

Some 40 per cent of total export income is earned by the farming industries. Those who are promoting the 35-hour week ought to recognise that the money that the farmers earn is used in the main to purchase products produced in the factories of this country. The turn-round in the rural industries has done more to lift this economy than perhaps anything else. Those who are promoting the 35-hour working week ought not to forget it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Regarding the latter part of the honourable member's question, we have intervened in a number of cases on preference and I envisage that we will continue to do so. In answering the major thrust of his question, I understand that, since its inception, the dry cleaning and dyeing industry award has made provision for a form of preference in employment to be given to members of the Clothing and Allied Trades Union. In July 1980 Commissioner Sweeney varied the award by deleting the existing preference clause and substituting a more complex form of preference. An appeal to the Full Bench of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission was launched against this decision and it was heard last December. The Commonwealth and the National Employers Industrial Council intervened. The Commission handed down its decision on the appeal last February and, whilst it allowed the appeal, thereby quashing the preference clause awarded by Commissioner Sweeney, the Full Bench substituted a modified preference clause basically following the provision awarded by another appeal Bench in September of last year in the Uniroyal preference case. The provisions of the clause awarded by the Full Bench are clearly much more practicable for employers in the dry cleaning and dyeing industry than those previously awarded by Commissioner Sweeney. Nevertheless, it is a matter of some concern I can well understand the shackling that occurs in this way. The Commonwealth has submitted that the Commission should take account, of course, in hearings of this nature of the rights and interests of individual employees and employers in the industry. I should add finally that the Commonwealth believes that every employee has the right to join a union if he or she so wishes and decides. It is, however, the Commonwealth's firm submission that no improper force or pressure should be brought to bear upon an employee, whether the decision is to join an organisation or to refrain from joining it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BU4">Mr ANTHONY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;An arrangement with the European Economic Community binds the tariff that it can impose on imports of certain Australian canned fruit. However, last year or late in 1979 the European Economic Community introduced a production bounty for the producers of canned fruit, especially canned pears to which the honourable member referred. A bounty, of course, has much the same effect of protecting an industry as does a tariff. We have made complaints to the Commission about this action. We believe that the effects of the bounty on canned pears will be similar to the effects of bounties on other agricultural products in the EEC which have encouraged an increased production and have produced a surplus. This means that not only do we find it difficult to enter the market but also we suffer the consequences of surpluses being exported to third markets.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The GATT situation is a complex one. It is not identical to that of sugar when the complaint was that the EEC was dumping surpluses on the export market. At the moment it is our concern that the EEC is increasing its production of canned pears and decreasing the quantities that we are able to sell on that market. However, we are continuing to make representations and to protest. Certainly we will take the matter before GATT to protest against the introduction of new measures of assistance to EEC industries, making it difficult for us to sell.</PARA>

I should say to the honourable member that I have made suggestions to the Government of New South Wales as to what additional assistance could be given to people in rural areas. It took me a long time to get New South Wales up to the mark in respect of the individual assistance of $20,000 which has been given for a long time in Queensland and other States.

The Government of New South Wales has not taken up that suggestion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All in all, I can only say that the Government of New South Wales has been parsimonious in its approach to individual assistance.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Honourable members will recall that on 30 March 1976 the then Minister for Primary Industry gazetted a notice under the Fisheries Act, 1952 concerning the taking of southern bluefin tuna in certain waters off New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia by the pole and live bait method of fishing. The effect of this notice was to freeze the number which had fished there in the 1974-75 season-about 70 vessels. The freeze was intended as a temporary measure to allow an assessment of the situation in the fishery, and to stabilise investment, following two bad seasons when catches were poor and prices low. The industry felt recovery would be helped by controlling the number of vessels entering the fishery. The freeze was reviewed in 1977 and again in 1978, by which time studies had been completed and better fishing seasons experienced. In 1979 the Australian Fisheries Council recommended to me that the freeze be lifted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I met with industry representatives in January last year. They drew my attention to the interaction which had developed between the tuna and south-eastern trawl fisheries-many fishermen operating their vessels in both fisheries. Largely because of this I deferred lifting the tuna freeze, announcing that it would be lifted on 31 March 1981, and that in the meantime my Department would update the earlier economic survey to see if there was a need for any continuing management regime. The Australian Fisheries Council met again in September 1980 and reaffirmed its earlier recommendation that the freeze be lifted. The economic study has been completed and does not provide any basis for concluding that the freeze should continue, or that management of the tuna fishery per se is necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently there have been a number of meetings within the industry, between industry representatives and State departments, my Department and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. I have also met with the Federal president of the Australian Fishing Industry Council and had extensive discussions with him. I think it fair to say the industry is divided, both within the processing and fishing sectors, as to the need for the freeze and its effectiveness. After considering the advice of the industry, my own Department, and the CSIRO, I am satisfied that the freeze has been ineffective in achieving its objective of stabilising investment in the fishery. I therefore believe the Australian Fisheries Council recommendation to lift the freeze was well based. Furthermore, I am concerned about Australians being prevented from fishing for southern bluefin when we have an agreement enabling Japanese fishermen to do so. Another point is the need for Australians to expand their fishing activities to take other species of tuna, such as skipjack. It seems to me that this will not be facilitated by retention of the freeze. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not expect there to be any significant increase in the number of new vessels in the fishery. New entrants, if any, will not be able to establish access rights under any future management regime on the same basis as fishermen who have operated in the fishery to date. Accordingly fishermen planning to enter the fishery should not base their expectations of profitability on taking southern bluefin tuna. I have concluded that I should endorse the Australian Fisheries Council's recommendation and lift the freeze, and the necessary fisheries notice will be gazetted forthwith. However I will require the South Eastern Fisheries Committee to immediately undertake a study of the tuna and trawl fisheries recommended in my Department's economic study and require it to report its conclusions to the Australian Fisheries Council in September. In the meantime operations in the tuna fishery will be kept under review by my Department to ensure that I am immediately informed if a situation develops which requires more urgent attention, and I have sought, and confidently expect to obtain, the immediate co-operation of my State colleagues in implementing any action necessary. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I have not really had the time to check out all the implications of this statement or the view of the industry; that is, the fishermen. At first reading this is a very poorly thought through document. It uses a survey which did not come to any firm conclusions as a justification for certain actions which the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) has announced. The only interpretation of the statement that I can make is that it is allowing the entry of the multinational firm Heinz into the southern bluefin tuna fishery. The Minister's statement backs up the industry's worries; an industry which the Minister has admitted in his statement is divided. Honourable members are aware that at present protection in the industry takes the form of a freeze on new entrants. The Government will reduce protection by lifting the freeze but the main beneficiary will be Heinz. That word does not appear anywhere in the statement but anyone who is aware of debate within the industry would know that this is the concern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There do not seem to be any economic reasons to which the Government is reacting. In January 1980 the Government said that after an economic survey of the tuna industry, it would consider lifting the freeze. The survey said little either way, economically. The local industry-the canners-sides with the fishermen. The Government has not really consulted the fishermen. I am sure that the Australian Fishing Industry Council will not be pleased by this statement, which ends the freeze, creates a vacuum and argues by way of contradiction. Recently the manager of Safcol said:</PARA>
<PARA> And all this nonsense about lifting the freeze has been to a great extent a cloak and dagger business that is completely unnecessary. The Federal Government should bring it out into the open. </PARA>
<PARA>Safcol and Port Lincoln Tuna Processing have withdrawn from the Australian Fish Canners Association. That means that two out of its five members, representing three-quarters of the Australian catch, have withdrawn. The Minister's statement has said nothing about the fact that planning for any expansion in an industry such as the tuna industry should be based on reliable knowledge of profitability limits and its influence upon the state of exploitable biological resources. Knowledge of profitability is very important because we have here a fishery that overlaps the Japanese industry. We do not know what the relevant figures are. There is no word in the statement about further studies that need to be undertaken to investigate potential implications before any major expansion takes place. </PARA>
<PARA> I propose now to consider the statement piece by piece. The first paragraph deals with the pole and live bait method of fishing for southern bluefin tuna. No mention is made of purse-seining, which is of major concern to the industry. At a later point, the statement refers to the Australian Fisheries Council recommending that the freeze be lifted. It does not say on what basis that is proposed. In the next paragraph the statement says that the Minister met with industry representatives. Who were they and of which industry does he speak? Is he referring to the canners, the fishermen or the Australian Fishing Industry Council? Quite a range of organisations is involved. At the bottom of page 1, the Minister states that the Department would update the earlier economic survey 'to see if there was a need for any continuing management regime'. I wish that the Minister had been more explicit because the very bone of contention now in the industry in terms of the future, is whether there will be a management regime. I will refer to that again in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA> On page 2 of the statement, in the second paragraph, the Minister says:</PARA>
<PARA> The economic study has been completed and does not provide any basis for concluding the freeze should continue, or that management of the tuna fishery per se is necessary. </PARA>
<PARA>That is right, but neither does the survey say that the freeze should end. AFIC, the fishing industry and the fishermen would say that management of the resource is necessary. In the next paragraph of the statement the Minister says that he has spoken to Mr Connell, the Federal President of the Australian Fishing Industry Council and has had extensive discussions with him. What is the view of AFIC? The Minister has not told us. In the next paragraph he says that he is satisfied that the freeze has been ineffective in achieving its objective of stabilising investment in the industry. Of course that is so, but surely that was not the main objective. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last paragraph on page 2, the Minister states that he is concerned about Australians being prevented from fishing for southern bluefin when we have an agreement enabling Japanese fishermen to do so. What this really means is that it will let in the American firm, Heinz. </PARA>
<PARA> On the next page of the statement the Minister tends to contradict himself. He indicates that he does not think that there will be any significant increase in the number of vessels engaged in the fishery. That backs up my argument, that mainly this statement is directed at allowing Heinz into the industry. The survey did not say anything one way or the other; so the Minister can certainly argue that there will not be a significant increase. The Minister says also that the fishermen should not base their expectation of profitability on the survey. Again this is true, but the survey does not really give us any ammunition to argue one way or the other. It did not come up with any strong recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> In the concluding part of the statement, the Minister says that he would require the South Eastern Fisheries Committee to undertake another study. Of course, this Committee is already on record as saying, 'No freeze', so I do not know where we are getting. The whole statement really amounts to a justification for opening up the industry to Heinz. It is quite true, as the Minister says, that not a lot of profitability is involved; that not a lot of new participants will be coming into the industry. I believe that only Heinz will do so. </PARA>
<PARA> The very important question that has to be answered by the Minister relates to whether there is to be a management regime. For example, does the Government intend to allow the industry three months to come up with some plan for a management regime, that is, a freeze for a further three months? The questions that should be asked relate to the profitability of the resource, the biology of the resource and the management of the resource. As it is, this statement only amounts to a rationale for allowing more entrants into an industry. It does not address itself to the problems inherent within the industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The 185th report is the Department of Finance minute on the Committee's 176th report on the Auditor-General's report for 1977-78. The Committee is satisfied with the explanations provided by the Department of Finance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The 186th report concerns our inquiry into the Advance to the Minister for Finance for 1979-80. The Committee obtained explanations from departments and authorities in relation to 128 items of expenditure from the Advance. Public inquiries were held into four departments. I am pleased to be able to inform the House that we are satisfied that in most cases the use of the Advance in 1979-80 was justified. </PARA>
<PARA> The 187th report relates to inquiry by the Committee into the criticisms made by the Auditor-General in his reports for 1978-79. It has been a long standing practice for this Committee to select items from these reports and inquire into some of the issues raised. In our 187th report we have made recommendations on some administrative and financial aspects of the departments of Defence, Primary Industry and Social Security. </PARA>
<PARA> The inquiry into the Department of Defence arose out of comments by the Auditor-General in 1977-78 and again in 1978-79 relating to the practice within the Royal Australian Air Force of removing serviceable components from aircraft to remedy defects in other aircraft. Investigations by the Committee revealed that this practice, although in itself wasteful of limited resources, is a symptom of wider problems of the RAAF maintenance supply system. We discovered that as a result of delays in bringing an up to date computerised supply system into operation in the RAAF and the decision in 1973 to abolish buffer stocks or supply margins of aircraft spares, the RAAF supply system has become too finely tuned to provide the necessary logistics support to the RAAF within reasonable time constraints. Therefore, we made a number of recommendations aimed at the more timely provision of spare parts, including a 'Once off' expenditure of around $20m, to re-establish the spares supply margin and the development of a more accurate mechanism for assessing future spare parts requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee also noted related aspects of the availability of skilled manpower in the RAAF and local industry participation in aircraft maintenance. We discovered that the RAAF is experiencing considerable difficulty in retaining adequate numbers of skilled tradesmen and engineers. Accordingly, we are presenting a number of recommendations aimed at improved efficiencies in this area. These include better margins for skills, increased re-enlistment bonuses and overseas recruitment. </PARA>
<PARA> The inquiry into the Department of Primary Industry concerned the Auditor-General's criticisms of the procedures relating to the management and disposal of forfeited foreign fishing vessels. During this inquiry the Committee became aware that the realisable value of many of the forfeited vessels and catches was low, whereas the cost of storage and maintenance prior to disposal was high. Additionally, local harbour authorities were concerned that the prolonged storage of apprehended vessels posed considerable inconvenience and danger to harbour operations, and that the often considerable delays between apprehension and disposal led to increased costs. In addition, we believe that there had been considerable ecological and environmental effects as a result of illegal fishing, particularly with the taking of clams. Confiscated catches of clam meat individually have amounted to several tonnes with one particular catch being in excess of 11 tonnes which would represent the destruction of over 22,000 clams. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee is satisfied that the Department's new manual of procedures will overcome many of the Auditor-General's criticisms and should result in greater decision-making at the local level, considerably reducing the delays and costs associated with the disposal of these vessels. A vessel ordered to be forfeited in January this year is currently being destroyed in Cairns in accordance with the new procedures. It is estimated that considerable savings have been achieved as a result. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee also inquired into deficiencies mentioned by the Auditor-General in the procedures for payment and review of pensions and benefits overseas. Since May 1973 persons leaving Australia, either permanently or temporarily, have been entitled to receive their Australian pensions and benefits under substantially the same conditions as if they were residing in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a rapid expansion in recent years in the number and value of these payments and the Committee was concerned that the deficiencies mentioned by the Auditor-General may have led to significant payments in excess of entitlement. Accordingly, the Committee ex- amined the procedures for payment and review of pensions and other benefits, reciprocal payment arrangements with other governments, staffing of overseas offices and the internal audit procedures applying to overseas payment functions. Whilst the Committee has noted the actions taken by the Department of Social Security to strengthen its procedures following the Auditor-General's report, it is concerned that this action was not taken earlier as the growth in overseas payments has markedly increased the scope for improper or excess payments. Savings of nearly $700,000 were achieved by a special review conducted by the Geneva office over the 12 months to March 1980. This clearly demonstrates the need for regular investigations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has also made a number of recommendations aimed at achieving greater efficiency and economy in this field. We have recommended that most payments to pensioners overseas should be made by the Central Office of the Department of Social Security. Centralisation of control will facilitate eligibility checks. In addition, the Committee believes that, in order to minimise the number of overseas payments, pensioners on short term visits should be actively discouraged from using the overseas payment system and instead should have their payments made into bank accounts for transfer overseas using normal banking facilities. We also recommended that the Department pursue the possibility of extending reciprocal arrangements, similar to those with Britain and New Zealand, under which administrative functions and controls over pension payments would be exercised by the authorities in the countries where payments are being made. In some cases conditions are such that it would be appropriate also for additional officers to be posted to those posts, especially in southern Europe, where a significant number of pensioners reside. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-In support of the remarks made by the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) as Chairman of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, I would like to deal particularly with chapter 1 of the 187th report, which deals with the question of repair and overhaul of aircraft which is under the responsibility of the Department of Defence. The Committee has made a series of useful recommendations on overcoming shortcomings in the Royal Australian Air Force's logistics supply system. The Committee noted that there had been unnecessary delay in installing improved computer-based logistics management systems. The Committee has been concerned for some time with effective data processing associated with management in all departments. We noted in the case of the Defence Department that relevant systems were 10 to 15 years old and were fully used. Consequently, it has not been possible to improve the RAAF's inventory management techniques, over the past four or five years. From time to time, problems are encountered in the production of reviews of stockholdings. We noted that some efforts were being made to install systems to overcome this and we want the process hurried up. In looking into this aspect we are taking up issues that we have been interested in for some time. However, public interest in this question has been focussed not on management problems but on so-called cannibalisation of some aircraft to keep other aircraft flying and the availability of skilled manpower to service them. We were rather cautious about the use of the term 'cannibalisation'. The meaning of that term envisages the disappearance of the aircraft cannibalised. We found that, strictly speaking, this situation was not occurring. We noticed, however, that there was delay in getting in spare parts to restore the aircraft on which the process of cannibalisation might be said to have commenced. We recommended, therefore, that the Department should re-introduce a six month's buffer stock system to supply a margin of spares. We noted that the current situation means that only 50 per cent of the F111 aircraft and 60 per cent of the Mirage aircraft were available for missions at any time. In the case of the F111 aircraft, this is better than the United States Air Force figure of 40 per cent. However, we operate from a very much lower base and have no alternative strike aircraft available. In the case of the Mirage aircraft, the Committee's report suggests a figure of operational aircraft probably somewhat lower than the 84 suggested by the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) in his statement the week before last. We believe the record could be improved by improvements in buffer stocks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee was also concerned about the retention rates among skilled categories of Air Force technicians. At the moment, re-engagement is only about 50 per cent to 60 per cent of trained personnel. Clearly, salary rates are inadequate to compete with non-service salary possibilities. The current practice of leave in lieu of overtime is not dealing with the problem. This is a useful report in an important area of our defence effort. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the quorum was formed there was hardly a Government supporter in the House, yet we have heard for so long about the great Rundle project. Indeed, it was the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) who announced the arrangements between the Esso organisation and the Central Pacific and Southern Pacific companies-not the companies. No announcement was made by the two companies about what they intended to do in evaluating a deposit. No, the Prime Minister had to push his frame in and announce to the world that all this was going to happen under the auspices of the Fraser Government. On 28 February he stated that the project was to go ahead. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The policies of the Commonwealth have been of fundamental importance in creating the circumstances in which this project is economically feasible. </PARA>
<PARA>No caveats just the word 'is'--</PARA>
<PARA>The viability of the project is underpinned by the Commonwealth's policy on import parity pricing for crude oil. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The project would not have been able to proceed without the Commonwealth's import parity pricing. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, he was trying to take the credit for a project in fulfilment of the cargo cult mentality that we have to have big solutions for everything, not the fact that two companies were just investigating a deposit-an important deposit, no doubt-which is a reasonable thing for an energy company like Esso and the companies which held the deposits, that is, the Central Pacific and South Pacific companies, to have done. No, the Government had to rush in with its mouth open. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for National Development and Energy (Senator Carrick) said that the Rundle project is a classic example of how the Government's policies are succeeding. We have been told and told that Rundle is the basis for the Government's import parity pricing policy, that we need a high priced policy for substitution and synthetic crudes, that Rundle was the first of a long line of synthetic projects. We did not hear a statement from Senator Carrick, the Minister for National Development and Energy, in the last year which did not refer to Rundle in some way. Rundle has been the linchpin of the Government's policy. We were laboured with it throughout the election campaign last year. What do we find now? We find that there was no economic justification for the Prime Minister's statements. These statements were made by the Head of Government, not by some company. When the Head of Government, the Prime Minister, lends his name to such statements it is no wonder the investing public of Australia start to buy Central and Southern Pacific shares and involve themselves in the Rundle project. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not see any decent Government energy policy about utilising natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, electricity, coal or the other energy benefits and assets that we have. The development of a comprehensive energy approach, a national energy policy, together with the States is too hard; it is too mundane. The Government wants the big symbolic approach-the easy solutions, the big projects, the cargo cult. Appearances rather than results motivate the Fraser Government. Other countries have looked at a decent energy policy. Australia should use the fuels which it has in abundance. The fact is that Australia is a gas-prone continent. We are exporting 1 1/2 million tonnes of LPG. We have very large reserves of high grade coal. We can have cheap electricity, but the Government has no national policy for electricity or power generation. It has no natural gas policy and no policy on liquefied petroleum gas, other than a patchwork scheme which is changed every couple of months. It has no national energy policy. It just relies on big projects. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has the same disease which afflicts Sir Charles Court and Mr Bjelke-Petersen. They consider that if they can announce a big project and try to claim the credit for it they can let the economics worry about themselves later. That is what we have seen with Rundle. The Government is trying to talk up how it is developing Australia and saying that it is responsible for the boom in exports. The Government says that the people should not trust the Australian Labor Party because it is supposed to be against exports. The Government says that it can be trusted because it gets everything done. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not the Government that gets everything done. On the basis of what we have seen today, the Government is incompetent. Not only is the Government incompetent but also it has cost Australian investors a lot of money. The shares involved were at the $60 mark; they are now down to less than $10. Which people does the Government think have lost their money? Ordinary Australians have lost their money. Why? They have lost their money on the say-so of the Australian Government. They have lost their money not on the say-so of Esso or Central and Southern Pacific but on the say-so of the Australian Prime Minister. The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony), who is sitting opposite me at the table, wants to mine everything. He adopts a policy of letting anyone have uranium. He does not care who they are. He will let anyone have iron ore. It does not matter if the market is swamped with uranium. He wants to see uranium mined and projects started. He considers that the more projects the merrier. As soon as someone says, 'Hang on, there will not be a market for that, there may not be a price for that, we may flood the market, we cannot develop that in time, the economics are no good', the Government says that those people are prophets of doom and gloom and are against development. The Government tells those people that they should vote for it because it will give them prosperity. The truth is that the Government is incompetent and cannot be trusted with Australia's resources. The Government has led the Australian public into believing in a false situation. The important thing is that the Prime Minister said, as part of the Government's energy policy, that 250,000 barrels of oil would come from Rundle in the early 1990s when Bass Strait production runs down. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask again, as I did at Question Time: Where is the oil coming from to replace the 250,000 barrels which is equivalent to half the production of Bass Strait? If the Government were relying upon Rundle for oil at that time, where will the oil now come from when the Rundle time frame development is put further and further back? When we asked the Prime Minister where the oil was coming from he talked about exploration. Not one Commonwealth dollar has gone towards exploration in the last four or five years. This year the Commonwealth will collect $3.5 billion from the crude oil levy, from the petrol tax-the pump tax. Everyone is socked through their pay packet by paying high prices for petrol. Not one dollar of Commonwealth money has gone to the oil exploration industry. Ministers have told the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association conference how everything is going well. But the Government has done nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Prime Minister was questioned today about the replacement for the oil to be produced at Rundle and asked where the 250,000 barrels a day will come from in the 1990s, a time when the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries is unlikely to be supplying us with oil, he talked about exploration. What humbug! The Government has never had an energy policy. It would not know how to construct one. The Deputy Prime Minister, who is the gigolo for any foreign interest which wants to come to this country, has no semblance whatsoever of the national interest and runs around the country giving crazy forecasts. I ask honourable members to look at the headline I have in my hand. It reads: 'Bonanza in shale oil. Enough for 12,000 years, says Anthony'. The article reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The Acting Prime Minister, Mr Anthony, estimated Australia had enough shale oil for 12,000 years. Speaking yesterday after visiting the Rundle shale oil deposit near Gladstone, Mr Anthony disclosed that the deposit could contain up to 5,000 million barrels. </PARA>
<PARA>Yesterday Esso told us that, after spending $30m, there is only 2,500 million barrels. The Deputy Prime Minister says that there are 5,000 million barrels of oil and that that is enough for 12,000 years. That demonstrates the sort of nonsense we have heard from the Government about shale oil. We could go over and over what has been said. Let us look at some of Senator Carrick's lalapaloozas. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The company--</PARA>
<PARA>that is Esso-</PARA>
<PARA>has given clearly to the public an undertaking of a multibillion dollar investment in this project. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for National Development and Energy has advised the Australian public that the company has given a multibillion dollar commitment. The company has made no such commitment ever. This shows the kind of misleading statements which come from Government Ministers. Let us look at another statement of Senator Carrick. On Monday Senator Carrick said:</PARA>
<PARA> The fact that EXXON, the world's biggest oil company, and its Australian partners were investing in Rundle was adequate evidence that the project would be successful. </PARA>
<PARA>He said that it would fill the gap. In other words the mere presence of Esso near this development guaranteed its commercial viability. That has been proved to be nonsense. If Ministers in any other country lent themselves to statements like these they would be called upon to resign. There is no integrity in this Government. When the Budget of the Treasurer (Mr Howard) was leaked it was said that it was someone else's responsibility and not his. If statements are made which are misleading it is said that it is someone else's responsibility. When we look at ministerial accountability and responsibility we see that this Government is culpable. Not one Minister will ever resign if he or she misleads the public. There is no morality in this Government. Ministers of the Government will do what they must to try to talk up their sagging political stocks. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Carrick, the Minister for National Development and Energy, has committed a number of other atrocities. The National Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Council's report No. 12 concerning alternative liquid fuels talked about producing shale oil. It said that the prospects were moderate and that production would take eight to 10 years. When Senator Carrick made a speech a day or so after the presentation of that report he changed the time of eight to 10 years to 15 years and then classified the prospects as good. That shows manipulation by Senator Carrick of one of the Government's advisory bodies. No matter where we look we see no energy policy for Australia. Just a week ago we saw a report which stated that the Japan National Oil Co. was looking at the Condor shale oil deposit. No doubt the Deputy Prime Minister will go through his jingoism with the Japanese and tell them when the project will be developed. We will hear about that project as the next election looms. There are so many brown coal projects on the drawing boards in Victoria that, if Australia were prepared to let it happen, half of Gippsland could be dug up. Nobody knows about the technologies involved or whether the projects are economic. </PARA>
<PARA> We are absolutely at the frontier of energy technology with synthetic crudes. Australia does not have to be in that position. Australia is well endowed with energy. It has reasonable prospects for further oil discoveries. We have gas everywhere. The only reason it is not being pulled out is that the Government does not have a decent national natural gas policy. We have coal and electricity. We are very well endowed. We do not have to commit ourselves to the frontiers of liquid fuel technology. What would happen if these projects were set up at a certain price per barrel within the parameters of present OPEC prices and OPEC reduced the price? What would happen to all these synthetic industries starting in the United States, West Germany, South America in Brazil, and Australia if there was real competition for OPEC and OPEC responded, like any other group of producers, with competition. As the Fraser Government does not have the sense, the presence of mind or the competence to develop a national energy policy, what would happen with these white elephants sitting around the landscape of Australia, these massive investments with this dubious technology? The Australian public would have to pick up the bill. Soon we would be hearing about a new absorption scheme to take up the expensive crude. Who would pay for the expensive crude? It would be the Australian public. There is no forethought, there is no evaluation and there is no planning. </PARA>
<PARA> I would have thought the Prime Minister's statements about how this project would be economically viable would have been based on advice from his bureaucracy, from the Department of National Development and Energy. It was not based on that at all. He tells us today that it was based on information from Esso and from the companies. The companies said only that they were moving into an evaluation of a shale oil deposit-nothing more and nothing less. Instead of that, we get these bullish statements. We see a whole change in the speculative nature of the Australian stock exchanges. Rundle is the Poseidon of the 1980s. It has been built on Government statements, not corporate statements, and now it has collapsed. It is said that the pilot plant will be left out and will be continued to a completion stage. That is nonsense, and the Deputy Prime Minister knows it. If the companies do not build a pilot plant, they will not go on under the present arrangements. Have honourable members seen the price of a pilot plant? It will cost $2,000m to produce 20,000 barrels of oil a day. The cost has escalated from $700m to $2,000m. The Esso company in its statement yesterday said that the project cost had increased by a factor of three. What does that make the project worth-$30 billion? Who would say that Rundle would be economic at a cost of $30 billion? One million tonnes of earth have to be moved each day at Rundle. That is over twice the amount involved in the mining operations of the five iron ore mines in Australia combined, and it is all on the one site. A million tonnes has to be retorted every day. The retorts would be 17 storeys high and there would be 49 of them in a row. Can anyone imagine a mining operation of that scale?</PARA>
<PARA> To predict now that it will be economic at current oil prices is a gross distortion and the Prime Minister deserves the censure of the House and the nation for lending his name and that of his Government to a feasibility study which had the public believing it was a final evaluation. It is a gross distortion and a disgrace. But, what is more disgraceful is that the Government has no energy policy. The Prime Minister admitted that today at Question Time. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Government needs to reassess the totality of its energy policies . . . </PARA>
<PARA>After five years in government, the Prime Minister said that today at Question Time. The Government will need to reassess the totality of its energy policy because it has all been built around pie-in-the-sky synthetic fuels. It is a disgrace and the Government deserves the censure of the country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suppose it is understandable that every time the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) gets up to speak he becomes quite hysterical if the matter deals with mining and energy problems. Having been one of the shortest lived Ministers in Australian history, I suppose he has reason to get all excited. Certainly he does get into a frenzy, but he has reason to do that. Honourable members might ask: Why is that? It is because the policies of the Australian Labor Party were utter and complete failures. The Opposition cannot deny that. One of the reasons for the rejection of the Opposition in 1975 was that the economy became stagnant as no development was taking place. Members of the Opposition have to live with that. What a terrible legacy it is. The honourable member also gets rather upset because of his policies at the last election. He tried to deceive the Australian people with his energy policies but they did not make any impact at all. The Australian people rejected them because they knew they were false. He has been exposed because of their falseness. He thinks he makes an impact with the sarcastic remark that I am a Minister who will mine and develop anything. I am very proud of the development that is taking place in Australia today. It is leading to the recovery of the economy. There are great prospects and there is a great confidence in this country because of those developments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The attitude of the Labor Party is one of sour grapes, and we have to recognise that and put up with it. The honourable member for Blaxland talks about being concerned about shareholders. Heavens above, can he not be a little more accurate in bringing forward a matter of public importance than to say that the project is being shelved. That is not true. The project is not being shelved. The honourable member does himself no credit by making such a statement. It is for political mileage and for no other reason that he makes that statement. This project is far too important to be treated in this manner. It is of great importance to Australia and it has to be looked at in a responsible way, not in the flippant way in which the honourable member has handled it today. He is trying to condemn the Government as if it has no energy policies at all and as if it has done nothing in the fields of gas and electricity. I refer honourable members to the extension of the natural gas lines, to the assistance we have given, and to the subsidies on liquefield petroleum gas. What about the taxation concessions on conversion to electricity. There is the matter of using condensates for fuel. The Government has encouraged the Cooper Basin developers to use their condensates for liquid fuel purposes. All these policies are working and are having an effect and the Australian people realise that. </PARA>
<PARA> When I visited the Rundle site in February 1980 I said that the project being launched presented many problems which had to be overcome. I said that companies in many countries were grappling with the technical and economic difficulties of unlocking the energy potential trapped in oil shale. I said-I still believe it to be the case-that, because of the size of the project and because of the contribution it would make to our liquid fuel requirements, the successful development of the Rundle oil shale deposit could lead to a vast new industry of greater significance for Australia than any other mining project that has taken place. I caution the honourable member for Blaxland against writing off the Rundle project too quickly. We are looking at potentially the largest project ever undertaken in Australia. It would make a major contribution to our fuel requirements. I am confident that sooner or later this oil shale project, along with other oil shale projects, will be developed. From what I have seen and heard of the statements by Opposition members they seem to take delight in the fact that this project might not go ahead. All that is happening at the moment is that the project is being reappraised. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The project is being reappraised; the companies have to re-evaluate the terms on which they decided to join up with the two Australian partners in the first place. The honourable member for Blaxland tries only to undermine confidence. He talks about jeopardising the Australian stock exchange and the value of shares. Nothing would jeopardise the share market more than a Labor government. In particular, a Labor government's resource tax would soon put an end to confidence on the stock exchange in Australia, so honourable members opposite should not make remarks about any comments the Government might make. What did Esso say yesterday in its statement? It said that additional work was needed to define a practical and economic approach to the development of the Rundle deposit. It said that it would be submitting to the other participants a proposed work plan that would seek solutions to technical problems. It said that the prime objective of this program would be to reach a sufficient level of technical and economic confidence to allow a decision on whether to proceed in due course to a commercial plant without building a demonstration plant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Do these statements mean that Esso is pulling out? I do not believe one can accept that in any way. There is no reason why the statement should be interpreted as indicating that Esso is withdrawing from this project. Of course, there is no guarantee that the project will proceed. There has never been any such guarantee. The whole of the work under the project so far-remember that Esso has spent about $30m over the past year in evaluating it-has been on the basis of proving the economic and technical viability of the project. Only after the feasibility is proven or otherwise, can there be a firm decision one way or the other on whether to go ahead. It will be an immense, huge project. Yet the honourable member for Blaxland today is doing everything he can to spell the death knell for this project. </PARA>

The two Australian partners in the Condor deposit, another huge deposit, are at present negotiating with the Japanese National Oil Corporation to see whether it might be involved in yet another huge project in Queensland. What will this discussion do to help? I really believe the Australian Labor Party delights in seeing that these developments do not go ahead because it knows that if they proceed there will be more jobs, more employment and more prosperity for Australia.

At least 202 of those wells will be exploration wells, compared with 25 wells drilled in 1975.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BU4">Mr ANTHONY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There were 25. The Opposition says that our policies are not working or that we have not got a policy. If we have not got a policy, something is working darn well. APEA forecasts a rapid increase in exploration over the next five years. The expenditure on exploration was $228m in 1979 and $355m in 1980. It is expected to reach $400m this year plus another $1 billion on development work. In 1982 exploration expenditure is expected to be substantially higher. Next year over 30 on-shore and at least nine off-shore rigs are expected to be at work looking for oil and gas in Australia. This hardly represents a picture of neglect as the honourable member for Blaxland has been trying to make out. The honourable member is making out that the Government has been concentrating too much on synthetic fuel. The Government makes no apology for encouraging the development of synthetic fuels. To do otherwise would be grossly irresponsible. Our fuel policy has been and will remain one for overall development of Australia's alternative forms of energy. Certainly synthetic fuel is an important part of that. Indeed, in yesterday's statement, the Rundle project participants emphasised that favourable energy development policies had been the key consideration in the initiation of the Rundle development studies and said that a continuation of these policies remained an important consideration in the future development of the resource. To suggest that a reappraisal of the Rundle project somehow means the Government's energy policies are wrong is clear nonsense. There are a number of these oil shale deposit developments taking place around the world. It is a major alternative form of energy. We have the deposits here. We need to capitalise on them and to utilise them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At present, developments are taking place by Union Oil of California which is one of the pioneers of the extraction of oil from oil shale. It is pushing ahead with the project in Colorado. Paraho Development Corporation is planning a project in Utah; Petrosix of Brazil is expanding its existing output; Occidental is constructing a project in Colorado. These projects are going ahead. Oil shale projects are a reality. I am looking forward to the time when Australia will be a major producer of oil for oil shale. The massive scope of the Rundle project has always been known, but the evaluation work done so far has shown the scope to be far larger than was originally contemplated. There have been geological problems, there have been problems relating to the cost and there have been problems relating to the manpower, water and electricity required. All of these matters have been assessed during the period of evaluation over the past 12 months. The companies are now looking at how they might rearrange their approach to developing this project. For the future of this country and for future Australians, we have to find alternative forms of energy, as do other countries around the world. </PARA>
<PARA> If there have to be some changes, as suggested by the companies in the last 24 hours, then we should not look at the project in a disparaging way as is being done by the honourable member for Blaxland, who is doing nothing other than trying to undermine confidence in people wanting to push ahead with these sorts of developments. He seems to take a great deal of joy from the fact that the project might be shelved or might not go ahead. The project will go ahead at some time. I do not know when. It is a massive project. I think all of us hope that the sooner it commences, the better it is in Australia's long term interest. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CH4">Mr HOLDING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I propose to tell the honourable gentleman. The difference between the approach of the Opposition on this matter and the approach of the Government is very simple. For year after year the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), as spokesman for the Opposition on energy matters, has pleaded with the Government to adopt a national and comprehensive policy on the whole question of our energy resources, including oil, brown coal deposits, liquid petroleum gas and oil shale deposits. Time and again this Government has rejected any such comprehensive approach and preferred a panacea for all of our future energy problems-the projected development of the Rundle shale oil deposits. When Esso Australia Ltd became involved in that project, that not only was lauded by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) but also were gross and misleading statements made by him, by the Deputy Prime Minister and by the Minister for National Development and Energy (Senator Carrick). They led the Australian people and many members of the investing public to a completely false sense of expectation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Prime Minister did not have any doubts at all about the future of the project. The statement, and his certainty about this project has already been quoted by the honourable member for Blaxland. The Prime Minister was quite certain about the future of the deposits and he followed that belief up when on the AM program he said:</PARA>
<PARA> But under policies you know the great Rundle shale oil deposits; the pilot plant is going ahead at the cost of some hundreds of millions of dollars and the objective is to have oil from Rundle and other shale oil projects coming on stream about the time Bass Strait's starts to run down significantly. </PARA>
<PARA>When the Prime Minister was questioned in the House today about his statements, what was his answer? He regretted that the project had now run into some difficulties. What are those difficulties not described in any detail by the Prime Minister? They are first of all that feasible technology in respect of this project has increased in price three times to a total of $2,100m. That is three times the original estimate. The directors have further stated that problems in the geology of the deposit would make sections difficult or impossible to mine. As a result of this, as of yesterday, Esso is not going to build phase one of the project. It wants to re-negotiate the agreement. The members of the public, who have been urged by the public statements of the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for National Development and Energy to invest in this project, have seen the value of their share investments slashed by 40 per cent in 24 hours. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the Government's response? At Question Time, the Prime Minister, having described there as being some difficulties, retired hurt and did not answer any more questions. He handed the matter over to the Deputy Prime Minister, knowing that he will say anything at any time, and who is known with benign good humour, throughout the Middle East, as: 'Have mouth, will travel'.</PARA>

<PARA> Australian has enough shale oil to last 12,000 years. </PARA>
<PARA>He said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . that the deposit could contain up to 5,000 million barrels of oil. </PARA>
<PARA>At least let me say this for the Age reporter: He was prudent enought to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Anthony's estimate is also 3,000 million barrels more than the recoverable reserves announced to stock exchanges by Rundle twin owners. </PARA>
<PARA>So, this is the accuracy of the Deputy Prime Minister. He is an incredible man. He goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> But even more important, the successful commercial exploitation of the pilot technology which has already evolved elsewhere will put Australia in the forefront of what could be one of the world's most important new industries. </PARA>
<PARA>When Mr Anthony talked about 12,000 years supply, again we ought to be grateful to the Age reporter who points out:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Anthony drew the estimated figures from a committee report which warned that most of Australia's reserves of oil shale were uneconomic even though they total 2,850 thousand million barrels. </PARA>
<PARA>So Mr Anthony did not merely over-estimate the figures which were some millions of barrels in excess of those even claimed by the companies in their wildest dreams; he drew on reports using figures which were totally inaccurate and misleading.

<PARA>Fill the gap! What is the reality? Confronted with-honourable members cannot even call it a policy-a set of statements that is in tatters, the Prime Minister today answers one question and retires hurt and does not deal with the other three. The Deputy Prime Minister tries to make the best of it, but he was used as spokesman in this situation by the Government because of his known capacity to quote figures that are demonstrably wrong, demonstrably inaccurate and demonstrably misleading. </PARA>
<PARA> What does Senator Carrick say when asked by the Press about this matter? This was the man who was saying:</PARA>
<PARA> Ever since Rundle was projected and Esso was involved it was the answer; it was the linchpin of Government policy. </PARA>
<PARA>That was before this week. How is he quoted in today's newspapers? The Brisbane Courier-Mail states:</PARA>
<PARA> He sought also to diminish the importance of Rundle to Australia's future energy requirements. </PARA>

<PARA>Does that sound like a Minister who is saying, as the Deputy Prime Minister endeavoured to say today: 'Have no fear; Rundle will proceed'? Not a bit of it!

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The proposition put forward by the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) is preposterous. He says two things and both of them are nonsense. He says that the Government's energy strategy has failed. That, obviously, is not true. The Government's energy strategy is working with great success. On every front our policy is proving to be correct and effective. The search for oil has picked up very strongly as a result of our policy. Honourable members should note that 140 wells have been drilled this year in the search for oil and gas. Compared with the disaster of the policies of the Labor Government, there has been a complete revival in the search for oil and gas. The Australian Petroleum Exploration Association is now forecasting very large increases in expenditure-$400m on exploration and $1,000m on development. If we do not find more oil, we will be forced to do one of two things: Either we will have to import more and more oil, if we can get it, and import it at very high prices or we will have to develop alternative kinds of fuel. That is why the Rundle project is so important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second piece of nonsense we have heard from the honourable member for Blaxland is that the Rundle project has been shelved. No doubt that is what the honourable member would like to see happen, but it has not happened and I hope and believe it will not happen. Certainly there have been very significant changes in the forecasts of what the project will cost. But, despite what the two Opposition members have said in this debate, the Rundle project will go on. Spokesmen for Esso and the two Australian companies involved strongly reject suggestions that yesterday's development will lead to the cancellation of the project. Esso spokesmen have stated: 'It is a reappraisal and reassessment. We need to do more work and have more time. The project will go on'. </PARA>
<PARA> The companies-Southern Pacific, Central Pacific and Esso-are to undertake a further program of studies so that they can make a proper assessment of the future of the project in the light of the latest information. But it is quite wrong for the honourable member for Blaxland and the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) to say that the project has been shelved. That is a damaging thing for them to say. They have said it only to undermine public confidence in the Rundle project. It is irresponsible of them to do so. They should be looking for ways of making a constructive contribution to the debate, not doing all they can to destroy confidence and to undermine Australia's chances of developing a new kind of fuel. So on two counts the honourable members are wrong. They were wrong to talk of the failure of the Government's energy strategy because it has not failed. They were wrong to talk of the shelving of the Rundle project because it has not been shelved and I do not believe it will be. </PARA>
<PARA> The key element of Australia's energy policy is fuel pricing. No one likes to have to pay more for his fuel. This policy is not a popular one, and that is understandable. But the Government's responsibility is to do what is right and in the best long term interests of the nation, not just to seek popularity. Australians are now paying the true price for their fuel. That means that the circumstances have been created in which we can look at the development of alternative fuels. They will not be developed if our pricing policies are unrealistic. The Rundle venturers have always made it clear that realistic fuel pricing is absolutely essential if their project is to succeed. Despite the difficulties that have now emerged they are still making clear, as they did in yesterday's announcement, that the project cannot go ahead if the Government does not maintain correct energy development policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Party seems quite happy to take a defeatist attitude and say that the Rundle project is finished before it has even started. I note that not one member of the Opposition is in the House at the moment. This attitude might be good enough for the Labor Party, but it is not good enough for the Government and it is not good enough for Australia. There has to be an intensive effort to see that the Rundle project does go ahead if at all possible. We cannot just write it off. It is too important to this nation. Australia will need every drop of liquid fuel it can get from whatever source it can get it. We will face crippling financial burdens in the future if we have to import large quantities of oil. We will need an all-out effort to develop oil from coal and shale if we are to meet our future needs. I believe that the Rundle project holds promise as a source of a major part of our fuel needs. I say that even though problems are apparent now that were not obvious a year or two ago. </PARA>
<PARA> In a recent report on Australia's energy outlook the Esso company said that unconventional sources of oil must be developed. Esso also said that this was necessary because there could be no guarantee of finding more conventional oil in sufficient quantities to prevent loss of our present self-sufficiency. The company said that the projected development of synthetic crude oil could account for nearly half of Australia's oil production by the year 2000. Esso pointed out that there were very real commercial risks in committing huge amounts of capital to developing the technology and the facilities to produce these synthetic crudes. It said that if Australia is aiming at becoming self-sufficient in oil the Government must maintain policies encouraging both conventional oil exploration and synthetics development. That is perfectly true. That is exactly what the Government is doing. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that Esso said that progress on both fronts-conventional and unconventional oil-could be made if the risks were reduced by clear bipartisan policies. What hope is there of bipartisan policies when the Labor Party is determined to knock and to be destructive? The Rundle project is of tremendous significance to Australia. I hope that the problems which have arisen can be overcome and that, in a relatively short time, oil from the Rundle project will begin to increase Australia's self-sufficiency in fuel. The Government, unlike the Labor Party, will be working to that end. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Trade and Resources (Mr Anthony) made reference in his speech to there being 12,000 years' supply of shale oil. The Minister did not determine this figure himself, as he was accused of doing. He quoted an estimate published by the National Energy Advisory Committee, which said that Australia's total reserves of oil shale-not just from the Rundle project, but our total reserves-at current rates of usage represented 12,000 years' supply. If honourable members opposite want to question this estimate they should take their dispute to the National Energy Advisory Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has certainly encouraged expertise and know-how from overseas to explore for energy in this country. The policies set by the Government are having outstanding results. For instance, the liquefied natural gas project on the North West Shelf will involve $5,000m. Companies involved in the project include BP, Shell, Woodside, Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd and Asiatic Petroleum. This project is being developed under the auspices of this Government. These companies have been prepared to develop the project because the Government has made it so attractive. Great development has taken place in our coal industry. The Minister for Trade and Resources has been able to arrange contracts for our coal during his many overseas visits. There is great development in the coal industry at present in my electorate of Paterson. Again, overseas companies with expertise and know-how have come in and invested money in our coal projects. Obviously they have in mind liquefaction from coal. They are not taking over the mines entirely but they are investing money. The Foreign Investment Review Board has strict guidelines and the main investment is Australian. Shell, BHP, Esso and Caltex are coming in and investing money in these mines. The are protecting the energy industry in which they have invested millions of dollars. The Government's policy in this area is bringing great results for the nation. I deplore the remarks made by members of the Opposition in this debate. </PARA>

<PARA> That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: CSIRO Marine Laboratories, Hobart, Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA>In April 1980 the Government decided that a marine laboratories complex should be established in Tasmania. This decision was aimed at strengthening Commonwealth support for the fishing industry and upgrading oceanographic research following the declaration of the 200-mile Australian fishing zone. The proposal is to accommodate the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation divisions of Fisheries Research and of Oceanography in new premises at a site adjacent to Castray Esplanade at Battery Point in Hobart. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to pursue an enlarged research program CSIRO has formed two separate divisions from the former Division of Fisheries and Oceanography which has its headquarters at Cronulla, New South Wales. Existing facilities are inadequate for modern marine research. They are overcrowded, the site is unsuitable for redevelopment, and there are no adequate berthing facilities for research vessels. The site for the marine laboratories at Battery Point does not have these disadvantages. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed works will comprise: Fisheries and oceanography research laboratories; offices; workshops and stores; conference rooms and a lecture theatre; staff amenities; and servicing facilities for research vessels. The Battery Point area of Hobart is of historical significance and the site is subject to special planning constraints. The proposed marine laboratories will comply with these requirements. The estimated cost of the proposal at February 1981 is $10.75m. I table plans of the proposed work. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As member for Denison in this House it gives me very great pleasure to support the motion just moved so capably by my colleague, the Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr McVeigh). I wish briefly to recount the history of the matter to date and to state what we hope will now follow as a result of today's motion. Back in January 1976 I spoke with the then Minister for Science, Senator the honourable James Webster, as to the possibility of some form of Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation marine science research activity being located in Tasmania. Senator Webster explained to me that problems had arisen in relation to the continued occupation of rented premises at Cronulla at which the divisions of Fisheries and Oceanography of the CSIRO were currently ensconced. The factual situation was that the premises were inadequate, it was inhibiting forward planning and, quite unbeknown to me, the Department, together with the CSIRO had been looking at alternatives. Following that initial discussion in January 1976 a number of strong representations were made by myself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to pay a special tribute both to Senator Webster and to the present Minister for Science and Technology, (Mr Thomson), for the interest that they have shown in this proposal. In April last year the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) announced in this House that the Government had taken a decision to establish in Hobart what would eventually become known as the National Marine Science Research Centre comprising the CSIRO Divisions of Fisheries and Oceanography and the other facilities referred to by my colleague, the Minister for Housing and Construction. This indeed is good news. It is an initiative which I believe will be applauded. It brings to Hobart, Tasmania, not only the Australian headquarters of the Antarctic Division but also, with the forwarding of this proposal to the Public Works Committee, a National Marine Science Research Centre. Last week the Antarctic Marine Living Resources Conservation Bill which was so capably handled by the Minister for Housing and Construction in his capacity as Acting Minister for Science and Technology stated that Australia had become the first nation to ratify the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources which Convention provides in Article XIII, sub-article 1:</PARA>
<PARA> The headquarters of the Commission shall be established at Hobart, Tasmania, Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>I place on record my gratitude to the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Groom), the former Minister for Housing and Construction for his assistance and co-operation, to the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman), and to my good friend and colleague, the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Goodluck), who has supported this project since its inception. I also wish to take a few moments to place on record my gratitude to the following members of the various departments who have proceeded with some expedition to enable this motion to come before the House today: Mr Ian Preston of the Department of Administrative Services; Mr Allen McKenzie, the Controller of Housing and Construction in Tasmania and all members of the staff in the Department of Science and Technology in my home State; and to the CSIRO, particularly Dr Paul Wild, and Sir Victor Burley and all the others. I believe the initiative which comes before the Parliament today is one which will ultimately lead to the establishment of a Marine Science Research Centre of international standing. In addition to the buildings referred to in the motion, it is further proposed that the $9m Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation vessel, which I hope the Government will be able to commission at the earliest possible opportunity, will also be based in Hobart. The entire complex would provide employment for some 250 persons. The value to the economy of southern Tasmania would be indeed significant, but it is the bringing together in Australia's southernmost capital, in Australia's only island State, of the Antarctic and marine resources of this nation, which is of international significance. That gives me as a Tasmanian particular pride and pleasure. I know that my Tasmanian Liberal colleagues in both the Senate and the House of Representatives are equally proud. </PARA>
<PARA> Last but not least, I commend the Chairman of the Public Works Committee, the honourable member for Canning (Mr Bungey) and the Secretary of the Committee, Mr Dick Fenton, for facilitating the early hearing of this reference in Hobart. That will take place in the week commencing 18 May. Because of the efficiency of the Department of Housing and Construction, the display model has already arrived in Hobart. It is on display and has attracted a lot of attention. As proposed, it is a superb architectural structure-one that will also be scientifically superb. Aesthetically it is very attractive and will not in any way disrupt or interfere with the traditional beauty of the Battery Point area. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish the Committee every success in its deliberations and look forward to its speedily reporting back to the Parliament. I will support any necessary expediency motion in order that early expenditure on this magnificent total complex may be speedily approved. I understand that ultimately the complex will cost in the order of $25m and will be of international standard. Its being established in Hobart, Tasmania, will be to the benefit of the people of Australia and indeed the peoples of the world for many years to come. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Designs Amendment Bill 1981 is a further development in the Australian industrial property system. It introduces the first substantial changes to the designs legislation since 1906, when the Act was first passed. Its aim is to encourage innovation and industrial design within the community. To this extent the Bill reflects the Government's continuing commitment to reforming Australia's industrial property system. It seeks to make industrial property more responsive to our needs in developing and exploiting Australia's innovative technology. </PARA>
<PARA> Designs are probably the least understood of the possessions collectively known as industrial property rights. Many people are only vaguely familiar with the meaning and advantages of patents, registered trade marks and copyright rights. The availability of design protection often surprises manufacturers and importers, distributors and retailers. Yet these are the very people who benefit by being able to suppress unfair competition or who could take steps to avoid infringement of another's design rights. This lack of understanding is particularly unfortunate when a business is founded on a new or improved product as its only real asset. </PARA>
<PARA> Designs, in the sense of eye-appealing, industrial creations as opposed to mechanical contrivances, can be protected in Australia by a registration procedure which has existed for 75 years. Industrial designs have been created by manufacturers who consciously sought to enhance the sales appeal and competitiveness of their products through ornamentation. Nevertheless, functional considerations have tended to predominate. It is, however, only in comparatively recent times that industrial designing has intensified. It has been encouraged by the need to exploit wider markets; by domestic and overseas competition; by increased media advertising and display; by the discovery of many new processes and materials; and by the higher level of community education. </PARA>
<PARA> If good design is to flourish, those responsible for producing it must be protected. To this end, industrial designs have been safeguarded by legislation through registration. Anyone who produces a new or original design may protect it by registering it at the Designs Office. The right given by registering a design is a monopoly and can be infringed without copying taking place. The monopoly conferred by registration is, however, subject to review by the courts, which have the power to declare any design registration invalid. Thus registration is the only prima facie evidence that the design is valid. This Bill recognises that in this country changes to designs legislation can greatly improve the incentives for innovative design. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1970 the Government set up the Designs Law Review Committee to determine what changes would be appropriate to Australian conditions. It advocated the inclusion of new provisions in the designs legislation. The report has been widely circulated and has received support from those using the design system in Australia. Under the new legislation, designs will be registered initially for one year. This period can be extended so as to give the owner of a design a maximum of 16 years protection. This will apply provided the Registrar is not made aware, either from members of the community or in any other way, of any matter affecting the registration's validity. This Bill introduces a specific provision empowering the Registrar to undertake searches to establish the newness or originality of the design for which registration is being sought. </PARA>
<PARA> Another significant change is the abolition of the present requirement to register according to a class system. The abolition of this system will give wider protection to designs without affecting the test of novelty or originality. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation also incorporates a new definition of design which is coupled with a new provision. The combined effect is to make it clear that design features serving a functional purpose should not be taken into account by the courts in determining whether the design is valid. This will allow registration of shapes which enable an article to perform a particular function. The function itself will not be registered, merely the shape or feature needed to achieve the function. </PARA>
<PARA> I should stress that the benefits provided by the Designs Act apply only to designs registered under the provisions. Whilst the benefits of registration outweigh those of non-registration, the Act clearly requires that a design must be new or original and unpublished in Australia before a registration application is made. In return for satisfying those conditions the owner obtains a monopoly for up to 16 years. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian industry, as well as overseas industry, favours the system of Australian design registration. This is apparent when one considers the wide range of articles registered as designs by Australian industry. Design registrations being sought and obtained range from air conditioners, barbecues, boat hulls, chairs and display cabinets to roof tiles, toys, wash-basins and yo-yos. The Government is seeking to encourage Australian innovative effort in every possible way. Since 1975 the rate of design lodgments in Australia has increased by 50 per cent. Approximately 70 per cent of all applications for design registration have come from Australians. This indicates a greater awareness of the need for, and the benefits of, statutory protection for industrial property rights. The Government is well aware of this. This Bill is another of the measures introduced in the last three years to provide a more conducive climate for innovation in the Australian community. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill corrects inadequacies in procedures for obtaining a patent for an invention. Although the procedures are technical and sometimes complex, the principles behind them are basic to industrial property protection. In particular this applies to provisions of the Bill concerning time limits for certain actions necessary while a patent application is pending. The main purpose of a patent system is to stimulate industrial invention and innovation by granting limited monopoly rights to inventors and by increasing public availability of information on new technology. Patent procedures must achieve a balance among competing interests while remaining administratively workable.</PARA>
<PARA> The primary purpose of time limits is to enable industrial competitors to operate with some certainty about whether they are impinging on someone else's patent rights. A set time limit ensures that third parties can act in the sure knowledge that an applicant has obtained or has foregone his rights. Time limits should not, however, be inviolate. An applicant who fails to observe them may incur the loss of all or part of the potential rights to a patent. </PARA>
<PARA> Provisions already in the Patents Act allow the Commissioner of Patents, under certain conditions, to extend the times laid down. The most important of these is section 160, which allows time extensions in circumstances beyond control or through an error or omission by the person concerned, or his agent or attorney. It was a long-standing Patent Office practice to grant liberal section 160 time extensions. Recently this liberal approach has been challenged, resulting in inadequacies becoming apparent in three areas. The first area relates to the time within which the Commissioner may accept a patent application. Acceptance marks the stage when the Commissioner grants an application. The problem is that no explicit provision allows section 160 to extend that time. </PARA>
<PARA> The second relates to the Convention period which is derived from the Paris Convention and concerns the priority dating of patents lodged in Australia but which originated from other member countries. Again no express provision allows section 160 to extend that period. The third area relates to extending the 12-month period for lodging what is called a complete-after-provisional application. It arises where an applicant lodges a patent application with only a provisional specification. This is in order to retain a priority date corresponding to the filing date of the provisional specification. There is no express provision in section 160 to extend the 12-month period. </PARA>
<PARA> Recent decisions by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Deputy Commissioner of Patents mean extensions of the Convention period or the acceptance period cannot now be granted. There is also doubt about the validity of Complete-after-provisional extensions. The seriousness of the problem became apparent in mid-1979 when an industrial dispute at the Redfern Mail Exchange delayed a large number of patent application documents in transit. As well processing delays could often mean that the time limit for accepting applications has passed. Under these circumstances patents would be irretrievably precluded from being granted. The Government decided on remedial legislation, and this Bill ensures extensions of time in appropriate circumstances. The Bill now provides specific sections to supplement the inadequately worded section 160. Apart from time extensions, provisions also allow for protecting third parties adversely affected by extensions. Additionally, there is the opportunity for opposition to extensions exceeding three months. The Bill also contains a catch-all provision to cope with late lodgments of documents attributable to postal delays. </PARA>
<PARA> Another problem arises from the findings that some extensions were invalid. The Attorney-General's Department advises that a patent granted after an invalid extension of the acceptance period is itself invalid. In the case of the Convention period, an invalid extension means that the Convention priority date is lost. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill therefore includes provisions retrospectively validating extensions of time purported to have been granted in the past and which are now held, or might be held, to be invalid. All consequences flowing from such extensions are also validated. The only exceptions are those extensions which have been questioned in proceedings under the principal Act. It would be unjust to legislate retrospectively arbitrarily to remove rights established in those proceedings. As far as extensions of the acceptance period and of the time for lodging the complete-after-provisional specifications are concerned, grounds for seeking an extension are the same as those in section 160. However, divergent views exist about the availability of extensions to the Convention period. Because of these conflicting considerations, the Industrial Property Advisory Committee was asked whether the Patents Act should provide for extending the Convention period. The Committee recommended and the Government accepted that: Firstly, extensions be granted where the applicant can show he intended filing within the 12-month Convention priority period; secondly, the failure to do so was beyond the control of the applicant, his agent or his attorney; and, thirdly, under no circumstances should the extension exceed three months. </PARA>
<PARA> Other points covered by the Bill include easing the restrictions imposed by time limits for lodging divisional applications, inclusion of more wide-ranging regulations on professional conduct of patent attorneys, and provisions which enable Australia to carry out its obligations under the International Patents Co-operations Treaty. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, this Bill aims to resolve a procedural defect which has been uncovered in the patent system. That defect has not only put obstacles in the way of obtaining a patent but also rendered many existing patents defective, and even void. This Bill corrects those defects. The rights of applicants and patentees, and also of competitors in industry, are now safeguarded. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to take part in this debate. I wish to voice my concern about a number of decisions taken by the Government which confirm fears that I have had-they are fears held by many people in Canberra-that the Government is intent on carrying out a vendetta against Canberra people. I am very pleased that the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) is present to hear what I have to say. I hope he takes the opportunity to respond to it. I refer firstly to the blatant double standards of the Minister in going along so enthusiastically with the heavy subsidisation of air fares to Tasmania while at the same time not lifting a finger to protect Australian Capital Territory residents from the savage 30 per cent increase in their air fares. Many people feel, as I do, that the Minister has let the people of Canberra down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have then the rather reactionary legislation of the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar) in which he is endeavouring to change the structure of the Capital Territory Health Commission in a way which will exclude the elected members of the Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly from the decision-making body. These representatives were elected specifically by the people of Canberra to carry out a constructive and responsible role in the interests of those people. This Government obviously believes that the people of Canberra do not have a right to be heard on these authorities which deal with very important matters concerning the quality of services available to them. </PARA>
<PARA> Probably the most serious concern of all is about reports which I have heard recently that the Minister for the Capital Territory has attempted to interfere with the Australian Capital Territory Milk Authority in carrying out its responsibilities. I know that this is a very serious allegation. I hope that I am wrong and I hope that the Minister will tell me if I am wrong. I understand that the Minister in fact put pressure on the Australian Capital Territory Milk Authority to re-negotiate an existing legal contract which the Authority has with Bega Co-operative Society Ltd in order to increase arbitrarily the price of milk to Canberra consumers. I understand that the Authority, to its credit, refused to be a party to this disgraceful deal and that the Minister was considering using the reserve powers contained in the Authority ordinance in order to override the opposition of the Authority to this devious proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not blame the dairy farmers for wanting to get a few more cents for their milk. I know that they have been through a difficult time. I do not blame their elected representative for trying to achieve that end for them. But I think the Minister should remember that he has a very serious responsibility to protect the interests of Canberra people. I hope that on this issue he will take that responsibility seriously and put first their interests and not the interest of a minority group outside the Australian Capital Territory. I am very concerned about these allegations. I hope that they are not true. I hope that the Minister will respond. I think that the people of Canberra are just beginning to realise how blatantly this Government and the Minister are prepared to discriminate against Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> I have heard disturbing reports that the Government is considering selling the Canberra Commercial Development Authority; that is, the Authority which owns and runs the Belconnen Shopping Mall. I understand that the Government is considering selling the Mall to private enterprise. Again, I would like the Minister to clear the air and say what is happening in this respect. We have just cause to be apprehensive about these reports because the Government has a pretty good record in flogging off government owned enterprise to private enterprise. We have already seen the historic government sawmill sold off-a mill which was responsible for the sawing of timber for many of the fine old buildings in this city. We have seen the modern brickworks sold off for a fraction of its real value. Last year, of course, the Government was negotiating to sell the Mugga quarry, again a facility, a resource base, which has been used to build a lot of the buildings in Canberra and which has given very fine service to the city. </PARA>
<PARA> We still have to face up to the devastation of the so-called Lynch razor gang. Again, we have cause for great concern for the future of Canberra. No doubt, that committee will continue the process of total disregard for the interests of Canberra people. I think the people of Canberra are entitled to know what is the Minister's intention with regard to future milk prices. They are entitled to know what is the Government's intention with regard to the possible sale of the Canberra Commercial Development Authority. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to another area of government policy which concerns me greatly; that is, the blind obedience which our Government seems to have to following the foreign policy progressions of our great and powerful friends. I refer particularly to two very important areas of foreign policy: One concerns our policy towards the problems in Indo-China and Kampuchea and the other concerns the problem in El Salvador. Despite mounting criticism, the Government is continuing to support the United States involvement in the El Salvadorean civil war. The Government has remained oblivious to both internal and international criticism of this facet of United States policy. It is important to remember that what really motivates the Reagan Administration may be substantially different from its public statements. Since the humiliation of the hostages in Iran, the United States has been itching for an opportunity to show that she still has the military muscle and the willpower to do what she likes. This mood, of course, was compounded by the impotence that the Americans felt during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, which the Opposition condemned in exactly the same way as the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> President Reagan fought much of his highly successful election campaign on the irrational issue that the US had somehow lost control of the world situation and that tough action was necessary to stop further deterioration. The very tough rhetoric of President Reagan has been backed up by his choice of several hard line staff-Vice-President Bush, Haig, Weinberger and people of that nature. Their number one foreign policy aim appears to be to confront progressive peoples' governments and movements wherever they appear, no matter who their opponents are, and to support regimes that protect US overseas business interests, no matter how brutal or repressive they are or how they act towards their own deprived people. Some of these regimes have been totally repressive-for example, the Pol Pot regime-brutal and totally unjust and have inflicted total poverty on their people. This has led the Administration to support such diverse groups as the Pol Pot murderers, the Moslem insurgents in Afghanistan and the junta in El Salvador. This means, in effect, that the US expects the Soviet Union to stay well clear of America's back yard-that is, El Salvador-but at the same time she does not seem to apply this principle to her own activities. The US policy towards El Salvador must be seen against this background. </PARA>
<PARA> It is disturbing that the Australian Government has been so uncritical of the motives of the Reagan Administration. With the presumption that the US wanted the opportunity to show her strength, the proof offered by the Department of State may well be good enough for American internal consumption but it should not be good enough for level headed governments elsewhere in the world, including the Australian Government. We should have an independent attitude towards these problems. If we listened to the voice of people in Australia on the situation in El Salvador, I think we would have a different policy. The American action in El Salvador is rationalised by the claim that Cuba, East Germany, the Soviet Union and many other members of the international communist conspiracy are funnelling huge amounts of modern weapons to the left wing guerrillas. This claim is similar to the ones by the US before intervening in the affairs of Guatamala and Cuba in 1961-the Bay of Pigs invasion. The American State Department has now made public documents which purport to prove this claim. This collection of documents, entitled 'Communist Interference in El Salvador', is dated 23 February 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> When one looks at them one sees there is very little in the documents which would give them authenticity or credibility. Several of them are undated. Several use only first names when referring to alleged leaders. Most contain information which cannot be checked. The arms listed are predominantly of American manufacture, which I think is irrelevant. If people want the arms it really does not matter where they come from. The few photographs accompanying the documents are inconclusive and bear no source. To sum up, there is very little in the documents that could not be a clumsy forgery. They contain little substance. Because of code words, first names and acronyms, it is difficult to interpret much of the evidence at all. Further, the report does not come to grips with the quite plausible explanation that the guerrillas are buying weapons from international arms dealers. I say that it is irrelevant where the arms come from. When people are being shot at, repressed and killed, naturally they will get arms, but the revolutionary front is poorly armed compared with the military junta in El Salvador. </PARA>
<PARA> The Reagan Administration has tried to claim that a win for the leftists in El Salvador would cause all Latin America somehow to go over to the socialist camp-the old domino theory. This generalisation seems to be supported by our Government. The leftist opposition forces in El Salvador joined together on 18 April 1980 to form the Democratic Revolutionary Front. The United States is simply wrong in portraying this front as a hard core Marxist-Leninist party. It is a political alliance of many diverse individuals and groups. It contains many people who have been associated with previous ruling groups in El Salvador, including Social Democrats, members of the Socialist International, former Christian Democrats, peasants, intellectuals and unionists. It is, indeed, a revolutionary front. The current President of the Front, Mr Ungo, resigned from the present ruling junta as late as January 1980. Foreign policy generalisations are very dangerous. Writing for the now defunct Australian International News Review the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Malcolm Fraser), the present Prime Minister, in July 1965-this is an interesting extract-said:</PARA>
<PARA> The war Australians are fighting in Vietnam is not a civil war, as the left wing tries to tell us. It is an invasion from the north, as it was in Korea . . . if Mainland China is allowed to push her domination down through Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, and if we find South-East Asia and Indonesia all swayed and dominated by communist regimes, then our position would be bleak indeed. </PARA>
<PARA>How wrong the Prime Minister was. These generalities can now be truly recognised as absurdities. The Prime Minister and his Government today seem to be following much the same line towards El Salvador. Again they seem to have swallowed the American line without even considering that the United States is simply looking for an opportunity to indulge in some well-publicised bullying to satisfy internal political demands. </PARA>
<PARA> The present Government has demonstrated that it has no foreign policy will of its own. It can only follow the lead of Washington. It is incredible that our Government is again preparing to follow a nation whose recent foreign policy defects are now, fortunately, a matter of public record. Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Chile and Angola are cases that spring readily to mind. </PARA>
<PARA> The only beneficiaries of American involvement in El Salvador are sections of the United States itself and the brutal, repressive, fascist regime in El Salvador which is financed and controlled by 14 families of landowners, supported by the United States, whose wealth has come from keeping the majority of the population impoverished. Any member of parliament who saw the film on El Salvador shown last week would have seen how brutal that regime is. It is worth noting that although we invited all members of parliament to watch the film-it was a World Council of Churches film illustrating what is going on in El Salvador-of the approximately 30 people there only one Government supporter thought it worth while to come along to find out what was happening in El Salvador. Not one member of this House came to look at the film. Only one Government senator came. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know that other things were happening and that some Government members would have liked to come but no member of this House came to see the film even though an invitation was issued to all of them. If the Australian Government is to persist in encouraging President Reagan's venture, it should at least call for economic rather than military aid. As with other Third World countries, supplying weapons will not help the situation. Weapons cannot destroy the root of the violence or social and economic conditions which force people to take desperate measures. The President of the El Salvador Legislative Assembly himself said: 'We can have the best army in the world but it is of no use if the people are starving. We want social reform and economic aid, we do not want weapons'. This Government would do well to look at the independent evidence of the situation in El Salvador rather than relying on United States handouts. Most Latin American and European nations have treated United States claims with scepticism. Such a healthy attitude would benefit our Government. By turning a blind eye to evidence contrary to that offered by the Reagan Administration, the Australian Government is doing a great disservice to the people in El Salvador, to humanity and the people of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The folly of blindly following the United States can be seen in our attitude towards Indo-China. The Americans have decided that Chinese foreign policy aims are acceptable and those of the Soviet Union are not. Of course, Australia has followed this policy blindly. One of the most important regional repercussions of this assessment is that until recently the Government, without any shame, maintained diplomatic recognition of the Pol Pot regime. Many of the people referred to as like-minded people, with whom the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) had discussions recently, represent governments that still recognise the brutal regime of Pol Pot, such as the people in Thailand, China, the Philippines, America and Singapore. These are the people to whom we are looking for advice. We do not seek advice from people who may think a little differently from us. We continue our tunnelled vision and follow blindly United States foreign policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The logic of the recognition of the Pol Pot regime was that remnants of the Pol Pot forces continued to fight Vietnamese troops who had saved the Kampuchean people from a regime which was worse, in some ways, than the one Hitler imposed on Eastern Europe. The Vietnamese are allies of the Soviet Union. Hence the overthrow of the barbaric Pol Pot regime was equated with Soviet expansion. This was seen as a greater evil than a regime which caused immense suffering and destruction to over one million people and a peace-loving country. Of course, there are good reasons why Vietnam and the Soviet Union became firm friends. Western countries, led by the United States, ceased all aid and left the Vietnamese to their own devices to rebuild their shattered nation. For more than a decade the United States, aided by a number of other countries, including Australia, attempted to destroy Vietnam with high explosives, napalm and defoliants. They did not succeed in destroying the will of the people but they left the economy and the countryside in ruins. The damage caused by B52 bombers flying in from Thailand and the Philippines, by naval ships bombarding the coastline and by ground fire was immense. However, the long-term results of the defoliation campaign are probably even more harmful, as many Australian servicemen and their unfortunate children are now discovering. The terrific results of chemical warfare have been magnified many times over on the Vietnamese people themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> The lack of humanity of successive American administrations has been shown not only by a refusal to grant unilateral aid but also by the obstruction of American representatives on international financial bodies. It is small wonder that the Vietnamese turned more and more to the Soviet Union for desperately needed assistance in reconstructing their country. They had no option but to turn to the socialist countries. The association of the Vietnamese Government and the Heng Samrin regime with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is very much an artificial construction. The Vietnamese and Kampuchean governments are far from Soviet puppets. In fact, they have introduced economic reforms far more liberal than anything in the Soviet Union. In both cases there is scope for free enterprise. There is a free market sector in both Vietnam and Kampuchea. In Vietnam it is possible for groups of up to 20 employees to work for themselves. Much the same is true in Kampuchea. I think this is an interesting development of most socialist regimes. The political systems of both countries are flexible and dynamic. Because of a lack of understanding, particularly on the part of the United States, they are lumped together with a monolithic Soviet Union. This is far from the truth. </PARA>
<PARA> What is so shocking about the Government's attitude towards El Salvador and Indo-China is its ignorance. The Government knows little about what is happening in those places, yet it exhibits no desire to broaden its horizons. It is happy to rely on second hand American information and to repeat, parrot fashion, the comments of the United States President and the Secretary of State. It is incredible that this Government can still trot out the same sorts of glib generalisations that got Australia into such a mess some 15 years ago. In particular, it is surprising that the Prime Minister continues to accept so uncritically information from the United States when doing so previously involved us in the tragic farce of Vietnam. The wilful ignorance of this Government is to be condemned. Australia is a sovereign State and should conduct itself as such. A foreign policy of fawning after friends with big muscles will earn this nation nothing but contempt. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The House is debating the Address-in-Reply to the Governor-General's Speech. The Governor-General directed himself to matters of foreign affairs and he stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The past year has seen a significant heightening of international tension and uncertainty. While we must hope that it turns out to be mistaken, it must be recognised that the consensus of informed opinion, at present, is that the period encompassed by the life of this Parliament is likely to be a troubled and tense one in international affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> The foreign policy priorities of my Government are clear. It is very conscious of the need for a strong and united Western stance towards the Soviet Union and to this end it will work to maintain its already strong ties with its traditional allies, and in particular with the United States. It should be clearly understood that it will do so out of an appreciation of Australia's needs and interests and for no other reason. </PARA>
<PARA>That comment is relevant because of the remarks of the previous speaker in this debate, the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Fry), who suggested that some honourable members, particularly in relation to their own attitudes on the matter of certain interventions in El Salvador, Vietnam and Cambodia, or Kampuchea, have tunnel vision. I suggest with respect that the only person with tunnel vision is one who can direct himself to what is happening in those parts of the world without also directing his attention to the important events which have taken place in other parts of the world. I will endeavour to give the honourable member's address some balance and also to highlight problems in parts of the world which are of particular concern to me. One need only look at Afghanistan to appreciate that it is not only the United States which has ambitions in this world. The Soviet Union also has very clear ambitions. They may be predicated on its own self-interest but certainly they have consequences for individuals. One reads of the remarks of informed observers about the forces of the Soviet Union using gas in one form or another and equipping themselves to deal with gas warfare in that region against people who are not well equipped or well armed, and who certainly have not been armed in a significant way from the outside in the same way that insurgents-if I may call them that; as that is what they were at the time they were fighting against legitimate governments-were armed from outside when fighting in Vietnam and in Kampuchea, or Cambodia as it then was. We should consider the approach of the Soviet Union in Poland and the people who are in its so-called sphere of influence. Heaven knows that South America and Central America were frequently seen to be in the United States' sphere of influence, but what is happening today in the Soviet Union's sphere of influence certainly gives cause for concern and highlights the words of the Governor-General about this uncertain world in which we are living. In today's Australian newspaper it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Warsaw Pact troops yesterday continued to surround Poland, despite a dramatic rejection by Moscow of speculation the Soviet President, Mr Brezhnev, had called a 'mini summit' of allies on the crisis, under the cloak of the 16th Czechslovak Communist Party Congress in Prague . . . </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Intelligence sources yesterday said there were now more than 25,000 troops in the gigantic Soyuz 81 exercise. </PARA>
<PARA> The buildup in the past 24 hours includes tanks, communications units and troop transports. </PARA>
<PARA>One could go on. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> In the past 24 hours Moscow has again unofficially warned that intervention would result in trade boycotts by the West, and immediate demand for the repayment of Poland's outstanding $28,000 million to Western nations. </PARA>
<PARA> In what could be regarded as a warning to dissident groups inside Poland and other Warsaw Pact countries yesterday, the East German news service ADN broadcast details on early troop movements to the Polish border, saying they had come 'from deep within home territory'. </PARA>
<PARA>This must concern every honourable member, as it does me. I know that some honourable members on the other side of the House are very much concerned with what has been happening in Poland. In this debate I wish to direct my attention to the involvement of other countries in the activities of another independent nation, the Lebanon. I am particularly concerned about what has been happening in the Lebanon and I have my own views as to why it is happening at this time. I believe a sinister involvement of other forces in the Lebanon is taking advantage of the uncertainty generated as a result of the events in Poland. Notwithstanding the efforts of many to bring peace to that area, I am most concerned that the interests of the outside players in that country are not really to bring peace to it. I regard the present situation as the most serious since the 1975-76 civil war, which was followed by the establishment of the Arab League force in the form of a preliminary Syrian presence. </PARA>
<PARA> It needs to be understood that over a long period there have been diverse interests in the Lebanon. There have been Christians, Muslims and more recently Palestinians. They have lived together in that country and have managed to develop systems for handling their different interests. They were able to live in a country in the Middle East which would have been regarded as the most prosperous and certainly one of the most advanced in that area. Yet, we now see a situation which to all intents and purposes can only be regarded as most alarming. In today's broadcast of the A.M. radio program Steve Cosser interviewed Asher Walfisch who, in part, commented on the situation in the Lebanon. He made some comments about Israeli attitudes, and said:</PARA>
<PARA> Israelis are not at all surprised at the admission by the Soviet Ambassador in Beirut that five Soviet military intelligence experts are with the Syrian troops attacking the Christian Arabs in the beseiged Lebanese town of Zahle. The number of Soviet experts inside Lebanon is probably much higher. Reports from Lebanon monitored here, say that fighting erupted fiercely during the day after a fairly quiet night. The reports say that Syrian aircraft joined the artillery in pounding away at the town of Zahle. The Syrians have said publicly that their aim is to clear Zahle of all Christian Falangist militia fighters. The casualty toll in half a day for Zahle alone came to 30 wounded, many of them children, serious shortages of medicine, food, electricity, fuel and blood for transfusions have again been reported. A team of French volunteer physicians has arrived in Lebanon to help handle the wounded and the French Government has offered to send two ambulance planes to Lebanon to fly wounded back to France for treatment. The ruler of Kuwait in the Persian Gulf has offered to mediate between Syria and Lebanon, his offer has met with no response so far. </PARA>
<PARA>Many reports in today's newspapers must be equally alarming to honourable members as that A.M. report. That report mentioned-I believe it is clear-that the threat of escalating civil war is being used by those who wish to intervene and who have some purpose for intervening. It worries me greatly, when I become aware of the closer relationship between Syria and the Soviet Union, that it, with its very large force in the Lebanon, is the one that is threatening the lives of so many Lebanese people at this time. I will recount some of today's reports. In the Australian today it is reported:</PARA>
<PARA> The warning came against a background of increasing violence in Lebanon, where warring factions have increased the likelihood of a full-scale Syrian military takeover. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> In Zahle, Phalangist radio said Syrian MIG fighters buzzed the city while Syrian gunners pounded the town with tank fire, rockets, mortars and artillery. </PARA>
<PARA>In today's Melbourne Age we saw:</PARA>
<PARA> A blockade of the largely Christian city of Zahle, 50 kilometres east of Beirut, by troops and tanks of the Syrian Arab Deterrent Force today entered its sixth day. </PARA>
<PARA> Residents reported by telephone late last night that intermittent shelling and the sound of machinegun fire echoed through the blacked-out city in Lebanon's fertile Bekaa Plain. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite four ceasefire announcements, prospects appeared bleak for a truce between militiamen from the Right-wing Falangist Party and the Syrians. </PARA>
<PARA>It went on:</PARA>
<PARA> Lebanon's United Nations representative Mr Tueni said the country had reached the limits of survival and the sudden upsurge in violence had taken it closer than ever to partition. </PARA>
<PARA> He called for the 30,000-strong Syrian force to be replaced by a more diverse Arab peace-keeping body including UN troops 'within a comprehensive security plan that will allot an ever-growing role to Lebanon's own armed forces'. </PARA>
<PARA>This week we saw a report of the comments of the American Secretary of State. The report stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Haig urged all elements in Lebanon to show restraint and to lend their support to the Government of President Elias Sarkis. </PARA>
<PARA>It must concern all honourable members that since 1975-76 we have had a long-standing situation in which the Lebanon has lurched from a situation in which it had a very sound government, with a very sound structure and an adequate balance between Christian and Muslim interests, to a situation in which continued factionalism and the growth of militias has brought this country to a position very short of civil war. Yet one can only suspect, as I do, that it is the outside influences using the Lebanese people that has helped to create this problem. Part of our legacy in Lebanon at this stage is a huge refugee problem, not only the refugees who came as a result of the displacement of Palestinian people, but also the people who are now refugees in their own land, the Lebanese people-Muslim people in some areas and Christian people in others. Lebanon is occupied, in fact, by what is called a peace-keeping force. This is a force of some 30,000-strong Arab League troops, but principally Syrian forces. Some 6,000 members of the United Nations interim force have been in the Lebanon since 1978, in the south where there had been previously Israeli activities. </PARA>
<PARA> Efforts have been made in the Arab League to try to resolve this problem, to bring forward proposals which might help solve Lebanon's problems. To this point there seems to have been little in the way of efforts which might result in an acceptable solution to the different interests that are evident in the Lebanon itself. Towards the end of last year we saw a statement from President Carter. He called for an international conference under the aegis of the United Nations in which delegates from the United States, France, Israel and those Arab nations with an interest in the situation in the Lebanon should take part. In my view, there is a role for Australia in such discussions if they are initiated. I hope that Australia will take an active role in all international forums and will pursue the very well chosen remarks and calls for peace in that region uttered today in this House by the Minister for Foreign Affairs. All honourable members need to know that terrific hostilities have been taking place over a long period in the Lebanon. I am personally concerned at the extent to which there is an absence of reports in the Australian media. It is only when large numbers of people are killed that these matters seem to come to the fore in the Australian Press. I will give honourable members some idea of the numbers of people involved. In a paper prepared by the Legislative Research Service of the Parliamentary Library it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA> On 6 October, Lebanese police were reported to estimate that the victims of the fighting between Christian militia and Syrian troops had amounted to at least 1,000 dead and 1,700 wounded . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That was in a period of some six months. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA> A Spanish Red Cross official who visited Beirut went further, reporting in addition to this that 5,000 dwellings were destroyed and one half million persons displaced as a result of this fighting. </PARA>
<PARA>All honourable members would appreciate that in that situation, where such disastrous events are taking place, it was not at all surprising that a large delegation of Lebanese people was in Canberra today. The members of that delegation brought a submission to honourable members of the Government and honourable members of the Opposition, a submission which, again, spoke of the hostilities, but called for action on the part of Australians. They said in their statement:</PARA>
<PARA> We are abhorred and alarmed by the indiscriminate artillery bombardment of civilians, which this week left 300 people dead and 620 wounded in the Capital City Beirut and the central Lebanese city of Zahle. Since 1975, thousands of civilians have been killed by conflicts between parties, both internal and external, including the Syrian troops stationed in Lebanon as members of a peacekeeping force under the auspices of the Arab League. </PARA>
<PARA>They called for certain action on the part of this Government, on the part of the United Nations and on the part of the Arab League. The action they called for was in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA> 1-An immediate ceasefire agreement covering all of Lebanon. </PARA>
<PARA> 2-Cessation to the senseless killing and maiming of civilians, especially women and children, and the indiscriminate shelling of hospitals and public utilities. </PARA>
<PARA> 3-Removal of the Syrian peacekeeping forces, and their replacement by members of the Regular Lebanese Army and the United Nations Forces. </PARA>
<PARA> 4-To put an end to terrorist organizations operating in Lebanon. </PARA>
<PARA>Those objectives outlined in that statement from the Lebanese people, the delegation here in Canberra today, are well worthy of support. I was pleased, therefore, that at Question Time the Minister for Foreign Affairs responded to a question from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen). He had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government is deeply concerned by the recent outbreak of fighting in Lebanon, in the cities of Beirut and Zahle. The fighting appears to be the most severe to have taken place since 1978. The Government calls for an immediate ceasefire, and urges that all parties to the conflict commit themselves to negotiations leading towards a national reconciliation. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister went on to comment that this matter is one in which ultimately a solution should be found in Lebanon. It is necessary for the various interest groups in the Lebanon, including the Syrian and Israeli Governments as well as the Palestinians, to make efforts to avoid violence and to seek a solution. While Australia has a limited role, I believe that it has a significant role to play. There are very many Lebanese people and people of Lebanese descent living in Australia and those people have a real interest in what is happening in that part of the world. For that reason, I believe we have a real part to play in encouraging all nations of the world-in particular all participants in that part of the world-to come to a realistic solution, to call upon those external forces to stop involving themselves in the future of Lebanon and to play out their own games. </PARA>

<PARA> One of the strange traditions of this parliamentary system is the Governor-General's Speech, when, at the opening of each parliamentary session, the Governor-General comes into the Senate and mouths a speech that is written for him by the Prime Minister. On this occasion, when I saw Sir Zelman Cowen reading the speech I felt rather sorry for this man, who has done so much to restore dignity to the post that he now occupies, after the atrocities committed against democracy by his predecessor. It is now considered what it should be-a post of high respect. But I felt that the task that was given to the Governor-General by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in that speech was really insurmountable. If I may use the expression, the Governor-General was called upon to put a human face on liberalism. It is almost like putting a smile on a corpse, almost an impossibility. To see this decent, honest man, this man above question or reproach, having to mouth the hypocrisy, the cant, the hyperbole, the almost downright dishonesty of the Prime Minister's prepared speech, was something that almost made me sick. But it was not only what the Prime Minister had the Governor-General say that worried me. I was concerned also at what the Speech did not say. Search as I might through the Speech, I can find no reference to jobs for the boys. Strange to relate, since the last election three jobs have been found for the boys. </PARA>

Funnily enough, with this by-election on Saturday, no statement has yet been issued by the razor gang, the gang with which the Prime Minister has set about pruning Government policies, we believe, to the extent of $300m. It should have reported last week. A terribly funny thing-a sinister thing almost-is that the report has not yet been produced. I wonder whether that is because the by-election is on Saturday. I wonder whether the reason why the Premiers Conference has been postponed is so that the Prime Minister will not have to tell the Premiers the terrible news about the cuts in State funds. Is that because the by-election is on Saturday? I wonder whether he is terrified that the State Premiers would then have to reintroduce some State taxes to make up for the shortfall in Commonwealth funding. What an opportunity the people will have then to talk about the human face of Fraser liberalism. </PARA>
<PARA> Having referred to a quote that did not appear, I give now a few of the quotes that do appear. The first one I speak about concerns Aboriginal health. The Governor-General's Speech talks about the commitment to improve Aboriginal health standards. There were some very eloquent statements made in the last couple of weeks by Professor Fred Hollows, the head of the National Trachoma Eye Health Program. He was interviewed on the PM radio program one evening. Some of his remarks make very good listening. </PARA>
<PARA> We all know that Professor Fred Hollows recently received an Advance Australia award for his contribution to Aboriginal health. He has claimed:</PARA>
<PARA> That millions of dollars of taxpayers' money is being wasted by both State and Federal Aboriginal health authorities, particularly the Western Australian Government. </PARA>
<PARA>Professor Hollows has just completed a three-year treatment and study program across the Australian outback. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OD4">Mr JOHN BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He claims:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>that the misuse of funds by health authorities has meant that Aboriginal health problems are just as bad as they were 25 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA>In answer to the honourable member for Dundas, yes, I did read the report. I wish to quote some of the matters the Professor mentioned on PM. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> What is happening is that a lot of money is going into an expensive white bureaucracy that spends money that taxpayers think is going to alleviating Aboriginal health problems. Most of it is not going to where it should. Taxpayers' moneys from the Department of Aboriginal Affairs to the tune of $6 1/4m is spent on a big white health bureaucracy that is supposed to be providing primary and preventative care for Aboriginal people there. </PARA>
<PARA>The questioner asked him:</PARA>
<PARA> What is this money actually being spent on then?</PARA>
<PARA>The reply is very interesting:</PARA>
<PARA> It's spent on white nursing sisters, 4-wheel-drive motor cars, two-way radios, hospitals, clinics, audits, the Aborigines of Western Australia have been measured and counted and had their blood done and there's been millions spent on a service like that but it's not spent on the way World Health recommend monies to be spent. </PARA>
<PARA>He was then asked:</PARA>
<PARA> Why isn't the recommendations of the World Health Organisation in this area being followed? Is it a matter of ignorance, indifference or perhaps even worse, racism?</PARA>
<PARA>This is what he said:</PARA>
<PARA> It certainly looks very racist. There seems no Aborigine is employed by the Western Australian Health Department at any significant level. Aborigines do not get an opportunity to put an input into direction and policy making in Western Australia. Of recent years they've employed some up to 200 Aboriginal health workers at the most basic level in their service, whereas I know, and have personally met and received very good advice from, scores of Aborigines in Western Australia who could be part of direction giving and could stop this scandalous waste of money on Aboriginal health in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>So, there is one claim made in the Governor-General's Speech about how this Government was going to improve Aboriginal health and here is a man of Professor Hollows' eminence suggesting that Aboriginal health has not improved in 25 years. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area of government involvement very dear to my heart is the area of sport. I would like to quote the Government's claim in this respect in the Governor-General's Speech. The Governor-General said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . commitment to encourage excellence in a number of fields-for example, to provide greater support and improved facilities for research, to encourage the arts and to provide greater opportunity for young Australian athletes. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Deputy Speaker, I ask you to cast your mind back to the period last year when the sorry chapter of the Moscow Olympic Games raised its head in this Parliament. I do not think the Australian people need to be reminded of what this Government did, but I will remind them anyhow. It put enormous pressure on young Australian athletes not to go to the Moscow Olympic Games. All of this Government's retribution against Russia was placed in terms of a ban on the movement of our athletes to the Olympic Games. In the period of this Government's argument with Russia our trade with that country has quadrupled, yet the Government saw fit to try to prevent our athletes from going to Moscow. Fortunately, to the eternal credit of the Olympic movement in Australia, that did not happen and our athletes went to Moscow. But, in order to assuage public revulsion at the Government's move against those sportsmen, the Government decided to introduce suddenly-from nowhere-the Institute of Sport, which was to be the panacea for all sport in Australia. In the last week or two the truth has been revealed about this Institute, to the extent that the Canberra Times published an article under the headlines 'Doubts over the future of the Institute'. That article recounts how Don Talbot, the Director of the Institute who had been lured back from Canada where he had a very lucrative position as a swimming coach, is furious about the broken promise of providing sports facilities and giving the Institute priority use of existing facilities. Don Talbot is now in the situation of saying things like this:</PARA>
<PARA> If I was a gambler . . . I would not bet on the institute surviving . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The damn thing is only six months old. It was set up to paper over the cracks that appeared in the Australian Government's relationships with the sporting fraternity of Australia. It appears that it was a very shallow ploy to see that Australia's revulsion would disappear. It will not disappear. I do not intend to quote everything that has been said, but it appears that the Institute's budget to the end of the financial year in June is $1.1m. The Institute has budgeted for more than that next year-it has budgeted for $2.3m-but it gives the impression of not being over-optimistic about getting it. Don Talbot believes that the Government lacks a genuine commitment to the Institute and to sport in general, despite the high sounding phrases in the Governor-General's Speech. Since Mr Ellicott's departure for the Federal Court, no priority has been given to the Institute's development. Mr Talbot described the position as being in limbo. Sport just does not stop when a bureaucrat says so; it does not work like that. This is just another example, taken from the Governor-General's Speech, of the hypocrisy of this Government. Although I am against the tradition of a Governor-General's Speech, at least it gives us an opportunity to know in advance the sort of government with which we are dealing. </PARA>
<PARA> The other area I would like to speak about-this is also mentioned in the Governor-General's Speech-is the area of welfare benefits, and it comes under the heading of caring for people. What a contradiction in terms! Does any honourable member believe that this Government cares for people? Let me read to the House what the Governor-General was compelled to say in this respect. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> In what I have said about unemployment, youth and the economy, I have stressed my Government's concern with the human dimensions of the issues involved. It believes that the only legitimate yardstick for assessing any policy is not conformity to an ideology, not the strengthening of the state, but the effectiveness of that policy in enhancing the lives of people. This is the fundamental concern of my Government. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Deputy Speaker, let me refer you to a very pressing social policy. As you are the incumbent of the seat of Chifley, which is situated alongside my seat of Parramatta, you would know of the problems I face in Parramatta. Two hundred young people under 18 years of age live on the streets there. These young people are required to exist on the dole level of $36 per week which was provided in 1976. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Ruddock" NAMEID="0J4">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OD4">Mr JOHN BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have plenty of kids at home. I have five of my own. I think I am fulfilling my obligations there. The kids on the streets of Parramatta all fall into the same category. They are homeless, rejected, unloved, lacking family support, despairing and in most cases unemployable. But, given the pittance they are paid by this Government, is it any wonder that we are seeing the manifestations of this problem, even in the city of Parramatta? I refer to child prostitution, drug taking and youth alcoholism. These kids have become lost in a sea of hopelessness, despair and loneliness, and all this Government does is forecast that it will review the situation of those under 18 years of age. The Government plans to review the education, training and employment of school leavers. We know about reviews. We know of the practice of this Government of saying: 'It is only a review'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> How short and how frail does this Government think our memories are? We remember what the Government said in respect of Medibank. We remember the softening up of the community in order to implement its views on Medibank. In the first place the Government told us that Medibank was sacrosanct, that it would float some ideas about an alternative proposition and that it would carry out an economic examination. But then, as we all knew was inevitably the case, down came the hatchet and hundreds of thousands of Australians were disadvantaged. That is the track record of this Government and that is the only measuring stick we have to go on. That is precisely what is happening with those under 18 years of age. The Government talks about a review of the situation of this group. In this seemingly innocuous proposition the Government is merely asking people to examine a possible alternative. On the Government's track record we are perfectly entitled to assume that this is the first step towards removing whatever meagre dole exists at present for these defenceless kids of 16 and 17 years of age who are already suffering shamefully under this Government. The meagre support which they are given has diminished in real terms by over 40 per cent since 1976. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government decided that it would get kids back to work by attrition. By not increasing the dole over those five years it thought the kids would go back to work. I ask the Government to tell me where they can go back to work. Has the Government done anything about creating any jobs for them? Not at all. All the Government can do is institute a review to see whether it can cut out the meagre, miserly pittance that it is giving to these kids. There are 200 of these kids on the streets of Parramatta at this stage. At the present rate of progress, in another two years there will be 400 or 500 on the streets. What is the Government to do about them? What is it to do about this whole generation of young Australians who are lost in despair?</PARA>
<PARA> I will cut my remarks short because I know that the Government Whip is anxious to conclude this debate. But let me give the House one little quote which is contained right at the end of the Governor-General's Speech and which is the only thing of significance that I can find in the Speech. The Governor-General said:</PARA>
<PARA> I now leave you in the faith that Divine Providence will guide your deliberations and further the welfare of the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA>I hope to God he is right because there is no hope of any welfare for the Australian people under this Government. It will be only with the intervention of Divine Providence that there will be any hope for the Australian people. </PARA>

<PARA> That this House-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) expresses disappointment that, in 1981, public expenditure is estimated to increase in real terms by 3 per cent, and that receipts will be higher, as a percentage of GDP, than in any previous year, and</PARA>
<PARA> (2) is of the opinion that the Government should move quickly to substantially reduce the size and costs of the Federal bureaucracy, so as to allow a cut in personal income tax giving ordinary Australians greater incentive and more discretion over how their earnings are to be spent. </PARA>
<PARA>This motion spells out very clearly the greatest single challenge facing this Government at present. The motion contains the ingredients that should distinguish honourable members sitting opposite from those sitting on the Government benches. The alternatives of big or small government, more or less government regulation and increased or reduced levels of taxation separate the Liberal Party and its coalition partner from the Australian Labor Party-a party which obviously needs high levels of taxation and a heavy reliance on powerful interfering government to fulfil its socialist objectives. These differences must be emphasised by the present Government, not just in words but also in policies, decisions and actions. </PARA>
<PARA> It is now clear that the economy of this nation has improved significantly since the Fraser Government came to office in 1975. Most of the economic indicators now point to a strengthening of the economy in the early part of the decade of the 1980s. I warn the Government that it must not be complacent. It cannot afford to sit back and relax. It must now resolve to pursue its philosophy with greater vigour and determination than it has shown to date. I criticise the ad hoc nature of so many of the decisions that have been made over recent years. There has been a tendency to respond to pressure from vocal interest groups and to find the most expedient political solution. I believe that this is the wrong approach. Rather than respond to political pressures, the Government needs to re-examine and to understand its basic philosophy, and to respond to the needs of that philosophy. There is no point in a party's being in government unless it has a clear philosophy and some sense of political purpose or goal, and relentlessly and vigorously pursues that philosophy or goal. </PARA>
<PARA> I was very pleased to see that the Government, following the last election, established the so-called razor gang under the chairmanship of Sir Phillip Lynch, the Minister for Industry and Commerce. That Cabinet committee has had the task of examining the role of all the Commonwealth Government departments and the various organs and agencies of government. What a massive task that has been. The report of the razor gang gives a golden opportunity, perhaps never to be repeated and certainly not to be repeated in the foreseeable future, to loosen the grip of government and to rekindle the free enterprise spirit that can make this country as successful as any in the world. I trust that the Government will not allow itself to be pressured and to be overborne by the officialdom that surrounds it but that it will act with strength and courage to slash the size, the influence and the cost of the Federal bureaucracy. I believe that this is a reasonable option. It can be achieved if we have the courage and the will to do so. If we can get rid of the red tape, free up the system and take away the great burden borne by our taxpayers the sky will be the limit for our economy. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that with our immense energy and mineral resources we have the potential to become the strongest economy in the world. I can understand why what I am saying upsets honourable members opposite who are trying to interject. All we need is a truly free enterprise economy with an abundance of incentive and opportunity. </PARA>

If we do not cut the size of government, if we do not care about this issue and if we relax, the economic recovery that is clearly now under way will be placed at risk. The fat that undoubtedly surrounds essential and necessary organs of government must be slashed away now before it is too late. If this can be achieved we will save money and will then be able to provide for those in real need of community support. This is an important point. I am certainly not saying that those who are in real need should be ignored. Of course they must not be. It is a fundamental responsibility of government to provide a basic level of support for the less fortunate sections of our community. But if we can get rid of all the regulatory bodies and all the commissions, boards, councils and committees which serve no real purpose other than that of clogging up the system with useless red tape, we will be able to give more help to those who are in genuine need.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have 35 members of the House of Assembly, 19 members of Legislative Council, 10 senators and five members of the House of Representatives. That represents a grand total of 623 politicians for a population of 400,000, or one for every 642 Tasmanians. That is one reason why we need so much help in Tasmania. There is enormous pressure on governments to expand their operations and to spread their tentacles further and further. From my own ministerial experience I know that Ministers are expected by their colleagues, by commentators and by those close to government, to produce initiatives. They are expected to churn out new ideas, new programs, new legislation, and departments and authorities are judged in the same way. They must all justify their own existence. So we have this sausage machine with a broken stop button that cannot be switched off. Glossy reports, legislation, rules and regulations, new committees and other bodies, new programs and policies are oozing out all over the place. It is far easier to create some new, expensive initiative than it is to abolish some activity of government or rescind a piece of legislation. Once a single seed is germinated the weed quickly spreads.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I invite honourable members to consider the history of the Industrial Relations Bureau, the Prices Justification Tribunal and even the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, to name a few. That is probably burning my bridges. Ministers are defenders of their own departments and advocates for the programs they administer. I believe that these attitudes are all wrong, and attitudes are a large part of the problem with which we are now confronted. They must change if we are to get the size of government down. It must be understood that a Minister's first priority is to the government and to the community at large and that the responsibility to defend the interests of his department, if it exists at all, is secondary. There are signs that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Government are determined to do something about this major problem. If the razor gang lives up to its name government will be cut back and there will be scope for substantial tax relief. </PARA>

The legitimate family is the foundation of community life and should be given every possible encouragement. Much more concern must be shown for families. Families have been neglected especially the ordinary mother who stays at home working hard for the sake of her children. She cannot strike. She does not get dirt money, compensation or long service leave. It is time that governments-I use the plural again-forgot about some of the trendy social issues and directed more of their efforts to protecting and encouraging the Australian family, the housewife, the mother, the father and the children. We should not discourage Australians from having larger families. This country can support a much larger population and I believe that it makes sense for Australians to help build our population to its optimum level. I would like to see people encouraged, by the provision of financial support, to have more children. I ask the Government to give the benefit of any cut in the size and cost of government to Australian families. The Government should examine all of its economic and social policies which have an impact on the family and carefully study the benefits or disadvantages that they bring to family life.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have in mind such things as taxation policies, rebates and deductions, family allowances, social security pensions and allowances, education assistance, child care and employment schemes and policies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In addition, the Family Law Act should again be reviewed to determine its impact on family life. I doubt that it has been as beneficial as its original protagonists suggested it would be. Out of this examination, should be produced a national family policy which is directed towards: Firstly, providing adequate economic support for the family unit, especially while the family is supporting dependent children; secondly, encouraging child birth and larger families; thirdly, supporting the family unit during marital problems or other crises; fourthly, facilitating the role of the woman at home; and fifthly, placing special emphasis on the provision of adequate housing. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the Government's first priorities should be the provision of additional tax relief for the single income family, especially the couple with dependent children. I would like to see the dependent spouse rebate substantially increased. Alternatives that have been mentioned by various people include increased family allowances and income splitting for taxation purposes. If we managed to cut away wasteful expenditure, this would not wreck the Budget. The effect of such a step would be twofold. Firstly, it would provide much needed tax relief for the family battling along with children to support on a modest income. Secondly, because the tax relief would be means tested, it would also encourage married women to leave the work force and so provide increased job opportunities for young females. Presently, we have an absurd situation in which, in some cases, the mother is working while the daughter remains at home receiving unemployment benefit and doing the housework that her mother would normally have done. I do not deny that married women should have the opportunity to work but I also say that if they wish to remain at home to look after the home and the children they should be provided with suitable economic opportunities. Many married women want to work, and like to work, but I believe that many do so only because their economic circumstances require it of them. There is no doubt that the movement of females, especially married women, into the work force has had a major impact on the unemployment figures and has reduced job opportunities for young people. The startling fact is that one in four of the Australian work force is a married woman compared with one in 14 only a generation ago. If we can give greater support to the family unit and more incentive for the wife to remain at home, if she wishes, we could create a very large bank of jobs for our young people. </PARA>
<PARA> The young single person in regular work, the two-income family and, I suggest, even the average pensioner does not have as much trouble making ends meet as the single income family with young children trying to exist on a low or modest income. (Quorum formed). I repeat the point I was making that the young single person in regular work, the two-income family and, I suggest, even the average pensioner does not have as much trouble making ends meet as the single income family with young children trying to exist on a low or modest income. </PARA>
<PARA> People are not only upset by the amount of tax they pay but also clearly disillusioned with the present tax structure. I must express some disappointment that the Government has already announced that it will not now consider alternative methods of tax collection. The reason given is the possible effect on the consumer price index of any new indirect tax. It is a matter of disappointment that somehow the Commonwealth Statistician could not be persuaded to alter the nature of the CPI basket so that the CPI does not increase because of indirect taxes where offsetting cuts in personal tax occur. This may not be easy to achieve, but it should be possible.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. As Professor Russell Mathews said when addressing the Australian Institute of Political Science's Summer School in January 1980:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A tax system will only remain administratively feasible and politically acceptable if it meets the requirements of certainty and social justice. Neither of these conditions now holds. </PARA>
<PARA>The problem is that personal income tax has become largely a tax on wage and salary earners as other income groups, at both the upper and lower ends of the income scale, take steps to avoid or evade tax. I hope that the Government will take a further look at our tax structure to see whether changes might be made in the foreseeable future. As I said before, the work of Sir Phillip Lynch and the razor gang has given the Government a golden opportunity to be true to its philosophy and slash away the fat of government. This can be done without causing any harm to those people in the community in genuine need of help and support. When this is done it will give added momentum to the economic revival now under way. Here is an apportunity for the Government to avoid the wasteful expenditure of taxpayers' money, an opportunity to provide much needed tax relief, and an opportunity, in particular to give encouragement and support to Australian families. The Government must show that it has the courage to make tough decisions so vital to the future well-being of this nation. I ask honourable members to show where they stand on lower taxes and smaller government by supporting this motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The motion now before the House is a reflection of the fact that the Government has no legislation to bring before the House and so it is turning it into a talk shop. It is interesting to note that this is a precursor to the report of the razor gang, which was referred to in the speech of the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Groom), who moved the motion. It is very interesting indeed that this motion has been moved and seconded by honourable members from Tasmania-the most subsidised State and the State which would have the most to lose if the Government were really to hack into government expenditure. The two honourable members are selling their own areas down the drain by supporting a move for hacking away at public expenditure. If it is done in a fair and reasonable way, they have more to suffer than any other area of Australia. So the honourable members are selling out their electorates by moving and seconding this motion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The razor gang's report is of importance because, as I have said, it will come before the House in a few weeks and maybe even sooner than that. The razor gang consists of a group of Cabinet Ministers. It started off at about half a dozen of them and now includes the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony). The committee was given the task-after the election, of course; the matter was never mentioned before the election-of examining the means of reducing public expenditure. Apparently this body has been meeting quite often over the last few months. There have been various leaks and hints as to the recommendations which it is likely to give to the Government and which, presumably, will be adopted by the Government, particularly since the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister are now part of that group of Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA> The kinds of measures which we can expect are apparently the abolition of various regulatory bodies, such as the Prices Justification Tribunal and the Trade Practices Commission; the abolition of various government advisory bodies; further cuts in Public Service staff numbers by further reductions in the staff ceilings; the sale of government enterprises-we have seen already some moves towards the selling of Trans-Australia Airlines; and the transfer of various activities or services to the States-the prime example there appears to be in the area of health services with the Jamison report certainly giving some basis for that concern. A wide variety of expenditure cuts by this Government is possible; one could even say that it is likely. The motion moved tonight by the honourable member for Braddon sets the scene for such action. </PARA>
<PARA> The impact of previous cutbacks is something that should be looked at and borne in mind in considering further possible cutbacks in government expenditure. We have already seen five years of Fraser Government in which there have been continuing attempts to reduce the level of public expenditure. So we should look back at this time and see what impact those reductions in public expenditure have had. If we do that we will see that they have been substantial. They have involved the abolition of various programs introduced by the Labor Government, especially in the welfare field and the urban and regional development field. They have involved a reduction in the level of expenditure in many areas, especially in capital expenditure areas related to the social infrastructure, such as public housing, public transport, roads, schools and so on. Indeed, a frightening figure to contemplate is that the real level of government capital expenditure in 1979-80 was 10 per cent less than it was in the last year of the Labor Government. A 10 per cent reduction in the real level of government capital expenditure has been brought about by these cutbacks. That cutback in capital expenditure is concentrated in the areas of social infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been reductions in the number of public servants by the arbitrary-I stress, arbitrary-imposition of staff ceilings. Since 1975 the number of public servants under staff ceilings has been reduced by over 10,000, according to a speech made by the Prime Minister a week or two ago. These reductions have not occurred without cost. They have had a substantial impact on people in need. In the time available I cannot do more than point to a few examples. Let me give a couple of examples. The allocation this year for aged persons' accommodation is only 36 per cent in real terms of what it was in 1975-76. Let us look at welfare housing-a very important area. The allocation this year is only 47 per cent in real terms of what it was in the last year of the Labor Government. The allocation this year for Aboriginal health services is only 57 per cent of the 1975 figure in real terms. So in these areas, which are all areas of great importance to people in need, there have been dramatic cutbacks. </PARA>
<PARA> It is sickening that these areas were given in the Governor-General's address to Parliament last year as examples of the Government's caring for the people. It is a hell of a way to care for people to cut back so drastically in areas of undeniable need! There is no doubt that there have been cutbacks in government expenditure which have adversely affected people in real need. More generally, cutbacks in expenditure on the capital stock of our cities, our essential services and our transport systems have most effect on those on lower incomes, that is, those most in need. There is no doubt that the reductions in the staff ceilings have clearly caused increased inefficiency in various areas of the Public Service. For example, there have been various protest bans by Public Service unions as a result of the fact that inadequate staff are available to perform required functions. An example of that is the ban on the collection of various Commonwealth Employment Service statistics in Victoria for up to six months. </PARA>
<PARA> The Auditor-General's report, which came out only recently, contains numerous examples of situations where shortages of staff and other resources have led to inefficiencies in the Public Service. The staff shortages were said by the Auditor-General to have created problems in the Department of Finance, the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs, the Department of Administrative Services, the Department of Primary Industry, the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, the Department of Education, the Department of Health, the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Communications. The Auditor-General says that staff ceilings are causing problems in each of those areas by not enabling enough staff to be there to perform the allocated tasks of their departments. Slashing the number of public servants rather than promoting efficiency is quite clearly promoting in efficiency. If one establishes staff ceilings in a totally arbitrary way, if one in no way relates the reduction in staff to some change in the functions of a department, it is to be expected that one will get that kind of result. Perhaps this attack on public servants is to be expected from a Government that is severely prejudiced against the public sector as this Government most certainly is. Thus, the Treasurer (Mr Howard) has expressed his admiration for the thoughts and writing of a former United States Treasurer, William Simon. Apparently the Treasurer has read the book A Time for Truth, written by William Simon in 1978. In that book he states:</PARA>
<PARA> Bureaucrats should be assumed to be noxious, authoritarian parasites on society, with a tendency to augment their own size and power and to cultivate a parasitical clientele in all classes of society. </PARA>
<PARA>With those kinds of sentiments being approved by the Treasurer of this nation it is not surprising that we have this outright attack on the public sector, and on public servants in particular. It is interesting to note that along with this attack on the public sector the Fraser Government has failed, nevertheless, to reduce the size of the public sector. The total public expenditure as a proportion of the gross domestic product shows that the size of the public sector has not fallen under this Government despite all these attacks on it. It is strange but true and one finds it surprising in the light of what has happened that Malcolm Fraser presides over--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="1" SPEAKER="Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER" NAMEID="10000">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="10000">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER</NAME><NAME NAMEID="CI4">(Mr Millar)</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Order! The honourable member will refer to the Prime Minister as such.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The current Prime Minister presides over a larger public sector than the previous Prime Minister. That is the fact. The public sector outlay as a percentage of GDP in 1975-76 was 38 per cent, last year it was 38.1 per cent and the estimate on the Budget figures for this year is 38.5 per cent. During the three years of Labor the figure was 35.6 per cent but in the five years of the present Government it has been 38.6 per cent. Clearly, the public sector is bigger under the Fraser Government. That is partly because Commonwealth cuts in government expenditure have forced the States to increase their expenditures, so there has not been a total reduction in government expenditure to the extent one would have expected in some areas, and partly because cuts in government expenditure have reduced the overall rate of economic growth. With gross domestic product growth reduced, the government expenditure as a proportion of GDP does not decline as much as it would if there were a faster rate of growth of GDP. Honourable members should note the importance of government expenditure in regard to inducing economic growth. As mentioned in the motion put by the honourable member for Braddon, Government expenditure is estimated to rise by 3 per cent in real terms in 1981, after an election year when the Government allowed itself this aberration for political purposes. Professor Neville, of the University of New South Wales, has estimated that that 3 per cent real increase in public expenditure this year will add 1.5 per cent to the rate of growth of the non-farm gross product.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So, we have a 1.5 per cent increase in the growth rate attributable to this 3 per cent growth in public expenditure, which the honourable member for Braddon condemns. Ironically, presumably the Government will vote along with him tonight and will virtually condemn its own Budget. That will be a curious exercise. I look forward to seeing honourable members opposite all line up to vote on a motion that appears to condemn their own Budget, to deplore the 3 per cent increase in real government expenditure. More importantly, this is likely to add 1.5 per cent to non-farm gross product this year, according to Professor Neville, who is a real authority in these areas. Yet, the Government says: 'Isn't it great, our policies are working; there is an increased rate of economic growth'. As Professor Neville says, that is largely attributable to this increase in real public expenditure which the Government now deprecates and deplores. There is no logic at all for its position. Members of the Government want it both ways. They want to rejoice in the increased economic growth and deplore the increase in public expenditure which is partly the reason for that increased rate of economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA> Another point I wish to make relates to the neo-conservative anti-public sector ethic which lies behind this motion, this Government's economic policy and the policies of conservative governments all around the world. They are based on several alleged truths, the first of which is that the reduction of the public sector will increase the level of human freedom or liberty. This is held to be because public services are not decided by the market, but by government fiat, and the lower public sector will enable lower taxes and so more freedom to taxpayers to spend their own money. The mere fact that public goods are not provided by the market does not mean that they are less necessary than private goods. Indeed, it is quite the contrary. We can ask which is more necessary, schools or television sets. One is provided by the public sector and one by the private sector. Also, public goods and services are absolutely essential to the poor who otherwise would have to do without. The wealthy also can always afford to pay, so the abolition or a cutback in government expenditure is of less concern to the wealthy since they can afford to pay and, anyway, in many cases they do not use services such as state schools or public transport. </PARA>
<PARA> The argument of the freedom to spend one's own money is usually put in terms of the taxpayer, but what about the welfare recipients of all sorts and their dependants? What about their freedom which is associated with the income which they get from government welfare payments? That freedom and liberty which they get from that income is infinitely more important to them than some marginal change in taxation is to the welfare and liberty of a taxpayer. Therefore, it is extremely important to bear in mind that we are talking about liberty and freedom. We have to take into account the freedom and liberty of welfare recipients who are utterly dependent on the Government for the freedom which the minimal amount of income which this Government gives to them provides. If we move to take that away, as we have done in regard to unemployment benefits, the liberty and freedom of the unemployed will be reduced drastically. I dare the honourable member for Moore (Mr Hyde) to deny that point because it is absolutely undeniable that that is the case. It is crucial in terms of this pseudo argument which is put about liberty and freedom. The liberty and freedom of the people who depend on public expenditure is also tremendously important-indeed, it is more important than the liberty and freedom argument which is related to tax changes. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point I wish to make-unfortunately time is against me-is that the public sector is held to be bad because it reduces the market sector, which is held to be good, and by excessive regulation the public sector interferes with the free operation of the market. All this depends on a totally unreal view of the market, as though it is some centuries old market instead of the market of today which is not featured by a vast number of small units but instead is dominated by large companies, with oligopoly and monopoly being rampant, particularly in relation to transnational corporations. That fact alone undermines the whole monetary thesis which lies behind this Government's policies. In conclusion, I move:</PARA>
<PARA> That all words after 'House' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) noting (a) the damaging impact of Government cut-backs in public services on economic growth, the social infrastructure and on people in need, and (b) the inefficiences created in the Public Service by the Government's imposition of severe staff ceilings;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) condemns the damaging economic policies which have brought about these results and calls for the adoption of policies which will provide an adequate level of public services and staff and reallocation of public expenditure so as to ensure justice and equity in the use of public funds'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the motion of the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Groom). In doing so, I remind the House of the terms of that original motion. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That this House-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) expresses disappointment that, in 1981, public expenditure is estimated to increase in real terms by 3 per cent, and that receipts will be higher, as a percentage of GDP, than in any previous year, and</PARA>
<PARA> (2) is of the opinion that the Government should move quickly to substantially reduce the size and costs of the Federal bureaucracy, so as to allow a cut in personal income tax giving ordinary Australians greater incentive and more discretion over how their earnings are to be spent. </PARA>
<PARA>I am surprised to see that motion spoken to by the honourable member for Braddon. I support almost every word that the honourable member said in speaking to the motion. It is a new honourable member for Braddon, as he recently experienced a very considerable conversion, one that might be compared-so complete is it-with that of St Paul on the road to Damascus. </PARA>
<PARA> I read from the speech of the honourable member for Braddon, made only a few days ago. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I do not generally favour subsidies. As a true liberal I do not generally favour subsidies but there are always exceptions to that general rule. I have looked carefully at this decision of the Government-</PARA>
<PARA>I interpose that the decision was to subsidise Tasmania with $5m--</PARA>
<PARA>I believe in a critical way, and I have decided that it is right, because it is in the interest of the people that there should be a subsidy in this case. I made the same decision as far as Mount Lyell was concerned. </PARA>
<PARA>I point out that Mount Lyell is in the honourable member's electorate. However, I would not wish to belittle the conversion. I am very glad that, at long last, the honourable member for Braddon has seen the light that, in fact, one cannot have reduced taxes without reduced expenditure. Reduced expenditure will affect people like the honourable member for Braddon. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make some observations about the circumstances Australia is experiencing at the time this motion is being debated, firstly, in relation to large government. The last Federal Budget was, in real terms, the biggest in Australia's history. In the past five years there have been more regulating ordinances and very few have been repealed. At this juncture, let me welcome the Government's decisions in relation to the airlines and to express the hope fervently that it will see them through so that ultimately, having had all the appropriate inquiries and reaching a point where we have an appropriately informed Australian public, we can move to a deregulated airline system. In six years the Government has sold only one major enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as taxation is concerned, the last Federal Budget provided for the largest ever tax take of any Budget either in real terms or as a percentage of gross domestic product which, I suggest, makes nonsense of the recent words of the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis). The deficit is relevant to this motion since it always stands between taxes and expenditure. The Commonwealth deficit has been reduced during the time of the Fraser Government to $1,566m. This has been achieved partly by transferring the borrowing requirement to semi-government authorities such as Telecom Australia and to State and local government authorities. Nonetheless, there have been some real cuts. This has partly been achieved by increases in taxation, particularly in the oil levy. The limits in growth in the public sector have been entirely with the Commonwealth public sector so that the total public sector deficit, that is, the States, the Commonwealth and local government, is only a marginally smaller proportion of gross domestic product than it was in 1975. Clearly, the discipline of constraint or restraint has not been evenly shared between the arms of government. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to say something about the fiscal problem that Australia must consider very seriously tonight and face up to within the next few years. Oil revenues depend on the world price and are, therefore, unpredictable. The proportion of Australian production that will be classified as old oil and, therefore, be subject to the well head levy that yields considerable revenues to the Commonwealth coffers, will decrease. Under present rules, it is likely that real oil revenues have already peaked and by 1984 will be in a state of substantial decline. The income tax base is in difficulties. It is becoming increasingly difficult in spite of considerable efforts on the part of the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and his Department to collect the taxes that are duly and properly levied. I assure honourable members that it has not been for want of trying on the part of the Government that some of these taxes have not been collected. It is likely that, because of demographic changes, social welfare payments will continue to grow in real terms but will not growing rapidly until about the turn of the century. Commitments already made will ensure that defence expenditure continues to grow. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw the attention of the House to a matter that ought to be quite obvious, but is too often ignored in this place; that is, that the laws of arithmetic are not within the control of the Government. It is a sad fact that those laws are given and no amount of political rhetoric or the passage of legislation will remove them. We might as well face up to budgeting accepting the fact that they exist and will continue to exist. In other words, revenues must be raised either by taxes or by borrowing to cover expenditure and it is not possible to spend more and tax less without more borrowings. It is not possible to pretend that that simple fundamental which most of us learnt in second grade has suddenly disappeared because we have all become members of parliament. There are other arms of government that seem to have forgotten those simple laws of arithmetic. There are members of Parliament, the member for Braddon sometimes would be one of them--</PARA>

I would like to quote two short excerpts from the Governor-General's Speech. It reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My Government will give particular attention to encouraging the growth of the private sector and to increasing the freedom of choice of taxpayers in spending their own incomes.

Those are resources that are now not available to people who are genuinely poor. Home savings grants amount to $100m. Those home savings grants are directing capital formation in a country that forms more capital than the average Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development country, away from resource developments-so much so that some say we have a foreign ownership problem. It does not make economic sense. There is an amount of $100m from the Budget involved there. A minor one is the Australian Capital Territory sewerage and garbage grant. There is an amount of $5m for that. Why the devil should not the people in the Australian Capital Territory pay for the disposal of their own sewage and garbage?

It hardly makes economic sense and it is a waste of $30m. To quote an example where I am affected, I mention the fertiliser bounty of $51m. I advise honourable members that I am a wheat grower and I use a lot of fertiliser. There is no way that I should be subsidised to do so. It is a waste of public resources, and it is money that could be used for cutting taxes. The next is the export expansion grants in the sum of $200m. That amount tends to go to beef producers who are selling to quotaed markets, so not one additional tonne of beef can be sold. It also goes to cray fishermen, fishing from a controlled resource so that not one additional crayfish can be taken as a result of it. The petroleum freight subsidy of $123m flies completely in the face of the fuel parity pricing policy and causes extra petroleum to be used. That does not make sense. It is easy to find programs that could be cut. What it needs is political leadership and political will.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;How much hypocrisy there is on the other side of the House is indicated when one sees the kind of exchange that has taken place between the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Groom) and the honourable member for Moore (Mr Hyde). Here is a Government which claims that it has a philosophy written down in the Governor-General's Speech. Then the honourable member for Braddon comes in-it has taken him a while to get around to finally understanding what the Governor-General was on about-and shows that he has forgotten the pork barrelling that he was supporting only last week. It is quite extraordinary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The proposition of the honourable member for Moore-I want to talk about it in terms of the philosophy that he has been espousing-is essentially one that would propose a reduction in taxes and a commensurate reduction in public expenditure. This will supposedly-at least in terms of the Governor-General's Speech-increase initiative and help to boost the economy by enabling the private sector to invest in the most profitable areas of economic activity. Of course this kind of thinking is quite naive when one considers the reality of monopoly capital in the present age. The notion of an open economy is essentially a matter of arguing that justice is in the interests of the stronger. Few conservatives would admit that that is a proposition that they are about. But that indeed is what they really are about. </PARA>
<PARA> Why then cannot we reduce public expenditure? It is essentially because the free market system will not look after the people who cannot look after themselves or who in one way or another are the victims of that system. The extraordinary growth of the welfare state not only in Australia but also in every developed society is the product of an ever-growing list of needs that are not catered for within the capitalist system proper. They are not looked after because they are inherently unprofitable activities. </PARA>
<PARA> Tonight I take the example of health. There is no doubt that health expenditure is expanding in all Western countries. It is expanding more rapidly in countries which have retained private medicine or fee-for-service with a major role. The reasons for this expansion are complex, but in part they flow from the fact that the type of society we have created, or the type of society which is typified by Western industrial capitalist societies, is conducive, I would argue, to ill health. We have not sought to organise a society in a way which will maximise people's sense of health and well-being. Thus the causes of ill health are now deeply imbedded within the structure of society. I emphasise that point because the Government is spending a great deal of money on public relations campaigns in relation to health. I believe that those campaigns are a quite useless waste of public expenditure. This expenditure will do nothing to improve public health because health is essentially a matter of the way that society functions, the structure of society and the values which exist in that society. It is not a matter that can be influenced one way or the other by public relations campaigns. </PARA>
<PARA> There are several examples of the reasons why we have a great deal of ill health and therefore very large health bills in our society. I take for example the emphasis placed in our society on private mobility. This results, of course, not only in thousands of motor car deaths each year but also in countless injuries. It adds up to a massive health bill simply in terms of the physical accidents which result. But as well as the physical accidents that occur, in association with the value that we place on private mobility there is also the associated psychic stress. So a system which is organised in a way which is primarily determined to achieve private profits does not result in a rational transport system and it has associated with it enormous externalities which result in a quite massive health bill. </PARA>
<PARA> So, what is true of our methods of mobility or of our transport system is also true of the mode of production or the methods that we use to produce goods and services. Just as we do not choose the most rational methods of transport, so we choose forms and methods of production which are often inherently dangerous to people's health. This has been recognised in the level of industrial accidents and the massive sums of compensation which must be paid to enable people who have suffered serious industrial injuries to survive economically. This results in a massive cost which governments indirectly or directly are involved in meeting. </PARA>
<PARA> Much more is lost in terms of economic income-no-one from the other side of the House spoke about this-productivity and the costs associated with health. For example, last year as a result of industrial accidents, more was lost than in the last 10 or 15 years as a result of industrial strikes which is something that people on the other side of the House have an obsession about. Again one can take the example of indirect costs associated with industry and which, in a sense, are costs which are generated by the way that the private sector operates its business or by the way that industry operates in the private sector. But the effects of that activity, in terms of people's health, are generated within the community at large. I take as an example the problems of quite widespread pollution which may affect the Western suburbs of Melbourne and Sydney. The costs of that pollution are borne by the public sector which pays the health bills occasioned by respiratory diseases, cancer or whatever. That bill is then paid by the public sector, but that cost has really been generated by the way that the private sector organises its economic activity. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to another area which is associated with what I have just been alluding to, namely, the area of environmental health. One of the major problems of health-it is a problem not just simply of last year but of the twentieth century-is associated with the increase in the incidence of cancer, which has become a disease of the twentieth century. A great deal is said about the problem of cancer. A great deal of money is spent on it. Governments contribute enormous sums to research into or treatment of cancer as a disease. It is now being generally seen, I think, that up to 80 per cent or 90 per cent of cancers are formed or caused by environmental factors. It is also argued in the United States by the National Institute for Occupational Safety in Health-NIOSH-that up to 40 per cent of all cancers are induced by exposure to carcinogenic substances in a work place environment. In the post-war period this country and the United States have been through a revolution in the production of chemically-based pollution within the work situation and more generally within the environment. Despite that, we have taken no account of those costs in terms of national legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> We have no regulatory mechanisms. We have no equivalent of NIOSH. We have no equivalent of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration in the United States. We have not even begun the process of regulation in relation to environmental and occupational health in this country. That means that the costs associated with these diseases-I refer particularly to the costs associated with the disease of cancer-both in terms of human suffering and in terms of the health bill are borne by the public sector even though those costs are very often generated in terms of private sector activity; indeed, this is so in the overwhelming majority of cases. So, when a Government supporter introduces a motion such as the one before us which says that we ought to be cutting public expenditure, he is really saying that we ought not to be taking account of the consequences of private sector activity and the results of that activity in terms of public sector expenditure and welfare services. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that Western society is facing what might be termed a fiscal crisis of the state. More and more tasks are being transferred to the state simply because control within the private capitalist system would destroy the illusion of profitability-that is, the private capitalist system cannot operate, the monopoly capital cannot operate, at this point in its history without the state. Thus, one gets the situation where the public sector increasingly bears the costs while the private sector gets the profits. This situation is, of course, intolerable. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, we are moving to multiply the complexity of society so that people have less and less control over their lives. The growth of massive corporations which are often subject to the control of a single individual or at best an incestuous board requires countervailing power, which is provided in the form of a strong state and state regulations. But, of course, there are contradiction involved in this. People on this side of the House are well aware of that. Those contradictions cannot be dealt with unless people admit that we are dealing with a situation in which corporate power is increasingly concentrated. It is simply not good enough to go back and talk about eighteenth century economics as if there has not been a revolution, as if there has not been a concentration of economic power, as if multinationals do not exist, as if multinationals are not fundamentally dedicated to the maximisation of profits and are not dedicated at all to minimising the costs which they transfer to the community. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt whatsoever in my mind that what this Government represents is a coalition between the Government itself, the state and the monopoly sector. That is fundamentally the problem. If the Government were really committed to free enterprise, we could perhaps understand the honourable member for Moore and perhaps even the honourable member for Braddon. But this Government is not committed to private enterprise; it is committed to maintaining corporate power and, indeed, forms the closest of possible alliances with corporate power. We can see that in relation to the policies of this Government whereby it seeks not to enforce trade practices legislation which might introduce more competition and introduce more sense of the market-place but in fact moves, through the razor gang, to eliminate mechanisms such as the Trade Practices Commission which might introduce a degree of competition in society. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not true to say that honourable members on this side of the House are not concerned with maximising freedom, that they are not concerned with increasing the range of choices of the private individual. We are fundamentally committed to those things, but we believe that the only way that people can get freedom is if the society is prepared to take on in the strongest possible way entrenched corporate power and privilege. If the honourable member for Moore were interested in taking on corporate capital-I do not believe the honourable member is too interested in that; he is interested in coming in and giving us lectures but he is not really interested in taking on the major corporations of this country-we might be able to take him seriously. If his party were concerned about that we might be able to take it seriously. But the reality of his party is that it is opposed to regulations because it knows that that is what the corporate sector wants. It knows that the corporate sector would rather be gone with regulations because what regulations mean in this country, as regulations mean in the United States, is that there is at least some countervailing power and there is someone working to see that some of the costs that are generated by major companies-many of them are investing in this country in a very big way and we are not counting the costs-are taken account of and, if possible, are put back into the private sector.

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -First, I want to confess that I am an unashamed capitalist. That is in contradistinction to the honourable member for Batman (Mr Howe), who is an unashamed socialist. We may as well get that straight. I think we had better get a few other things straight. The period when economic power was far more concentrated in Australia was in the 1800s when we inherited a system that was working its way through into a more democratic system. We have now at last reached a stage where, through our democratic system, we have the means of freeing up markets and allowing people greater freedom. Individuals in our society, given that governments will allow them to, can have economic freedom and therefore personal freedom because of the basic level of affluence that spreads right across the economy. When did Australia run into trouble in recent history? We ran into trouble during the Depression in the 1930s. We ran into trouble for one reason only. It was because the then government wanted to interfere and regulate and not to let a nasty coincidence of events work itself through. If honourable members opposite do not believe that; why do they not read what Jack Lang had to say? After all, he was a member of the Australian Labor Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We ran into another nasty set of events in the 1970s when basically a similar thing happened with one additional impingement by government. Not only did governments interfere more and more and regulate more and more in the early 1970s but also governments grew more and more. Tonight we are talking basically about the size of government. Governments, through their size, tend to interfere and tend to regulate. If I get a chance I propose to talk briefly about those two aspects. We are here to talk about the size of government. Generally, by that we mean the amount of money that the Government takes from us and then in its great wisdom located here in Canberra, it decides who will get that money and how it will be spent. Of course, the Government knows better than we do about how we should allocate our resources. The honourable member for Batman talked about market failure. Market failure will always occur in this country when we have a market system. The public should not think for one minute that the onle area in which market failure occurs is in private enterprise. It occurs in the government. Have honourable members not heard about government corporations making massive losses? Is not that market failure? Have not governments had programs with corporations that have had difficulties and have not been able to cope as well as other people who can make better free choices? The honourable member for Batman talked about all these wonderful concepts and the victims of market systems. In systems, such as the true social system in Russia, everybody is a victim of the system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would just like to point out that Russia calls itself a socialist system. I take its word for that. The honourable member for Batman talked about the concept of big capital monopoly. I do not quite understand that. All I can say is that in those countries where the Government is biggest, the biggest capital monopoly applies. This Government is the biggest capital monopoliser in this country or in any other country. The bigger the government the bigger that capital monopoly will be. In fact, of all these nasty companies which the honourable member for Batman would like to tear down-I noticed earlier in the debate today that he was not too anxious to tear down companies which had to face some pretty severe facts on the Rundle shale oil deposit even though one of them was a multinational-it is always the companies that provide the jobs for people in this country. He ought to realise that in our sort of system the companies are controlled by myriad people who go along and invest in shares. Whether they do that through a stockbroker-I must say that not enough people do that in Australia-whether they do it through a savings bank account as a loan to a company, or whether they do it through a deposit with an insurance company which in turn will invest in another company, does not matter. (Quorum formed). I hope that the few additional Labor members who have come into the House will stay and listen as they might learn something. I was talking about the size of government. I will leave aside for a moment what was said by the honourable member for Batman. At present the size of government, which I imagine is best measured by the size of government expenditures for reasons that are fairly obvious, is round about 28 per cent of Australia's gross domestic product.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Braddon (Mr Groom) suggested, firstly, that it has been increasing too quickly, although he referred to the revenue side more than the expenditure side; and, he also suggested that we ought to look for means of cutting it back. At a level of 28 per cent this means that we leave-by my arithmetic-only 72 per cent for other people to control. We have to ask ourselves, without looking at the efficiency with which that money will be spent by government, whether already we are crowding out the more productive sectors of the economy. Should we bring it down to 25 per cent, 20 per cent or 15 per cent? Perhaps in all fairness we should go the Swedish way and have it at a level of 53 per cent. I completely agree with what the honourable member for Braddon has had to say. The 28 per cent level is far enough. </PARA>
<PARA> In the past few years there has been an alarming coincidence between the increase in government expenditures and the increase in unemployment, the size of the deficit, interest rates, and a number of other economic factors. It may be that they are not all interconnected but it just seems to me that a level of 28 per cent is far enough. I put this proposition to the honourable member for Braddon: One of the options that we have if we are not going to have a discontinuous arrangement, a very severe cutting back which can throw a number of things out of kilter, is for us to say that we will hold the real money level at the same level. By that process, over a period of increased productivity that that very decision will help, we will have a cutback in the percentage of expenditures going to government. On my assessment an amount of 28 per cent going to government spending, and also, on the other side, going to government through taxes or through government borrowings is going far enough. I hope that we can get that figure down. </PARA>
<PARA> The crowding out effect has been rather severe in recent years. We have notices that people, who want access to capital that has been traditionally available, have found that it is just not there at times such as the situation we are facing at present when the Opposition is saying that Australians ought to invest more. If the Government were taking 28 per cent and leaving 72 per cent for other people we would be in a worse position in relation to finding the money with which to invest in our resources in Australia than we would be if the Government spent, say, 25 per cent and left other people to spend 75 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> When one talks about the size of government, in what way could Government better employ our money, apart from doing basic things such as providing a defence force and a social security system that looks after the really needy people? What else can government do? Can government supply information required in a system such as ours more efficiently than that supplied by the private sector? Can government provide economies of scale that other sectors sometimes are looking for in order to be able to produce cheaper goods? Can government really provide a higher level of management or better managers than the fellow who grows up in a small business, who battles his way through crises and who, at the end of the day, finds that he has something to offer; the practical man, the practical tradesman or the practical professional man? Can the Government really provide management services as well as that? Can the Government encourage better effort?</PARA>
<PARA> Does the government work as hard as the man in the work force? Can the government really guarantee that the men and women it employs will work as hard as people in the private sector who have different incentives and different bonus schemes? Let us consider an organisation such as Telecom Australia which, at a management level, is really trying to crack down on inefficiency. Do people in the constituencies of honourable members ever complain that the people working for Telecom do not seem to work as hard as they do? Maybe honourable members opposite live in a different part of the world. Do the people ever complain to honourable members opposite that people working on the councils do not work as hard as they should? They complain to me. I contend that the fellow who has a small business or the fellow with a big business who wants to make a profit so that he can feed his kids or pay a dividend so that other people can feed their kids will work a little harder and use more ingenuity. When the Government takes over our resources and says that it can manage them it reduces the basic efficiency of the country. If honourable members want to see that statement borne out-I say this without any reflection on the honourable member for Batman-they should look at the Soviet Union. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us say that the level of 28 per cent is far enough. In real terms we are talking about an expenditure of $36 billion this year. I admit that there are areas in which there could be a reallocation of priorities. This was raised earlier by the honourable member for Moore (Mr Hyde). It is essential that we as a government reallocate expenditure on social security to those in greatest need. There are a number of groups in our community-people come to talk to me about this-to which, frankly, not enough of the social welfare dollar is going. At the same time, people who do not require benefits are picking them up. We should look not only at the size of government but also at a reallocation of government expenditure. In that sense the razor gang is doing a very good job. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us also consider a reallocation of government priorities in considering how the $36 billion should be spent. We should not prop up industries that do not deserve to survive. We should allow other industries to burgeon. There are plenty of industries in this country that will survive far better if the Government reallocates its priorities, even within its present spending program. I point out that we are not suggesting, as the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) contended, a reallocation towards the wealthy. Whenever the Government cuts taxes members of the Opposition always say, 'How much will Malcolm Fraser get?', or something like that. It is absolutely ridiculous. The general direction of the tax cuts which this Government has brought about has been towards people on lower incomes. The record is there. Of course, some people already pay a disproportionate amount of tax. (Extension of time granted). It is very gracious of the Opposition to allow me an extension of time. It shows that the spirit of tolerance which the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) mentioned during a condolence motion the other day really does exist. If I am speaking and the Opposition wants to listen there must be tolerance. </PARA>
<PARA> I have dealt very briefly with the financial aspects of the size of government. I could say a lot more. It would probably be appropriate, especially so soon after an election when the people of Australia clearly told the Government that they wanted less money dragged out of their pockets, to talk about specific programs, as the honourable member for Moore did, but I do not propose to do that. I prefer to mention briefly other areas where the very size of government helps to foul up the economy. The first is basic interference in the market. We have had a tendency in this country to allow governments to get involved in corporations that could be better run by private enterprise. Sometimes it appears that this has happened for legitimate reasons. When Trans-Australia Airlines was set up in the late 1940s it was seen as a short term measure-that is exactly what the then Prime Minister said-to try to provide for the Australian people a service that may not have been offered otherwise. But where does TAA fit into the market at the moment? Is it there merely because the Government wants to perpetuate a governmemnt instrumentality or is it there genuinely so that the consumers of Australia can have cheaper air fares and more services? As the next few months go by I think the Australian people will be clearly convinced that the continuing existence of TAA militants against their best interests. Is Qantas Airways Ltd interfering in the market? Perhaps it is not. Perhaps if we did not have Qantas we would not have any other international carrier and our sacred international obligations would be seen to be abrogated. I doubt it. I suspect that if Qantas were not run by the Government other people in Australia would apply for licences to fly people overseas. Perhaps then people would fly on time as distinct from the situation in which a number of us were caught recently. </PARA>
<PARA> Other instances of interference in the market place are numerous. Australia Post should justify its action in keeping people from providing basic courier services. The argument involves economies of scale. If people in the community want to employ others to fill in gaps and provide services which are slightly more innovative than those which already exist, why do we not let them? Why do we let the Government monopolise any area? The honourable member for Batman talked about monopolies. Why let the Government monopolise areas when individuals are quite willing to do the jobs? As I said, they would probably do them with more effort, better management and a better flow of innovation. There are a number of areas in which the Government interferes in the market system and which it ought to get out of. A further point relating to the size of government concerns government regulation. This impinges on the basic philosophy of the Government parties. </PARA>

If we do not believe in that philosophy we will inexorably move in the direction of monopolies. Regulations interfere with individuals and, at the same time, they reduce freedom. I will be very pleased when the Prices Justification Tribunal is disbanded, I hope in the next couple of months. I will be very pleased when the Government interferes less than it does now in the interest rate and exchange rate structures. I will be very pleased when the Federal Government ceases overlapping in areas which the States, by the Constitution of this country, properly administer. I will be very pleased-this is a very topical issue-when the Government stops interfering in specific areas such as air fares and the pricing of commodity exports when the prices are being determined on the true world market.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A large number of Government members agree with all the things I have said. Thankfully, that is the way we are heading. The Government makes regulations only to guarantee freedoms and not to take them away. The basis of such Acts as the Trade Practices Act fits in very closely with my ideals. I will not run away from those ideals. The motion moved by the honourable member for Braddon, which I commend, referred to two things. These are the concepts that matter. The first is greater incentive. In our system that means greater production and, therefore, greater affluence and a better life for those in need. Secondly, the motion called for more discretion. Those words, by their very definition, mean greater freedom. Tonight we are talking about less government in order to bring about better production and greater freedom. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the amendment that has been moved by my colleague, the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis), and reject the motion of the restriction of public expenditure contained in the motion moved by the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Groom). I find it extraordinary that such a motion should have been put to the House by an honourable member from Tasmania. The honourable member for Braddon will know as well as I do that if the Federal Government moves quickly to reduce substantially the size and cost of the federal bureaucracy, the first State that will suffer will be Tasmania. If this is what the honourable member for Braddon wants for Tasmania, so be it, but it is not what we on this side seek for Tasmanians or for anyone else who lives in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is actually interesting to see this motion brought on for debate today, following the promise yesterday by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) to seek to cut taxes before the next election-not that many people have much faith any more in the Prime Minister's promises. Experience has taught us not to become too excited in that regard. This debate is linked also with the address given yesterday by the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (Mr Wilson), in which he urged families to do more for themselves and not to rely on government. The message coming through loud and clear is that this Government is about to opt out of many areas of responsibility, most likely the welfare areas, in which it has always been a reluctant partner. The message from the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment about 'allowing ordinary Australians greater incentive and more direction over how their earnings are to be spent' has a very hollow ring when one considers how many people are dependent on unemployment benefit, with little or no hope of gaining employment in the foreseeable future and very little earnings to have any control over at all. </PARA>
<PARA> The tens of thousands of Australians, including Tasmanians, who live well below the poverty line, will get no joy from the terms of this motion. I would imagine that the pensioners and the unemployed in Tasmania will wonder just who the honourable member for Braddon is representing if his Government intends to pull back on public spending. The Prime Minister's remarks were very enlightening. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Small and limited government bears no relationship to mean, ungenerous government. In social security, for example, the Government remains absolutely committed to making sure that support and assistance will be available to those who need it. </PARA>
<PARA>They are fine words but are not followed by fine deeds. We are all familiar with the distress that has been caused over past months by the application of extremely strict guidelines by the Department of Social Security in assessing eligibility for invalid pensions. The number of invalid pensions granted in the last 12 months has dropped considerably and, as well, many people who have received the invalid pension have been knocked off it. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HF4">Mrs CHILD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member must get special treatment over there, with his pork barrelling. Parliament has frequently been told that there has been no change in the pension guidelines. Nevertheless, most members of Parliament-except the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Goodluck)-most welfare workers, the Australian Council of Social Service, the Combined Pensioners' Association of Australia and the Australian Quadriplegic Association, have provided concrete evidence that changes have been made and have directly disadvantaged people who are dependent on social security payments. A backlog of 1,000 invalid pension appeals is still in the pipeline and, with the lack of staff due to this Government's policy of small government and economy, Social Security Appeals Tribunals will take more than a year to catch up. The waiting compounds the anxiety of invalid pensioners and makes a mockery of the Prime Minister's words, 'My Government gives to the elderly, the sick and the disabled'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If public expenditure is further reduced, as is advocated by the honourable member for Braddon, the elderly, the sick and the disabled will be the first to suffer, and those who are in Tasmania will suffer along with the rest of us on the mainland. If this is what the honourable member is advocating, so be it. For some days this House has been denuded of legislation to debate while the Prime Minister and his advisers have been trying to make up their minds on what they intend to do about health, unemployment benefits and various other areas of policy. </PARA>
<PARA> This motion is a kite flying exercise by the Government to try the carrot-before-the-donkey trick in the form of reduced taxes, coupled with a veiled insinuation that we would all have more money if those who lived on social security and unemployment benefit did more to help themselves. This is a great platform that the conservatives have and one of which we should beware. They divide the poor into the genuine and the loafers. They do not say it as openly as that, but the implication is quite clear. The Minister for Home Affairs and Environment stated that if health users, apart from the poor and needy, were to pay more, governments would pay less. The Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar) says that the user should pay. Who is to identify the genuine poor and needy? If this Government's strict guidelines are used, not many will qualify. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, what a message to give forth: 'Reduce the taxes' says the Prime Minister. The Minister for Home Affairs and Environment then says: 'But you'll pay more for health care'. It is just another Hobson's choice. The Government is saying, 'We will give you a tax rebate on one hand while we rip you off on the other.' Tasmanians beware; if this motion is passed, you will be paying more for health care and for education. The Government appears certain to pass back to the States all responsibility for health care, and that will spell disaster for State public hospitals and community health centres in particular. It will not just spell disaster for those in my electorate but also for those in the electorates of Braddon and Franklin. Tasmania does not have the capacity to promote its own public hospitals and health centres. Perhaps they will take the advice of some Government Ministers and tell the States to raise their own taxes. Perhaps then there will be a health tax in Tasmania too or double income taxation. After all, the States have been given the right to raise their own taxes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Home Affairs and Environment did his bit in his address in Canberra yesterday by floating the idea of a common pension age for men and women. No doubt he had read the report in the recommendation of the Australian Industries Development Association that women should not qualify for a pension until they reach the age of 65 years. This is supposed to save the Government $400m over four years. What it will do to the women, nobody says or cares. No doubt this idea will appeal to the razor gang. I doubt that it will appeal to the women of Tasmania who are approaching the age of 60 years. It would be fair and equal to have a common pensionable age but, bearing in mind the state of unemployment in this country, it would be better to make the common age 60 years and to give men a go-give them a chance to retire early and some of the young unemployed a chance to get a job. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to refer now to the proposal of the Government to restrict the unemployment benefit paid to people under the age of 18 years. Apparently Government supporters believe that such people are best cared for by their families. We on this side of the chamber believe that the unemployed are already carrying an unjust share of the burden of this Government's policies. The Government has blamed everyone in sight for unemployment. First it blamed the trade unions and then the Labor Government, six years after it went out of office. The families of the unemployed have been attacked for not supporting their children. The education system has been attacked for not educating those who are unemployed but, in the main, the unemployed themselves have been criticised for not going out and finding a job. Nobody seems to notice that there are not enough jobs to go round. </PARA>
<PARA> Now we get the warning, which I imagine will be followed by legislation-if the Government ever brings any legislation into this House again-that the out-of-work 16 and 17 year-olds are not only to be blamed for their own plight but also are to be punished for being unable to find work by no longer being paid unemployment benefit. I remind the honourable member for Braddon that if he wants to save public money and reduce public spending, the unemployed in Tasmania-in his electorate and other electorates-will suffer along with the rest of us. This Government is not a job creator. It is a job eliminator. It is about to take a carving knife to its own Public Service. It is taking a carving knife to just about every area of welfare. </PARA>

He put forward a point of view in lieu of some of the controversy and antagonism that has been directed against Tasmanians all this week. He stood up to everybody because some of them were saying that a state of hypocrisy existed. We were alleged to have asked for $5m. We did not ask for the $5m; we received it because people realised what the situation was. Surely the people who have a little common sense realise that Tasmania is isolated. Air travel is the only way in which one can get from point A to point B. One cannot get to Tasmania by motor car, canoe or by swimming. We need the Empress of Tasmania and the Empress of Australia to get from point A to point B. The honourable member for Hume wanted Tasmania to support the Government. He wanted five members up here to assist the Government to fight for the things that we want, such as the free enterprise system, and not a socialist system. He wants us as much as we want him. That is the reason we should stay together and not criticise each other when we achieve something which will be beneficial to the people of Tasmania. That is all we wanted to do from the outset. We do not want all this criticism that we receive each time we win or gain something.</PARA></TALK.START>

I hope that the Government will move consistently towards the aim of reducing taxation to assist the families of Australia and, I hope, keep some of the women home to look after their children. Then we might not need to direct some of the money that is directed at child welfare clinics, other clinics and so forth. If we can do that, the fabric of the family will be stronger and Australia will be a better place to live in. I agree with the honourable member for Braddon. We will fight for that aim. </PARA>

They are the people whom the honourable members are trying to put out of work. They are the people who will create a further pool of unemployed. They are the people who, once they are put out of work, will no longer go to the shop and the shop will no longer go to the factory or the warehouse. This will create further unemployment, not only in the public sector but also in the private sector. The people of Tasmania should be ashamed of those two honourable members. The people of Tasmania have been hoodwinked by them since 1975. All the honourable member for Franklin did tonight was argue about the fight he is having with the National Country Party. The split between the National Country Party and the Liberal Party in Tasmania is all he spoke about tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously neither Representative Groom nor Representative Goodluck understands that the public sector of the economy is the greatest purchaser of goods and services from the private sector and that when one reduces the size of the public sector one creates unemployment not only in the public sector but also in the private sector. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Hindmarsh has just said, it is simple economics, but I would not expect those two honourable members to understand that. I must sympathise with the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in his dismissal of the honourable member for Braddon from the Ministry. Obviously this occurred because of the honourable member's lack of understanding of these simple economic principles. We should always remember that when the public sector no longer goes to the factory this means less employment in the private sector as government is the biggest buyer from the private sector. This is a principle which has not been learned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Added to that, the honourable members opposite should remember that even the infamous Milton Friedman, the arch monetarist of the past who is in Canberra at the moment, the man who sold his monetarist policies to the United States Government, the United Kingdom Government and this Government, is now, as we will see from his comments in the Press only this morning, trying to get away from those monetarist policies and into the middle ground so that he will not be blamed for the economic wreckage that he has caused, the massive unemployment, the world-wide recession, and the world-wide misery that he has created. Milton Friedman, the arch monetarist-the proposition before us tonight is another monetarist proposition-is trying to get away from those policies and back into the middle ground. He realises in terms of history that he will be blamed for many of these policies. I shall quote from the Australian Financial Review-surely not a radical organisation-of today. The headline in that newspaper states 'P.S. Ceilings Blamed for Losses: Govt misses out'. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> Federal Public Service staff ceilings have been identified in the latest Auditor-General's report as the cause of millions of dollars of lost Government revenue. </PARA>
<PARA>I will not go into that matter in great detail. Anybody can read the article in today's Australian Financial Review. It is there to be seen. The facts are that what this Government has been doing to staff ceilings in the Public Service--</PARA>

Naturally, I will not name the man. He retired at the first opportunity he got-at the age of 60 about six months ago-because he was fed up with the game. He was a top man in the Public Service. The Christmas before last, he said: 'John, it will take many years to restore the efficiency of the Public Service because of the Government's policies on staff ceilings'. He explained it very simply. First of all, there is a 2 per cent cut, so they all work a bit harder. Then there is another cut and they continue to work harder.

For example, Mr Deputy Speaker, you will know as well as I do that the reason we have been through the most boring session of Parliament that we have seen for many a day is that the Government, or Cabinet, has been making decisions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In an address to the South Australian State Council of the Liberal Party of Australia on 5 December last year, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As its name implies, ours is a liberal Government holding liberal principles. It believes, that is, that to the maximum extent compatible with a cohesive and stable society, people should be free to make their own decisions concerning their lives and the disposal of their own resources. It believes that society is healthier and the lives of people happier when responsibility, enterprise and power are spread widely through the community, rather than concentrated in one or a few places. That is the ideal to be aimed for and any deviation from it requires special justification. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is concerned to maximise the degree to which people have control over their own lives and their own resources, to ensure that it is their choices which are decisive, not those of politicians, of bureaucrats or union officials or corporations. </PARA>
<PARA> To this end the Government is concerned to limit the role and reduce the power of the State, and as part of that to restrain taxes and to contain public expenditure. The State must remain the servant, not the master, of the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA>I am here tonight to support wholeheartedly that statement by the Prime Minister. I want to say a few words in support of exactly that proposition. One of the major problems that the federalism policy of this Government faces is that we increased the amount of money going to the States but maintained a share of the funding of the functions at a Commonwealth level. The only way that federalism can work effectively is if the total function and the total funding is transferred to the States. There is a large number of areas in which this should be done. Education, health, housing and transport are probably the most significant. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Education should be abolished. Those functions which refer to the Australian Capital Territory should be transferred to the Australian Capital Territory. The universities commission should be transferred to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet or some other department, and I can see no reason why the rest of the functions of the Department of Education could not be transferred to the States. The Department of Health has a number of important functions, including quarantine, which obviously must be maintained at a Commonwealth level. However, the Department of Health certainly carries on a large range of functions which are duplications of activities carried on by the States. Perhaps the main area of that involves the hospital cost sharing and benefits scheme and a range of similar functions that are duplications of State activities. They should be removed from Commonwealth control and passed back to the States as soon as possible. The community health program and the school dental scheme should similarly be passed back to the States. The pharmaceutical benefits scheme should be thoroughly overhauled so that benefits are not paid on anything other than essential drugs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Housing and Construction, as such, should be abolished. The entire welfare housing program and the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement should be returned to the States. The Department of Construction, probably in the form that existed in years gone by, should be re-established as a separate department with responsibility for those technical and practical matters which now come under the responsibility of the existing Department of Housing and Construction. The principal expenditure items are the welfare housing program, which involves $140m, the rental housing program which costs $110m and the Home Savings Grants Scheme which has cost $100m. There is no necessity for any of these policies to be carried out by the Federal Government; all should be either abolished or returned to the States. This would represent a saving of almost $350m in one department. The Defence Service Homes Scheme also cost over $40m. This Department employs over 11,000 people of whom almost 5,000 are described as being industrial or day labour. It seems absurd that the Commonwealth needs to maintain a day labour force of this size. These people should be replaced by contractors when the need arises. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously the civil aviation and sea transport functions of the Department of Transport must be maintained by the Commonwealth; however, there is no need for the level of duplication between the Commonwealth and the States in the area of road administration and funding. We should refer to the old Department of Civil Aviation concept and take account of our constitutional responsibilities in relation to shipping. In regard to roads, I would favour a system where national highways are funded totally by the Commonwealth, State roads are funded by State governments and local government roads are funded by local governments, with an amount equivalent to what is presently being spent on local roads added to their share of revenue, which would involve an addition to the 2 per cent of income tax revenue that they now get. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Veterans' Affairs employs approximately 13,000 people. By comparison, the Department of Social Security employs approximately the same number. The extent of the bureaucracy in the Department of Veterans' Affairs must be horrific. If we compare either the amount of money administered or the number of clients of each department, then the productivity of the Department of Social Security makes the productivity of the Department of Veterans' Affairs seem horrible. The Department of Veterans' Affairs ought to be abolished and its functions taken over by the Department of Social Security. The claim of the Returned Services League that we should have a separate department with its own Minister must be considered but if the choice is between better administration and higher taxes, then the RSL should be made to believe that higher taxes are not an option. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Employment and Youth Affairs is a unique department in that it administers virtually no legislation. The only Act of any importance administered by that Department is the Commonwealth Employment Service Act. This Department would appear to be a classic example of bureaucracy gone mad. I am not aware of any other function of the Department, apart from the Commonwealth Employment Service, that has made any impact on this government. The export expansion grants program should be phased out as soon as possible. It is the sort of program which should be introduced once every 10 or 15 years for a limited period simply to draw attention to the fact that export opportunities are available and to encourage people to take advantage of them. It should not be a long term ongoing program. It has achieved its impact over the last couple of years. It is also obvious that Australia is not in export difficulties. Although we should try to maximise our exports, the reality is that we have no necessity at this stage to encourage exports by this sort of expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> Similar comments apply to the investment allowance. It should certainly not be extended beyond 1982 when it is to terminate. The Independent and Multicultural Broadcasting Corporation should be placed on a strict performance and results basis. If it does not obtain a certain percentage of the listening audience by a particular date, it should be scrapped. The whole social security system should be overhauled to ensure that payments are made on a basis of need. The principle of social security payments should be to assist those who, for reasons beyond their own control, are unable to care for themselves. All social security benefits should be subject to a means test and the family allowance should be included in this category. The children's services program which includes pre-schools and costs something over $36m per annum should be returned to the States. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, if one removes a function or a program from a department, Parkinson's law will ensure that little real saving is made. If one abolishes a whole department, the saving is total. The impact on the Australian Public Service and on Australia as a whole would be remarkable if the Government were prepared to bite the bullet and abolish three or four or more of the existing departments of state. Obviously essential functions would be transferred to other remaining departments, but the bulk of the activities of the departments concerned would be transferred to the States. The Government needs to take a bold step such as this if it is ever to reverse the ever-encroaching spread of bureaucracy. If the public can be educated to the extent that it is made to understand that new taxes or higher taxes can be avoided if administrative changes are made, I have no doubt that the sorts of propositions I am speaking about can be handled successfully. It is simply a matter of choice which must be put to the community. </PARA>
<PARA> The Constitution makes interesting reading. Part V, which lists the powers of the Federal Parliament, shows that the main functions intended for the Federal Government include trade, taxation, post and telecommunications, defence, quarantine, currency, social security, immigration, foreign affairs, property and conciliation and arbitration. There are obviously a range of other smaller and less important matters but the principal powers given to the Federal Parliament are those which have been listed. It is interesting that some of the major spending departments within the Commonwealth today-for instance, housing and education-do not even rate a mention in the Constitution. Apart from the quarantine power, health comes into the same category. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to take up any more time than is absolutely necessary. I want to be on record in this Parliament-particularly in a period which is close to the time when the Cabinet Review of Commonwealth Functions Committee will be making a report to the Government-as stating that I believe firm steps and firm actions need to be taken. For my part, I say that there should be more power given to the razor gang. May its efforts be successful and may we get some fundamental changes made to the bureaucracy of Australia as the result of the razor gang's activities. May we then look forward to a situation which the Prime Minister himself has outlined. In conclusion, I will repeat some of his words:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is concerned to maximise the degree to which people have control over their own lives and their own reesources, to ensure that it is their choices which are decisive, not those of politicians, of bureaucrats or union officials or corporations. </PARA>
<PARA> To this end the Government is concerned to limit the role and reduce the power of the State, and as part of that to restrain taxes and to contain public expenditure. The State must remain the servant, not the master, of the Australian people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One would think the Government would bring in some legislation. That it does not, is a matter of disappointment for me and my colleagues. It is extremely unfortunate that what looks like being the year of the big axe coincides with the International Year of Disabled Persons. Handicapped and disabled persons who might have looked forward to international focus of attention on their predicament in the hope of attracting government support will be sadly disappointed, much more disappointed than the honourable member for Braddon is about the level of public expenditure. Already there is a long waiting list of welfare organisations, such as ANSUA, A New Start for the Under Achiever, and SPELD, the Society for the Prevention and Elimination of Learning Difficulties. Both organisations are concerned with learning difficulties faced by children waiting for some sort of government recognition, support and funding. It looks as if it will be a long wait-at least three years. The omens on the health, education and welfare fronts are particularly appalling. The cuts are coming on both large and small scales. Social worker organisations have already suffered considerable staff reductions despite the fact that the demand for social workers is even greater as a direct result of Government cutbacks already made in welfare expenditure. Invalid pensioners in Queensland have suffered delays of up to six months in the processing of their appeals because the Social Security Department does not have enough money in its coffers to pay for the services of a medical representative on the Social Security Appeals Tribunal in that State.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Psycho-analytical Society has expressed serious concern over the statements of the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar) about possible curtailment of health benefits payable for psycho-analytical treatment. It sees the writing very clearly on the wall. Queenslanders are battening down the hatches against the inevitable and inexorable opposition of the Federal Government to the free public hospital system which a previous Queensland Labor Government established. In the Courier-Mail yesterday a scathing attack was made by the Liberal Queensland Health Minister on the Liberal Federal Health Minister. The honourable member for Braddon's motion calls for a reduction in the size and cost of the Federal bureaucracy. No one could query the need to retain the bureaucracy within sensible limitations of cost efficiency, but the assumption that less bureaucracy means greater efficiency is patently absurd. If any proof is required, I suggest he read the report of the Auditor-General which was tabled in this House last week. The Auditor-General states:</PARA>
<PARA> It is a matter for concern that, at the time of audit, claims examinations were significantly in arrears-</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say that it will take up to 10 man-years for these arrears to be brought up to date. The report casts similar reflections on other departments already mentioned by the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis). I venture to add the Department of Social Security and the Australian Taxation Office to the list of departments benefiting from an increase and not a cut in staff, if only on the grounds of increased cost efficiency. For example, naturally the incidence of fraud increases in the Department of Social Security every time the Government reduces social security because there are fewer staff to check benefit claims. </PARA>
<PARA> That is not the only basis on which I find the Government's course objectionable. I am completely opposed to the habit of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) of playing on the public's natural apprehension that the bureaucracy should grow like Topsy as a means of painlessly withdrawing essential services from already neglected sections of the Australian population, sections outlined capably by the honourable member for Henty (Mrs Child) earlier this evening. To put it bluntly, the Prime Minister whispers to his razor gang to do the slashing on public expenditure, but hides his own role from the voting public with the most distressing display of double talk I have witnessed in this House; for example, his declaration that his Government will give assistance to those who need it. We know who that means. It means Rupert Murdoch, Lang Hancock, Peter Clyne and a plethora of multi- nationals. That statement, and other references which the Prime Minister made yesterday in public statements about the true functions of the Commonwealth, are nothing less than the euphemisms for a wholesale sell out of Federal Government programs to the States and to free market forces. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Braddon refers in his motion to ordinary Australians. I am sure he means average Australians. There are no ordinary Australians; only extraordinary Ministers and former Ministers, extraordinary in the extent of their blindness to the needs of the average Australian. If the honourable member for Braddon and his colleagues had any real depth of compassion for the average Australian, they would have given notice of motions reflecting the disappointment which I share with my colleagues. </PARA>

This compares very favourably with the motor vehicle industry and the minerals and energy industry which contribute about 3.4 per cent to the gross domestic product. The magnitude of the tourist industry can be seen by quickly referring to one country, the United States of America, where it is estimated to generate revenues and income of over $US100,000 a year, as well as supporting more than 4 million jobs. Those figures surely point to the importance of tourism to any country, no less Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. I run an awful lot along it. It is a particularly nice part of the world. However, we have had our bayside problems with pollution and the washing away of quite a deal of our beaches. Hard work over the years by local municipalities has helped to rectify this situation. I refer to Mordialloc Council as an example. The Council has spent many thousands of dollars over the past few years on reclamation of the beaches and the foreshores at Mentone, Mordialloc and Parkdale, and it is a credit to the Council that these beaches are becoming more popular every summer. The Parkdale beach has only recently been reclaimed. In February the first life saving carnival was held at Parkdale for over 50 years. A feature of that kind alone brings tourism to the bayside area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mordialloc Council spends some $85,000 a year on beach cleaning and maintaining its beaches. It is estimated that nearly 90 per cent of people who visit those beaches in the area are from outside the bayside region. With the increased popularity of the beaches-they have become superb beaches-recreation and tourism have increased. Thus the money that is generated to small business, local shops, et cetera, is very good and very important for the whole area. However, let us return to the $85,000 which the Mordialloc Council spends. It has to front up with $60,000 of that amount itself. The Victorian Government gives a subsidy of $25,000. No matter which way we look at the matter, the local ratepayers are once again forced to carry the burden. The Federal and State governments should take a stronger hand and make more worthwhile contributions to local municipalities that are trying to lead the way in tourism and are maintaining and enhancing our natural environment. </PARA>
<PARA> Approximately one-third of all the life saving clubs around Port Phillip Bay are in my electorate. Life saving carnivals, swimming competitions, yachting and various recreational activities on the playgrounds of the foreshore are vital to the local area. The Federal Government is not doing enough at present. Local councils know, when they have a big project in the recreation and tourism area in mind, that they will have to fund the major slice of it themselves. This is just not good enough. The Federal Government must decide whether domestic tourism should be given a real boost. If it decides it should be given a boost it should examine local tourist attractions and areas that can be helped. It must be a little more fair dinkum about tourism. I ask the Government to give consideration to increased funding and direct funding to local municipalities to help them continue their work-in many cases, such as the Mordialloc Council, excellent work-that has been carried out in the areas of recreation and tourism. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight considerable pleas have been made by honourable members from this side of the House for more free enterprise. I think these people were trying to say: 'Let us get the outstretched hand back on to the wheel'. My speech tonight will not be entirely in that direction. I am concerned about some of the problems of a particular issue-unemployment. A considerable myth exists today-I may get some cheers from honourable members opposite by saying it is a myth-that trade unions are responsible for inflation. I further think it is a myth that governments create unemployment. In fact, I think the reverse applies. Governments by their policies should and can either create or control inflation. Trade unions, by their price fixing policies which they apply just as vigorously to their members as they do to employers, create unemployment. Nobody will buy a product for more than the amount for which they can sell it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The opportunity for our young people to gain employment is, nevertheless, all around us. Large numbers of people in the community have the privilege of work at today's high wages. These people would gladly spend some of this money on services that they are unable to obtain. As an example, I ask: How much would some young people earn if, instead of being handed a dole application form, they were given a ladder, a plastic bucket and a chamois, and it was suggested that they offer their services to clean windows in the suburbs? Window cleaning is quite honourable employment. Others might see themselves as handymen or as being suitable for other duties in the household area. I see no difficulty in their earning a sum well in excess of the unemployment benefit that others must pay. </PARA>
<PARA> It has also been raised that today's economy and policy constantly favour the rich and disadvantage the poor. No doubt that can be proved in certain areas. However, we must first define the rich and the poor. The inference that we draw from the other side is that the rich are the establishment which is built on generations of wealth. Honourable members opposite overlook the regiment of newly rich such as the Holmes a'Courts, the Bonds, and the Agnews-I name Western Australians as they are known to me-and the many other young men from other States who have risen to great wealth in their lifetime and, in some cases, in this decade. Similarly, many examples of the financial decline of the establishment are also obvious. Some have occurred recently. All this proves to me that the greatest factor that exists in the Australian economy today is equality of opportunity-equality of opportunity to anybody who is prepared to start, if necessary, with his own ladder and plastic bucket. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I rise to discuss a serious waste of public funds caused by the Government's inflexible policy on staff ceilings. My words refer to the failure of the Government to provide sufficient staff to enable the Erindale library in Tuggeranong in the Australian Capital Territory to operate as a community library. Library facilities provide an essential public service. Through libraries our citizens enjoy access to information, recreational reading and self-education. Because of their substantial expenditure of public funds on school and community library buildings and on their book collections, so called joint use libraries are being developed in some communities as a means of containing expenditure. Joint use libraries are shared by a school and the community in the locality of the school. Students and residents utilise the same building and parts of the same book collection.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Such a joint use library has been built in the Tuggeranong Valley in the Capital Territory. It is called the Erindale Community Library and is designed to service not only the students of Erindale College but also the residents of Tuggeranong who currently number 25,000 but will ultimately number three times as many. As I say, the library has been built and it is sited in a modern, well equipped building. The library is now being used by the students of the college. Books and other library materials have been purchased and catalogued but the library is closed to the 25,000 residents of Tuggeranong because of the Government's staff ceiling policy. The Public Service Board has refused to increase the staff ceiling of the Canberra Public Library Service in order to allow the Erindale Community Library to provide day-to-day services to the public. The Board will review the situation in July but, even then, there is no guarantee that staff will be provided to open this library. It is surely a complete waste of public money to build and equip a community facility and then fail to use that facility because of a lack of staff. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I draw the attention of the House to the lack of facilities on the main road linking Canberra to Sydney, particularly that section which passes through my electorate and which was totally funded by the Federal Government and for some curious reason was opened by the Premier of New South Wales, despite the fact that the New South Wales Government contributed not one penny to the very large amount of $80m or so spent on that section of road. I refer to this section of road in particular because I am concerned about the lack of signposting indicating the services needed and available to travellers in those towns which are by-passed by the main road. I particularly mention the Canberra to Sydney road but, of course, also the Sydney to Melbourne road and other major centres south of my electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The concern that I have is that in the towns of Bargo, Tahmoor and Picton, for example, there are many small businesses which for many years have serviced travellers. In those towns there are caravan parks, motels, shops of various kinds and service stations. In fact there is a large industry which is ready and able to serve the needs of people travelling south and north on this main road through my electorate. Until the federally funded new section of Highway 31 was opened these people provided services to users of the Hume Highway. The Hume Highway has now been by-passed. It is normal procedure that, when a town is by-passed, signs are erected on the by-pass road to indicate the very good, high quality services which are available to the traveller, such as are available from the small towns in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately the New South Wales Department of Main Roads, which built this new stretch of highway, has rejected a request, dated 16 October, from the Wollondilly Shire Clerk in which he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Council continues to receive enquiries from local organizations in regard to the provision of suitable signposts advertising the facilities which are available in the towns and villages which will be by-passed by the Freeway but are located on the present Hume Highway. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this letter is to ask your Department if it is the intention to provide service signs denoting establishments, caravan parks and the like available in towns being passed by the Freeway. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a normal, reasonable request. On 4 December, the Divisional Engineer of the Department of Main Roads in New South Wales said:</PARA>
<PARA> Town Service signs are erected on the basis that a driver seeking a service can return to the freeway easily and that it is available at all times. Due to the distance from the freeway to Picton and the limited services available at other towns such as Bargo, the Department is not considering the erection of these signs on the new section of Freeway-F5. </PARA>
<PARA>The Department of Main Roads of New South Wales may be pretty good at building roads but it is not too good at judging what the services available to people are and whether those services are needed. In particular I stress that there is a very large stretch of road with no signs indicating services off the road. The Avon Caravan Park is an example that springs to mind. It is readily accessible from the freeway. At peak holiday periods, the Mittagong Caravan Park turns people away and they do not have an opportunity to go to the Avon Caravan Park because of the lack of signs informing them how to get off the freeway at, for example, the Avon Caravan Park site, even though it is next door to a point of egress. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the Federal Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt), whose Government after all paid for this road, will act in this matter. Why can the New South Wales Government not be told to look after people in this area and to erect these signs on this federally funded highway instead of adopting its very high handed approach to the small business people trying to earn a living in the towns in my electorate. I condemn the New South Wales Department of Main Roads for its arrogant attitude to these people who are trying to provide a service to the traveller. I think it is quite improper that it should decide not to accept this recommendation from the local council to put up the normal signs which are available on every major freeway in Europe. There are always signs indicating the services available just off the main freeways or autobahns. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise two matters tonight. The first relates to a matter of serious concern to a large number of my constituents. I note that the Minister for Education (Mr Fife) is in the chamber. An amount of $26m plus in training allowances is owed currently to teachers who have been involved in teacher training programs in private schools arising from the Deakin School of Education. This amount is owed for services which have been provided to the university. I advocate to the Minister that applications for the reimbursement of these funds should be dealt with as a matter of urgency. They are wages properly earned. My understanding is that money does not exist to pay those wages and they are part of the tertiary process for which the Commonwealth currently accepts responsibility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is one other matter I wish to raise, but first I draw attention to the speech of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume). I do not think that the House should ignore the fact that Government members seem to find it convenient to blame Australian Labor Party governments for deficiencies in State Labor administrations; and, in answering questions where there are not Labor governments, Ministers indicate that the matters raised are responsibilities of the States and are always prepared to indicate that those governments have no obligations at all and make no mistakes. The States exercise no control over Commonwealth funds, nor do they ask for any accountability in respect of Commonwealth funds. Recently we have seen the situation where funds which have been raised through the Commonwealth taxation system and reimbursed to State governments have not only been squandered but also been criminally misused by State governments. Possibly the greatest example exists in Victoria, where the degree to which financial irresponsibility exists within the State system would be a national scandal in any country where that country had governments which were concerned, as this Government consistently expresses it is, about the expenditure of public funds. </PARA>
<PARA> There has not been a major public work undertaken in Victoria in the last 20 years which has not been the subject of mismanagement, failures, contract failures, bad design and a squandering of public funds. Not only that, but also funds which were provided by this Parliament to the Commonwealth for education purposes were used to rent accommodation for a considerable period within the high rent areas of Melbourne without those buildings ever being occupied. Subsequently the State purchased other accommodation which it felt was more suitable. Funds allocated for education were totally squandered by a government which is totally irresponsible in matters of money. We all know what happened in Victoria in respect to the land scandals a couple of years ago. Few people in this Parliament are aware that the Victorian Government, in a shonky auction, sold the Liberal Party of Australia a building. When questioned in the Parliament, a Minister of the Crown stood up and said that he did not know that that organisation of which the Premier of the State was one of the directors was associated with the Liberal Party. </PARA>
<PARA> A nice little secret deal was made whereby expenses which were not publicly advertised as being covered in the sale were covered between the Liberal Party and a Minister of the Crown and a public building owned by the taxpayers of Victoria was sold at the lowest possible point of the market in a disgraceful deal which resulted in a major asset in the central business district being transferred to a political party. We are seeing the same types of activities taking place in this Parliament. Assets of the Commonwealth, assets of the taxpayers, are being transferred to support a political party, a political party which claims that it does not believe in the funding of other political parties. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Many trade unions today have as their thrust the cry that they want more leisure hours for their workers. I refer to some unions in Queensland, particularly in Brisbane-the Federated Engine Drivers and Firemen's Association of Australasia, the Electrical Trades Union of Australia, the Miscellaneous Workers Union, the union covering plumbers, the Australian Tramway and Motor Omnibus Employees Association, the Building Workers Industrial Union of Australia, the Australian Workers Union and others. I refer specifically to the problems that the Brisbane City Council, which is a Labor council, has before it at the moment. I do not intend in this place to sheet the blame home to that Labor council or to the Labor Lord Mayor. However, I have gleaned that the only explanation behind the current industrial unrest in Brisbane is that the unions want more leisure time for their workers. No claim has been filed in the courts and no arbitration procedures have been used at this time. But those unions are using the frontal attack system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to make reference to probably the most disgraceful episode in this nation's history. It is something which probably epitomises the new low level of industrial lawlessness in this country. I refer to the funeral in Brisbane last Saturday of a 6-year-old boy whose coffin was left uncovered because of the industrial strife which presently exists in the city of Brisbane. The funeral was conducted in the afternoon and the parents and relatives went away believing that the final stages of the burial would be attended to. A premonition by the mother that night caused the relations to return. They found that the coffin had a little bit of soil across it and that the flowers which had been buried with the coffin were showing through the soil. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not intend to blame a council of another political persuasion to my own for that event. But I believe that that event in itself stands as a symbol of how low we can go as a nation. I have had cause on two occasions earlier this year to try to make contact with a cemetery in Brisbane. On both occasions I found that the staff was on strike. I simply ask whether union members have ever contemplated the distress and hardship which must be thrust upon the shoulders of near ones when they know that a burial that should take place has to be cancelled because some union has decided to go out on strike. I appeal to all members of this House to recognise that this lucky country of ours is in a very sad state. We have surely pressed the self-destruction button when we will not assist to put to rest those who cannot help themselves. I am sure that I have total agreement from all honourable members. I hope that this contribution will be reflected upon as the unions fight with no holds barred because they want more leisure time for their workers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Fadden (Mr Donald Cameron) put forward a justifiable concern for a lack of responsibility in some sections of our community. I put to this chamber that the only answer to the ills of this nation is for each one of us to accept some responsibility for our own areas-for us, as members of this House, to accept that same responsibility to the people whom we represent, particularly the disadvantaged who, some say, are really pulling the nation down. One person who has accepted responsibility, a constituent of mine, has put very clearly in a letter to me the feelings, I believe, of most people in the electorate. I wish to take this opportunity to read this letter to honourable members in the chamber. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the belief that you have sincere interest in what your constituents are thinking I am putting forward here some thoughts on two matters of importance. They cause me great concern and I am sure that there are many who share this concern. </PARA>
<PARA>1. Taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> Cannot the Government see that the high rate of Personal Income Tax tends to stifle productivity and quality of output?</PARA>
<PARA> Cannot they see that it must be a big factor in the problem of Tax avoidance?</PARA>
<PARA> Surely they must be aware of the low morale existing throughout the nation's work force; and in being aware, they could not deny that high Personal Income Tax is a contributing cause. </PARA>
<PARA> All will agree that Income Tax rates should be reduced and in particular my sympathies lie with: (a) the aged pensioner with a small amount of cash 'on the side' who still has to worry about Income Tax returns; and (b) the superannuated person in receipt of income from a fund to which he has contributed; his rate of Tax should be at a substantially reduced level. </PARA>
<PARA> Achievement of a reduced level of Personal Income Tax is not easy but it seems to me that it could be made up through a reduction in Tax avoidance and an increase in indirect taxes. The latter would support the philosphy of 'let the user pay' which incidentally, I have noticed being reported in Government statements recently. If one were to be cynical, one could ask whether the Government's real philosophy is 'let the loser pay'. </PARA>
<PARA>II. Interest Rates. </PARA>
<PARA> This matter seems to me to be a more serious problem than Taxation. It is causing confusion and alarm among most people, but particularly the young marrieds and lower income folk with a housing finance arrangement. The increased repayments arising from higher interest impositions have already caused some to sell their homes and many others must be contemplating this action. To me that situation has all the indications of a disastrous depression in the making. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that no easy solution exists if urgently needed capital to fund development is to be obtained. But some relief for those in need must be found. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer appears to be out of touch with what is happening to millions of Australians. His recent statement that an increase in Interest Rates was justified partly on the grounds of wage increases indicates this. I can think of three reasons why that excuse should be dismissed. These are</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Any wage increases serve only to catch up (in part) with the costs of day to day necessities. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) An incorrect impression is given about the extent of wage increases. In most cases they go to minority sections of the work force but publicity tends to suggest that all our wages are going up constantly. </PARA>
<PARA> (c) In recent times two increases in Interest Rates occurred nowhere near a general lift in wages. </PARA>
<PARA> One obvious solution to the problem for many is that loans for the purchase of homes retain the same rate of interest as that contracted for at the outset. Reams of argument could no doubt be mounted against this proposition but none would convince me that it is not morally just and in the best long term interests of Australia and its people. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, do you have any words of advice or comfort for those in real fear of seeing their dreams crumble; of not being able to stretch their budgets to meet higher repayments brought about by higher interest rates?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 3 December 1980:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Is the Federal Government examining specific programs for deaf people during the International Year of Disabled Persons; if so, what programs.</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1418" SPEAKER="Hunt The Hon R.J.D." NAMEID="GH4" PARTY="NCP" ELECTORATE="GRAYNDLER">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GH4">Mr Hunt</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Yes, the following are currently being considered, and it is expected other programs will arise as the year progresses:</PARA>
<PARA> A lending library of films, suitable for deaf people. (National Library of Australia)</PARA>
<PARA> The Educational Research and Development Committee is currently funding a project by Dr B. Dalgleish, from the University of Queensland into 'The semantics of early deaf communication'. In addition, the Educational Research and Development Committee expects to receive in 1981 the report of a project by Dr D. Power, from Mt Gravatt CAE, entitled 'The education of mildly and severely hearing-impaired children'. (Educational Research and Development Committee)</PARA>
<PARA> The Theatre Board of the Australia Council has approved a grant of $38,000 towards the activities of the New South Wales Theatre of the Deaf. This grant continues assistance by the Board to this organisation in recent years. (Australia Council)</PARA>
<PARA> It should be noted that the Commonwealth Government, in supporting the United Nations declaration of 1981 as IYDP, will be drawing attention to all forms of disability, rather than singling out particular groups for special attention. Many programs planned, while not aimed specifically at deaf people, will be of benefit to them. The following selection of Commonwealth Government initiatives is indicative of the work being done. There are at present 140 projects under consideration:</PARA>
<PARA> Provision of a range of aids to daily living under the Program of Aids for Disabled People. Assistance will be provided with home modifications and a range of aids including wheelchairs, orthoses, oxygen, medical wigs, mammary prostheses, electrolarynxes, walking aids, aids for incontinence, and personal aids (cutlery, crockery, toilet articles etc.) will be provided on prescription under this new program. (Department of Health)</PARA>
<PARA> TAFE work preparation courses including the provision of adult literacy, remedial and special programs for intellectually, educationally and physically handicapped people. (Tertiary Education Commission)</PARA>
<PARA> $1 million has been provided for 1981 for special support teaching services to allow the integration of handicapped children in regular schools. The Government has also announced that it will make available $2 million in 1981 for the development of education programs for severely handicapped children. (Schools Commission)</PARA>
<PARA> National Employment Strategy for the Handicapped (NESH). A concerted effort is to be made to assist and train disabled people. In addition, a strong promotional effort will be made in employment, assisted by on-the-job training subsidies. Employment promotion committees will be established in each State and Territory to promote the employment of disabled persons to employers. (Department of Employment and Youth Affairs and other relevant Department)</PARA>
<PARA> IYDP grants to States and Territories for small innovative projects on a one-off basis. Projects should benefit disabled children or their families and priority will be given to projects for migrants, Aboriginals and the children of socially and economically disadvantaged parents.

<PARA> (1) It is a fact that the former Department of Productivity publication 'Work and People' estimated that approximately 3 times more industrial time was lost due to accidents and illness than to industrial disputes.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I am informed that in 'Work and People' (Vol. 6, No. 1, 1980) published by the former Department of Productivity there is an article about a survey conducted in October 1976 by the Human Relations Branch of that Department as to absence attributed to sickness and both industrial and other accidents in 1,184 manufacturing and non-manufacturing establishments. According to the article, the survey found that 4.0 per cent of employees were absent at any one time and that this figure did not include time lost through industrial disputation. However, the article goes on to say 'D Crawford (Hyquip Pty Ltd) and S V Volard (University of Queensland) estimate that when strikes are included time lost runs at 4.23 per cent'. The article then goes on to comment on certain other aspects of the survey.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (a) and (b). It is the External Affairs power that is exercised by the Australian Parliament whenever it ratifies international instruments, including Conventions of the ILO.</PARA>
<PARA> The process of examining whether Australia is able to ratify an ILO Convention almost always involves consideration of the law and practice of both the Commonwealth and the States. In accordance with the ILO Constitution, Australian Governments have only ratified ILO Conventions that require Federal and State implementation after full consultation with the States as to their law and practice. This process has led to the ratification of several Conventions that deal with safety, health and welfare at work. Others are under Commonwealth and State consideration.</PARA>

<PARA> The Government's success is apparent-ABS figures show that employment in the twelve months to January 1981 grew by 140,000 (or 2.3 per cent), while the number of persons looking for full-time work declined by 17,900 in the year to February 1981.</PARA>

(The Council was formed in 1979 by media and alcoholic beverages industry groups to apply a code to govern standards of advertising of all alcoholic beverages.)</PARA>
<PARA> My Department will continue to monitor the operation of the Code, particularly in relation to the avoidance of advertising that encourages irresponsible drinking.</PARA>

<PARA> My Department routinely reviewed the 'Brisbane Bitter' television commercial specifically mentioned by the honourable member and, on 24 February 1981, lodged a formal objection with FACTS and ABAC, subsequently maintaining contact with these bodies concerning withdrawal of the advertisement.

<PARA> (b) The possibility that World War II Flight Authorisation books were retained is remote as there is no documentation showing that they were retained and transferred to the Australian Archives.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Some such drugs can still be obtained on prescription or through hospital dispensaries. Drugs are not removed from the pharmaceutical benefits list solely because they are considered to be dangerous.</PARA>
<PARA> The Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) recommends the deletion of a drug from the pharmaceutical benefits list for various reasons, including-</PARA>

<PARA> In reviewing drugs available as pharmaceutical benefits the PBAC takes particular notice of the comparative efficacy and toxicity of drugs in a therapeutic group.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) One of the grounds on which tertiary students may be awarded independent status under the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme (TEAS) is employment for two years full-time in the workforce. There is no prohibition against employment in a family business or farm which may be operated as a sole trader, trust, or company; however applications for independent status must be supported by documentation which clearly indicates the bona fide nature of the employment. Independent status cannot be awarded on the basis of income from a trust where the student is not a bona fide employee of the concern.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The allowance will be made available, provided the rules of the Scheme, as outlined in the Student Assistance Act and Regulations, are satisfied. The legislation provides for independent status on the basis of employment as indicated in (1) above.</PARA>
<PARA> (a) The means test on a student's income requires that income from any source including employment, investments and trusts, be taken into account. Students may have an income of $2,000 a year before their allowance is affected. Where income is received in excess of $2,000, the allowance is reduced by $1 for every $2 of income in excess of $2,000. It is not proposed to vary this means test during 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) I have no evidence of abuses occurring in the Scheme in the assessment of independent status on the basis of employment in family businesses or trusts, or in the means testing of student income derived from these sources.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Prior to the enactment of the Defence Amendment Act (No. 2) 1977, provisions existed to proscribe the unauthorised manufacture, sale or supply of service decorations. The enforcement of these provisions proved to be a major and expensive task and they did not prevent awards leaving Australia for sale with consequent loss to the country of significant military awards. Moreover, the provisions were found to restrict genuine collectors and dealers who have done much to encourage interest in and the preservation of military relics. Consequently, these provisions were amended. The new provisions had the support of the Military Historical Society and the Returned Services League of Australia. The present legislation, I might add, was endorsed by the honourable member for Oxley speaking for the Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The duplication of decorations for commercial exploitation is to be deplored. However, because of the difficulties outlined above, as well as the difficulty of detecting duplicates and our inability to prevent reproduction overseas, the reintroduction of proscriptive legislation is not contemplated.</PARA>

<PARA> (2) Yes. The CSIRO experiments are expected to be carried out over the next two summers. During 1981-82 sites will be selected and prepared. This will involve fire fuel load assessment and characterisation in the test areas as well as fire behaviour studies. These studies are necessary to ensure that the full scale experiments can be conducted without endangering life or property. During 1982-83 actual air dropping using different fire retardants and mixtures will be carried out. At this stage the only air dropping operations planned for the 1981-82 fire season are those to be conducted with the Modular Airborne Firefighting System in Victoria using a RAAF Hercules aircraft. CSIRO will, at the appropriate time, call tenders for a suitable aircraft for use in its experiments the following summer.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4U4">Mr Killen</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The substance of the correspondence referred to by Dr Klugman is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> There is a Defence Force policy on homosexuality in the Services which is applied in common in the three arms of the Defence Force. This policy is based on the fact that the disciplined and structured environment of the Defence Force requires an approach to homosexual relationships which is in keeping with its primary functions and which may be different from the approaches which may be appropriate in the civilian community at large.</PARA>
<PARA> There is a need in the Defence Force to maintain command relationships, high morale, and discipline. The Services cannot function effectively in peace time, let alone in an operations situation, without these.</PARA>
<PARA> Acceptance and condonation of homosexual behaviour does not fit either the public or the Services' view of the Defence Force and would adversely affect both recruiting and re-engagement. For example, a large proportion of those recruited into the Services are very young persons for whom the Services have an obligation to act, in respect of social behaviour, in loco parentis. If it were to be known that the Services declined to fulfil this obligation many parents would be reluctant to authorise or encourage their children to enlist.</PARA>
<PARA> An allegation that a serviceman or servicewoman has been involved in homosexual conduct is necessary before any incident is investigated. The investigators are carefully briefed on the conduct of the investigation, which is carried out as discreetly and with as little publicity as possible in order to minimise embarrassment to those involved.</PARA>
<PARA> Should an investigation show that an allegation is ill-founded, that is the end of the matter. But if an investigation substantiates an allegation, further action may be either disciplinary (i.e. the laying of charges) or administrative.</PARA>
<PARA> In all three Services there is a reluctance to take disciplinary action. A trial inevitably causes embarrassment not only to the accused but also to others who may be wholly innocent victims.</PARA>
<PARA> If it is reasonable to assume that the serviceman or servicewoman is not a confirmed homosexual and is unlikely to become involved in further incidents, he or she may be retained in the Service and warned of the consequences of further involvement in homosexual behaviour.</PARA>
<PARA> If, however, it is apparent that the serviceman or servicewoman is a confirmed homosexual who cannot or will not refrain from further involvement, administrative action is taken to arrange release from the Service.</PARA>
