<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -Mr Speaker, I seek your indulgence to address a few remarks to the announcement you have just made about the return of the writs. You were absent overseas when, as Acting Leader of the Opposition, I first heard that the Government proposed to hold by-elections on 21 February. That struck me as being very unusual indeed because, as you know, if the Speaker is overseas, it is left to the Governor-General-in-Council to decide when a by-election will be held. I duly contacted your Clerk to find out whether I had heard correctly and that there were to be by-elections on 21 February. He said yes, he had discussed the matter with you, and that you proposed to write to me seeking my comments on the proposals. On 22 January, I duly received from the Clerk a letter which indicated that at that stage-it had been written the day before-resignations were anticipated from the then honourable member for Curtin and the then honourable member for Boothby. Assuming that you would consider any submission that I made, I wrote to you indicating that if, as suggested, 21 February was to be the date of the by-elections, surely that would leave insufficient time for the respective parties to select candidates and conduct campaigns.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The precedent which I put to you quite clearly and quite forcibly was that established in the Werriwa by-election. You will recall that when the previous honourable member for Werriwa resigned in July 1978 you agreed to fix the date for the by-election some 54 days later, which I consider provided adequate time. If that precedent had been followed in this case, it would have meant that all parties would have had a chance to select candidates and the by-election campaigns could have been conducted over a reasonable time. For example, 21 March would have been in accordance with the Werriwa precedent. What gravely concerns me is that I did not receive a reply to my comments to you. The very next day I learned that you had decided to issue the writs for by-elections which, according to a statement made by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) on television some three or four days previously, were to be held on 21 February. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, that leads me to say to you quite forcibly that in this case you seem to have acted more as a member of the Liberal Party of Australia than as an impartial Speaker. There was no reason at all to deviate from the precedent set in the Werriwa by-election. The Australian Financial Review of 20 January stated that the Liberal Party machine had been advised that the by-elections would be held on 21 February. In other words, the Liberal Party was advised well in advance and the Prime Minister in your absence announced to the nation that he thought the by-elections would be held on that date. I think you will agree that, as you invited my comments on the proposal and, on your return, you completely ignored my correspondence in agreeing to those dates, I am entitled to object quite strongly, firstly, to your lack of courtesy and, secondly, on the basis of precedent: Why was not the Werriwa precedent followed? Mr Speaker, if it becomes clear to us that you are acting as a member of the Liberal Party in the seat which you hold and that you will accord to directions given to you by the Prime Minister, I suggest that it is about time that you considered seriously whether you should continue to hold the position of Speaker. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. I have given him considerable indulgence. Having given him indulgence, I shall respond. I regard it as a matter of great importance that the office of Speaker in this national Parliament should be occupied in accordance with the current Westminster tradition. If the honourable gentleman feels consistently as he has expressed himself today, I hope he will join me in the process which I am undertaking to have the office of Speaker in this Parliament filled in the Westminster tradition. I hope I can look forward to his support in that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With regard to the issue raised, the fact is that last year it was announced that two members would be appointed to other posts and it was expected that they would resign from this Parliament. Indeed, they left the ministry for that purpose. On the death of the honourable member for McPherson, the late Mr Eric Robinson, it was necessary to call for the issue of writs for a by-election. While that was in process the two other gentlemen concerned decided to resign. I was then confronted with the situation of either holding separate by-elections or holding three by-elections on the same day. I thought it was desirable to hold the three on the one day and to hold them before Parliament resumed today. I also thought it was desirable to have them before the Parliament resumed today. I adhere to that decision. I think it was a correct one. I intended no discourtesy whatsoever to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who, in fact, was Acting Leader of the Opposition at the time. In my conversations with him, through the Clerk, I was punctilious about ensuring that he was informed. If he feels that I was in dereliction of my duty through a lack of courtesy, I will be glad to discuss the matter with him in private. If there was such dereliction, I will make an appropriate apology. At this stage, I do not believe that there was any departure whatsoever from courtesy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Wednesday, 7 January, members of this House were shocked to hear of the sudden and untimely death of Eric Robinson. The loss to Australia, to this Parliament and to his friends and his colleagues was a heavy one. I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That this House expresses its deep regret at the death on 7 January 1981 of the Honourable Eric Laidlaw Robinson, a member of this House for the division of McPherson since 1972, a Minister of the Crown from 1975 to 1980, the President of the Queensland division of the Liberal Party from 1968 to 1973; and places on record its appreciation of his influential and wide-ranging public service, and tenders its deepest sympathy to his widow and family. </PARA>
<PARA> Eric Robinson's time and energies were given up almost entirely to parliamentary life, to the Ministry, and to party and community affairs. To an enormous extent, he lived his life for politics. He did not keep his public career at arm's length from his private life. One thing that many honourable members will remember is the generous way in which he opened his home to his colleagues in politics. Whenever a venue was needed, his home was always available. Eric was alert to the needs of the community. He sought to provide the kind of representation McPherson electors wanted and he represented them truly and well. </PARA>
<PARA> Eric Robinson was a strong party man. He believed in the Liberal Party as a force for good in Australia and devoted his energies to strengthening it in Queensland. He was president of the Liberal Party in Queensland for five years before he entered the Federal Parliament. He believed in liberalism above all else. He believed strongly in the free enterprise system and supported the containment of government expenditure. He knew that this was the right path to a better life for Australians. He saw adherence to these principles as the foundation of progress in our community. </PARA>
<PARA> In his own electorate, he was surrounded by the tremendous development and progress that can occur when the energy and initiative of people are mobilised by the opportunities that freedom provides. Eric Robinson will be remembered particularly for his role as a man who had a practical understanding of business. He was himself successful in business after responsibility for his family's affairs was thrust upon him at a very young age. </PARA>
<PARA> He built up his family's sporting goods business from a single outlet into a chain that extends up and down the Queensland coast. As a result of this, he knew the needs of the business community and he wished to help business to flourish throughout Australia. The result of his efforts was that the business community often looked to him for a lead. He was prepared to give that lead. The business community has been grateful for that, and its benefits have been widely felt in the community generally. </PARA>
<PARA> But Eric Robinson was not just a practical man. His pragmatic judgments were informed by deeply held convictions and principles. These principles underlay his day to day responses. He did his best to ensure that his principles were given practical expression. </PARA>
<PARA> We all know that Eric Robinson stood strongly for his principles and convictions. He fought for them with determination. But there were many occasions when he was prepared to set aside his personal feelings for the sake of what he saw as the greater good. I think it is well known to honourable members that I did not agree with Eric on all things. This is not unusual in politics. But it would be right to say that our disagreements were more about means than about ends and perhaps about matters of judgment rather than matters of principle. My differences with him did not diminish my respect for him, or for his contribution to the Liberal cause and to the service of his electorate and Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Eric was a man whose outward calm hid the strength of his own feelings. Often it seemed that he was impervious to criticism and that nothing could hurt him. But he felt things far more deeply than was understood by people who knew him casually. I value my knowledge of Eric Robinson and of the things we did together. His untimely death is a reminder that public life can be severe and demanding and that the demands of a person's own conscience and sense of duty can be enormous. The strains of office, the strength of feeling, the pressures of time and the requirement for immediate action make many demands, and Eric Robinson extended himself to the full, and beyond, in meeting them. </PARA>
<PARA> Eric Robinson inspired loyalty and conviction, both amongst his own staff and amongst his Public Service advisers. He worked long and hard but retained the capacity to enjoy life, a capacity which was appreciated by his associates. We will miss him in this House in our deliberations and in the everyday contact of political life. A further feature of Eric Robinson's life was the indispensable foundation of everything that he did. It was at the base of his entire accomplishment. He was totally and utterly devoted to his family. His love and loyalty to his wife, Narelle, together with her constant presence and support, gave to this man continuing strength and perspective in the atmosphere of Canberra politics. In expressing our gratitude to Narelle Robinson for her contribution to her husband's public service, we express our deepest sympathy to her and to her family at this time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Opposition I join the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in expressing sympathy to the widow and surviving family members of the late Eric Robinson. For those of us who knew Eric Robinson personally, his death was a considerable sadness. Whatever our political differences with him-there were vigorous differences of substance and presentation; for his part he presented the case on behalf of his party with firmness but always without rancour-he enjoyed our high personal regard, as does his widow Narelle and their family.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> He was a conscientious Minister, always approachable and ever ready to be helpful where he reasonably could, while at a personal level he maintained a genuine, friendly interest in all of his parliamentary colleagues. His death was sudden and unexpected, so unexpected as to suggest that the extreme pressures under which he worked, and the increasing tensions to which he was subjected, were taking an awful toll. We in this House saw the manifest evidence of those pressures and tensions which, to a large degree, are part and parcel of the daily work load that we all undertake. But for Eric Robinson some of them seemed unnecessary and even unfair. He paid a high price for his industry, his personal integrity and his convictions. </PARA>
<PARA> He was essentially a man of great loyalty. He was loyal to the ideal, as he saw it, of what the Liberal Party should stand for and he was loyal to his Party in his home State of Queensland, where he fought fiercely against what he saw as any erosion of its position in political and public life. When he returned to the back bench after the recent elections, his vigorous advocacy of his beliefs became perhaps an every greater force in the life of his Party. The determination with which he stood by his convictions and his loyalties, despite great personal cost, is an example to many of his colleagues in this Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The death of Eric Robinson in January of this year, only days before his fifty-second birthday, was a great shock to all of us and is a stark reminder to us all of just how uncertain life is. Eric, a strong vigorous personality, without warning was taken from us. It was a demonstration of the toll that political life can take of those who work to serve this nation. It took from this Parliament a man with a distinguished record of service to the nation, to the State and to the region for which he worked so hard over many years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Eric Robinson's service was not confined to politics. He was prominent also in business, the community and the sporting life of Queensland. However, it was in politics that he made the greatest impression on Australians. After his election to the seat of McPherson in 1972 he gained growing respect in this Parliament. In 1975 he was appointed Minister for the Capital Territory and the following year he became the Minister for Post and Telecommunications and Minister Assisting the Treasurer. In 1977 he was appointed Minister for Finance. The corner-stone of Eric Robinson's career was his life-long commitment to free enterprise, the protection of the rights of individuals and the fostering of personal initiative. Eric Robinson's close involvement with the Liberal Party in Queensland was an integral part of that commitment. </PARA>
<PARA> As honourable members will be well aware, politics can put men-even men with the same political philosophy-at odds on issues. Eric Robinson and I did not have the same point of view about our political parties in Queensland. But these differences, whilst they were real, were never personal. Eric and I had a good personal relationship, one that started well before he entered Parliament. We were members of the same Cabinets of coalition governments. We were part of a team and I had a great respect for his ability, his capacity and his integrity. I am sure that is felt by all the members of Cabinet who served with him. I believe that respect is shared also by members of my party.</PARA>
<PARA> As I have mentioned, I knew Eric Robinson and his wife, Narelle, on the Gold Coast prior to his election in 1972. They were a very popular couple and their home was always open to welcome visitors to the area. Eric was a prominent figure on the Gold Coast which, of course, borders my electorate of Richmond. When he became the honourable member for McPherson we shared the handling of many regional problems in what is probably the fastest growing area in Australia. One of our joint achievements was the development of the Coolangatta airport and the construction of a major new terminal, which is now nearing completion. I am pleased that this new terminal is to be named in Eric Robinson's honour. It is a memorial to his services to the people of his electorate and to all Australians, and to his career as a distinguished Minister in Liberal-National Country Party governments. I would like once again to take this opportunity to extend my sympathy and the sympathy of the members of my party to his wife, Narelle, and the members of his family. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to associate myself with the motion of condolence that has been moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) for my friend, the late Eric Robinson. I believe that to all intents and purposes the Old Testament injunction 'lift up thy voice with strength; lift it up, be not afraid', was Eric's personal and political maxim. For both Queensland and the Gold Coast his voice rang loud and clear in this place. He carried that State's case for additional finance, particularly in the area of road funding. He pressed hard for the Gold Coast and the securing of tourist incentives for the area. Indeed, many government initiatives in tourism were initially fostered by Eric Robinson. He brought to this Parliament the drive and dedication that had served him so well in free enterprise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Eric Robinson was a man of unquestionable integrity, high principle, singular urbanity and, of course, personal charm. Above all, he was a valued colleague and a very close personal friend. His outstanding contribution to this Parliament is a matter of public record. He occupied the positions of Minister for Finance, Minister for Post and Telecommunications and Minister for the Capital Territory with great distinction. Eric believed in free enterprise. He was a firm believer in the need to get industry geared up and moving again because this was the area where new jobs could be created. </PARA>
<PARA> Throughout Eric's parliamentary career, he demonstrated both integrity and courage. As the Prime Minister has indicated, he was a dedicated Liberal and he was totally committed to the philosophy of the Liberal Party of Australia. He was a great Queenslander and family man, a man of principle and firm conviction, and a loyal and gentle man in the best sense in which those words can be used. He held very strong views and expressed them without fear or favour, no matter what conflict those views might have brought him into within his own political organisation, within this Parliament or in the whole body of political controversy in this country. At all times he was his own man. Eric made a very significant contribution to the Liberal Party of Australia over a long period, particularly to the Queensland division. Eric Robinson and I shared so much together. I will miss his friendship, as the Liberal Party and the country will certainly miss his contribution. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EL7">Sir WILLIAM McMAHON</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Lowe)</ELECTORATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had the good luck to be a friend of Eric Robinson. I came to know him from the time when, first as Treasurer, I began to go to Surfers Paradise each year to spend part of the Christmas holidays with my wife and later with her and my children. I had great respect, affection and liking for him. I will never forget the kindness that he showed me whenever I felt a need to discuss my problems with somebody who, I knew, would be sensitive to what was said and who would do his best to help to find a solution or who would give me some idea of what ought to be done. He was trustworthy. I know of no person, other than each member of my own family, whom I could trust to a greater extent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In addition, he had another valuable attribute. I found this when I went to stay with him when I was a Minister, before I bought a small place of my own a mile away from his. He would always be amusing and was anxious to assist any member of parliament who went to his home, no matter what party that person belonged to. I remember a number of occasions when we had dinner at his home and members of the Australian Labor Party were there as well. I remember the frankness with which conversation developed. The example, I think, is one that could well be followed by all. We do not appear to be able to discuss controversial matters in confidence. One of his great assets was that he was a businessman in the retail sales of sporting goods. When I was Treasurer, I preferred to talk to him about trends in the economy than to go to the professional economists. I include the Treasury when I use that term. Eric knew the market-place. </PARA>
<PARA> He was a true liberal. Again I emphasise that he had deep feelings for the disadvantaged. His conversations with me about social welfare matters and about people who were not able to look after themselves were frequent. I am certain that people went to him not only because he thought about each problem but also because his decisions came from the heart. He was also a very strong party man. I first met him when he was a member of the Executive of the Liberal Party Queensland division. Later he became its President. He was wise enough to realise that if he was to win a seat in parliament he had to have a base in Queensland and in the parliamentary party not only to sustain his authority but also so that he could understand and reflect its views. I believe that that was one of the sources of his authority and influence. </PARA>
<PARA> He believed in the equality of men and their right to justice. He cared for people and he showed his concern. As part of his philosophy, he also believed in the rule of law. How many times did I hear him speak up to say that we were all equal before the law and that whether one was a Cabinet Minister or a boss of a big business, there must be equality in the eyes of the law and, I believe, also in the eyes of most people in Parliament. He was a good Minister. One could go to him when he was Minister for Finance and find out the real significance of the money supply situation, what the economic trends were for better or worse and whether our expenditure or revenues were keeping within the Budget estimates. One could always talk to him. He welcomed others approaching him for a discussion as much as he welcomed the opportunity to approach others. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to speak now about his family. As I have said, I knew him for a long time. I knew his wife and I knew his wife's mother. I also knew Narelle's two children. Like him, they were very gregarious. They liked to see people in their home. They enjoyed entertaining them and wanted them to go home in a happy frame of mind. I will never forget the many nights I shared with them, particularly in the last six months of Eric's life. I believe that Narelle, his wife, is one of the three or four most charming and companionable people one could meet. I have never known her to be anything but friendly. She is as anxious to help people as she is eager to entertain them. In the last few weeks she has been an almost constant companion of my wife. In fact, I think Narelle has seen my wife more frequently than I have. </PARA>
<PARA> I must refer also to Narelle's mother, Grom. Most of us who have met her would think that she must read every newspaper in Australia. She has an instinct for public affairs. She knows what happens on television and radio. She always participates in a very human way, whether right or wrong, in telling people what she thinks the Government or its Minister should have done, what they had forgotten or where they had gone wrong. She is a charming person. I want to remember her, too. I have said what I wanted to say about those charming people. I will miss Eric. I will also miss seeing Narelle as much as I have in the past when she came here with Eric and shared our companionship. I speak on this occasion with sorrow-a kind of sorrow that will stay with me for some time. It is not easy to forget a person who was loved as much as Eric. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the condolence motion moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) concerning Eric Laidlaw Robinson. I knew Eric for many years. It was through his interest and guidance that I first became involved in the organisation of the Liberal Party. He gave an enormous amount of time, money and effort to that cause. As has already been said, he believed in private enterprise and he practised and advocated it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was from a very strong commercial background that he took an active interest in the Liberal Party. He formed the Surfers Paradise branch of the party in 1963. He became a member of the executive of the Liberal Party as representative of the McPherson area in 1964. He was Vice-President of the Queensland Division of the party in 1966 and its President from 1968 to 1973. During that time he showed complete dedication to the Liberal Party in Queensland and a great sense of organisational skill and development. He pressed the barriers on all corners. He was certainly a controversial figure, but his contribution to the development of the Liberal Party in Queensland is well remembered by its members, particularly those who are present today. I support the condolence motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think I am speaking for everybody on this side of the House when I say that we were all very shocked to hear of the death of Eric Robinson. We were shocked probably because Eric always looked as fit as any man could look. Many of us on this side of the House envied his apparent good health. Again, I think I am speaking for all honourable members on this side of the House when I say that the thing that endeared Eric Robinson to us was that, even though we were political opponents, he never attacked any of us on a personal basis in all the speeches he made in this House. Any attack he may have made was against an idea or a concept. But never was there any rancour, ill humour or vindictiveness directed at a person.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Not long before his death I sat next to him on a plane. The flight was most entertaining because he was a delightful human being. Like other honourable members of this place I was invited to visit Eric and, if necessary, stay with him. Unfortunately I never took up that offer. He said to me: 'If ever you come to Surfers Paradise I would like you to be my guest'. As I said, I regret that I never took that opportunity. I think Eric Robinson brought to this Parliament the very best principles of Westminster. No higher praise can be given of a parliamentarian. His passing will be a great loss both to this Parliament and to the nation. To his wife Narelle and family I pay my deepest respects. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very few, if any, members or senators in this Parliament, present or past, would have had a closer or more intimate association with Eric Robinson than I did. Coming from the same State, serving together for six and a half of the eight years that Eric was in this Parliament, and serving the same party organisation was certainly a sound foundation on which to build a friendship. I started to become active in the Queensland Liberal Party organisation in the middle sixties. Shortly afterwards Eric Robinson was elected President of the Queensland division of the Liberal Party and served in that position for five years from 1968. They were years not without their difficult times, but with a smooth, efficient and friendly approach Eric brought a measure of stability and calm that was to stand the party in good stead in the ensuing years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I can recall some of those earlier years with Robinson chairing sessions of annual party conventions, when I knew him only to speak to, and can say there were times when I doubted his impartiality and approach. I was soon to learn that Eric Robinson had a particular toughness and resoluteness that he combined with a deal of understanding and tolerance that was essential for the position of a successful party president. As those early years passed by my regard for him, both as a person and as a politician deepened and strengthened. That regard did not diminish or falter at any time right up until his recent untimely death. That is not to say that I agreed with him on all occasions. Indeed, our opinions differed on many issues and on many occasions. There was certainly no hero worship in my attitude or approach to Eric Robinson, but I did admire him greatly for the depth and sincerity of some of his outstanding qualities. </PARA>
<PARA> It was in the early sixties that Eric and Narelle established a fine home on the Isle of Capri on Queensland's Gold Coast. He commuted to Brisbane to manage his sports store and business interests and to indulge in his ever-increasing interest in the Liberal Party. Eric established branches of the Liberal Party within the McPherson electorate and he and Narelle worked untiringly to promote the party. On the retirement in 1972 of the Honourable Charles Barnes, the Country Party member for McPherson since 1958, Eric Robinson sought and gained the endorsement for the Liberals. He won the seat after the distribution of preferences in a closely fought tussle with the Country Party. From that time he comfortably retained the seat in 1974, 1975, 1977 and 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> Eric Robinson served Liberal and National Country Party coalition governments under our present Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in a number of portfolios. I hope his true worth was fully appreciated by all of us. There were times when I doubted that this was the case. Most members and senators on both sides of the House of this and previous Parliaments in which he served can attest to his helpfulness and kindness. Whether it was a constituent problem, a personal problem or the explanation of a Government policy, Eric Robinson went out of his way to assist. Nothing was too much trouble. It was a superb innate quality that he possessed. Many men of similar independence in status and affluence would not have extended the charity that poured so naturally from him. </PARA>
<PARA> In particular I feel compelled to make reference to Eric Robinson's helpfulness and fatherly attitude towards party colleagues from Queensland. If one cared to research the subject and Queensland members and senators were forthright and honest, I am sure the writings would be interesting and enlightening, although I regret to say-politics being what it is-some of my Queensland colleagues were less than appreciative of his kindness, understanding, generosity and assistance. I hope that the people to whom I refer are left to ponder their actions and live with their consciences. All members in this chamber, regardless of party affiliation, will argue the comparative degree of complexities and difficulties associated with their parties' politics at a State branch level. </PARA>
<PARA> Eric Robinson, as a former State Liberal Party President, party machine man and Cabinet Minister, had a tremendous load to carry in his liaising role between the government and the Queensland Liberal Party organisation. Australians from other States often scoff at Queenslanders for their lack of perception of what goes on in Australian politics. I would hotly dispute their view. Queenslanders are aware but, if anything, are not as emotional as people from some other States. In spite of this the Queensland scene in itself is a complex and difficult one politically. If honourable members think the Liberal and National Country parties have problems, they should ask the Labor Party about the old and new guards and the simmering discontent within that party in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> In general, the relationships between Liberal Party and National Country Party members and senators from Queensland are good. But when one puts that aside and delves deep into the State National-Liberal Party coalition, the personalities in government and the party organisations, the scene changes dramatically. Eric Robinson had a nightmare path to tread in his endeavours to maintain harmony and a close and successful relationship with this Government. Eric Robinson had to contend with one of the most dictatorial, ruthless, uncompromising, uncharitable and unfair men in Australian politics over the last four or five decades, a man who would stoop to any tactics to bring about his demise, even to giving voting preferences to his arch opponents to bring about Robinson's downfall. </PARA>
<PARA> Politics is not for softies and Eric Robinson never contended that it was or should be. But the merciless and scathing attacks he endured from those philosophically committed as he was were impossible to explain and, no doubt, took their toll of his health. In any account of Eric Robinson's time in politics the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Matters in Relation to Electoral Redistribution which dealt with alleged malpractices in Queensland's electoral redistribution must rate a sizable chapter. For months on end, Eric Robinson, his family, staff and friends were subjected to an unbelievable level of stress as the case dragged on. Eric Robinson was completely exonerated by the inquiry, but those who knew him well knew that the scars never healed. He was able to hold his head high after that gruelling inquiry. I only wish I could say the same about others. </PARA>
<PARA> From my personal viewpoint, Eric Robinson was a great friend. He was one of the beautiful people of this world. He was generous, understanding and unselfish in his thoughts and actions. Eric Robinson frequently put into action what others talk about. In mid-1978 I suffered a serious illness and was hospitalised for several weeks. To relieve the pressure on my wife and family, Eric and Narelle cared for two of my children at their Gold Coast home. For that gesture I am extremely grateful and thankful. I mention that particular event because it serves to illustrate the fine understanding qualities that Eric Robinson possessed. Last Saturday's by-election win in McPherson by the Liberal candidate Peter White was in fact a fitting tribute to Eric Robinson. I know that Narelle Robinson, who had worked side by side with Eric over 20 years in politics, is very happy with the result. Eric would have wanted the seat retained by a Liberal. In spite of great personal stress over past weeks, Narelle has worked tirelessly to achieve a Liberal win. I feel confident that that is the way Eric would have wanted it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal Party in Queensland and indeed throughout the nation has lost a faithful and dedicated servant. The electors of McPherson, whom he served untiringly for eight years, have lost a wonderful member for, although not born to the area, Eric Robinson was a great ambassador for the Gold Coast region. The people of Queensland and Australia have lost a truly great Australian and friend. His unselfish contributions for the betterment of Australia and Australians may not be known or understood by many but, let there be no mistake, they were considerable. </PARA>
<PARA> The Parliament has lost an honest and sincere person, an able debater who was not without a fair measure of humour both in and out of this chamber. The Government, which for the past five years has had the services of Eric Robinson in a number of portfolios, has lost an able and perceptive servant. My family and I have lost a true and dear friend. Finally it is to Narelle, Sarah and Simon that my thoughts go. They have lost a wonderful husband and father. Their personal loss far outweighs and overshadows that of any other person. I extend my heartfelt sympathy to them in a loss that will endure for the rest of their lives. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join with previous speakers in expressing sympathy to Narelle and the other members of the Robinson family in their loss of a husband and father. I congratulate the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Hodges) for expressing in very clear terms what from time to time many of us believed would have been the thoughts of Eric Robinson himself. From the Opposition's point of view, we very much respected his integrity and we understood his politics. We also understood some of the pressures to which he was subjected, and we recognise that in the course of debate in this place, which is a democratic institution, perhaps we contributed to some extent to those pressures, particularly in relation to the Royal Commission of Inquiry on Matters in Relation to Electoral Redistribution in Queensland 1977.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I know that Eric Robinson valued the friendship of all honourable members, and it is a delight to think that that sort of person can be elected to this Parliament. He bore no animosity, but he had a lot of setbacks and a lot of pressures. There is no doubt that they contributed to his death, and we must recognise that. In retrospect, we trust that that situation will not continue for others. I think Eric Robinson became a victim of the pressures of politics, perhaps on a more personal basis than should have been allowed. Nevertheless, from an Australian point of view he had a lot to offer, and perhaps he would have done things differently if he had had the opportunity to do so. To that extent I think we understood him well. </PARA>
<PARA> From the point of view of the Parliament and its members, let us place on record Eric Robinson's contribution to our welfare and advancement, where he played a significant role. He was always interested in what was to happen to a member's wife and family, and he played a leading role which we must recognise and applaud. I say again that it is sad to have to express these thoughts at this time. We well remember Eric Robinson when he was in his prime and we have fond remembrances of the things he said. They would have been a tribute to all Australians. </PARA>

Having known him since schooldays, and his wife's family and Narelle as well during that period, I stand to pay tribute to him not as a politician, not as a member of Cabinet, not even as a member of the Liberal Party, but as a friend with whom I had a friendship that was maintained over 40 years. I should like to pay tribute to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and to the right honourable member for Lowe (Sir William McMahon) for the comments they have made about his family. As the Prime Minister so properly said, Eric Robinson's whole life was based upon the strength of the family security that Narelle gave to him. On behalf of the backbenchers on this side of the Parliament, I rise to say that we will miss him, not for any of the grand things that have been said but as a friend who was a lasting friend to people he knew all his life.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Many of us knew Eric Robinson for a long time, and I think it is appropriate that something be said about the relationship we of the Australian Labor Party in Queensland had with our late friend. Eric Robinson was one of a number of members of this Parliament who have been president of the Queensland Liberal Party, and one thinks of the late Senator Sherrington, Alan Hulme, the former member for Petrie, and the present Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Moore). We recognise that Eric Robinson played a major role in building up the Liberal Party in Queensland. When he succeeded Dr Hartwig as President of the Queensland Liberal Party, that party was already committed to an electoral gerrymander. It was Eric Robinson's firm belief and his fervent hope that the Liberal Party would achieve what he saw as its rightful place in Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The last time I spoke to Eric Robinson in the Commonwealth Parliamentary Offices in Brisbane just before last Christmas he was not looking backwards, despite the reverses of the immediate past; he was looking forward to 1981 and the years ahead. We will always respect him as a very forthright officer of the Liberal Party, a very honest and fair exponent of Liberal Party views, a person with whom one could deal in a party sense because his word was his bond. Like his father and his brother, he came to an untimely end, which was unexpected and, of course, greatly regretted by all of us. When I was defeated in the 1975 election he was one of the members of this House who took a kindly interest in my well-being. He was always approachable, and I know that many of us who knew him in politics, in business and in public affairs never really saw him as a political opponent so much as a good friend. Members of the Australian Labor Party in Queensland join with members of this House in extending sympathy to Narelle and other members of the family. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It would be remiss of me if I did not join in the remarks which have been made in this debate on the condolence motion concerning my very good friend Eric Robinson. I came to this House in 1972, as did Eric and several other members on this side of the House. In those days many of us had to share rooms and by good fortune, for my part, I was roomed with Eric Robinson. We occupied room U70 up in the back corner of the building. We became very close personal friends and I very much respected him over those years. We did not always see eye to eye on various issues-others have said that was their experience also-but I can assure the House that in whatever Eric Robinson said and did he was always loyal to the Liberal Party of Australia and his Prime Minister. In those days, unfortunately, we were in the awful position of being in opposition. Eric and I were involved in one or two little plans which some honourable members know about and which led to changes. I am delighted that those changes which we believed at the time were necessary have come about. Whatever other people may have thought, Eric Robinson did help to change the leadership of the Liberal Party and he helped to prove that we had and still have the right man as Prime Minister. He always believed that. It was what he worked for, despite the views of others.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Eric Robinson was a great family man and I know how hard Narelle worked for him and with him. As John Hodges properly said, Narelle must be absolutely thrilled to see the results of her work in the recent by-election. She put a lot of effort into the by-election and I am sure that, despite the great loss that she has suffered, she would feel that Eric would be quite happy that again a Liberal has been elected to the seat of McPherson. As many of us would know, Eric always had a little twinkle in his eye, a little raising of the eyebrow, when he was being perhaps a little humorous, and he was always a most pleasant and delightful character. Even when he was a Minister, he would suggest that I might visit his office. He would find time for me to join him in a quiet drink after we had finished the day's work. </PARA>

We who have been in this place for some little time realise that Ministers fall into two categories-those who look for ways of helping one and those who look for ways of avoiding one. Fortunately, we do not have the latter category on this side of the House. Eric Robinson took delight in bringing to honourable members news which he knew affected their areas. I remember well when he called Jim Corbett, me and a few others down to his office to tell us that the satellite was to be a goer and that at long last people in remote areas would see a test pattern and then go on to better things. It is for those reasons and because of the friendship which I had early in my life with his father and subsequently with Eric that I add my tribute to those made here today.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia, in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia, respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> While an average of over 450,000 Australians are now suffering unemployment at any one time,</PARA>
<PARA> over one million people have been unemployed for one or more weeks during the last year and of these,</PARA>
<PARA> 62 per cent of women unemployed and 41 per cent of men unemployed received no unemployment benefits, and further that</PARA>
<PARA> While the poverty line for a family (one income, one child) is $117.90 per week and the average weekly earnings are $243 per week,</PARA>
<PARA> the income for these one million unemployed Australians is on average $62 per week for women and $110 per week for men.</PARA>
<PARA> We the undersigned citizens therefore declare</PARA>
<PARA> that unemployment with its attendant consequences of massive poverty is the major domestic, political and human question facing the National Government at this time,</PARA>
<PARA> that the central issue for the 1980 Federal elections must be the economy and the creation of jobs so that all Australians who choose may work.</PARA>
<PARA> We call for-</PARA>
<PARA> the right to work guaranteed as a fundamental human right</PARA>
<PARA> the restoration of full employment</PARA>
<PARA> the maintenance of real wages and the creation of acceptable social conditions</PARA>
<PARA> the maintenance and expansion of the public sector.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That permitting kangaroos to be commercially exploited when permissible cropping rates are unknown and the means of enforcing controls or protective laws are completely ineffective in this land, is allowing this unique animal to follow the path to rarity or extinction along which all wild animals have gone when subjected to exploitation in similar circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA> We, Australians, have the right to see kangaroos in reasonable numbers on the landscape; we find the commercial slaughter of the kangaroo to be abhorrent and unjustified.</PARA>

<TITLE>Aborigines</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives of Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> Whereas before Europeans settled in Australia, the Aboriginal peoples of Australia had lived on their traditional lands from time immemorial and had in Aboriginal law and customs a clear title to those lands; and</PARA>
<PARA> whereas Europeans and other non-Aboriginal people have occupied and used most of the traditional lands of the Aboriginal peoples against their will and without negotiation, compensation or treaty, and</PARA>
<PARA> whereas it has been the practice of nations established in territories previously occupied by indigenous inhabitants to reach a negotiated settlement with those inhabitants; and</PARA>
<PARA> whereas that occupation has seriously damaged the traditional way of life of Aboriginal Australians and has caused poverty and hardship to be the fate of the great majority of their surviving descendants; and</PARA>
<PARA> whereas the surviving descendants of the Aboriginal peoples have expressed a wish to have their rights to land acknowledged, to preserve their link with their Aboriginal ancestors and to maintain their distinctive identity with its own cultural heritage; and</PARA>
<PARA> whereas the people of Australia in 1967 voted overwhelmingly that the Commonwealth Parliament should have responsibility for laws relating to Aboriginal Australians; and</PARA>
<PARA> whereas the National Aboriginal Conference unanimously resolved in April 1979 in Canberra to ask the Commonwealth Government to negotiate a Treaty with Aboriginal Australians; and</PARA>
<PARA> whereas it is accepted internationally by the United Nations organisation, that each country should work to establish the rights of indigenous peoples to self-determination, non-discrimination and the enjoyment of their own culture; and</PARA>
<PARA> whereas the Woodward Commission in 1974 established principles by which Aboriginal rights to land should be acknowledged and realised; and</PARA>
<PARA> whereas the Senate of the Commonwealth Parliament in February 1975 resolved that Aboriginal Australians should be compensated for the loss of their traditional lands and for the damage to their way of life,</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Commonwealth Government should invite the Aboriginal people of Australia to negotiate a Treaty with the Commonwealth of Australia, and any Treaty should contain provisions relating to the following matters: (i) The protection of Aboriginal identity, languages, law and culture, (ii) The recognition and restoration of rights to land by applying, throughout Australia, the recommendations of the Woodward Commission, (iii) The conditions governing mining and exploitation of other natural resources on Aboriginal land, (iv) Compensation to Aboriginal Australians for the loss of traditional lands and for damage to those lands and to their traditional way of life, (v) The right of Aboriginal Australians to control their own affairs and to establish their own associations for this purpose.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That the question of basic human rights in the Republic of Korea is a matter of widespread and increasing concern. Since the assassination of the late President Pak Chung Hi and the accession to power of the Lt. General Chun Du Hwan the situation, already serious, has deteriorated rapidly.</PARA>
<PARA> That the issue is not simply one of basic human rights. The Korean Peninsula is one of the most explosive areas in the world. The collapse of the last vestiges of democracy in the Republic of Korea, the emergence of a military-police regime of unparallelled brutality, has convinced many moderate Korean reformers that peaceful political change is no longer possible. Renewed civil conflict in Korea would bring with it the terrifying prospect of Great Power involvement. Great Power involvement could precipitate a nuclear holocaust.</PARA>

Chun Du Hwan's Government suggests that it might not, given the opportunity, abide by either the letter or the spirit of the Nuclear Weapons Non-Proliferation Treaty, to which Australia is signatory.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Treasurer: Is it a fact that most recent data indicate that the money supply has moved sharply back toward the target announced by him in his last Budget Speech? If so, is it significant that the return of the money supply towards targeted levels immediately follows the Government's decision to deregulate interest rates?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true that some recent data indicate a much stronger likelihood that the monetary outcome for this year will be within the range laid down in the Budget Speech. When the money supply figures for the month of January are released in the course of the next few days, I expect that they will broadly indicate that trend. I believe that the interest rate changes that followed the announcements I made early in December have made a material contribution towards the improvement in the money supply outlook. It is a factor that one can observe very clearly from what has happened over the last two months that a willingness to allow a freer operation of market forces in this area has led to a much better monetary outcome.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I take the opportunity in responding to the honourable gentlemen's question to repeat in the clearest possible terms the importance the Government attaches to the maintenance of a firm approach to monetary policy. I choose those words deliberately because the Government remains very much of the view that firmly adhering to responsible monetary objectives will play a major part in continuing to reduce the rate of inflation in this country. The most recent evidence on inflation indicates that this country is doing a great deal better than the domestic critics the Government faces are prepared on occasion to acknowledge, because the inflationary performance of this country continues to stand very well by comparison with other countries. That approach can only be built upon and maintained if the Government continues to adhere to a very firm approach to monetary policy.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QS4">Mr MALCOLM FRASER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My attention has been drawn, I think on two separate occasions, to reports in relation to this matter. It is an important matter, so the facts ought to be known. I was not advised last week that the security of the Commonwealth Heads of Government could not be guaranteed. I did not overrule a recommendation that the venue be switched from Melbourne to Canberra because no such recommendation was made. In the earlier examination of this matter a number of Ministers tried very hard to create the circumstances in which the conference could be held in Canberra as Australia's national capital. For a number of reasons-such as the fact that there would be upwards of 2,000 people entering the country, many of them used to and expecting first-class hotel accommodation-Canberra would not be able to accommodate the total numbers required. In addition there is the problem of conference facilities. Therefore the decision was made to hold the conference in Melbourne. The Government is obviously concerned about security, as any government must be in this modern age with the kind of events that have occurred around the world. All appropriate security arrangements have been made and are being made for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Melbourne.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Both the Commonwealth and Victorian governments are working very closely together on the security arrangements and I know that the Victoria Police are taking their obligations very seriously as one would expect. The heads of government will be asked to send their own security advisers to Australia before the meeting to satisfy themselves as to the adequacy of security measures. It is a heavy responsibility on the security authorities and on the Victoria Police but I am conscious of the great deal of attention and effort that is being devoted to this task. The Government is confident that security arrangements of the highest possible order will be in place for the Heads of Government Meeting in Melbourne and of course also for the retreat in Canberra. I think that the reports are unfortunate. They are inaccurate. I hope that I have put the matter into perspective.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Treasurer to his statement yesterday in announcing Cabinet's rejection of his broad-based indirect tax proposal when he said that he was hopeful that significant income tax cuts could still be achieved by reducing government expenditure. I ask: How does the Treasurer square that statement with the Prime Minister's statement yesterday that it would be too much to expect significant tax cuts to result from the expenditure review operation of the Lynch committee? Further, how does he rationalise his supposed concern to achieve lower personal taxes with the Prime Minister's statement yesterday that the Government is firmly com- mitted to only half tax indexation, thereby implying a continually increasing burden of personal income tax in future years?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="20" SPEAKER="Howard The Hon J.W." NAMEID="ZD4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="BENNELONG" MINISTERIAL="TREASURER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know that the honourable member for Gellibrand is casting around for a few opportunities to attack the Government on the question of taxation, but to suggest, just because the Prime Minister says that the extent of the Government's commitments in an area for the current year relates to half tax indexation, that that automatically means that there will be no scope for personal tax adjustments in some shape or form in the future is to misunderstand the situation totally. I said yesterday, I have said previously and I repeat tonight that the only responsible way to have sustainable reductions in the taxation burden in this country is to control and reduce government spending. That applies irrespective of the mix of taxation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the last couple of months the Government has looked at a change in the mix or combination of taxation in our community. It is no secret that there are arguments for and against a change. Of course, in relative terms this country relies more heavily than many other countries on personal taxes. Equally, it has to be said that, as a percentage of gross domestic product, we pay less tax by far than the average for the industrialised countries. We pay far less taxation than those countries held up as socialist ideals by the Opposition, such as Sweden and Denmark. Sweden pays 52.2 per cent of gross domestic product by way of taxation against an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development average of 36 per cent and a percentage in Australia of 28.8; yet the Labor Opposition berates us on the question of taxation. After assessing the arguments both for and against, the Government decided that on balance the most important thing it should concern itself with in 1981 is continuing to achieve its anti-inflationary objective.</PARA>
<PARA> That objective has underpinned the economic progress this country has made over the last five years. Members of the Opposition have refused to recognise that economic progress because it has flown in the face of all their predictions. One is reminded of what the Leader of the Opposition said about the 1978 Budget, the 1979 Budget and the 1980 Budget. He said that those three Budgets would drive Australia into a state of recession. It is some recession when this country's growth prospects over the next 18 months are regarded by the OECD as much better than those of any other country in the industrialised area! Faced with a difficult choice about the sort of taxation mix that this country should have, the Government decided yesterday, taking all factors into account and having particular regard to the inflationary consequences of moving to a greater reliance on indirect taxes, that the best decision in economic terms for it to take was the decision which was taken and which I announced yesterday.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to inform the honourable member for the Northern Territory that before approval of the development of the Koongarra project can take place a number of conditions must be fulfilled. First of all, a conclusion has to be reached between the Aboriginal people-the Northern Land Council-and the company concerned about the arrangements. There has also to be completion of the necessary environmental procedures and there has to be compliance with the Government's foreign investment guideline rules. On 22 January this year the Chairman of the Northern Land Council said that the traditional land owners were prepared to authorise formal negotiations with the company as far as the terms and conditions were concerned. I believe the traditional land owners and the Northern Land Council deserve congratulations for making such a positive move.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the environmental aspect, I inform the House that the then Minister for Home Affairs and Environment wrote to me on 12 February this year. He advised that the object of the environment protection legislation had been met and complied with in relation to the Koongarra project and that there were no environmental objections to approval being given to Koongarra provided it met certain conditions.</PARA>
<PARA> On the question of equity participation, as honourable members know, Koongarra is owned by Denison Australia Pty Ltd which is a wholly owned Canadian company. It will be necessary for 75 per cent equity participation. I am sure that many Australian firms and individuals would be willing to participate in this venture which I believe should prove to be successful.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask a question of the Treasurer. Of course, I am inspired to do so from his answer to a question asked by the honourable member for Gellibrand a few seconds ago. Does the Treasurer recall the 1975 policy speech of the Prime Minister, effectively re-endorsed in 1977, in which the following statements were made: 'We will reduce the tax burden', 'We will fully index personal income tax for inflation over three years' and 'It will make government more honest with your money'? In view of the fact that none of these things have been done, that taxes in Australia are at their highest level ever and that his comments of a few seconds ago to the effect that taxes here were proportionately lower than taxes in most industrialised nations, is that evidence that in his belief income tax reductions are no longer a worthwhile objective and in fact higher tax levels similar to those applying in other countries, to which he referred, are an objective worthy of striving for? If not, will he state explicitly what is the Government's policy in relation to tax?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I state quite explicitly that it remains the objective of this Government, where it is economically possible and responsible to do so, to achieve reductions in taxation. It is not the objective of this Government as it is so clearly the objective of the Opposition, as evidenced by the statements of the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Gellibrand, to increase the size of the public sector and thereby the taxation take in this community. It is the honourable member for Gellibrand who made that famous promise to a meeting of Labor economists. One part of his promise was proved correct. He said: 'Labor is unlikely to gain office in 1980 and by 1983 when we might have a possibility of gaining office we will face a mammoth task in persuading the Australian community to have a larger public sector and to pay the higher taxation needed to finance that public sector'. Those are the words of the alternative Treasurer of this country. They are in black and white. They have never been repudiated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In case the honourable member for Gellibrand is feeling a little lonely in his addiction to doctrinaire socialism, we have the words of the Leader of the Opposition who in his F. E. Chamberlain memorial lecture said: 'We have had a lot of these deeply dispiriting dogmas lately.' Those deeply dispiriting dogmas were propositions based on lower taxation. They are very strange words indeed from the Leader of the Opposition who seeks to impugn the credentials of this Government so far as tax reform is concerned.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QS4">Mr MALCOLM FRASER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There has been an enormous and a wonderful response to the national appeal that was launched right around Australia. Something like $4m has been collected by the national appeal committee for the Italian earthquake relief fund and all of those people who have worked for that committee within the Italian community and in the wider Australian community. The national committee, of course, has been supported by committees at the State level. The Commonwealth Government encouraged the appeal by allowing tax deductibility for donations made. It also provided half a million dollars and indicated that it would match contributions from State governments with a further dollar for dollar contribution. I am advised that the States' contributions stand at approximately $160,000. Beyond that the Commonwealth Government has shared with the Tasmanian Government half the cost of providing approximately 800 tents to help with immediate relief for people who have lost their homes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All in all, Australia has provided some very substantial relief. I believe that that is a great credit to the communities and the committees concerned. The national committee will be largely responsible for determining how the funds are to be used. That will be done in consultation with the Australian and Italian governments. Certainly it is our hope that the funds will be used mostly for longer term, identifiable, permanent projects that will have a continuing and significant benefit for the communities concerned in Italy.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition to these matters, of course, the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs has sought to assist with family reunions, easier entry into Australia and in a number of other ways, thus building upon the very close links many Australians of Italian descent have with their country of origin. I would like to compliment all of those who have been involved in raising a very substantial sum. I am certain that it will be used for very worthwhile causes and will be of continuing benefit to the communities concerned.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Through the policies of the Commonwealth Government and through the operations of the Foreign Investment Review Board, which is designed to maximise and which has maximised Australian involvement and investment in major resource projects, Australian involvement and shareholding in resource projects certainly are maximised. The objectives of foreign investment policy have been clearly stated by the Treasurer and by the Minister for Trade and Resources on a number of occasions. I would have thought that the benefits from significant resource development would stand clear even for the Australian Labor Party. Quite clearly they include not only the benefits for those who are immediately employed on the projects and the benefits for the Australian shareholders who are involved, but also many other jobs and much work for subcontractors and Australian firms have to be considered. The fact that this country is now starting to move forward on a strong growth path in a quite different way from that of most other countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development where many economies are stagnant is very significantly as a result of our overall economic policies. The resource management and resource policy are a significant part of that. We know very well that the Australian Labor Party has had a view which would have very significantly impeded, held up, pushed out of this country major resource developments. Members of the Australian Labor Party do not believe in the same kind of partnership as we do. They do not believe in a strongly growing economy, as we do. We on this side of the House believe that a growing economy is essential to rising living standards and essential also in enabling State and Commonwealth governments to have available the resources needed to provide schools or hospitals or government services of one kind or another.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, as the Minister in the Government responsible for taxation matters, have said a number of things about the flat rate concept of taxation. I think my comments were given a fair amount of publicity in recent weeks. In the light of the fairly fulsome comments that I have made, I do not really think that there is a great deal I can add. But in case the honourable member for Adelaide thinks I have paid Parliament less than its proper due in providing explanations of my views on flat rate taxation, may I refer him to an answer I gave in about August or September last year-perhaps it was even earlier-I think in answer to the honourable member for Hume, who asked me a question on flat rate taxation. I think the honourable member will find that most of the material that I have referred to in recent weeks is contained in the reply that I gave to my colleague.</PARA></TALK.START>

Will the Minister indicate whether Qantas will be allowed to operate in a freer market place prior to the aviation review scheduled for later this year?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For some time the Government has been under pressure from the Australian Federation of Travel Agents and, until the middle of last year, the Board of Qantas to enforce the provisions of regulation 106A to try to stamp out illegal discounting because Qantas, as the Australian flag carrier, had to abide by Australian law. Illegal discounting has placed Qantas in a very difficult trading position on the domestic market. We have been well aware of that difficulty. The Government has a responsibility under international treaties to uphold the provisions of the regulation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As late as last year approximately 100 of the world's international aviation countries met and supported a motion that the parties to the bilateral agreements which provide for the setting of international air fares should abide by the provisions of the law. I gave fair warning over the last 12 months that the Government would take action to enforce the provisions of the law. Honourable members should remember that the Australian Federation of Travel Agents and Qantas wanted the law enforced. The Department of Transport set out to fulfil its responsibility in this regard. I have had further meetings with the Board of Qantas and with AFTA. As a result of those meetings, I will be reporting to Cabinet in the not too distant future.</PARA>

Will the Government take the initiative in this region for the first time and ask that a conference be held between the Association of South East Asian Nations and Vietnam, with Australia as the honest broker, in order to formulate peaceful proposals for the future of the Kampuchean people with a view that such a conference be a forerunner, at Australia's suggestion, to a major conference including all the super powers?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Obviously, it would be highly desirable for Vietnam to attend. At the moment it seems unlikely that it will. I hope it does. I am also aware that there have been some moves for a regional conference to discuss certain questions, but I believe that that would more logically follow a fully representative international conference which called for the withdrawal of troops and for internationally supervised free elections.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Considerable diplomatic activity is still being conducted on this matter by the ASEAN countries. Australia hopes that out of that will emerge a political settlement-we believe that an eventual settlement has to be a political one-to the Kampuchean question. The ASEAN countries were the original sponsors of the resolution in the United Nations. Australia believes, quite properly, that as those nations are the front line States in the area the future conduct of events following that resolution should be left primarily in their hands. However, we will give them all the support we can.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Prime Minister. I ask: Have proposals been received from any of the State governments regarding future tax sharing arrangements? In view of reports that the Tasmanian Government is now predicting a final deficit for this year twice that originally budgeted for, has that Government made any request for special funding? Does the Prime Minister have any advice for the State governments when preparing their future budgets?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QS4">Mr MALCOLM FRASER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tasmania is treated extraordinarily generously by the Commonwealth Government. Payments to it per capita are larger than those to other States and a number of special programs have been designed quite specifically to assist Tasmania in regard to special problems. I suppose that trade equalisation would be the most significant of these. It is now becoming very clearly understood by all Tasmanians that within the Tasmanian Government administration there is a level of inefficiency which is disturbing. If the honourable gentleman's projections in relation to the Tasmanian Budget are correct, plainly that State's budgetary situation is out of control. I will check the latest correspondence to see whether there are any recent messages from the Tasmanian Premier concerning that State's general budgetary position. I do not think that there have been any such communications or requests.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All the States have put forward a document in which they make some suggestions about the way in which the Commonwealth payments to the States might be worked out after 30 June, before which date the current arrangements are due for renewal. The document is not definitive. The States have put forward alternatives and options and it is worth noting that originally, in September of last year, the Premiers had a meeting to work out a common position to put to the Commonwealth. We received the document about 10 days ago. Therefore it took a long while for the States, consulting together, to work out some kind of a common position, but it was not a definitive one. It left open certain options. Obviously, the Commonwealth is now examining the document, but it will also be examining the level of funding that ought to be accorded the States in general revenue terms.</PARA>
<PARA> One of the benefits of some recent events in Queensland is that we are starting to look at the way in which expenditure per capita has risen within the States and the extent to which taxation could be reduced by State governments themselves if they even held expenditure level, in real per capita terms, instead of expending moneys on a continually rising plane. I do not have the Tasmanian figures with me but if my recollection is correct the people of Queensland could have been relieved of some $700m to $800m in State taxation in 1978-80 if the level of expenditure, in real terms, had been held at the level which obtained when the present Government took office.</PARA>
<PARA> I have no doubt that these matters will all be taken into account when the Commonwealth makes its decisions. State and local governments spend about 50 per cent of all revenues collected. Some is by way of transfer payments from the Commonwealth to the States but they are the end spenders of about 50 per cent of all government revenues. Quite plainly, if you take the view, as the Commonwealth does, that tax cuts need to be financed out of expenditure restraints, then clearly the States have a very real role in that regard. I am delighted to find any State Premier urging me to introduce tax cuts because I know that he will contribute accordingly at the next Premiers Conference and will ask for less, so that taxes can be reduced.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member might have had a good dinner, but I am not quite sure of the last reference in his question. I suggest it is rather disappointing so early in his parliamentary term that the honourable member has fallen foul of this concept of finding the big bogey man in an Australian who really has distinguished his country in an extraordinary way on the United Kingdom and New York scenes. I think it is quite extraordinary that the Australian Labor Party, of which the honourable member is a member, should take such a contrary point of view to its former leader who, in 1972 if we all remember rightly, on more than one occasion seemed to find that that same gentleman was very much a supporter of his cause. With regard to the balance of the honourable member's question, I say to him that if he or any other member of the Opposition wishes to express any views as to possible changes in the Broadcasting and Television Act, of course, the Government will be very happy to receive them.

I should also indicate that, although the Opposition will support the passage of these Bills, the fact that we are debating them tonight in this Parliament is an indictment of the Government for its complacency. This Parliament has been waiting and, more importantly, the Australian public and the National Companies and Securities Commission have been waiting for far too long for the legislation to be brought into effect. The principal legislation to which these amendments relate was detailed in this House on 16 April last year, which, by anybody's judgment, is a fair while ago. Ten months later we are discussing amendments which were first introduced last August-horses, which have birthdays in August, are almost six months older by now-and we still do not have a national companies and securities code operating in Australia, despite the fact that the whole area of national companies and securities law was first put before the Parliament by the Labor Government in 1975 and by the Labor Opposition in 1976. </PARA>
<PARA> The delays which this package of legislation has suffered must be virtually unprecedented in the history of this Parliament, but the Government clearly is not concerned. The delays are by no means over yet because after these amendments pass through the Parliament they will still need to be given effect through application laws to be passed by each State of the Commonwealth. That is an indication of how cumbersome this scheme is. The members of the Opposition have consistently warned of these delays. Enough time has passed and so little action has occurred that we can now claim that we have been proven right. One must not forget, of course, that the final draft of the companies Bill is yet to be introduced into the Parliament. We will not be debating that in this session. On the basis of this Government's record we will be lucky to see its provisions in effect before well into 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth remembering that the need for uniformity in companies and securities legislation has long been recognised. The founding fathers, dare I say, included the corporation's power-section 51 (xx)-in the Federal Constitution. In 1959 the objective of uniformity was again re- affirmed by a meeting of Commonwealth and State Attorneys-General. In the 1960s and 1970s we saw the first attempt at co-operation with the establishment of the Standing Committee of the Company Law Advisory Committee, known as the Eggleston Committee, and the Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange under the chairmanship of Senator Peter Rae. All these expensive, expert and exhaustive efforts over a period of more than 20 years have been treated nonchalantly, almost in a cavalier fashion, by this Government. Over this period we have seen at least two major boom-bust cycles in the Australian share markets which have done enormous damage to the efficiency and the credibility of the securities industry and, as a result, to the Australian economy. We are now well into a third boom. We are still waiting for an effective body of law to regulate companies and securities in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> This neglect by the Government is having increasingly unsatisfactory effects. In recent months we have witnessed the development of a strain of parochial independence in a number of States, most notably Queensland, which is the State of the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Moore). This potentially threatens the whole notion of a uniform companies and securities law in Australia. I would like to relate what the Queensland Government has done. It has intervened to prevent what it calls southern takeover bids for Evans Deakins Industries and Walkers Ltd. This intervention was successful. These two companies are now in the final stages of a merger. But it is not a matter of whether the takeovers in these cases were a good or bad thing. </PARA>
<PARA> There are reasons for believing that there has been an excessive number of takeovers in Australia. Perhaps it might be said there has also been an excessive centralisation of corporate control in the financial capitals of Sydney and Melbourne. But these were not necessarily the considerations of the Queensland Government. No assessment of the costs and benefits of the takeovers in terms of the public interest, the national interest and the interest of maintaining effective competition in the market place was undertaken. The Government's only concern was the protection of local managers. This has now had the effect of protecting, through precedent, all managers in Queensland from any threat of takeover. This cannot achieve anything more than a reduction in the efficiency of industry in that State. </PARA>
<PARA> The simple irony of this, of course, is that the xenophobic Premier of Queensland, who springs so anxiously to the defence of Australian owned and Queensland based companies from takeovers by other Australian owned companies in other States, has formed an alliance with a company which is 49 per cent American owned-that is, the MIM company-in order to protect Australian companies from Australian companies. That seems to me to be rather strange. The Premier of Queensland has been responsible for handing over to international interests-the Iwasaki organisation-large tracts of freehold land on the Australian coastline, yet the same gentleman is almost paranoid about any interference in the affairs of a Queensland based company by another Australian company. It appears that Mr Bjelke-Petersen is very concerned about seeing that the lines which our founding fathers drew on the maps should be an impenetrable barrier for any sort of commercial improvement in Australia's situation. </PARA>
<PARA> The point is that if the national Government had a responsible takeovers and mergers law and it was administered by an independent body, such as the Trade Practices Commission, according to clear guidelines set down by statute the legitimate concerns of the Queensland Government, if any of its concerns were legitimate, would have been satisfied. The same applies, of course, to the actual conduct of the takeover bids which should be regulated by a national acquisition of shares law which ensures that all parties to the bid are able to make reasonable judgment about its merits. </PARA>
<PARA> By failing to make provision for those national forms of regulation, the Fraser Government has caused the further fragmentation and restriction of Australian industry and corporate life that we have been struggling against since before Federation. I am sorry to say that there will be many more examples of this fragmentation. Already the Victorian Government has begun its inquiry into newspaper ownership, following the shock it received from the News Group bid for the Herald and Weekly Times group. Once again, this is a matter properly dealt with by Commonwealth law, as indeed it almost certainly was until the Government watered down the Trade Practices Act in 1977. But this too looks like becoming an area where the States impose controls which damage our efforts at uniformity. </PARA>
<PARA> The securities industry is also suffering from the procrastination of the Government and from the enormous delays which the co-operative approach to companies and securities legislation entails. The recent resources boom, and the strength of the stock exchange indices over the past two years-I see the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs is smiling at that, being an old stockbroker-have at last re-established the exchanges as a vehicle for raising capital for development. This follows a long period of dispute after the fiasco of phoney floats which characterised the boom in the late 1960s. It is a tragedy that adequate and uniform regulation has not yet been achieved in the securities industry to stop some of the nefarious practices which can so easily destroy the Australian corporate image and the efficacy of the stock exchange as a means of raising local capital for our development. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to a particular case that highlights what I am saying. In recent months we have seen an example of the type of sharp practice to which I have referred which we in the Opposition view in a very alarming light. I refer to the Negri River Corporation whose shares are presently being traded on Australian stock exchanges. This speculative float has been the subject of some Press coverage since my colleague, Senator Evans, the shadow Attorney-General, raised the matter in the Senate on 5 December last. </PARA>
<PARA> The Negri River Corporation is presently the subject of an investigation by the New South Wales Corporate Affairs Commission, as well it might be. The facts as presently known surrounding the issue by this company of its prospectus are very disturbing and to my mind highlight the inadequacies of the present regime of corporate control, and in fact the total sham of the self-regulatory powers Australian stock exchanges presently cling to. The facts surrounding this float as I know them once again raise the spectre of manipulation of the share buying public in the circumstances of a share market boom when people attempted, by virtue of easy profits to be made, to take their money out of building societies, savings banks and so on to invest in some speculative undertakings. According to information which I have in my possession, the prospectus for the Negri River Corporation issued on 4 November 1980 did not contain the report of a consulting geologist, Dr Peter Solomon, a man, I might add, who is not unknown to the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender). This report suggested quite conclusively that the two leases owned by the Negri River Corporation were most unlikely to yield diamonds and in fact were not worthy of future exploration. </PARA>
<PARA> By not including this report in the prospectus, the promoters of the company were clearly in a much better informed position than the share-buying public. They were in a position to form a judgment about the prospects of the exploration leases which other prospective shareholders were unable to assess. It is therefore disturbing that the three promoters of the company have been allocated directly or indirectly 3,500,000 shares, or half the total issued capital of the company. It is also of concern that at least one of these people, Sir Asher Joel, has reputedly sold sufficient of his holdings to enable him to recover his initial investment plus an unknown amount of profit. This action was made possible by the fact that the promoters' shares issued privately by the company at 20c per share have traded on the stock exchange with the public issue at up to $2 each based, of course, on a market which has been denied significant information in relation to the value or otherwise of the company's assets. </PARA>
<PARA> The Solomon report was commissioned in mid 1979 by the original lease holders, Messrs Beith, Lance and Cooper. Beith later passed his 15 per cent leaseholding in trust to an Asher Joel company, Design and Construction of Mt Isa. After the Ashton diamond strike in the Kimberleys, an area remotely connected geographically with the Negri River leases, the Negri River leases of course assumed a new importance. The new promoters quickly organised another geological survey. This report of Professor Vaisey, the consulting geologist, is very cautious with the words 'could have' and 'would have' recurring throughout. There is no reason to doubt the bona fides of this report, but the investor appeal of its findings would have been much reduced by the inclusion of the similarly cautious, but negative report of Dr Peter Solomon. </PARA>
<PARA> None of the three present promoters-that is Joel, Lance and Cooper-is a director of the company. Their role in the promotion of the company is relevant to whether their possession of the Solomon report can be attributed to the company and can therefore be said to have been fraudulently or negligently omitted from the prospectus. In any event, their knowledge of existence of the report and its contents provide in my judgment almost overwhelming evidence of insider trading of the worst kind. Therefore, I foreshadow that the Opposition will move in the Senate in the next couple of days to have the whole sorry Negri River Corporation affair referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs where the truth behind this shadowy speculative issue might be uncovered. </PARA>
<PARA> Graham Beith, the original shareholder, upon hearing of the float to the public last December minus the Solomon report went to the listing committee of the Melbourne Stock Exchange to complain of what he considered to be a fraudulent prospectus. In Beith's words, he was told: 'These people are establishment, Sir Asher Joel, and Sir Davis Hughes-nothing can be done'. Further, he was told: 'Be smart, take your money and run'. Fortunately he did not run and perhaps the Senate Committee if it picks up the reference will justify Beith's high-principled stand. He was in fact allotted 15,000 shares in the float but to his eternal credit he refused to trade in them. The fact that promoters can cloak a spectacular float with the respectability of well known and titled directors, albeit that these directors might not be fully aware of all the murky facts, and thus obtain a listing, is a matter of great concern. </PARA>
<PARA> Our national corporate image is at stake. We cannot afford another stock exchange scandal of the dimensions of the late 1960s. I am sure the Minister would agree with me. The names Minsec, Poseidon and Tasminex still haunt our memories. We must not allow another re-run of this sorry period. Negri River Corporation might yet prove to be a sound investment. For the investors' sakes I hope so. However, I seriously doubt this will be the case. If we had the sort of national body which the Labor Party envisaged in 1974 managing our securities industry things might be different. I am sure of one thing-given the sinister allegations made surrounding this float-and that is that given proper national control these Negri River Corporation shares would have been suspended from trading until all the facts were known. This has not happened. They are still trading on the Australian stock exchanges which is a matter of enormous concern to me. The Opposition sincerely hopes that when the National Companies and Securities Commission has its full powers-admittedly limited as they might be-the overwhelming decent body of share traders in Australia will be able to polish their now tarnished prestige and set about restoring our national securities image. I am sure the Minister will also agree with that. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the specific provisions of these four Bills. A number of the provisions are of a machinery or relatively inconsequential nature. As a whole, they represent some tidying up of the principal Acts. However, some of the provisions are also substantive and I will comment briefly on some of them. The Opposition has no objection to the provisions contained in the National Companies and Securities Commission Amendment Bill. The independence of State Auditors-General should ensure that the provisions of clause 6 do not result in any difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of the Companies (Acquisition of Shares) Amendment Bill, the Opposition welcomes the Government's decision to include the provisions at clause 18. This clause provides that an offeror in its part A or part C statement should indicate its plans for the continuation of the business of the target company, including the future employment of the company's staff. This style of provision has been sought by the Opposition and was contained in the abortive Labor Bills of 1975. I might add that it is included in the London and American codes for securities. We in the Opposition consider that this is the very least that can be done on behalf of the employees of companies who are the targets of takeovers. It is to be hoped that the decision of the Government to include this provision will be only a first step towards a more general recognition of the rights of employees under company law and, indeed, the law in general. </PARA>
<PARA> At this stage, I think it is reasonable to point out that my colleagues, the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi) and the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford), have consistently pushed for this provision to be included in these Bills since they were first introduced into the House. I am sure that those honourable members will be pleased that these rather humanitarian provisions have been included by the Minister's Department. The only other comment I wish to make on this Bill is that it provides further extensions of the discretionary powers of the National Companies and Securities Commission-for example, in giving consent to profit forecasts or asset valuations and to the variation of takeover offers. I am aware of the benefits of flexibility which such provisions allow. But it must be noted that these provisions also substantially increase the burden of responsibility imposed upon the Commission. It is to be hoped that this transfer of responsibility from the legislature to the Commission will not prove to be an abdication of responsibility. These provisions deal with matters of real concern and a rubber stamp approach should not be adopted by the Commission. I am pretty confident that it will not be adopted. </PARA>
<PARA> If we turn to the Securities Industries Amendment Bill, we find that further adjustments to the powers of the National Companies and Securities Commission are proposed. I earlier indicated that although the Opposition will not oppose these Bills it is not entirely happy with some of the changes made by this Bill. We support the Bill because we do not want to see any further delays in its implementation. In some cases the powers of the Commission to obtain information are reduced; the grounds for defence to a prosecution relating to false or misleading information are extended, proven copies, rather than the originals of books, will be allowed in evidence, and information may be required of a person only if that person is able to provide it. However reasonable these provisions may appear to be, it is always possible that they can work to hinder unduly the powers of the Commission. It is to be hoped that the Ministerial Council will be willing to amend them quickly if the need arises. Of course, the Bill also provides for the extension of the powers of the National Companies and Securities Commission, in dealing in securities, to require a director, secretary or executive officer to disclose information and to ask questions pertinent to ascertaining the nature and extent of relevant interests. The Opposition supports these provisions which were sought by the Commission. In its view the existing legislation gives it inadequate power to perform its intended functions. The Opposition also has no objection to the clarifications made in the Companies and Securities (Interpretation and Miscellaneous Provisions) Amendment Bill 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I reiterate that the Opposition supports the Bills, not because it believes that the co-operative companies and securities scheme will work satisfactorily but because it recognises more clearly than does the Government the urgent need for some action in these areas. I will detail what the Opposition believes the co-operative scheme does. Firstly, it abdicates the responsibility for companies and securities regulation given to the Commonwealth by the Constitution and clearly shown by the Rae Committee, the Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange, to require action. Secondly, it places uniformity before reform in an area where reform is desperately needed. Thirdly, it represents a slow and tedious process which, in an ever-changing world, will never match the real needs of the day. Accordingly, I move:</PARA>
<PARA> That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA> 'whilst not opposing the Bill, the House:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) expresses its concern at the Government's abdication of its responsibility to make national laws for corporations and the securities industry pursuant to the Commonwealth's own constitutional powers, and in accordance with the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange in 1974 (the Rae Report);</PARA>
<PARA> (b) notes that the legislative scheme of which this Bill is a part places uniformity before reform, and creates both the danger and the likelihood that lowest common denominator standards will prevail;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) expresses its concern at the lack of effective accountability of the National Companies and Securities Commission, to either the Government or the Parliament of the Commonwealth, or to any other single elected Government or Parliament;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) notes that amendments to close loopholes in company law are continually necessary, but, while acknowledging that pursuant to the Formal Agreement, any proposed amendment may need to be the subject of consultation with the Ministerial Council before final acceptance by the Government, nonetheless insists upon this Parliament's right to properly scrutinise and amend all legislation put before it by the Executive, and</PARA>
<PARA> (e) calls upon the Government in the event of the breakdown for any reason of the scheme embodied in the Bill, to immediately proceed to the introduction of Commonwealth legislation for the national regulation of the acquisition of shares'. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that amendment will be seconded by the honourable member for Griffith (Mr Humphreys). I would like to pay some form of quiet tribute to the Minister for his co-operation in presenting this Bill and also to his staff who have been very co-operative in their efforts to brief the Opposition. We appreciate the gestures of the Minister and his staff. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The four Bills we are considering in this joint debate seek to amend substantive legislation dealing with companies and securities passed last year in the main by the Thirty-first Parliament. The most notable of these amending Bills is the Securities Industry Amendment Bill which will give wider investigative powers to the National Companies and Securities Commission. The rest of the amendments are relatively minor and, rather than detail them, it may be salutory if we consider in this new Thirty-second Parliament where we are at present with regard to the co-operative legislative scheme and what remains to be done. In doing so, I will refer firstly to the unique co-operative and uniform approach to the legislative package that these Bills in part amend. Secondly, we should remind ourselves of the major innovations of the new companies and securities legislation. Thirdly, we should note the important legislation yet to come which will complete Australia's latest nationwide attempt to provide a sensible framework within which much of her industry and commerce will carry on business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The need for uniformity particularly, though by no means exclusively, in the business area has long been recognised. However, it has proven difficult to achieve. An important step was taken in 1961 and 1962 when all State parliaments passed uniform companies Acts. The terms of the new legislation had been settled by the standing committees of State and Commonwealth Attorneys-General. Unfortunately, the Acts did not remain uniform for long. Differences of substance are infrequent and many differences occur only in expression and organisation. Unfortunately, changes have often been legislated at different times which, at the least, is confusing and adds to the confusion of even minor differences. In addition, South Australia and Tasmania did not have securities industry legislation. Furthermore, some States have taken unilateral action to protect parochial interests. An example of that is the South Australian case with its Santos legislation. I should add that the new scheme still may not prevent this from happening but at least great progress has been made towards achieving uniformity and ensuring uniformity in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> In the early 1970s, fearing the possibility of the Commonwealth legislating to cover companies and securities, New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia formed the Interstate Corporate Affairs Commission. The four member States still were unable to achieve complete uniformity in their Acts, notwithstanding this step. In December 1978 the Commonwealth and all six States executed a formal agreement which is the basis of the legislative package already passed and the Bills still to come. The agreement contains four essential elements. Firstly, it formalises the Ministerial Council which is comprised of one Minister representing each State and the Commonwealth. The Council must reach unanimous agreement on all initial legislation but subsequent amendments require only majority approval. Secondly, there is agreement to establish the National Companies and Securities Commission. The NCSC, subject to direction by the Ministerial Council, will administer the legislation under the scheme. It has various powers including powers to hold hearings, summon witnesses and delegate most of its powers and functions to State and Territory corporate affairs officers. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, the formal agreement provides for maximum use of existing State and Territory corporate affairs offices. Although the legislation gives all powers and functions to the NCSC, the use of existing offices will ensure a decentralised administration of the scheme. They will carry out their functions much as they always have, with steps being taken, however, to ensure a uniform approach from State to State. The fourth element is a legislative framework which involves the States adopting the scheme legislation in force in the Australian Capital Territory. The Australian Capital Territory will be the first to pass all this legislation, which will then be adopted by the States and the other Territories. Subsequent amendments to the Australian Capital Territory's legislation, of course, will apply automatically in the other jurisdictions participating in the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The scheme provided for in the formal agreement thus addresses itself to three problem areas noted by the Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange, which was chaired by Senator Rae. They were: Lack of national uniformity in the law; lack of national uniformity in administrative practices; and lack of national uniformity in the quality of administration. The Rae Committee reported in 1974 on Australian securities markets and their regulation. The formal agreement provides that the co-operative scheme legislation should be substantially in conformity with the Interstate Corporate Affairs Commission legislation. Some changes, of course, have been agreed to, but the Ministerial Council has deferred a number of other modifications so as to get the co-operative scheme in operation as soon as possible. It is anticipated that there will be a large task of reform of companies and securities legislation to follow, and for this task the formal agreement establishes a Companies and Securities Law Review Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> In deciding upon the co-operative approach to the scheme, the Commonwealth could have considered a number of different ways of achieving uniform legislation. It could have taken on itself the passing of legislation declared to apply nationwide. Apart from any possible constitutional problems, this approach undoubtedly would be seen by some States as riding roughshod over their powers and functions, and that is something to be avoided if at all possible. It is this course, as evidenced in the speech of the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown) and in the Australian Labor Party's amendment that the Australian Labor Party would have this Parliament follow. That is why, of course, the amendment proposed by the Labor Party is not supportable. It is not the intention of this Government to ride roughshod over the States. Certainly it would not be my view, coming from a State as well as belonging to the national Parliament, that we should attempt to do so. Rather, in my view the co-operative approach is to be preferred. </PARA>
<PARA> The second way in which the Commonwealth could have approached the issue was to have legislated for interstate corporate activity. However, this would have added another complicated set of laws to various State laws and lessened rather than enhanced the possibilities of achieving unanimity. The Commonwealth, I suppose, could have opted to stay out of the field altogether, except insofar as it has responsibilities for the Territories, but Commonwealth participation is obviously desirable. The honourable member for Parramatta, when he was trying to argue the point for a total Commonwealth approach, regardless of the States, raised one apparent red herring in the debate when he referred to the Negri River affair. Interestingly enough, this is a matter which, is entirely within the powers of the State's Corporate Affairs Commission, and one wonders why the New South Wales Labor Government apparently has done nothing about it. Why that matter has to be dragged into this debate is a little beyond me. We are left with the co-operative scheme which has been devised. I agree that it is not without its difficulties. I agree that in practice it might not work out as well as is presently hoped. Nevertheless, I am personally satisfied that it is the preferable approach to take. We must live with its weaknesses and, above all, try to make it work. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the legislation that has already been passed, some of which these Bills seek to amend. The National Companies and Securities Commission Act was passed in November 1979 and proclaimed on 1 February 1980. Members were subsequently appointed to the Commission, but the Commission will not be in a position to assume its full functions until the substantive Commonwealth legislation under the scheme has been proclaimed and adopting legislation passed in each State. The other substantive legislation which followed included the Companies (Acquisition of Shares) Act, the Companies (Acquisition of Shares-Fees) Act, the Securities Industry Act, the Securities Industry (Fees) Act, and the Companies and Securities (Interpretation and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act. When regulations pursuant to these Acts are approved by parties to the scheme the Acts will be proclaimed. This will make the way clear for the States to pass laws adopting the Commonwealth legislation as their own. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from the formation of the Ministerial Council and the setting up of the NCSC, perhaps the most significant and indeed controversial innovation in the package is the setting down of a code for takeovers, which is enacted in the Companies (Acquisition of Shares) Act. Whilst Australian company law traditionally has been based on British models, the Australian takeovers code is a departure from the British law in this area. The United Kingdom approach to the regulation of takeovers was to formulate a code of good practice known as the City Code on Takeovers. It is an attempt at self-regulation. It does not have the force of law but rather is made up of general principles and rules which should be adhered to in the conduct of takeovers and mergers. The Panel on Takeovers and Mergers which administers the City Code may hold hearings, which are quite informal proceedings, and in the event of any breach the ultimate sanction of the code is to withdraw the facilities of the market from the disobedient corporation. Some people have seen this sort of self-regulation as preferable to an Australian code, or the code that has now been enacted, mainly because it is more flexible and adaptable to the rapidly changing corporate world and the quite acceptable practices it might from time to time adopt. The problem in Australia is that we do not have one centrally located market. A city code type of approach would have to be working in different places geographically far apart. I think that, with some justification, the Government decided in favour of a more formal legislated code. </PARA>
<PARA> The basic thrust of the Companies (Acquisition of Shares) Act is to prohibit acquisitions of between 20 per cent and 90 per cent of the shares in a company unless one of three methods is followed: A gradual acquisition of shares at the rate of 3 per cent every six months; a formal takeover bid based largely on the procedure set down in the current companies Acts; or an unconditional bid for one month on the floor of the stock exchange. There are certain types of transactions exempted from this procedure. However, the Act is quite detailed in its requirements, in contrast to the informal language of the London City Code. As I have indicated, our takeovers provisions are probably the most controversial part of the co-operative scheme legislation. A number of commentators have suggested a number of areas of doubtful interpretation or where the provisions may simply not work. I do not propose to canvass the main points of that debate here. As with the legislative package as a whole, there is sound argument for getting the code going as soon as possible, recognising that in all likelihood there will be a need for reform as we gain experience from its operation. </PARA>
<PARA> It remains for me to consider what is still to be done to complete the co-operative scheme. I could foreshadow a number of Bills yet to be introduced but, rather than going into that detail, I shall confine myself to the one major piece of legislation to be enacted-the new Companies Bill. Whilst this Bill is based largely on existing State legislation, it will have a number of important modifications. The most significant of these will be that an Australian company incorporated in a State or Territory can achieve nationwide recognition without the need for lodging company documents in the other States or Territories. Overseas corporations will similarly have to seek registration in only one place. I need not spell out the advantages of that to industry and commerce and to the legal and accounting professions. </PARA>
<PARA> Once all the scheme legislation is in place the substantive law on companies and securities will be contained largely in three main pieces of legislation-the Companies Act itself, the Securities Industry Act, and the Companies (Acquisition of Shares) Act. Administering all three Acts will be the National Companies and Securities Commission which, as I have mentioned, will be subject to direction by the Ministerial Council. Australia should then have at last uniform legislation with some important innovations, particularly the code on takeovers and mergers. We will have taken a unique co-operative approach to companies and securities law which, for all its weaknesses, should best cater for all the interests to be found in our federation of States. Indeed, it is not putting it too highly to say that, irrespective of whether this co-operative scheme wholly succeeds in its present form, it will prove to be one of the most positive steps ever taken towards providing the framework within which corporate enterprise can prosper and advance Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What we are debating tonight are really amendments to five Bills which were debated in April last year. On that occasion we did not have a full debate on the issue considering the level of complexity and the sheer volume of the Bills at that time. For example, the Companies (Acquisition of Shares) Amendment Bill at that time comprised some 64 clauses and some 84 pages and honourable members were expected to cover that and the four other related Bills in 20 minutes. Be that as it may, we now have before us some further amendments to those Bills which are now Acts. The Opposition appreciates that there will be a need for continuing amendments to be made in a complex area such as this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is the very need for continuing amendments that provokes and leads us to believe that we need companies and securities law which can be amended speedily. The problem with the co-operative legislating set up we have at present is that we simply cannot make speedy amendments. The reasons for that are well known and the Opposition's case on that is well known. It is not for purely idealogical reasons that we want a national approach to the regulation of companies in this country; our desire is based on more pragmatic grounds: We want a system that works. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Herbert (Mr Dean) referred to the Rae Committee, which delivered its report in 1974. Nothing which this Government has done since then has had much to do with the recommendations of the Rae Committee. What the Rae Committee pointed out and showed with great clarity was that the existing law was inadequate. What the Rae Committee tried to do in its recommendations was to protect the investors and not simply to protect the sharebroking industry. It is the investors that this Parliament should be concerned about. Once again, we are supposed to be on the edge of a resources boom. The previous resources boom led to the setting up of the Rae Committee because of all the malpractices which occurred at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not saying that the coming resources boom can be equated with what occurred in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Quite frankly, the coming boom will be of a different form. In this case we know which resources are there to be developed. There will not be as much accent on exploration. I do not think that as many companies will be floated as were floated then. The big problem will be finance, infrastructure and general company formation. It will relate to known resources or to some degree of knowledge of resources. Even so, the Australian Labor Party still adheres to the claim that there is a need for national company legislation to protect the investors. For a long time we have held this opposition to the co-operative scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite clear that we in this Parliament do have the power to have national legislation. As I said, the concept of co-operative federalism does not lend itself to speedy amendments of the type with which we are dealing. These amendments were introduced before the previous Parliament was dissolved and only now are they being debated. That surely is evidence of the fact that we cannot have speedy amendments. These Bills before us apply only to the Australian Capital Territory. Proposals for the amendments will have to go to the six State governments after this legislation is passed. The legislative framework for all this legislation is the so-called legislative device whereby legislative uniformity recognises that States concede no power. But the States have to refer any constitutional power in order that the Commonwealth Parliament may enact a national takeover code, for example. Of course, that power is afforded by section 51 (XX) of the Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA> The only authority for the proposition that that section of the Constitution does not empower the Commonwealth to enact a takeover code is the case of Huddart Parker v. Moorehead, which was based on the reserved powers doctrine since exploded by the High Court in the engineers case. Further, since the concrete pipes case, on any generally accepted view of the scope of section 51 (XX) a Bill such as the one presently under consideration could not be limited in the manner envisaged on constitutional grounds alone. I will not go through all the legal constitutional powers because there is no need to refer to other cases; it is quite clear that the Federal Parliament does have the power to enact national legislation. At the time of the Labor Government from 1972 to 1975, we did introduce Bills for that purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we need also to re-enforce the legal point that the system of co-operative federalism requires that each of the seven legislatures has to confer the relative powers of adjudication upon its own supreme court. Again, if this legislation is challenged by the States we will need to have a complex system of laws devised by the courts in the various States. I guess the judgments they bring down will be uniform also, but again that means delay. This is a long procedure whereby we can gain some sort of uniformity in terms of the adjudication of the law by the courts in the States. Again, that is a reason to say that it is terribly hard to make speedy amendments to this legislation under the co-operative system. I am pleased to see that the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Moore) said this in his second reading speech:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . there is substantial and visible progress towards the completion of the co-operative companies and securities scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>We are pleased to see that there is good agreement between the seven governments involved now. But each of the State governments still can act as a rogue. Each State still has power to act independently. We have seen moves in the Queensland Parliament to stop takeovers by the dreaded people of the south. Luckily, wiser heads have prevailed there and, on the last information I have, they do not plan to proceed with the legislation. Even so, the opportunity exists for any State to act as a rogue in that way for a stupid ideological reason such as that which the Queensland Government was contemplating. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister said that there are areas which need more attention. There is a need to finalise the content of the regulations which will be acquired under the Acts. There is a need to settle the form and content of the companies code which was introduced on 27 August 1980. Then, of course, each State will have to pass a series of Bills after we pass these Bills through this Parliament. What we will have will be a national companies and securities commission (State provisions) Bill in each of the States. Then, of course, we will have an application of laws Bill for each of the four codes in each State. What we are talking about is four codes. The State Bills other than the companies (acquisition of laws) Bill have been cleared by the Ministerial Council for introduction into individual State parliaments, the Minister informs us. However, the Minister states that the 'introduction and passage of the State Bills will depend on the programs of individual State parliaments'. When all that is done the national commission will have to proceed with its administrative arrangements for the administration of the scheme. What I am trying to say and to emphasise is that a co-operative scheme does not lend itself to speedy amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> Last time I spoke on the Companies (Acquisition of Shares) Amendment Bill I referred to the need to bring down to 10 per cent the threshhold for a takeover to be registered. I still wish to record my belief that 10 per cent should be the threshhold level. A minute ago I referred to the four codes. The honourable member for Herbert said that eventually, when all this legislation is passed, we will have three areas of legislation, three areas of law. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He mentioned three major areas of law. I concede that that is a move towards uniformity, but we are yet to have the companies law itself. The Minister in his speech said that that legislation will be introduced this session and I guess that legislation will be debated. But, again, it is a heck of a long time since the need for a uniform companies law in this country was seen to exist. It simply goes on and on. I can see the need for amendments which will take at least six months to go through all the parliaments, even to go through this Parliament, when one considers the time taken in elections and in recesses. I still do not think that the State governments have the capacity that the Commonwealth has to deal with these matters. I think that the Opposition is very much justified in the position it takes on these matters. Opposition members know that the Constitution certainly gives us the necessary power. We believe that the legislation should be national legislation. For those reasons and for quite a few others, I support the amendment moved by my colleague, the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown). The amendment states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That all words after ''That'' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA> ''whilst not opposing the Bill, the House:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) expresses its concern at the Government's abdication of its responsibility to make national laws for corporations and the securities industry pursuant to the Commonwealth's own constitutional powers, and in accordance with the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange in 1974 (the Rae Report);</PARA>
<PARA> (b) notes that the legislative scheme of which this Bill is a part places uniformity before reform, and creates both the danger and the likelihood that lowest common denominator standards will prevail;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) expresses its concern at the lack of effective accountability of the National Companies and Securities Commission, to either the Government or the Parliament of the Commonwealth, or to any other single elected Government or Parliament;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) notes that amendments to close loopholes in company law are continually necessary, but, while acknowledging that pursuant to the Formal Agreement, any proposed amendment may need to be the subject of consultation with the Ministerial Council before final acceptance by the Government, nonetheless insists upon this Parliament's right to properly scrutinise and amend all legislation put before it by the Executive, and</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can and will be brief, but I think that one or two things should be said in answer to the criticisms that have been made by the Opposition of the Bills presently before the House. The first is that what the House is looking at, has been looking at and will be looking at is the single most complex and comprehensive scheme of legislation that has ever gone through this House, so that when there is talk of delay and unnecessary time that has to be borne in mind. It is quite unreal to contrast this kind of legislation with any other legislation by reason of the very width of the fields that it covers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Secondly, it has been said by the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown) and other Opposition members that what should have been put before this House was a scheme resting upon the corporations and trading powers of the Commonwealth. Two things may be said of that. From time to time the Labor Party has been in power in this country and it did not seek to do that until 1974. It sought to do that in 1974 and the Bill which came before the House lapsed when the Labor Government went out of office in 1975. This in itself gives some indication of the complexity of the matters that this kind of legislation covers. More than that, there is a problem as to whether all the legislation-I speak now of the entire package-would be within our power. If it is not, some of it would be the subject of challenge. If, on the other hand, it proceeds on a co-operative basis, the prospects of a successful challenge are very much less. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin) referred to the fact that the State supreme courts would have to adjudicate at some time upon the validity of various parts of the legislation. I am not quite sure how that would arise but if it did arise it would be adjudicated upon no less quickly than would be the case if it went through the Federal courts because any question of the constitutional validity of the legislation must in any event go to the High Court. With all respect to the criticisms that have been made, I would have thought that this complex group of Bills, taken in conjunction with the other legislation which has been before the House and which will be before the House, would be embraced by the Opposition as an example of co-operative federalism. It must be recalled that essentially all the State governments regardless of their political complexions, had to agree to what is before the House. The very fact that agreement could be reached on matters of such immense importance-that is, the regulation of the securities industry, the setting up of companies, the regulation of trading activities and the regulation of a whole host of company and security activities-is a great sign that federalism can work co-operatively in a field such as this and I hope, in other fields as well. </PARA>
<PARA> I will spend one or two minutes commenting briefly upon the three major criticisms made by the honourable member for Parramatta. Firstly, he said that this legislation was an abdication of responsibility. For the reasons I have put it is not. To take the other route would invite constant constitutional challenges of the kind that we have seen, for example, in respect of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. Secondly, the honourable member said that the legislation put uniformity beyond reform. He referred to the provisions relating to takeovers. When I started practice in 1961 there were two sections dealing with takeovers in the then uniform legislation. I think I am right in saying that in the legislation which has come before this House there are 64 clauses and a number of schedules of great detail dealing with takeovers. What does this show? It shows that times have become very much more complex, that the legislation has become very much more complex and, more than that, that reforms have been implemented to meet abuses which have been perceived. Of course, there will be further abuses and the need to pass further legislation. There can be no doubt about that. What is before this House represents a comprehensive attempt to reform many areas of the law on a co-operative basis.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Parramatta instanced clause 18 of the Companies (Acquisition of Shares) Amendment Bill. I agree entirely with what he had to say about clause 5 and clause 5A which are to be inserted in Part A and Part C of the Schedule to the principal Act and relate to statements made by offerors. That is an example of the kind of reform which can be produced by co-operation. He might also have referred to the fact that in the same clause provision is now made for a statement of intentions by offeror companies of what they will do with the business of the target company, that is, whether they will strip the assets or keep it running. That is one more instance of the kind of reform which is before the House. </PARA>
<PARA> Lastly, the honourable member for Parramatta said that the legislation was slow and tedious and that it would not match the needs of today. I do not disagree with the proposition that it will be slow but legislation of this kind, when it is first before the House, will necessarily be slow because of the complexity of the problems that it has to confront. The honourable member said that it will not meet the needs of the day. As I understood him, he simply asserted that that is so. He referred to a company in New South Wales, I suppose in that context. As he knows, that company is under special investigation under provisions which will be in the co-operative legislation and which, I assure him, are widespread enough to meet the needs of any company investigation. I have had to act on two occasions as a special investigator in New South Wales under those provisions. They have been substantially re-enacted in the legislation now before the Parliament. The honourable member commended the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Moore). Of course, I agree with him on that. </PARA>
<PARA> I will sum up by saying that the difference is really one of emphasis. On the one hand it is said: 'Let us put through a national Bill'. On the other hand the Government has taken the view that co-operative legislation is preferable by reason of the problems that have to be confronted, the desire to obtain the co-operation of the State authorities and the desire to avoid endless constitutional confrontation by those who might be adversely affected by the legislation. If I had to make a choice I would certainly opt for the safer route rather than that which would simply invite endless legal quibbles as to the powers of the Parliament to do what it hopes to do and which would exclude co-operation with the States. We are, after all, operating under a Federal system. </PARA>

Feeling for the royal family is deep-seated in the emotions of many Australians and we all share and enjoy the public occasions which add colour to our contemporary scene. Each of us can look back on events in our own lifetime affecting the Royal family and they stand out in our memory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Tonight is such an occasion. Her Majesty the Queen announced from Buckingham Palace just a moment or two ago the engagement of His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales to Lady Diana Spencer. The announcement has been conveyed to His Excellency the Governor-General and to the Australian Government. On behalf of the Government, and all Australians, I welcome the announcement with great pleasure and extend congratulations and good wishes to Prince Charles and Lady Diana. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not able to say that the announcement has caught the Australian people entirely unaware or unprepared. The media has assisted us in, at times, graphic detail. But thus prepared I can say with even greater assurance that we applaud the announcement and look forward with excitement to the pageantry of a Royal wedding. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian people hold Prince Charles in special regard. From the completion of his schooling here as a young man, and his subsequent five visits to Australia, we have come to recognise and applaud his sense of humour and his dedication, his outgoing personality and his concern for people. He has spoken many times of his affection for Australia and Australians. We have a great affection for him, in which his wife-to-be will now share. </PARA>
<PARA> Prince Charles will be visiting Australia again later this year and he will be given a warm welcome. I do not know when we might have the great pleasure of welcoming Lady Diana to Australia, but whenever that is I am certain that the welcome will be equally warm, equally affectionate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Crown gives us a focal point in our development as a nation and links us with our history and our origins. The significance of the monarchy is not diminishing. It is not fading in Australian consciousness. The Queen and her family are part of a living and relevant institution, which in Australia is very much tied to our own institutions and emotions. We all share with Her Majesty the Queen and Prince Philip, and other members of the Royal family, the joy of this particular occasion and to them also we extend our good wishes. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall be conveying our sentiments to Prince Charles and Lady Diana, and to Her Majesty the Queen, on behalf of all Australians. In this I am sure that I shall have the wholehearted support of the members of this House. </PARA>

His Royal Highness, thrice a knight already, is a man of steady judgement who, at the age of 32, has clearly avoided being rushed into matrimony. Among heirs to the British throne, only his great uncle, once Edward VIII, later Duke of Windsor, took longer to embrace matrimony. Prince Charles is unique in the Royal family in that he was educated for a time in Australia at Timbertop and his bride to be has had Australian rural connections through her mother. It seems particularly appropriate that the precisely detailed and authoritative leak on the Royal marriage should have come from that eminent Victorian Mr, but soon to be Lord, Rupert Murdoch.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The last Bonny Prince Charlie was disqualified both by religion and marriage from accession to the British throne. The Act of Succession of 1702, as the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) established in a recent question on notice, is still in force. That Act requires the heir to the throne to marry a protestant. I am sure that there will be many who will be relieved to know that there will be no constitutional crisis, that the historic barriers presented by that legislation will not impede the union of our contemporary Prince Charles and his bride. </PARA>

Prince Charles, at some time in the future I am sure, will accept the increased burden of a much heavier kind of leadership. His wife will have to share that burden and the responsibilities that go with it. As Prince Charles and Lady Diana set out on this demanding course together we offer them our congratulations; we offer them our good wishes for their happiness together; we offer them the firm pledge of our loyalty and support in the great tasks and duties that they will undertake together; and we express confidence that their lives and their service to the nations that they will one day be called upon to lead will be patterned to a large extent on the distinguished and gracious example set them by Her Majesty the Queen and His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to draw the attention of the House and the Australian people to a matter that, because of representations made to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen), is well known to them. It is the case of Squadron Leader Ken Blight, a constituent of mine who fought in the Korean War as a fighter pilot in our Seventy-seventh Squadron. He has been fighting since he retired to have the Australian Government allow all those who are entitled to do so to wear the emblem of the citation made by the first President of the Republic of Korea, Syngman Rhee. I agree that the passing of the late President was not exactly a great loss to humanity, nor is the current President of that country an ardent supporter of democracy, but that is beside the point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The 42 pilots including the commanding officer of the Seventy-seventh Squadron, Wing Commander Spense, who gave their lives did not question the rationale of the adventurist and interventionist policies of the Liberal Government. They did not know that because of the inane policies of the then Government, their supreme sacrifice would be for the maintenance of a regime in South Korea just as oppressive as the one in the north against which they were fighting. Little did they know that in 1980 over 1,000 men and women would be shot and bayoneted in the Kwangju massacre by the troops of General President Chun Doo Whan. The South Korean Leader of the Opposition was nearly put to death recently, and only international pressure saved his life. To describe the tryanny of the South Korean regime I wish to quote from a letter written by Senator Chipp, a former buddy of the Prime Minister, to the South Korean Ambassador. It is dated 9 February 1981, and states:</PARA>
<PARA> Your reply to my telegram filled me with the deepest and coldest contempt both for you and your wretched government. Kim's life may have been spared but he is condemned to a living death in a freezing prison cell. </PARA>
<PARA> I take comfort only from the fact that while you may have broken his health you will never break his spirit. His commitment to democracy is a shining ideal which will live on long after the petty tyrant Chun is forgotten. </PARA>
<PARA> Your most arrogant and hypocritical letter is all that could be expected from a tyrant's lackey. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that even honourable members opposite and the Minister for Education (Mr Fife), who is at the table, will have enough intelligence to understand, in hindsight, how futile were their policies when they slavishly followed American expansionist policies in Asia and backed their stupidity with the lives of our servicemen. Having said all this, I cannot see why Squadron Leader Blight and his men should not be allowed to wear the emblem of the citation awarded to them. They served faithfully and fought valiantly, and it is no fault of theirs that the Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence are ashamed-or should be-of the policies of their Party. They are trying to hide behind technicalities such as that the Queen will not approve the emblem. I do not know what the Queen has to do with our military adventurism. Certainly she had the good sense to keep out of our involvement in Vietnam, which was another classic example of the futile sacrifice of the lives of our soldiers on the altar of reaction and conservatism. It is somewhat of an irony that I, a supporter of peace and co-operation between nations, have to ask the Minister for Defence and the Prime Minister-two bellicose gentleman-to approve the wearing of the emblem by people who served this nation. In part, the citation says:</PARA>
<PARA> This squadron entered the Korean War . . . flying Mustang aircraft, it earned the highest reputation for itself . . . . and it won the admiration and friendship of all units it supported . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The citation was signed by Syngman Rhee. I call on the Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence to stop passing the buck and afford recognition where recognition is due. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the short time available to me tonight, I wish to mention the devastating drought which has encompassed the whole of New South Wales and a major portion of Queensland. There is no doubt that this has been the worst drought this part of the world has experienced. It is quite evident that this Government, along with the State governments, must give greater consideration to the construction of more dams on our river systems. Although there have been excellent rains in the Hunter Valley, the north-west of New South Wales and in Queensland, no water has run into the dams. The Glenbawn Dam on the Hunter River has received no water although there have been good rains in the Hunter Valley. Its level is at 10 per cent capacity. The Keepit Dam on the Namoi River is at the same level and no water is running into it. It is evident that we have to work out a plan with the State governments to see that more dams are constructed so we can take care of future droughts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In regard to the Keepit Dam, the State Government and the Federal Government intend to build a supporting dam above Keepit on the Manilla River. The Federal Government and the State Government of New South Wales have each put in $500,000. When this dam is built, it will be of great benefit to farmers on the Namoi River system and it will help supply water to the cotton growers at Wee Waa who rely on water from this river system. These areas will go into the winter with a shortage of water and unless further rain falls they will experience very serious pastoral conditions. Farmers are facing drastic financial conditions because the failure of the wheat crop right through the north-west of New South Wales has meant that the farmers are entering 1981 without any cash flow. The wool clip will be cut in half because the dry weather has affected the production of wool. There have been severe sheep and cattle losses in the area. Let us hope that the Primary Industry Bank of Australia and the Commonwealth Development Bank are given funds so the farmers can carry on production this year. I stress again that we must at all costs provide funds for the establishment of more dams not only in New South Wales and Queensland but also right across Australia, because Australia is the driest continent. The Hunter River flows into the sea at Newcastle and the Namoi River, which is part of another system, joins the Barwon River at Walgett, which goes on into the Darling River and finally into the Murray River. </PARA>
<PARA> We could also give consideration to the establishment of more weirs on these rivers. In the last few years we have put two weirs on the Namoi River below Narrabri which have helped to conserve water for the farmers in that area. I feel that should provide more weirs on the Hunter River. The Government of New South Wales has plans to build a dam at Glennies Creek which will supplement the Hunter River as well as a dam on the Goulburn River at a place called Kerrabee. These dams will cost a considerable amount, but, when established, they will help to provide water for the great power station at Liddel, which is necessary for the cooling system. That power station has had great problems in maintaining sufficient water for its cooling system. I ask the Government to look at these problems as they are urgent and the solution to them is necessary for the development of our country. </PARA>

It has a dual line from Tempe to Riverwood, which is about 17 kilometres, and a single track from Riverwood to East Hills, which is a further 11 kilometres. For this reason the service is notoriously bad for its irregularity and unreliability. The line is hard hit by any signal failure or fault occurring in the system. Many of the trains must terminate at Riverwood. Of the 47 trains operating between 7 a.m. and 6 p.m. into the city, 15 must start at Riverwood because of this single track. Because of these inadequacies many of my constituents choose not to use the service but rather to use their own motor vehicles instead, which of course causes a drain on petrol resources, impeding the roads to essential trade and commercial vehicles, and is also a cause of pollution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Despite these problems, the daily average usage of the railway for the five railway stations between East Hills and Riverwood is in the order of 9,000 persons excluding school children on free educational passes. With additional persons using the system from Riverwood to the city, it can be seen that the rail link is very heavily utilised at present. </PARA>
<PARA> I also point out that the population estimates for the Menai Development project, just across the Georges River, indicate that for a further 17,000 people the East Hills railway line will be the closest means of public transport to the city. Already there are plans for a bus service to operate from Menai to Padstow station to connect with the railway line. It can readily be seen therefore that the rail link will be unable to cope with such increases in demand when that population growth occurs in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA> The history of this matter is as follows: In 1974-75, the then Federal Labor Government promised the construction of a rail link connecting East Hills with Glenfield on the main southern line. It involved the amplification and consequent improvement of the service into Sydney. This project was approved as part of the 1974-75 Urban Public Transport Improvement Program and would have involved expenditure amounting to over $21m. That amount would be funded over four years, two-thirds from Federal funding and one-third from State funding. Plans were drawn up; an environmental impact statement was completed; and the expectations of the people in my area were aroused. It is now 1981 and they are still waiting. The development did not proceed due mainly to the former State Liberal-Country Party Government and its mismanagement of the transport system generally and because of serious difficulties with the Eastern Suburbs railway in particular. The funds for the project could not be used in the year they were provided and they were diverted to other programs. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst I do not believe that the completion of the whole of this original project between Riverwood and Glenfield is necessary at present to meet the demands, action is required most urgently to improve the existing installation by the duplication of the line between Riverwood and East Hills. The estimated cost involved in carrying out the amplification of this rail link between East Hills and Riverwood is in the order of $20m at today's prices. However this cost is beyond the present resources of the New South Wales Government because of cutbacks in capital payments from the Federal Government, particularly during the current financial year. Capital payments this year from the Federal Government to the State of New South Wales total $815m, compared with the amount paid four years ago of $880m, which represents a 7 per cent reduction before allowing for price rises of almost 50 per cent during that period. If the original proposal in respect of funding of this rail amplification was adhered to, at today's prices the Federal Government would be responsible for approximately $13.3m and the State Government would be responsible for $6m. </PARA>
<PARA> I therefore submit that additional funds should be provided to the Government of New South Wales to enable the amplification of the East Hills railway line between Riverwood and East Hills so that adequate rail services can be made available to the residents in the electoral division of Banks. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I especially draw the attention of the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Thomson) to the deteriorating state of the upper reaches of the Georges River in Sydney. It is a very great river which runs from Botany Bay for, I suppose, some 15 miles into the Liverpool area and provides a recreational facility for a very large number of Sydneysiders. I recently had the opportunity to visit the upper reaches with a number of local government representatives and State members of Parliament, to see the extent of infestation by a weed that has suddenly emerged and has run wild in a most unusual and unprecedented way. Some nine or ten months ago there was no evidence of this weed, which is known as salvinai molesta, in the Georges River area. On this recent inspection, we were able to observe the weed, which had spread out like a cow pasture. It was so thick that the Army barges in which we were travelling were hardly able to proceed. Even with the barges moving at a slow pace, the weed would come over the front and choke up the motors. It is apparent that the weed will rot and cause a very serious pollution hazard in the area. Respected authorities have contended that this infestation represents a health threat because typhoid or hepatitis could result from the very serious contamination that is in evidence. There is also the prospect that serious flooding might occur as the water which normally flows downstream, especially at times of heavy rain, is unable to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another alarming aspect is that some of this weed has already jumped into the salt-water part of the Georges River and appears to be surviving. Honourable members can imagine the concern felt on the part of the famous oyster industry in the Georges River when it is faced, as it could be, with yet another threat. There is already the threat of contamination from oil spillage from ships in Botany Bay. The Metropolitan Water Sewerage and Drainage Board appears to identify itself as having some responsibility for this problem because it has erected booms across parts of the River. Some people on the inspecting party were cynical enough to contend that the Board had laid these booms to prevent the public observing from the road the extent of the infestation. I must admit that the booms were located in such a position as to give that impression. I would hate to think that any public authority would reach such a cynical stage. </PARA>
<PARA> The aldermen of Liverpool and other local government representatives were alarmed to know that this infestation had reached such serious proportions. They were unable to observe the weed from the roadways and other traditional travelling points. One has to get into an Army barge and go into this otherwise inaccessible area to see this contamination. Spraying has been undertaken. Again, we are very concerned about whether any adverse effects will accrue from the spray. I do not suppose it is the type of spray used in Vietnam, but one cannot be indifferent to these matters these days. The community is anxious to know what spray is being used and whether it represents a hazard to bird life, fish life and marine life, particularly the oyster industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the Minister for Science and Technology to take an interest in this matter. I hope that the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation will be able to study the weed salvinai molesta. It could well be an exotic weed that is washed through the sewer. Contamination from sewage is providing nutrients which are keeping this weed alive and causing it to flourish. Regrettably, some of that contamination comes from the Holsworthy military establishment and the Bankstown Airport. The Commonwealth Government clearly has a responsibility to interest itself in this matter and to help rid this river of this unfortunate contamination, which is causing such widespread concern in the suburbs that surround the Georges River in Sydney. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to raise a matter which is of concern to my electorate. It is a relatively parochial matter but it is also one of national consideration. Recently the Victorian Government determined that a toxic waste storage area would be established. The Victorian Environment Protection Authority, after considering a number of sites, announced that on political grounds-I emphasise that point-it had chosen a site in the area of the Avalon airfield almost adjacent to the Werribee sewerage farm. Last Thursday night a large number of residents of the township of Lara-well in excess of 600 residents-turned out to indicate to the EPA that the site chosen was not acceptable. Victorian Government Ministers declined to attend the meeting on the ground that ultimately they would be judging the report of the EPA. Therefore, they did not consider that they should be present to hear the views of the community. I think that was straight out cowardice on the part of Victorian Government Ministers. They have avoided a conflict and they have passed to a public servant the responsibility of making a political judgment on their behalf. Whether or not the toxic waste storage area is established on that site ultimately will be determined by Cabinet, but it will be done in an ivory tower atmosphere because it will have avoided the responsibility of facing up to the views of the community concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Most people would accept that a toxic waste storage area has to be established somewhere, but a site near Heathcote was examined and ultimately dropped for political reasons. When the site was announced as being suitable, the EPA indicated very clearly that it was satisfied that the site chosen was safe. It was dropped ultimately for political reasons. The choosing of a site on the western side of Port Phillip Bay seems to be in line with the whole environmental approach of the Victorian Government. Nothing goes on the eastern side where the residences of the more affluent and more influential Victorian citizens are situated. Certainly the Newport power station, which is on the western side of the bay, would not have been commenced had it been suggested that it be built at Brighton. The Werribee sewerage farm, which is a major pollutant of Port Phillip Bay, is being added to surreptitiously and the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works gradually is gaining control of all access land so that there is very little chance of the general public being able to establish what is going on in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that a Federal inquiry is taking place into the disposal of toxic waste and that that inquiry is due to report some time before the middle of this year. I am concerned about this problem. I think all of us as responsible citizens recognise that it is a problem. The means of disposal should be determined on a national basis. Disposal should not take place in an area where it is likely that seepage from any accidental breakdown in the system-the system is completely unproven despite statements to the contrary-can cause damage not only to individuals but also to an area of enclosed waters which it is almost impossible to cleanse over a short or long period. In the early 1970s a report was brought down which indicated that for several miles around the Werribee sewage farm the waters of Port Phillip Bay were, in fact, poisoned by seepage from that area. It is intended to add to that problem by this establishment on political grounds. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the Federal Government ought to indicate to the Victorian Government that a national consideration is involved and that the amount of toxic waste probably would lend itself to a national solution. The whole nation should look at the problem. I certainly think it is cowardly of the Victorian Government to dump this waste in an area where it thinks it is politically safe. </PARA>

<PARA> (1) My attention has been drawn to the comments on social security appeals in the 1980 Annual Report of the Administrative Review Council, and to the Council's statement therein that it had made its report on this matter to the Attorney-General in June 1980.</PARA>
<PARA> As the honourable member will be aware, the former Minister for Social Security announced significant amendments to the social security appeals system on 9 September 1980. With effect from that date, departmental clients dissatisfied with decisions involving medical assessments may have their case reviewed by a Social Security Appeals Tribunal (SSAT). As a result of this initiative, additional rights may also be created which enable the client to seek review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT).</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, regulations have now been made which empower the AAT to review any decision of the Director-General or his delegate affirming, varying or annulling a decision of a departmental officer where that officer's decision has been reviewed by an SSAT. There is also provision for decisions to be reviewed by the AAT where the Director-General has issued a certificate enabling a direct appeal without prior review by an SSAT.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) 5,063 appeals were received by the Department up to 30 September 1980. This is the latest available information.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Yes, however statistics are not maintained on a basis which would provide full details in relation to such categories. Statistics collected relate to the type of pension or benefit.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) For the year 1980, up to 30 September, Social Security Appeals Tribunals recommended that 921 appeals be fully or partly upheld, while 1,262 appeals were conceded by the Department before they had been referred to the Tribunals for their consideration.</PARA>
<PARA> These figures include appeals which were lodged before 1 January 1980 but finalised since 1 January. Similarly some appeals lodged between 1 January 1980 and 30 September 1980 would not have been finalised by 30 September.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="014">Mr MacKellar</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I do not have information regarding the total sales of pharmaceutical companies. However, the tables below show the top 50 manufacturers of items supplied as pharmaceutical benefits (those which can be identified as their firm's brand, but excluding 'unbranded' prescriptions) for the years 1976/77 to 1978/79 inclusive. Such tables were not produced prior to the year 1976/77. Data to produce a table for 1979/80 are not yet available.</PARA>
<PARA> These tables do not in any way reflect sales by manufacturers of pharmaceuticals supplied by public hospitals, on private prescriptions, through the Veterans' Affairs Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, over-the-counter by retail chemists, etc.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Compliance with the provisions of a document, the Australian Code of Good Manufacturing Practice, is used by State Governments as the criterion for granting of licences to manufacture pharmaceutical products. This document is based upon the recommendations of the World Health Organization. Similar national codes are employed in other countries. The Australian code is negotiated by Commonwealth and State Health Department inspectors and representatives of the pharmaceutical industry.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) There are no inspections carried out under the Australian Code of Good Manufacturing Practice in overseas countries. However, products manufactured overseas and imported for sale in Australia are required to comply with standards laid down under the Therapeutic Goods Act. In addition, under the provisions of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations, companies are required to provide to my Department data to establish the quality of the product being imported. These data include information on the chemistry of the drug and details of manufacturing procedures and quality control testing carried out during the manufacturing process. These data are evaluated by officers of my Department prior to approval being granted for importation into Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Drug company representatives can receive training from within the company, from a special course of one year's duration conducted by the Australian Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (APMA) and from other specialist organisations. Company training, which is normally continuous and as required by new or special products, provides knowledge in the pharmacology of company products and the technical aspects of bioavailability, bioequivalence and product details. The APMA training course covers industry knowledge, anatomy and physiology, microbiology, disease states and pharmacology. Written examinations are conducted. The effectiveness of the training programs is assessed by surveys carried out by senior company executives visiting medical practitioners in the field and by surveys to obtain the reaction of medical practitioners to drug company representatives as a total group.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) There are no Commonwealth and/or State Government marketing codes as such. There are, however, statutory requirements relating to the marketing of both ethical and proprietary pharmaceuticals under the legislation administered by the various State and Territory health authorities. In addition, under the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regultions, the Director-General of Health must be satisfied as to the quality, safety and efficacy of products imported into Australia before granting approval for their importation into and distribution within Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Inquiries conducted into the pharmaceutical industry or portions of the industry with which my Department has been directly involved are:</PARA>
<PARA> Senate Select Committee on Medical and Hospital Costs (Reports dated 1969 and 1970)</PARA>

<PARA> (b) Yes, if this report is the one reported in the United States Congressional Record-Senate 1972.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) A copy of the Saigon Newspaper Tui Sang, for 26 June 1969, is not available. However, the newspaper article is discussed in John Lewallen's book Ecology of Devastation.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) and (e) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (f) Yes, if this is the report entitled Multiple Arsenical Cancers of Skin and Internal Organs.</PARA>
<PARA> (g) I am aware of a report of November 1974 from the Dow Chemical Company. A sevenfold increase in the incidence of lung cancer followed exposure in excess of eight years. Exposure of less than one year resulted in an increase of less than three fold. Lymphatic system malignancies occurred more frequently than expected in a ratio of 6:2.8.</PARA>
<PARA> (h) Reports which mention all but one of the above conditions-corneal keratosis-as being due to exposure to tetrachlorodibenzodioxin, have been drawn to my attention.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) This question presumably refers to the accidents at the Monsanto Chemical Company in Nitro, West Virginia, US in 1949, and at the Badische Anilin und Soda Fabrik (BASF) factory in Ludwingshafen, Federal Republic of Germany in November 1953. Some workers were reported to have developed the conditions mentioned in the question.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Australian Repatriation system is one of the most accessible in the world. It provides a three tier system of independent statutory authorities for determining claims and appeals. These authorities, when considering a claim or appeal, are required to fully consider the merits of a particular case and to take into consideration all the available evidence, including any medical opinion expressed. They are required to grant a claim, or allow an appeal, unless they are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there are insufficient grounds for so doing. The independence of the authorities means that it is not possible for the Minister, or any other person, to influence their decisions and I would not seek to direct them as to what decisions to make.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) If any relationship is established, by the epidemiological study, between contact with herbicides and other toxic chemicals in Vietnam and miscarriages in the wives of veterans and birth defects in their children, the Government will then consider the position.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5E4">Mr Sinclair</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The difficulties referred to arise from the need for Regulations under the Customs Act to specify precisely the equipment to be controlled and the criteria to be used to restrict imports. This was not a straight forward matter because the existing Wireless Telegraphy Act provides no formal definition of the Citizens Band Radio Service (CBRS) and makes no provision for legally recognisable equipment standards which could be invoked in Customs Regulations. The CBRS, particularly in the 27 MHz band, uses frequencies very close to other similar radio services such as the 27 MHz Harbour Mobile Radio Service. The equipment to be controlled, viz CB radios having unapproved frequencies, closely resembles equipment used in some of these other services. In the absence of existing definitions, it has been a difficult drafting exercise to distinguish CB equipment operating on incorrect frequencies from handphones or harbour mobile equipment which is very similar and operates on adjacent frequencies.</PARA>
<PARA> These difficulties have been compounded by recent negotiations with suppliers of harbour mobile equipment which has led to an expansion of the number of frequencies to be included in such equipment, including frequencies closer to the CBRS frequencies. Consequently, the final form of the regulation has required further drafting changes to ensure that legitimate harbour mobile equipment will not be caught up in the import restrictions proposed for CB equipment. This process has recently been completed.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) It is Government policy that the regulation of industry should not depend on the discretionary decisions of Ministers or public officials. For example, Regulations prohibiting the importation of radio equipment unless the consent of the Minister is obtained, are not usually acceptable. Objective definitions, standards and criteria must be incorporated in the Regulations, and these Regulations must identify the particular goods to be controlled.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) A link between import or manufacturing controls and licensing requirements could be established only by equipment standards common to all areas of regulation. Present equipment approval procedures which precede the licensing of radio services under the Wireless Telegraphy Act work effectively in the context of licensing and regulatory controls on radio use. However, the Attorney-General's Department has advised that they are not able to be used as the basis for an import restriction. Existing equipment standards were not designed for this purpose.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) and (5) This has been investigated and it has been found that there are, in practice, no other means available than the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA> New radiocommunication legislation is currently being prepared which will address itself to these matters and make it possible for controls on the manufacture and importation of illegal equipment to be established on the basis of published technical standards and new equipment type approval requirements.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) The Social Services Act requires a person to be permanently blind or permanently incapacitated for work to the extent of at least 85 per cent to qualify for an invalid pension. The level of incapacity for work is a matter for medical assessment and is carried out in accordance with recognised medical procedures and using established criteria. Broadly, the assessment of a person's capacity (or incapacity) for work involves an evaluation by a Commonwealth Medical Officer of the person's present and future capacity to engage in any field of employment which might be considered suitable for the person to undertake. In addition to assessing the person's degree of medical impairment, such factors as age, sex and education are relevant in assessing the degree of incapacity for work.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WM7">Mr Newman</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Australian Electoral Office depends heavily on the knowledge and experience of its polling officials. This experience, which in the case of many officials has been gained over a number of elections, is essential to the efficient and successful conduct of each election. Clearly, such 'know how' is not likely to be available from large numbers of inexperienced staff. For this reason the normal practice is to retain the services of efficient, experienced officials from election to election. Since the Office must be prepared at all times to conduct an election, possibly at short notice, Divisional Returning Officers periodically, between elections, review the list of polling staff employed at the previous election to identify those not likely to be available on the occasion of the next election and those whose efficiency on the job does not warrant their continued employment and efforts are made to recruit suitable alternative staff.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) It is because of this need for suitable staff who will be available when needed in the future that the Australian Electoral Office seeks its recruits in such areas as the Commonwealth and State Public Services, the teaching services, banks, insurance companies and appropriate areas of commercial organisations.</PARA>
<PARA> If there is any emphasis on a particular area of employment it could be in the use of teaching staff, particularly in country areas. This flows from the fact that many polling places are located in schools and the employment of staff from those schools as polling officials facilitates arrangements for setting up and operating of the polling booths in those premises.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Given the need for the Australian Electoral Office to have the bulk of its casual polling staff requirements planned in advance of the election there normally are comparatively few vacancies when an election is announced. Given the immense amount of administrative detail in conducting an election, recruitment well ahead is the only efficient arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA> Despite these efforts to forward plan staffing needs some vacancies inevitably do occur close to the election and all available avenues, including the Commonwealth Employment Service, are canvassed in an effort to find suitable replacements.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) and (2) I refer the honourable member to my news release of 23 September 1980 for my statements on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) My Department received a query from a private pathologist concerning a number of outstanding bulk billed claims for medical benefits submitted by him for pathology services associated with termination of pregnancy. In response my Department advised the pathologist on 4 September 1980 that the claims had been processed in accordance with the terms of the Health Insurance Act which places a restriction on the payment of medical benefits for services which are considered to be of a health screening nature.</PARA>
<PARA> Computer programs are used by my Department to assess and calculate medical benefits payments for bulk billed claims. The term 'coded to suppress payment of medical benefits' is a reference to a procedure used during such computer processing of claims to prevent payment of benefits for services which do not automatically attract benefits (that is, benefits are not payable unless the services are medically necessary).</PARA>
<PARA> (4) All registered health funds were advised during August and September 1980 that payment of medical benefits would be restricted for some pathology tests associated with termination of pregnancy where those tests were not considered to be medically necessary.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Full medical benefits are payable under Schedule Item 994 for the multiphasic screening service provided by Medicheck and the Shepherd Foundation. Item 994 covers the performance of 10 or more medical services.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) Priorities in Australian civil defence preparation take account of the assessed low probability of nuclear attack and the priority given by Government to support of practical measures which give the best assurance of the probability remaining low. Precise definition of the form of such a remote eventuality is not practicable. Our civil defence capacity depends heavily upon the extensive organisations and capabilities which have been established in recent years to mitigate the effects of major natural disasters. These capabilities, together with some special preparations including the survey of fallout shelter space, provide a basis for timely expansion should development of the risk of direct military attack upon Australia require it.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) to (5) The Natural Disasters Organisation survey of fallout shelter space in suitable existing buildings is a continuing technical activity carried out at the request of, and to provide information and assessments for, State and Territory authorities responsible for the planning of civil defence measures. It commenced in 1966 following a decision by government, and is being maintained. The results are in the form of technical planning data and are not published. However, many buildings in all capital cities have been surveyed and the space located could in relevant circumstances provide shelter from fallout for some hundreds of thousands of people.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) and (2) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) While the Commonwealth makes a substantial contribution to the costs of undergraduate and specialist medical education and training, I do not consider that it would be appropriate for the Commonwealth to fund an activity, such as that suggested by the honourable member, which is a form of continuing medical education. Because it is in the personal and professional interests of medical practitioners to keep abreast of developments in their form of practice, and continuing medical education is a major way of them doing so, I believe that medical practitioners should have the major responsibility for continuing medical education costs.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="014">Mr MacKellar</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Basic medical tables are restricted to benefits for professional services rendered by qualified medical practitioners, particularly optometrists and approved dentists in respect of certain dental services. However, benefits for services such as physiotherapy, pre-natal/post-natal therapy are able to be provided under health insurance organisations' supplementary tables of benefits. There is no legislation specifically governing the nature and extent of supplementary benefits a health insurance organisation may wish to provide. The organisations themselves are virtually free to determine these matters. The Government's role in relation to the provision of such benefits is essentially one of ensuring that contribution rates are sufficient to finance benefits payments.</PARA>
<PARA> The decision by the Government to allow health insurance organisations the latitude for innovation and flexibility in the provision of supplementary benefits has led to a very competitive situation. Organisations are conscious of this situation and strive to satisfy, as far as possible, the needs of their contributors.</PARA>
<PARA> It is therefore a matter for the private health insurance organisations to decide for themselves whether or not their table of supplementary benefits will provide benefits towards the cost of fees raised for pre-natal classes conducted by the Childbirth Education Association. The large majority of health insurance organisations do provide supplementary benefits for pre-(ante)-natal therapy, but such benefits are generally restricted to these services when rendered only by qualified/registered physiotherapists.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes, to the extent that the practitioner concerned is not a qualified/registered physiotherapist.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) and (4) I would not stand in the way of any organisation that wishes to expand its range of supplementary benefits to cover pre-natal classes held by the Childbirth Education Association. However, as I have explained above, health insurance organisations are free to determine the nature and extent of supplementary benefits and I believe that this should continue to be the situation.</PARA>
<PARA> In the circumstances, I do not believe that it would be appropriate for me to attempt to influence the health insurance organisations in regard to the range of ancillary benefits allowed. I would suggest that organisations such as the Childbirth Education Association make direct representations to the Voluntary Health Insurance Association of Australia and Medibank Private.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="014">Mr MacKellar</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) A number of insulin preparations are currently listed as pharmaceutical benefits. These preparations are available to the general public on the payment of the patient contribution, currently $2.75 per prescription and free of charge to eligible pensioners i.e. those in possession of a Pensioner Health Benefits card or a Health Benefits card.</PARA>
<PARA> The provision of medical equipment such as insulin syringes and needles falls outside the scope of the National Health Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, which is limited to the provision of drugs and medicinal preparations. The cost of syringes is not subsidised under the National Health legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The expense incurred by insulin-dependent diabetics in meeting the cost of syringes and needles is determined by the type of syringe used by diabetics, the dosage levels and the frequency of doses required to meet the individual needs of patients with different requirements. The costs for individual patients can vary substantially.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) In general terms, there are more people over 50 years of age who suffer from diabetes than under 50 years of age. However, in the context of the use of syringes and needles the majority of insulin-dependent diabetics are under 50 years of age.</PARA>
<PARA> A substantial proportion of diabetics over 50 years of age suffer from 'mature onset diabetes' most of whom are not dependent on insulin and whose diabetes is adequately controlled by diet or a combination of diet and oral hypoglycaemic agents.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) There are no data available whereby the number of aged pensioners who are diabetics can be determined. However, I understand that the Department of Social Security is soon to publish statistics showing the number of invalid pensioners suffering from diabetes.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Consideration has been given to ways and means by which Government assistance can be given to diabetics to help in meeting the cost of insulin syringes and needles.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is sympathetic to the needs of diabetics and is mindful of the costs to the patient in the management of diabetes. However, in the current economic situation which has necessitated policies of restraint in public expenditure, it has not been possible for the Government to commit itself to additional programs, such as assistance with the cost of insulin syringes and needles. Nevertheless this matter will be kept under review.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Voters who spoil a ballot paper may obtain another by returning the spoilt ballot paper to a Polling Official or a Divisional Returning Officer, as the case requires.

<PARA> (2) No. It has not previously been suggested that the reason why only an extremely low number of postal ballot papers are returned with corrections, is that suggested by the question.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZS7">Mr Thomson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Veteran's Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I am unable to provide the information sought by the honourable member in respect of petitions presented to the House of Representatives. The copies of petitions provided by the Clerk of the House of Representatives to Ministers do not contain signatures. I understand that it is not the practice of the House to ascertain the number of signatures on petitions. However, the original petitions would be available for perusal in the House Table Office.</PARA>
<PARA> No petitions dealing with this matter were presented to the Senate during the 31st Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Representations seeking a review or a reversal of the decision to close Rosemount Hospital have been received from various sources. Organisations which have had representations made on their behalf are the Hospital Employees Federation of Australia, the Kedron/Wavell, Sunnybank, Beachmere and Sandgate Sub-branches of the Returned Services League of Australia, the War Widows Guild, the Union of Australian Women and the Australian Tramway and Motor Omnibus Employees Association (Queensland). Members of Parliament and various members of the public have also made representations.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) It is not proposed to review the decision to close the Rosemount Repatriation Hospital, Windsor. The decision was taken only after careful consideration of the findings of an extensive review of the role, function, level of operation and continuing need for the hospital and following discussions with the local Federal member of parliament and the Hospital Employees Federation of Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister for the Capital Territory, upon notice, on 26 November 1980:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Is it a fact that applications for alteration of land use in the Australian Capital Territory must be lodged with the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court without requirement for prior public notification of intent to seek a change.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Did his Department notify the Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly that lodgment of an application with the Court made the matter sub judice and thus not open to debate or public inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) If so, will he examine the procedure to ensure that proper opportunity exists for public debate on matters of changed land use and other planning changes.</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="75" SPEAKER="Hodgman The Hon W.M." NAMEID="BV4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="CORIO">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BV4">Mr Hodgman</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I am advised that the position is that Section 11A of the City Area Leases Ordinance permits a Canberra lessee to make application to the Supreme Court for a variation of the land use permitted under his lease without prior consultation.</PARA>
<PARA> The legislation goes on to provide that the Minister for the Capital Territory may lodge a certificate with the Supreme Court in the event that the variation sought is repugnant to the principles for the time being governing the construction and development of Canberra. The Court cannot grant a variation if such a certificate is lodged.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) An officer of the Department of the Capital Territory advised the Clerk to one of the House of Assembly Standing Committees that as a certain matter was before the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court the matter would probably be regarded as sub judice and that before the Standing Committee proceeded with the advertised public inquiry into the matter, it would be prudent for formal legal advice on the question of sub judice to be obtained.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The procedure was recently examined by the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory as part of its Inquiry into the Adequacy and Public Acceptability of Planning Procedures and Processes in the Australian Capital Territory.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government accepted a recommendation made by the Committee that applications of this nature should in future be dealt with by the Department of the Capital Territory instead of the Supreme Court.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department will not be able to grant a variation that is in conflict with the planning principles currently applying. The National Capital Development Commission has been and will continue to release major planning issues for public comment prior to formulating a policy. This arrangement is considered to enable adequate public debate on the principles applying to land use issues.</PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore when individual applications are lodged with the Department it is proposed that the proposal be publicly advertised so that any person or body opposed to the proposal can lodge an objection.</PARA>
<PARA> All objections lodged with the Department will be taken into consideration and the applicant or any third party dissatisfied with the Department's decision will then have a right of appeal to an appropriate Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA> Legislation to bring the new arrangement into force will be introduced as soon as possible.</PARA>

<PARA> Upon the basis of that examination, it would appear that any payments of unemployment benefit which have been or may be made to those persons, whether as a result of an appeal to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal or otherwise, would not be affected by that agreement. Whether or not the amount of any payment to be made under that agreement to any particular person would be affected by any payment of unemployment benefit made to that person by the Department of Social Security is a matter upon which I am unable to comment.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Has his attention been drawn to (a) a statement on page 2 of Volume 3 of the Australian National Satellite Communications System Request for Tender that a possible future development will result in Adelaide accessing a 5th (low power) transponder with one TV and two sound channels, referring to broadcasts by the Australian Broadcasting Commission as part of an expanded HACBSS service. (b) a statement on page 6 of the document The National Communications Satellite System Outline of Proposed Service Requirements and Technical Specifications, referring to the 11 low-powered transponders on the first satellite having an approximate power output of 15 watts and (c) the official view of the Satellite Planning Group, for example enunciated by its Chairman, Mr R. Johnson, that 10-15 watts is the probable range within which the power of the satellite's smaller transponders will fall.</PARA>

<PARA> (3) Is the OTC the Government's preferred developer of the Satellite system and is it also the view of OTC's Satellite Planning Group that the satellite's low-powered transponders are most likely to have a power output closer to 10 watts rather than 20 watts, if so, will he affirm the published views of his predecessor, appearing in answer to question No. 5357 (Hansard, 18 September 1980, page 1610) that studies in Australia indicate that direct satellite broadcasting using 20 watt transponders is feasible and that in the Australian context the proposed services areas to be provided are larger than those applying in Canada and consequently powers higher than 20 watts are considered to be necessary.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) If he will affirm his predecessor's stance, will the ABC and the OTC cease investigation of a separate 10-15 watt, Adelaide based HACBSS service for the Central Australian spot beam.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5E4">Mr Sinclair</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. In the Request for Tender documents, the satellite transmit power is not specified in terms of the transponder power, but as an effective radiated power from the antenna directed towards Australia. Depending on the antenna performance, the actual transponder power is expected to range between ten and fifteen watts for the low powered transponders, and to be approximately thirty watts for the high powered transponders.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) As announced in Parliament on 18 September 1980, the Government decided that at this time the Overseas Telecommunications Commission (Australia) be designated as the authority to own and manage the domestic communications satellite system. For the remainder of the question, see the answer to (1).</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The design of the satellite is such that four high powered transponders can direct HACBSS programs to four regional areas via the north east, south east, central and western Australian satellite beams. To avoid time zone and other programming problems, it is possible that the ABC may wish to use a low powered transponder switched to the central Australian beam to distribute a South Australian program to the ABC regional broadcasting transmitters in South Australia and perhaps to those people and communities who equip themselves with high performance HACBSS receiving earth stations. If the ABC did so decide, it would still be possible for people and communities in South Australia to use normal HACBSS receiving earth stations, however, they would then receive Northern Territory rather than South Australian programs. The Request for Tender has been written to permit such an arrangement to be implemented should the ABC so decide.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The design of the satellite is based on the judgment that high powered transponders are necessary if the cost of HACBSS receivers is to be kept in the order of $1,000 as indicated by my predecessor. The projected use of a lower powered transponder in South Australia by the ABC is a specialised application and the resultant increased cost of individual HACBSS receivers for that purpose will not be known until tenders have been examined.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Telecom has requested tender bids for Transportable plant, with associated satellite telephony circuitry, for possible itinerant use on thick route telecommunications links.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Page 13 of Volume IV, Part 1 of the Satellite Request for Tender states that there are no specific requirements foreseen for Telecom thick route telephony services via satellite. This means that Telecom does not currently expect to employ thick route satellite telephony for permanent application in the national telecommunications network. The transportable equipment which has been specified in the Request for Tender is designed to provide Telecom with the capability to cover unforeseen temporary shortfalls in traffic capacity on particular links in the national network. Such circumstances could arise out of a major emergency, or unavoidable delays in some key elements of the capital construction programme. The extent of any application of such equipment, however, will be critically dependent upon the prices received and their relationship to the costs of equivalent terrestrial links.</PARA>

I do not, however, intend to seek amendments to the provisions of the Life Insurance Act at this time.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) A basic requirement of the Isolated Patients' Travel and Accommodation Assistance Scheme is referral by a medical practitioner to the nearest suitable specialist or consultant physician. Emphasis is therefore placed on informing potential users of the Scheme through the medical profession and associated organisations. To this end, upon commencement of the Scheme in October 1978, and following changes in the Scheme in June 1979, letters, explanatory pamphlets and application forms were sent to medical practitioners in country areas and appropriate hospitals, medical centres, community health centres and welfare authorities. Included were Department of Social Security country regional offices and relevant State Government authorities. Similar material was issued in 1979-80. Advertisements were also placed in country newspapers. In 1980-81 following further amendments to the Scheme applicable from 1 October 1980, revised explanatory pamphlets and application forms were ordered for issue on the same basis as in previous years.</PARA>

<PARA> (a) (i) $50,000; (ii) $45,000 was originally included in the estimates for a further advertising campaign in 1980-81 but because of the rapid increase in usage of the Scheme it was felt that it is widely known in isolated areas and expenditure of further Commonwealth funds for this purpose could not be justified.

<PARA> The further break-up of private patients in recognised hospitals according to the type of accommodation provided (i.e. shared ward or single room) as requested by the honourable member is not available.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) My Department does not have access to statistical data that would enable the identification with any real accuracy of any trend in the proportion of public hospital beds occupied by private patients over the last 20 years. The earliest information available, on a national basis, concerning the proportion of bed-days in public hospitals occupied by private patients is in respect of the year ended 30 June 1964.</PARA>
<PARA> From that year to the introduction of the 1975 hospital financing arrangements, information provided to my Department by the State and Territory health authorities in relation to the distribution of the various types of patients accommodated in public hospitals was by ward type. This information covered (a) public ward patients (split into 'pensioner' and 'non-pensioner' patients, with non-pensioner including some patients with private health insurance) and (b) 'non-public ward' patients (including patients both with and without private health insurance). A classification by benefit entitlement (insured, uninsured, pensioner, tuberculosis and others) was also provided.</PARA>
<PARA> Since 1975, information provided to my Department relates both to hospital patients (who may be insured or uninsured and who receive treatment provided by hospital doctors) and private patients. Private patients may be insured or uninsured and may be in private or shared wards.</PARA>
<PARA> Statistics available to my Department for the years prior to 1975 are therefore not comparable with those available since that date.</PARA>
<PARA> Attached are two tables.

The second table shows the percentage of private bed-days in recognised hospitals since 1976-77. Statistics are not available for the year 1975-76 due to variations in the times at which the 1975 hospital cost-sharing arrangements became effective in the States/Territories.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) to (4) During the past few years the Australian Radiation Laboratory has investigated X-ray emission from TV tubes. Prototype units are subject to a stringent test protocol recommended by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NH &amp; MRC) which requires that the radiation field 5cm from any external surface in any direction should not exceed 0.5 milliroentgens per hour under extremely faulty conditions. Of 150 TV receivers and approximately 70 video display terminals, only one unit (a colour TV receiver) has breached the NH &amp; MRC standard and this did so by a factor of 2 when pushed to its high voltage limit. The protective circuitry included in this model was re-designed and proved to be satisfactory before its release to the market. Most receivers have produced no detectable radiation although a few have reached levels of 0.01 milliroentgens per hour at their high voltage limit.</PARA>
<PARA> It is generally accepted that for X-rays the dose-response function for the induction of cataracts severe enough to impair vision has a threshold of somewhere between 200 and 500 rad when delivered in a single brief exposure and 1000 rad or more when delivered over a period of months. The likelihood of doses of this magnitude arising from a malfunctioning picture tube is extremely small and it is not considered that the incorporation of an additional safety device as suggested by the honourable member would be justified on these grounds.</PARA>

<PARA> I shall be interested to see the results of this research.</PARA>
<PARA> In the meantime, several developments have already occurred which should be of benefit to the hearing impaired.</PARA>
<PARA> The first is the introduction of multicultural television on Channels 0/28 in Sydney and Melbourne under the auspices of the Special Broadcasting Service (SBS).</PARA>
<PARA> The SBS has received an encouraging response from some members of the deaf community who appreciate the opportunity to watch sub-titled television programs.</PARA>
<PARA> The SBS has also recently introduced sign language to accompany its 6.28 pm and 8.27 pm headline news bulletins and is working towards complete subtitling of the main half hour news at the earliest possible opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA> The ABC has advised me that consideration is being given to the introduction of a closed captioning system for some of its programs.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, you may be interested to know that proposals for public television services are currently being examined. Every effort will be made to ensure that programs for the hearing impaired are included in these new services should they be established.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GH4">Mr Hunt</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The maximum rate of sickness benefit payable to single persons 18 years of age and over without dependants is $64.10 a week.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Social Services Act provides that the weekly rate of sickness benefit payable to a person cannot exceed the weekly rate of salary, wages or other income which that person has lost by reason of his incapacity. The Act also provides that where a person transfers from unemployment benefit to sickness benefit the amount of unemployment benefit paid to that person shall be regarded as a loss of income suffered by that person.</PARA>
<PARA> The maximum rate of unemployment benefit payable to a single person aged 18 years or over without dependants is $53.45 a week. Therefore, such a person in receipt of unemployment benefit who transfers to sickness benefit, and has no loss of income other than unemployment benefit, is eligible for a maximum rate of payment of $53.45 a week.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) To qualify for sickness benefit a person must, amongst other things, satisfy the Director-General of Social Services that he is temporarily incapacitated for work by reason of illness or accident. To qualify for invalid pension a person must be 85 per cent permanently incapacitated for work or permanently blind. A person not qualified for invalid pension may qualify for sickness benefit for as long as he satisfies the relevant criteria.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) An unemployment beneficiary whose total loss of income when transferring to sickness benefit consists of a loss of unemployment benefit of $53.45 a week would continue to be eligible for a maximum rate of benefit equal to this amount. This would, of course, be increased if there were an increase in the relevant rate of unemployment benefit.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The limitation on the rate of sickness benefit to the amount of a claimant's loss of income resulting from his incapacity is required by the provisions of the Social Services Act referred to in (2). These provisions have been in the relevant Act since payment of sickness benefit was introduced.</PARA>

<PARA> National Health and Medical Research Council (NH &amp; MRC) recommendations in relation to labelling of agricultural chemicals refer only to the human toxicological hazard which may be associated with the product.

<PARA> The provision of these directions is the responsibility of the State Departments of Agriculture as it is the State governments which possess legislative control over all chemicals.

<PARA> Concerning the closure of Rosemount, generally, the decision was taken only after an extensive review and analysis of the past and present utilisation of this facility.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) While I am aware of these reports I wish to point out that the Commonwealth Government is providing sufficient funds under the hospital cost-sharing agreement with Victoria to maintain hospital services at the levels existing at 30 June 1979, pending the report of the Commission of Inquiry into the Efficiency and Administration of Hospitals. For expanded or new services since 30 June 1979 to receive Commonwealth hospital cost-sharing funding, the State is required to show compensating offsets of services that were in existence at 30 June 1979. Of course, the State is able to fund these new or expanded services from its own resources if it wishes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) While the Commonwealth Government makes a significant contribution (50 per cent of approved net operating costs totalling $272m in 1979-80) to Victorian recognised hospital operating costs and has an equal say in determining aggregate budget levels for the State, the allocation of funds to individual hospitals from within the approved aggregate budget is purely a matter for the State to determine.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) and (4) The Commonwealth Government-initiated Commission of Inquiry into the Efficiency and Administration of Hospitals is due to report by the end of December 1980. The Government will not make any alterations to existing hospital funding arrangements pending receipt and consideration by the Government of the Commission of Inquiry's report.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Paracetamol tablet 500 mg, 50 has a Commonwealth dispensed price range of $2.44 to $2.51 according to the brand prescribed. Eligible pensioners (i.e. those holding a Pensioner Health Benefits card) and sickness beneficiaries holding a Health Benefits card receive their pharmaceutical benefits free of charge. All other patients pay a patient contribution, currently $2.75, for each supply of a pharmaceutical benefit. Where the Commonwealth dispensed price of an item is equal to or less than the relevant patient contribution, the item is deemed not to be a benefit. In this situation the Commonwealth has no control over the price charged by the chemist for the item. Likewise where such an item is obtained without a prescription, the Commonwealth has no control over the price charged by the chemist, in which case the chemist sets his own retail price (which could be $1.67 or less).</PARA>
<PARA> (2) My Department regularly provides for publication in the AMA Gazette or as a supplement to the AMA Gazette, as a service to medical practitioners, a list of all pharmaceutical benefit items with a Commonwealth dispensed price equal to or less than the patient contribution for pharmaceutical benefits. In effect the list is an extract of the relevant items from the pharmaceutical benefits book. The latest list was published in the AMA Gazette of 4 December 1980.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) (a) Nil.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) As at 1 December 1980, 109 forms and strengths of various pharmaceutical benefit items listed in the Schedule of Pharmaceutical Benefits were available without a prescription, in all States, for less than $2.75 assuming a 66.6 per cent mark-up. A further 45 were so available in at least one, but not all, States.</PARA>

Continuation of the supplementary assistance is intended to assist growers who have been reliant on exports to traditional ''at risk'' markets in the United Kingdom and Europe to adjust to the new export price support arrangements to apply after the 1980 season, and I anticipate that the allocation of the Commonwealth commitment among the States will take into account relative shares of exports to those markets in past seasons.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) to (3) The substance of the matters recommended in the Report by the National Women's Advisory Council in connection with extension of the Isolated Patients' Travel and Accommodation Assistance Scheme (IPTAAS) has previously been given careful consideration. With regard to the particular points in your question, my comments are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) IPTAAS allowances are payable to patients from isolated areas for follow-up treatment by medical specialists or consultant physicians provided that the specialist or consultant physician is the nearest suitable one, and other relevant criteria are met. The nearest suitable specialist is normally regarded as the nearest specialist in the particular specialty but other specialists can be considered where it can be shown that the particular treatment required is not available from the nearest specialist.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) IPTAAS is designed to assist patients from isolated areas requiring specialist medical treatment. As extension of the Scheme to assist parents visiting children would significantly increase the scope and hence the cost of the Scheme such a change cannot be accepted at this stage.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Air fares are reimbursable (less the first $20 per visit) provided other eligibility criteria of the Scheme are met and the referring medical practitioner indicates that air travel is necessary for medical reasons.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) IPTAAS was designed to assist people living in isolated areas to obtain specialist medical treatment not available locally. Because of funds limitations it was decided that only those people who have to travel at least 200 kilometres to obtain specialist medical treatment should be assisted. To ensure some equity between patients living beyond 200 kilometres from specialist medical treatment and those living within 200 kilometres, a patient contribution of $20 is deducted from the allowance in respect of each visit.</PARA>
<PARA>The other recommendations of the Report not already covered under IPTAAS would so alter the scope and intention of the Scheme that major cost escalation would be inevitable. With the Government's current Budget strategy of restraint on public spending, such cost escalation is unacceptable. Nonetheless, modifications to the Scheme have been recently approved to assist those young people with cleft lip and palate requiring orthodontic treatment and action is in hand to amend the legislation at an early date.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) No. Records are not kept of the laboratories in Australia which carry out tests on cosmetics. Therefore no indication can be given as to how many laboratories use the Ames test as part of their evaluation of cosmetic products.</PARA>
<PARA> The Ames test is, however, widely used in the toxicological evaluation of all new chemicals and the Cell Biology Unit of the Commonwealth Institute of Health is experienced in its use. Nevertheless, it must be realised that the Ames test represents only a small fraction of the total testing necessary for an adequate toxicological evaluation. While the Ames test is considered useful as a primary screen for bacterial mutagenicity, extrapolation of results to predict human carcinogenicity is not scientifically sound.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) (a) Health benefits cards for sickness benefits recipients were introduced on 4 November 1980. It was expected that this would cause a slight workload increase. The Department has estimated that an additional 11 staff would be required in the Department to cope with this increased workload.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The acceptance by the Commonwealth of immediate responsibility for the payment of supporting parents benefits took place in most States including Queensland from 6 November 1980. It was estimated that 115 additional staff would be necessary to handle the increased workload arising from the payment of these benefits.</PARA>
<PARA> The above estimates represent a total increase of 126 staff throughout a national network of 161 regional offices. The impact of these changes on any one office will therefore be minimal. The situation is being monitored continually to ensure that no problems arise in any offices.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Department experiences an annual seasonal workload peak during the months of December, January and February. Specific arrangements are made in advance to assist regional offices to cope with these peaks.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Buranda Regional Office is the only office of the Department of Social Security in the Electoral Division of Griffith.</PARA>
<PARA> The workload and staffing levels in all regional offices are reviewed at regular intervals. As a result of these reviews, the establishment of the Buranda Office was reduced by seven positions on 4 September 1980 from 93 to 86 and by a further seven positions on 22 October 1980. The current establishment of 79 positions is considered to be appropriate for the existing workload at the office and results in the office achieving levels of productivity comparable with other regional offices. However, an additional four positions (3 full-time and 1 part-time) have recently been allocated to the office in preparation for the additional workload expected over the December to January period.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Health Insurance Commission Act provides for appointments to the Commission to be made by the Governor-General, who acts on the advice of the Federal Executive Council. The Act provides for the Commission to consist of a Chairman, the General Manager and up to 5 other members appointed as part-time Commissioners.</PARA>
<PARA> The most recent appointments to the Commission were made in September 1980 whereby the Chairman and 5 part-time Commissioners were appointed. The Chairman and Commissioners were carefully chosen to ensure that the Commission will have membership to provide the business acumen to enable it to operate as a viable, statutory trading organisation, and at the same time reflect a range of community representation. For example it includes a member from the medical services field and a representative from the Council of Australian Government Employee Organisations (CAGEO).</PARA>
<PARA> The present composition of the Commission is considered to provide adequately for the representation of community and consumer interests. Accordingly, it is not intended to make any further appointments, or to vary existing legislation covering appointments to the Commission, to include specifically a consumer representative.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Thirteen.</PARA>
<PARA> (2), (3), (4) and (10). See Attachment 1.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Western Australian and Commonwealth fisheries officials have been involved in assessment of the proposals and issuing of licences. Observers have been placed on foreign vessels to ensure correct log book recording procedures are used, and to take scientific samples and measurements. The projects have not been subsidised by either the Commonwealth or the Western Australian Governments through direct injection of funds. Feasibility fishing projects therefore, provide a relatively inexpensive means of obtaining information to assist in management and conservation of fish resources in the Australian fishing zone, and to enable Australian fishermen to make informed investment decisions concerning their involvement in developing fisheries.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Nine of the approved projects have commenced feasibility fishing operations. None has completed the full two-year term of approval, although several operators have terminated the projects or indicated they intend to complete the feasibility projects in 1981. Thus in most cases, there is still limited information on which to base long term commercial investment decisions. However, some Australian companies have processed fish landed from feasibility fishing operations and have indicated an interest in developing longer term joint venture operations. All companies are advised at the time of approval, however, that successful completion of the project confers no exclusive or preferential rights in any fishery that may develop.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) All feasibility fishing projects are required to undertake Australian market evaluation in order to assess the potential of the resource for development for Australians. In general, projects are required to land a minimum of 10 percent of the total catch and offer it for sale to Australian processors. The portion of this product which is not purchased by Australian interests must be exported as Product of Australia to test overseas markets.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) Ten.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) All feasibility fishing projects approved to operate off Western Australia have been permitted to operate in some areas where Australian-based companies have exploited either Spanish mackerel, prawn or rock lobster resources. In each case, however, species to be taken and fishing methods used by foreign vessels exclude those species and methods utilised by Australian fishermen. In addition, foreign vessels participating in feasibility fishing projects are generally not permitted to operate in specified areas off the south west coast during the western rock lobster season. There have been no confirmed reports of interference by foreign vessels operating under feasibility fishing arrangements with Australian vessels operating off the coast of Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> (11) No. Discussions concerning such projects are held between Government officials in Australia and representatives of Taiwanese fishermen and their Australian agents.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) A deferred application for telephone service is one which cannot be satisfied within three months due to the unavailability of cable or exchange equipment. The number of deferred applications at particular exchanges can change from day to day as new cable works are completed or new exchange equipment is installed. The following table illustrates the current overall position-</PARA>
<PARA> Awaiting installation</PARA>
<PARA> Awaiting cabling</PARA>
<PARA> of exchange equipment</PARA>

<PARA>New South Wales (incl. ACT)  173 2,887 150 857 4,067 Victoria  234 951 322 329 1,836 Queensland  218 2,515 59 310 3,102 South Australia (incl. NT)  191 549 0 103 843 Western Australia  312 1,198 0 3 1,513 Tasmania  116 253 42 22 433</PARA>
<PARA>  Australia  1,244 8,353 573 1,624 11,794</PARA>
<PARA> It will be seen that a large percentage of deferred applications are awaiting the completion of cable works in the country areas. Telecom expects the bulk of these works to be completed within the next 12 months. A small percentage of these deferred applications are in remote rural areas and Telecom has commenced work on its plans to expedite its rural network upgrading program to provide automatic service for manual subscribers and to enable applicants to be given service earlier than originally envisaged.</PARA>
<PARA> Most deferred applications which are due to shortages of exchange equipment are at exchanges which are out of numbers for relatively short periods and only minor equipment extensions are required to overcome them. However, in a number of areas, for example, northern New South Wales and the Queensland Gold and Sunshine Coasts, demand is running well ahead of forecasts. In these high growth areas, major equipment extensions are required. In some cases where exchange equipment has been fully allocated, further connections also depend on completion of exchange building extensions.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for National Development and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I am advised that all major oil companies in the United States of America refine and market leaded petrol.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The average price of super grade motor spirit in the United States of America was 30 cents (Australian) per litre on 8 January 1981. However, on 28 January President Reagan issued an order immediately decontrolling the price of crude oil in the United States. It is estimated that decontrol will add 5-10 US cents per gallon (1.1 to 2.3 (Aus.) cents per litre) to the cost of gasoline in the United States. On the basis of this information the indicated level of retail prices for super grade petrol in the United States is up to 32.3 (Aust.) cents per litre.</PARA>
<PARA> On 4 February 1981 the Prices Justification Tribunal set maximum wholesale prices for motor spirit in Australia. In Sydney these prices range between 33.57 and 34.77 cents per litre, resulting in the level of retail prices in Sydney being up to 37 cents per litre with prices being typically set around 35 cents per litre. In Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia those prices will be marginally higher as a result of the incidence of state levies (franchise fees) which add between 1.51 and 1.33 cents per litre to wholesale and retail prices.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The producers of crude oil in Australia have received approximately $1,100 in aggregate sales revenues from indigenous crude oil production for the three years 1977-78, 1978-79 and 1979-80 at the levels of producer returns provided for under the Government's policy of import parity pricing. However operating expenses, royalties and company tax will result in a significantly lower level of net profits after tax.</PARA>
<PARA> Production of motor spirit takes place in the refineries and as such it would be the refineries, and not the crude oil producers, who would bear any possible increase in production costs of lead-free petrol.</PARA>

<PARA> The review of telephone zoning and charging arrangements which led to the Community Access 80 initiatives concluded that community call access to Melbourne from the Woodend zone was not applicable as that zone did not adjoin an outer metropolitan zone.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZS7">Mr Thomson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) A synthesis telescope combines the output of a number of small movable radio-telescopes to provide a signal comparable in sensitivity and resolution to that which would be obtained from a large steerable radio-telescope with a diameter, were it feasible, of the order of kilometres. The concept, which has revolutionised radio-astronomy, was discovered by the CSIRO in 1947 and subsequently developed, especially in the UK.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes: for some twenty years the investment in high quality radio-astronomy facilities, of which the foremost is the CSIRO 64 metre diameter telescope at Parkes, NSW, has en- abled Australian scientists to achieve a high reputation in radio-astronomy as a result of a number of important Australian discoveries during this period.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) (a) In order to maintain Australia's high international reputation in radio-astronomy a powerful synthesis telescope is required. In the northern hemisphere a major facility was built in the Netherlands in the 1970s and the largest in the world is nearing completion in the USA. Australia is uniquely situated not only in location, but in skills and expertise, to provide a similar capability for study of the southern skies. The astronomical information gathered would be complementary to that obtained from other telescopes in the southern hemisphere, in the northern hemisphere and in space. Astronomical research with such telescopes is currently in the front line of fundamental discoveries of new phenomena and forces in nature. It ranks with the investigation of electricity in the nineteenth century and the atom in the first part of the twentieth.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Where telescope design can draw on expertise in other countries, an Australian designed and built synthesis telescope, which can be incorporated with the existing Parkes facility is the most practical and economic way for Australia to proceed. As a major proportion of the facility will be built in Australia, the consequent benefits for Australian industries will be substantial.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) A consortium of CSIRO, Australian National University and three State universities submitted a proposal to the Australian Science and Technology Council (ASTEC) in September 1975 for the construction of a synthesis telescope in Australia. In its Report to the Prime Minister entitled 'The Next Generation of Australian Telescopes' (March 1979), ASTEC gave first priority to the construction of the proposed Australian Synthesis Telescope. That recommendation was supported in July 1980 by the Astronomy Advisory Committee, which advises me on matters relating to Government support in this area, in its report 'Astronomy in Australia-Developments in the 1980s'. Consideration is being given to the proposal taking note of the views expressed in this recent report.</PARA>
