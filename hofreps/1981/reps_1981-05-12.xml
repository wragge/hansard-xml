<PARA> The Clerk-Petitions have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate Ministers:</PARA>
<PARA>Proposed Sale of Trans-Australia Airlines</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> Many Australians depend almost exclusively upon Trans-Australia Airlines for the provision of essential air services.</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Liberal Party policy objective of selling Trans-Australia Airlines within 4 years is contrary to the national interest.</PARA>
<PARA> Sale of Trans-Australia Airlines would inevitably result in:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the creation of a private monopoly of major airline services in Australia;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) higher domestic air fares.</PARA>
<PARA>Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House of Representatives will reject outright any proposal to sell Trans-Australia Airlines</PARA>

<TITLE>Excise on Beer</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The hotel industry in Australia is long-established and a valuable part of the community of this nation, providing places where the people may partake of the three basic needs of life: a place to eat, a place to drink, a place to sleep.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. The hotel industry is accepted throughout the nation as occupying an important place in the social and economic activities of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. The hotel industry is almost entirely within the private sector and makes a large contribution to the government in taxes of various kinds.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. The hotel industry has a need to sustain an appropriate level of turnover and growth, to make profit, and to sustain and improve the level of employment.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. The hotel industry of Australia is gravely concerned at published reports that the Government intends to increase excise charges on beer in the forthcoming Budget.</PARA>
<PARA> 6. Sales of beer constitute the major source of income of most of the industry's 5811 hotels in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> 7. The very steep rises in beer excise in 1975 and 1978 severely retarded the growth of the Australian hotel industry.</PARA>
<PARA> 8. Any further increases in excise on beer in the 1981 Budget would further retard the industry at a time when growth is essential to maintaining economic viability and the ability to serve the constantly growing needs of the community.</PARA>
<PARA> 9. Such is its significance as a community requirement, beer occupies a place on the Consumer Price Index, and any alteration to its cost to the community would have an inflationary effect.</PARA>
<PARA> 10. Any increase in excise would result in and force the hotel industry to pass on such increase to the consumer by way of higher prices for beer.</PARA>
<PARA> 11. Higher excise would be only the starting point for an upward spiral in beer prices because of the presence of other factors, such as State Licence Fee taxes, which are directly linked to excise rates.</PARA>
<PARA> 12. The hotel industry of Australia already is gravely handicapped by heavy excise and other tax imposts, its growth is at a standstill; and, inevitably must decline if beer excise is increased.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that Honourable Members of the House of Representatives:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Recognise the importance and place of the Australian Hotel industry in social and economic life of the nation.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Accept that the viability of the hotel industry is essential to the maintenance of employment opportunities and stability of the industry is essential to enable it to continue to provide for the hotel needs of the nation in this period of growing population and increasing tourism.</PARA>
<PARA> And further, that Honourable Members of the House of Representatives resist and reject any move to increase excise on beer.</PARA>

<TITLE>Plant Breeders' Rights</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. We, the undersigned citizens of the Commonwealth, do humbly pray that the Commonwealth Government:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Note that legislation establishing plant breeders' rights in other countries has had serious adverse effects, namely:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Virtual monopoly control of seed production has passed into the hands of a few large international corporations seeking to profit from the exclusive rights over plant genetic materials created by such legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The varieties of seeds available have been restricted mainly to hybrids which will not reproduce truly and will not grow without the aid of artificial fertilizers and pesticides, thus maximising corporate profits without regard for the interests of growers and consumers.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) The genetic diversity of crops has been eroded, rendering them vulnerable to disease and other environmental threats.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Recognise that maintenance of the genetic diversity of plant varieties is crucial to the continued well-being of the Australian nation, and take all necessary steps to preserve and promote such genetic diversity as a public resource and to prevent exclusive control over plant genetic materials from falling into private hands.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. Defend the vital interests of Australian farmers and gardeners, independent Australian seed companies and their employees, and consumers of Australian farm and garden produce, by rejecting any proposal to legislate for the establishment of plant breeders' rights in Australia.</PARA>

<PARA> That the level of benefits for all unemployed people, and including people receiving sickness benefits and pensions, be raised to at least 120 per cent of the poverty line.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned showeth that your petitioners are gravely concerned at the prospect of the proposed Plant Breeder's Rights legislation. The reasons are as follows.</PARA>
<PARA> (1) We believe it will restrict free growing and exchange or sale of non-chemically treated seeds.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) We believe it will cause a decline in the genetic diversity of plants as evidenced in Europe following implementation of similar legislation there.</PARA>

<TITLE>Discriminatory Legislation</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives of the Australian Parliament in Canberra assembled. The petition of certain citizens respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That the right to work without discrimination on any ground including, inter alia, discrimination on grounds of race, ethnic origin, pregnancy, marital status, sex and/or sexual preference, is a fundamental human right; and</PARA>
<PARA> That it is both the duty and the responsibility of society to fully support those denied work and therefore those who are unemployed as a result of society's inability to provide full paid employment should be guaranteed an adequate income without discrimination on any ground, including inter alia discrimination on grounds of race, ethnic origin, marital status, sex and/or sexual preference, or pregnancy.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray:</PARA>
<PARA> That appropriate and adequate laws be formulated and passed to outlaw discrimination in Commonwealth employment, in employment of persons by statutory bodies and quasi-governmental organisations, in employment of individuals under federal awards, and in employment of all persons in areas over which Commonwealth and Australian Capital Territory equal opportunity legislation should have jurisdiction; and</PARA>

<PARA> The humble petition of the undersigned showeth that your petitioners are gravely concerned by the threats to women's health and lives posed by Toxic Shock Syndrome, and urge the following steps to be taken as a matter of urgency:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Tampons, sanitary napkins, vaginal deodorants and similar sanitary products to be re-classified under Therapeutic Agents (not under ''Cosmetics'' as at present), in order to bring them under the scrutiny of the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee. We believe manufacture must be under the strictest hygienic conditions.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) After re-classification, we urge an immediate government-funded inquiry into all aspects of manufacture and content of these products. This must lead to: (i) contents of product and instructions for correct usage to be shown on packaging; (ii) removal of synthetic fibres, chemicals or ingredients that are potentially or actually harmful to users.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Allocation of extra funding for ongoing research by the National Health and Medical Research Council into these products, results of this research to be made public to ensure all health workers and potential users are fully informed. This campaign of public education would necessitate multilingual distribution of the information where appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA>Your petitioners, therefore, humbly request that Parliament take immediate and positive action to avert possible threats posed to women's health by implementation of the above measures.</PARA>

<TITLE>Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in the Parliament assembled. This petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The proposal to introduce fees for higher and second degrees will mean that access to post-graduate and recurrent education will be limited to the rich; Australian research and ability to cope with technological change will suffer; this proposal must be seen as a step in the direction of the introduction of fees for all tertiary students.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. The proposed introduction of a loans scheme for students will mean graduating with a heavy debt or being denied a tertiary education if loans are refused because a student is seen as a 'poor risk' (particularly affecting women and those doing non-vocational courses); only the rich will be able to get a tertiary education without course restrictions and the burden of indebtedness.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. In regard to the proposal to restrict eligibility for TEAS and the foreshadowing of reviewing TEAS levels only in the light of the availability of loans, it should be noted that any further downgrading of TEAS, which is already inadequate, can only further limit access to education.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. The proposed restriction of Adult Secondary Assistance to those needing qualifications for employment will severely restrict access to a full high school education and necessary bridging education to tertiary education for those who left school early.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. The proposal not to fund 30 Colleges of Advanced Education if they are not rationalised is an attack on teacher education. This attack will create teacher shortages in the mid 1980s, restrict access to education now and endanger the future quality of teaching available to Australian children.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore pray that:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) post-secondary tuition fees not be introduced for any courses or for any category of students;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) that the TEAS scheme be extended so as to more fully meet the real financial needs of students;</PARA>
<PARA>(iii) that a comprehensive loans scheme not be introduced;</PARA>
<PARA>(iv) that there be no restriction of Adult Secondary Assistance;</PARA>
<PARA> (v) that the proposal not to fund 30 CAEs unless they are rationalised be rescinded.</PARA>

<PARA> 1. That continued use of animal ingredients in cosmetic products, and the inhumane use of animals in scientific research for cosmetic products is abhorrent and barbaric.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. That no central records exist on such inhumane use of live animals for experimentation purposes, yet research institutions in several Australian States engage in such a practice.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. That there exists no uniform legislation between the States concerning responsible standards of research conduct, indeed, in some States there is a complete lack of legislation altogether.</PARA>

<TITLE>Privacy and Personal Information</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled.</PARA>
<PARA>The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA>Paragraphs 107 and 108 of the Privacy and Personal Information discussion paper number 14, brought down by the Law Reform Commission in June 1980, undermines the family unit and the authority of parents, which is the Christian basis of our society, by proposing that ''between 12 and 16 years, a child should be entitled to object to disclosure of information to a parent.''</PARA>
<PARA>It is your petitioners sincere belief that:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) an adolescent between the ages of 12 and 16 is not at a mature enough stage of life to decide whether or not the disclosure of information to a parent will be in the best interests of the adolescent.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) as a record keeper has no responsibility for the child, and as his moral standards may be different to those of a parent, he should not be permitted to come between child and parent.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) a parent has a unique position which may enable him/her to perceive a situation that the record keeper does not. The parent must therefore be aware of the problem if remedial action is to be taken, and has the right to guide the child in the direction he/she feels fit.</PARA>
<PARA>Your petitioners therefore pray:</PARA>
<PARA>That the Members of the House of Representatives will reject the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission and find some other means to protect children from the excessive abuse of some parents.</PARA>

<PARA> That the proposed use of Darwin Airport as a refuelling and Rest and Recreation base for American B52 bombers:</PARA>
<PARA> Jeopardises the welfare of the citizens of Darwin and of all Australians, in that it establishes a stronger potential of Darwin being a nuclear target in any conflict between the U.S.A. and another power.</PARA>

<PARA> (a) carried nuclear weapons;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) were engaged in bombing missions against another State.</PARA>
<PARA> Violates the Australian people's independence and links this nation irreconcilably with United States foreign policies thereby destroying the potential for independent Australian defence policy.</PARA>
<PARA> Violates democratic procedures in committing the Australian nation to participation in future wars without due consultation and informed assessment by Australian citizens and further increases the militarisation of the Indian Ocean thereby increasing the likelihood of super power conflict in this region.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of certain citizens of Western Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That we protest most strongly against the present two airline domestic policy of the Commonwealth Government.</PARA>
<PARA> That this policy has resulted in expensive airfares and poor service and discourages tourists from the Eastern States visiting Western Australia and vice versa.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Government will look favourably on our petition and formulate an Airline Policy providing for greater competition so that prices and service are determined by free market forces.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RK4">Mr HAYDEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Prime Minister: Is it a fact that the strongest opposition has been expressed by every State government to proposed cuts in funding to the States, the objectionable manner in which those cuts were achieved, and particularly to cuts in health funding? Is it a fact that both the Queensland and Western Australian Premiers consider the cuts not only wrong on policy grounds but also immoral in the way in which they were achieved, and probably illegal? In view of that, and in the interests of trying to establish some harmony in Federal relations, will the Prime Minister now swallow his pride and recall the Premiers Conference as soon as possible to work out a fairer and more honest deal?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2221" SPEAKER="Fraser The Rt Hon J.M." NAMEID="QS4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="WANNON" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QS4">Mr MALCOLM FRASER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The arrangements that have been worked out with the Premiers in relation to these matters are fair. They are fair in particular when we have regard to the needs of the taxpayers of this country. At a Premiers Conference during the winter last year, the Premiers indicated to me that they were going to have meetings amongst themselves, excluding the Commonwealth, and that they would then put proposals to us for a review of the tax sharing arrangements because under the original agreements the tax sharing arrangements had to be re-established, re-negotiated, by 30 June this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I put it to the Premiers at that time when they made their own proposal known that it would be much better if the Commonwealth could participate in that discussion with the Premiers. I said that if they did not do that, it could so easily lead to a situation where we have Premiers putting one view and the Commonwealth in the interests of the Australian taxpayers having another view-a situation where it is difficult to get to a final agreement. The Premiers persisted with the view that they wanted to meet by themselves. They met in September. I think letters were sent to me at that time indicating a need for an urgent meeting then to discuss the results of their review but that could not take place because the results of their review did not really come forward until some time in February. So, the Premiers themselves, discussing these matters amongst themselves, took from September till about February to be able to formulate their own view.</PARA>
<PARA> The document which they provided to us was one in which firm views were not really put. They argued on the one hand for maintaining a percentage of income tax revenue; they argued on the other the merits of making the percentage a percentage of total taxes. We obviously have examined the States' document in the decisions that we have made. If I might take that one point-a percentage of income tax or a percentage of total taxes to be defined by discussion between ourselves and the States-the second alternative is obviously one that would give the States greater security in the revenues that they have because the fluctuation in all Commonwealth revenues is likely to be to a degree less than the fluctuations that could occur in one particular form of revenue.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition to that, since the States had expressed concerns over the previous years that adjustments to income tax should not be made without prior consultation with them-and that obviously put any Commonwealth government in difficulty in relation to the formulation of its own Budget because one cannot discuss major matters of that kind on a wider front-the Commonwealth had come to the view and put to the Premiers that it would be better to relate the funds that go to the States as a percentage of all revenue to be defined rather than as a percentage of income tax. The Commonwealth Government, as a result of reviewing matters that the Premiers put and the reference by the Treasurer and me of these matters back to the Cabinet, had decided to maintain the view that a percentage of all revenue was better from the States' point of view than a percentage of income tax.</PARA>
<PARA> There would be no purpose in reconvening the Conference at the present time. It needs to be understood that there will be a meeting with the Premiers in June that has important matters to discuss, including the infrastructure program, the Loan Council programs and the borrowing programs of semi-government authorities and smaller authorities. On that occasion there will be opportunity for the States to raise matters related to those issues. But I should indicate that the main thrust of the Government's decisions in relation to tax sharing has been made. There has been discussion with the Premiers in relation to it. In discussion this morning, the Government made it very plain that in the interests of Australian taxpayers who are interested in smaller government, whether that be from the Commonwealth or from the States, we adhere to the views that have been put and we adhere to the decisions that have been put.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Health has also reported to us on discussions which he had. I do not want to make any comment about that at the present time except to say that the main thrust of the arrangements that we have made in relation to health will stand.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs to recent newspaper advertisements by the Government which promote the employment of disabled persons. Assuming these advertisements are part of a campaign for the International Year of Disabled Persons, will the Minister advise the House whether this is all the Commonwealth will be doing in the field of employment for disabled persons in their designated year? If not, will the Minister advise the House as to what else is being done or planned to be done?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OD4">Mr N. A. BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Even before the International Year of Disabled Persons the Government clearly recognised the importance of improving the employment prospects of disabled people. This concern has been heightened and emphasised by the fact that this is the International Year of Disabled Persons. Accordingly, the Commonwealth has embarked upon a number of specific initiatives to achieve this objective. In the first place, as the honourable member pointed out, there has been a significant promotional campaign under way to encourage the placement of disabled persons in employment. This program has two stages. The first is directed to senior management and the second is directed to those people in management who actually take people on and employ them in companies and enterprises. Secondly, the Government has also established Commonwealth employment promotion committees in each State and the Northern Territory to look specifically at the employment problems of disabled persons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Thirdly, in respect of specific programs to assist the disabled, the Minister for Housing and Construction has already taken initiatives to ensure that improved access is provided for disabled people within Commonwealth premises. It is perhaps not widely known, as it should be known, that there is an incentive available from the Government of some $2,000 for the purchase of special equipment and the making of necessary modifications to the work place to enable disabled persons more adequately to take their place in the work force. In Commonwealth Employment Service offices there are special personnel who are attuned to the needs and specific requirements of disabled persons. This likewise is making a very substantial contribution to enabling disabled persons to obtain employment. The Commonwealth is doing all those things and more. I can assure the honourable member that, especially through the work of the State committees, the Commonwealth is determined to make every effort to adapt the work place as far as possible to the needs of disabled persons and to ensure that as many disabled persons as possible are placed in suitable and satisfying employment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable gentleman has a misunderstanding of the negotiating mandate that the Treasurer and I had on that occasion. It is perfectly plain that a Cabinet is capable of expressing a view to a Treasurer and Prime Minister and saying: That is the maximum extent to which you can go but we do not want you to go anything like that far. That is precisely the situation the Treasurer and I were in. We negotiated within the authority. It is not a question of there being an extra $70m. That money would have to be prospectively taken off the taxpayers of Australia to be paid to the Premiers. It is not a question of the $70m being in somebody's kitty or up in the sky. It is a question of its having to be prospectively taken from the taxpayers of Australia to be paid to the Premiers or somebody else.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The policy that the Government has pursued for some time is administered by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and me to provide protection to the Australian shipbuilding industry. This policy has been under some criticism by companies wishing to drill for oil off-shore. I have had a number of representations from people expressing concern about the matter. As a result of that concern the policy is currently under review to ensure that it does not unduly inhibit, or add to the costs of, oil search in this country. I do not have at my fingertips the actual cost of this policy, and any costs associated with it, but I will make sure that I get the information that the honourable member requires and make it available to him. If it is necessary, I will make it publicly available.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I have said, the policy is under review. At present I am not aware of the policy having had an impact on any particular company. We have had discussions with a number of companies and I think their requirements have been adequately met as a result of negotiations that have transpired. We will not inhibit the oil search program with a policy that could provide an impediment to oil search generally in this country.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is directed to the Prime Minister, relates to the letter from the Premier of Western Australia to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister agree with Sir Charles Court's statement that the States' share of personal income tax is theirs as of right, being equivalent to taxation reimbursement arrangements which have existed since 1942? Will the Prime Minister make a reality his claim to decentralise financial responsibility by holding what Sir Charles calls 'proper consultation' rather than unilaterally dictating what funds the States can receive? Since the States together have the legal power to control the Loan Council, what action will the Prime Minister propose should the States decide to make up for the cuts in their general assistance grants by increasing their borrowing?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QS4">Mr MALCOLM FRASER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable gentleman would be well advised to wait until the Loan Council meeting takes place before he decides what can or should be done in relation to it. I can assist him to this extent: In relation to the infrastructure programs where some States have claims for massive increases which would double the size of the total program, before a project can be approved there needs to be a simple majority of the Loan Council, of which the Commonwealth must be a part. The States are examining at the moment whether they, as States, see any particular level at which the borrowing requirements of the States would be too high. It will be interesting to see what judgment they make on that but obviously the Commonwealth is in a position of being able to make its own judgment if it has to. It is odd for governments to look upon the taxpayers' funds, whether from income tax or some other tax, as belonging to any government as of right. I believe that the funds earned by taxpayers are theirs as of right and that governments need to justify spending that part of people's incomes which the governments do spend.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whilst I can understand the purpose behind the honourable member's question, I have to point out to him that there is a great deal of guessing involved in some of the figures which he has used. The real test that had to be applied to the Australian Wool Testing Authority, when the Review of Commonwealth Functions committee looked at it, was whether there would be any detriment to the industry were the Authority to become a private wool testing house.

He knows that in the United Kingdom private wool testing houses are used. These private wool testing houses have achieved the same high reputation as has the Wool Testing Authority in Australia. On all the criteria that are applied to the matter, it cannot be claimed at this point that any real detriment would occur to either the industry or the wool growers if the Wool Testing Authority became a private wool testing house. That is the first point to make. With respect to the second part of the honourable member's question concerning the transfer of the Australian Wool Testing Authority, it is our intention to give it adequate time within which to prepare for an orderly transition from a government-owned organisation to a private test house. Thus there should not be any delay or hiatus in the issuing of certificates. It should prove possible to transfer the organisation as a going concern.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Treasurer. No doubt he is aware of the fact that at present there are two takeover proposals announced in respect of two trading banks. Many people would regard a licence to conduct banking business as an extremely valuable asset. Arising out of those comments I ask the following questions: Firstly, has the Treasurer given consideration to the sale by tender or by some other appropriate means of licences to conduct banking business?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am interested in the suggestion made by the honourable member. Certainly, it is the fact that the issue of a banking licence confers upon the recipient of that licence an extremely valuable asset. That is more particularly the case under existing policy whereby considerable restrictions are placed upon those persons or organisations which can hold banking licences. As I think the House will be aware, the subject of the regulations under which banks operate in Australia is one that has been examined very closely by the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System. I expect that that Committee will report in August or September of this year. I would be surprised if the Committee did not have something to say in some detail about banks and banking practices and the conditions on which the Government ought to approach banking operations in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In those circumstances, the type of proposal that the honourable member has in mind obviously could be considered by the Government in the context of looking at the Campbell Committee's report. Some differences exist between the considerations that bear upon the sale of privileges of that kind by tender in respect of other industries and those that might bear upon the sale of them in respect of banks. In any event the question loses some of its relevance depending upon the extent to which one removes the restrictions on the granting of licences.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Treasurer to the figures released yesterday showing that the level of capital inflow in the March quarter of $1,705m was the highest ever recorded. I ask: Is it a fact that a very high proportion of this capital is being brought to Australia as portfolio investment to buy shares in existing Australian businesses and not for the purpose of establishing new industries? Will the Treasurer tell the House what procedures, if any, are employed by the Foreign Investment Review Board to monitor the level of foreign portfolio holdings in Australian com- panies and what criteria are used to arrive at the classification of certain shareholdings as Australian? Finally, what steps is the Government taking to protect the Australian ownership of existing businesses against the capricious investment policies of large foreign companies and large foreign institutions?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the figures referred to by the honourable member for Blaxland. They are further evidence of the attractiveness of this country to foreigners as a place in which to invest. Much and all as those on the opposite side of the House complain and find it a matter for adverse comment, this country is regarded as having a stable economy. That is precisely why there is such very heavy investment in this country. The honourable member for Blaxland knows as well as I do the provisions of the Foreign Takeovers Act which relate to the acquisition of Australian businesses, he knows as well as I do the provisions of the foreign investment policy so far as they relate to new projects, and he knows as well as I do that the high level of portfolio investment in this country is a tribute to the success of this Government's economic policies.</PARA></TALK.START>

I addressed to the Treasurer a question not about takeovers but about the cancerous behaviour of this buying up of shares in fairly small parcels by a myriad of institutions overseas. They are not takeovers as block investments. I want to know what the Government's attitude is to the buying up of Australia in parcels by a number of institutions, whether this is monitored and what the Government will do about it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Treasurer to his statement yesterday on the two proposed bank mergers in which he said that his general view was that strong national interest considerations would need to be involved before the Government sought to interfere with normal commercial processes. In view of the fact that these mergers would reduce the number of banks by one-third and concentrate almost half of the assets of all financial institutions in the hands of four banks, thereby reducing competition and providing more scope for excessive profits, is the Treasurer seriously suggesting that strong national interests are not involved? Further, would it not be more appropriate for the Government to put the onus on the banks by requiring them to demonstrate that strong national benefits would result from these mergers before they are allowed to proceed?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2226" SPEAKER="Howard The Hon J.W." NAMEID="ZD4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="BENNELONG" MINISTERIAL="TREASURER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The problem with the honourable member's suggestion is that it ignores the provisions of section 63 of the Banking Act which provides that the consent of the Treasurer is required for a merger and that that consent will not be unreasonably withheld. That is utterly inconsistent with the course of conduct which is suggested by the honourable member. To suggest that to put upon those seeking consent the onus to demonstrate the national interest meets the requirements of a provision that consent should not be unreasonably withheld is an odd construction of the language of section 63 of the Banking Act. I have indicated that the Government has yet to receive formal applications in respect of either of the mergers that have been mooted in recent days. When those formal applications are received, consideration will be given promptly to the question of consent under section 63. I expect the parties seeking approval for the respective mergers will, in their applications, address a number of things, including such matters as the question of future staff arrangements and the provision of an adequate branch network to service the needs of different parts of the country. There are a number of other matters which no doubt will be addressed by the banks in making their applications. A judgment will then be made on the basis of the applications put forward by the respective parties. I repeat the view I expressed yesterday, that strong national interests need to exist in order for the Government to interfere in what are essentially commercial arrangements between financial enterprises in this country. In company with a lot of the comment that has been made in other places about these mergers, the honourable gentleman talks as though the only banks in Australia are the six trading banks, including the Commonwealth Banking Corporation, which was referred to in his question. I remind him that a significant number of State banks are in existence in Australia and that, since the last occasion on which there were significant mergers between trading banks in this country, there has been a very major change in the structure of the financial sector in Australia and there has been a significant rise in the contribution of merchant banks. There has been a significant rise in the strength and the contribution of building societies offering, as they do, a number of facilities which are offered also by parts of the trading bank structure. It is a total misunderstanding of the Australian financial system to talk as though it is entirely constituted by those six trading banks.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As described in the report of the Australian Wool Corporation, the Commonwealth's equity in wool stores covers the Corporation and the public equity in the land and in the stores held by the Corporation. It is true that the Corporation had an obligation in times of emergency to store Australia's wool clip. That obligation will be maintained in the future. But it is also true-I think it is agreed-that there are a number of wool stores that are surplus to the requirements of the Wool Corporation. We on this side of the House believe that it is not appropriate that a government monopoly, such as the Corporation, in this sense ought to be competing with the private sector in the leasing of stores that are not used for their main purpose. Therefore the decision has been taken that, after discussion with the Wool Corporation, some of the stores should be sold. I do not know where the honourable member gets the idea that in some way this will create an extra cost to the wool grower, but I will look at that aspect of his question and see whether I can give him any further information.</PARA></TALK.START>

Will the companies who prepared submissions be compensated for the incorrect information given to them? Does the Minister acknowledge that this project would have been a great incentive to the tourist industry and the Canberra economy? Does he acknowledge that the convention centre and hotel could proceed without Federal Government assistance if a casino were included in the project?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-On 5 May this year, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) repeated to this House two demands for renegotiation of the North West Cape Naval Communication Station Agreement. These were demands he first stated when he spoke to the National Press Club on 14 April 1981. The demands are:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Firstly, that Australia's consent is mandatory for all orders to initiate military action which flow from the station; and secondly, that we be given firm and convincing assurances that the station will not be used to send orders for a first-strike nuclear attack or to initiate a limited strike. </PARA>
<PARA>Responding to my statement that these demands amounted to an Australian veto over United States use of the North West Cape Station, and that it was unreasonable to expect the United States to co-operate in such a veto, the honourable member said:</PARA>
<PARA> Does he know what the two most senior people in the American Embassy, apart from the Ambassador who is yet to arrive, have declared to me, to members of my staff and to at least one of my colleagues that they find no problems with what we are proposing. They understand completely our concern about national sovereignty. They believe they can work with the proposal. </PARA>
<PARA>I immediately had inquiries made of the United States Embassy about this statement by the honourable member. On 6 May, the United States Charge d'Affaires, Mr Stephen Lyne, wrote to me in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Mr Minister:</PARA>
<PARA> Statements made in Parliamentary debates yesterday by the Leader of the Opposition regarding the installations jointly operated by the Australian and US Governments in Australia have come to the Embassy's attention. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hansard for May 5, 1981, quotes Mr Hayden as stating that senior Embassy officials told him and his staff that they found ''no problem with'' and ''can work with'' his proposals. I wish to clarify that, insofar as Mr Hayden's statement refers to his two proposals that the North West Cape Agreement be renegotiated to provide for mandatory Australian consent to initiate military actions and convincing assurances that the Station not be used to send orders for first-strike nuclear attack or to initiate a limited strike, the Embassy did not give such assurances nor did it have the authority to give them. </PARA>
<PARA>With the Embassy's permission, I now table this letter. Although marked confidential the letter has since been declassified. I should not wish a misunderstanding between my honourable friend and officers of the United States Embassy to become the central feature of our discussion of this important topic. My honourable friend might have misinterpreted some general comment by the Embassy-to the effect that, should a Labor government come to power, the United States Government would discuss any concerns about the facilities that that government might raise. This seems to me the sort of response that one would expect from an Embassy in such circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me add that it would really be fruitless for us to become side-tracked by this issue. Clearly we cannot know how a United States government might respond to the Labor Party's demands regarding the North West Cape agreement until the Labor Party is able to form a government and formally put its proposals forward and require a governmental response. This is not the position at the present time. It remains for me to say that if there are some further briefings that my friend would like then I would be quite willing to facilitate those briefings at his convenience. I present the following paper:</PARA>

<PARA> I give honourable members the facts for the record so that there is no doubt about the circumstances and the justification in association with my claim. On 14 April I addressed the National Press Club. It was a speech which covered, first of all, the relationship between the super-powers concerning nuclear strategic doctrine and matters associated with that. It then related to joint defence facilities in this country-Nurrungar, Pine Gap, Smithfield and North West Cape. I then outlined the reaction of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen), who accompanied me on my visit to those facilities and both before and after that visit participated with me in quite extensive briefings and inquiries we projected at the people conducting the briefings at the Department of Defence. In relation to North West Cape I expressed certain reservations about the implications of how that facility could operate. I will not go over that. But, after I spoke I left the hall where the Press Club luncheon which I addressed took place and went to the bar-a perfectly understandable reaction. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, and we both enjoyed good company. My private secretary, Mr Mike Costello, was standing in the foyer near the reception desk. He was approached by Mr McAndrew of the American Embassy. Mr McAndrew said, explicitly, the things I have stated. He not only stated them-voluntarily-but also he said them in the hearing of my Press secretary, Mr Alan Ramsey. A little later Mr McAndrew entered the precincts of the bar at the National Press Club. He approached me and repeated those things to me. He repeated them in the hearing and presence of another member of my staff, Mr Michael Roche, a research officer, who heard the full discussion. Some of that discussion was overheard by Mr Costello, who had joined us. Subsequently, I think in the first week of the Easter recess, but certainly during that recess, Mr McAndrew called at my office in Canberra. I was absent. He spoke again with Mr Costello and repeated the views which I have put; that is, that the Americans found no problems with what we were proposing, that they understood completely our concern about sovereignty and that they believed they could work with the proposals. That, comprehensively, was their view. There were no ifs or buts, no qualifications and no special reservations about any aspects of those proposals, including North West Cape.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My colleague Senator Gareth Evans tells me that unsolicitedly-all of these comments were unsolicited-Mr Stephen Lyne, charge d'affaires of the American Embassy, approached him and said exactly that too. It seems that there is now some re-assessment of the view earlier extended by the American Embassy representatives. I repeat: Firstly, none of us asked for these testimonies to be expressed by those spokesmen, and secondly, apart from being voluntary, they were given quite openly in the presence of other people and were not in any sense what could be described as confidential comments. They were given openly and freely to several people and in the presence of several people. The only other observation I have to make on this matter is that the Minister for Defence was generous enough to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Clearly we cannot know how a United States government might respond to the Labor Party's demands regarding the North West Cape agreement, until the Labor Party is able to form a government and formally puts its proposals forward and require a governmental response. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a considerably diminished expression of view on this matter to that which the Minister put not just forthrightly but I thought provocatively about a fortnight ago when he made his statement in relation to this matter. It would be unfortunate if these matters were to be taken up with some sense of inflammation on the part of the people taking them up, if the debate were to get under way in circumstances somewhat frenetic and if we were to lose sight of the real issues at stake. These are powerful issues; they are crucial issues. They are central to so much that is related to the future of mankind. As I have said before, because of these joint facilities we are deeply involved in superpower strategic nuclear doctrine and the implications that flow from that. We need an informed and sober debate on these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> If there has been a misunderstanding as to the extent to which the American officials could present their views, then I accept that, but I will not accept that I, members of my staff or my colleague Senator Evans have misunderstood in any way at all what has been said. I am prepared to leave the matter there and to debate the issues. But, if it is the wish of any person concerned about this, from the Government side or from the American Embassy, to make an issue of it then I am happy to enter the lists and continue the debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government's aim is to advance the welfare of the Australian people. The great social and humanitarian reforms of the last century were largely possible because of increased industrial productivity, better health services and improved communications. Science and technology played a major role. It is equally true that science and technology will underwrite Australia's economic and social development in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Questions of the Government's role, the ways of co-ordinating science policy and establishing priorities must fall within this aim. The first science statement was tabled last year and I believe the document was a major development in helping to answer science policy questions. It provided a new basis for analysis, observing changes and providing data. </PARA>
<PARA> The response to the science statement has been positive and this year it has been expanded to cover not only research and development but also a range of scientific and technological activities. It is now the science and technology statement, not just the science statement, and some new figures have to be treated cautiously. It is a post-Budget analysis of Commonwealth expenditure listed by agency, Ministry and by socio-economic objectives. I would like to thank fellow Ministers, their officers and the Australian Science and Technology Council for their help in compiling the statement. </PARA>
<PARA>Development of Science and Technology Policy</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>In formulating Government policies towards science and technology, both long and short term factors have to be examined and taken into account. Over the past decade there have been significant changes in community attitudes to science and technology which cannot be ignored. Presently there is concern about job replacing technology, the environment, the availability of a highly skilled work force and a continuing supply of energy. In addition, I sense a growing fear of the impact of science and technology among the less well informed. </PARA>
<PARA> Looking towards the year 2000 there are several factors which will have an important impact on science and technology policies. Some examples are the emergence of new technologies, such as biotechnologies and micro-electronics, changes in the patterns of energy supply and demographic changes. Coherent and far-sighted policies are needed to meet these challenges. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has pointed out that these challenges and changes will require a different sort of policy response-one in which science and technology policy is taken together with economic and social policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian science itself must also recognise these changes and respond to them. This is as much the responsibility of individual scientists as it is of governments and other bodies responsible for formulating science policy. </PARA>
<PARA>Government role</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Government is determined that the science and technology sector should not be considered in isolation. It must be linked and co-ordinated with other sectors such as manufacturing, tertiary and primary industries and energy to form a coherent research policy to meet national goals. Scientific, economic and social policies must be integrated. At the same time the public must be kept continually informed. Society should not be put in a position of being swept along by new developments without influencing their direction. This is the basic reason that I have produced the science and technology statement. To help meet these objectives a four point plan was outlined last year in the science statement. The plan balances the demands for science and technology to meet community needs and problems with public concern over possible side effects from new technologies. The plan is to stimulate and support basic research, applied research, to transfer research results into the market place and to minimise any undesirable impacts of new technologies. </PARA>
<PARA>Government Support for Industrial Research</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Apart from establishing policy and priorities, governments are examining the extent to which they should promote innovation through funding of basic research and industrial research and development. This question was discussed at an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Conference of Science and Technology which I attended earlier this year. Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development reports are challenging the prevailing economic wisdom that the solution to current economic problems lies solely with conventional demand management mechanisms. Major recommendations focus on the critical importance of restoring declining innovation. Co-ordinated technological and economic policies must be used to create a growing economy. Governments throughout the world have accepted this premise. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. The Australian Government has been involved in 'pump priming' industrial research and development through the Industrial Research and Development Incentives Scheme. It is the Government's plan to use the scheme to increase employment, raise productivity and maintain the competitiveness of Australian industry. This year $53m is being spent. We believe this investment will repay itself many times over in the future. My Department has conducted a survey of estimated benefits which companies expect to receive this decade from project grants under the scheme. The companies estimate that new sales generated in this period will total $8,600m in domestic sales and a similar amount in exports. Jobs created will be an estimated 29,000.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Applied Science</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Government is continuing to support Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation research aimed at assisting Australian industry. In particular, CSIRO is stepping up its work in the manufacturing and energy sectors. A new Division of Manufacturing Technology has been created. Initially it will focus on the processing of metals and computer-aided manufacturing. </PARA>
<PARA> Also CSIRO is establishing a new Institute of Energy and Earth Resources formed from existing CSIRO energy research activities and the non-nuclear research sections of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission. Research will be expanded in such areas as fossil fuels, mining of energy resources, energy conservation, alternative fuels and renewable energy. Policy will be formulated in co-operation with my colleague, the Minister for National Development and Energy (Senator Carrick). In marine sciences, CSIRO will be expanding activities also to assist the fishing industry and the exploitation of off-shore resources. </PARA>
<PARA>Basic Research</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> I have concentrated mainly on policy considerations, particularly in meeting practical problems. Basic research must not be ignored. It is a paradox that, in order to apply science more directly and effectively to problems, we must extend our knowledge of basic science. Without this foundation successful technology transfer will not be possible. Basic research must be funded at a realistic level without necessarily being measured against short term application. The need of man to extend constantly his knowledge of himself and the universe is an undeniable argument for the funding of basic research. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government mainly funds basic research through the Australian Research Grants Scheme, the Australian Marine Sciences and Technologies Advisory Committee and the National Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Council. Over the past few years the Australian Science and Technology Council has examined the role of the Australian Research Grants Scheme, the role of university research, the objectives of funding basic research and the appropriate levels of funding. The Government has agreed to a recommendation from the Australian Science and Technology Council that the role of the Australian Research Grants Scheme must be used to support the most outstanding research projects. We have agreed also to an Australian Science and Technology Council recommendation that the universities themselves should allocate their internal research funds to give greater support for good quality research. Even greater emphasis will be placed on excellence as the basis of the Australian Research Grants Scheme support for research. </PARA>
<PARA>Role of private sector</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned that the private sector is still not investing enough in research and development. The Industrial Research and Development Incentives Scheme has arrested an alarming slump in industry spending in this area during the mid-seventies. There has been a slow upturn and I am challenging private enterprise to increase its spending in this important area. Research and development are essential if we are to compete internationally. Yet OECD figures indicate that spending by Australian industry is very low compared with other Western countries. I would like to see research and development spending by industry more than doubled in this decade. The whole innovative process from invention to commercial marketing will have to be strengthened also in line with this aim. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government makes an unequal contribution to research and development spending in Australia, currently accounting for about 70 per cent of the estimated total of $1,200m. The Government should not be expected to upgrade that figure further unless industry also greatly increases its research and development funding. It is in the interest of the private sector to increase its own effort and, in so doing, create new jobs. Industries not willing to do this run the risk of being left behind, and, as such, should not expect government protection. Australia's financial institutions also have been tardy in providing risk capital to develop and commercialise new products and processes. </PARA>
<PARA> Along with resources development, the creation of specialised high technology industries is necessary for Australia's long term economic well being. My Department has conducted forums bringing together financiers and high technology entrepreneurs. Matters discussed included changes to the capital market, establishing a specialist venture capital financing body and taxation incentives. We are planning also a high level symposium bringing together the Academy of Technological Sciences, financiers, and the Government to look at these points. The House will be aware that the Campbell Commission of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System is examining these and other related points. </PARA>
<PARA>Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Australian science and technology policy must be integrated with economic and social goals. If not, the nation's scientific and technological resources will be wasted. All sections of the economy must play their part in supporting science and technology if Australia is to be counted among the technologically advanced countries of the world. High technology industries must be created. Present industrial processes and products must incorporate the latest technology and must be basic research promoted. Australia must maintain and improve its data base of technological and scientific knowledge otherwise we will lose jobs and business opportunities to other countries. </PARA>
<PARA> We must not forget that science is a cultural activity essential to the spirit of mankind. This Government has adopted policies aimed at making the best use of science and technology for the economic and social advancement of all Australians. In pursuit of these goals, the Government is acting to minimise the undesirable social consequences of new technologies. A special sub-committee of the Australian Science and Technology Council has been established to advise the Government on this matter. The science and technology statement will be the factual basis on which scientists, policy makers and the public can work. I present the following paper:</PARA>
<PARA> Science and Technology 1980-81-Ministerial statement, 12 May 1981. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition welcomes an opportunity to comment on the statement Science and Technology 1980-81. There are several points where we can offer strong support for a bipartisan policy on science and technology: First, recognition of the central role played by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation-an enormous national asset and worth every cent of its $256m; second, concern that the private sector is still not investing enough in research and development; third, development of science and technology polcies in an economic and social context as recommended by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Council of Ministers, attended recently by the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Thomson); fourth, increased government expenditure in research and development, which already is about $840m for the year; fifth, support of basic research, broadly defined, even where an immediate economic application is not obvious; and sixth, recognition of the significance of some of the newly emerging high technology industries such as biotechnology.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, the Minister's statement is inadequate because it evades or ignores the economic and social problems which face the nation in areas related to science and technology. There is a fundamental contradiction between the interventionist philosophy advanced by the Minister, which we will gladly support, and the Friedmanite views advanced so recently by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the razor gang. Let me quote what the Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>OECD reports are challenging the prevailing economic wisdom that the solution to current economic problems lies solely with the conventional demand management mechanisms. </PARA>
<PARA>We agree. </PARA>
<PARA>Major recommendations focus on the critical importance of restoring declining innovation. Co-ordinated technological and economic policies must be used to create a growing economy. </PARA>
<PARA>He then said:</PARA>
<PARA>Governments throughout the world have accepted this premise. </PARA>
<PARA>I can think of a few examples that do not-the Australian Government, for example. The Minister advocates priming the pump. The free marketeers who sit behind the Minister want to sell the pump. They have no interest in having further investment in technology and science. Tell the razor gang that we want more pump priming, that we recognise that we have to invest far more before we can expect to get an economic return. Tell that to the honourable member for Hume (Mr Lusher). Tell it to the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton) or the honourable member for Moore (Mr Hyde) or the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Sainsbury). </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Or the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Bourchier), although his case is the greatest conversion since the Damascus Road. As far as this Government is concerned, we have a Minister who is trying his best to get a greater degree of government in- volvement in science and technology and a free marketeer group behind him and in the Ministry which says: 'No, slash it out. Leave it all to the market'. I applaud the Minister for saying that he does not believe in that. We do not believe in it either. I am glad that the Treasurer (Mr Howard) has come into the House. I welcome him. The Minister also said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Government is determined that the science and technology sector should not be considered in isolation. </PARA>
<PARA>We agree. </PARA>
<PARA>It must be linked and co-ordinated with other sectors such as manufacturing, tertiary and primary industries and energy to form a coherent research policy to meet national goals. Scientific, economic and social policies must be integrated. </PARA>
<PARA>There are several outstanding omissions from the factors which the Minister said ought to be taken into consideration. There are no references to the information sector of the economy or to education. The word 'education' never appears in the statement. In 1975 an OECD conference in Paris recommended recognising that information was itself a vital factor of production and that we ought to recognise information-based employment, that is to say, teaching, research, the media, the arts, office work, public services, and many business activities such as banking, insurance, and real estate, which are dependent on the collection, processing and dissemination of information, as a separate employment sector. The information sector is recognised as the largest single component of the United States economy, with about 45 per cent of employment. The Australian figure is above 30 per cent. It is about time we recognised this as a separate sector, its needs and its significance but it is completely ignored in the Minister's statement. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government is also pursuing a policy of benign neglect in respect of education. It sees resources exclusively as something which is dug up out of the ground. It does not see resources in human terms. I blush for the Minister, if he does not blush for himself, after the razor gang report urged that the Commonwealth should divest itself of its national responsibilities in education and transfer them back to the States. How can we possibly have a rational and coherent-coherent was the word the Minister used-set of national goals if education is to be divided and sent back to the States, saying: 'You work out in your individual areas what you want to do with the nation's education'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Quite so. About 40 per cent of Australian research is conducted in universities, much of it by people pursuing second or later degrees-in other words, precisely the people singled out for the slash of the razor gang. Australia cannot expect to expand its research and development, whether industrially based or not, and contract its educational base. We cannot do these two things at the same time. It is an absurdity. The Minister is trying to push for an expansion in industrial research and development, but at the same time his base-the educational base-is being undercut by the razor gang. That contraction is a recipe for disaster. Yesterday afternoon I was at the Engineering School at Monash University. The Dean, a very distinguished engineer, Professor Lance Endersbee, the outgoing President of the Institution of Engineers of Australia, made the point that because of the starvation of funds and because of extraordinarily low contribution of industry to the work the university is doing-so much of its work is directly related to industry-they find that only 20 per cent of post-graduate engineering students at Monash are Australian residents.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KH4">Mr BARRY JONES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will repeat that. This was said in the presence of other professors. It was not just a casual piece of conversation. Four other professors were discussing it. Of post-graduate engineering students at Monash, 80 per cent of students are not Australian residents. We need to make it perfectly clear that the Australian Labor Party has always welcomed the bringing in of students from South East Asia and other countries. But where are the Australians? Where is the expansion we need in that area so that we can provide not only for those numbers of people from South East Asia but also have adequate representation of Australians? The failure of the Government to provide facilities-I must add too, the failure of our own young people to respond to the challenge-is a matter for very grave concern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I urge the Minister to use all the strength at his command to persuade the razor gang and the Government that, in the national interest they must reverse the decisions they have made on education. They have come to regard education as a kind of non-essential activity, almost a wasteful activity. They see expenditure on education as a cost, they do not see it as an investment and a lot of them see post-graduate and research work as 'caviare for the general'. They do not really see it as being essential, central to the whole future of this country. The Minister rightly deplores the failure of industry to pay its share of the costs of research and development. The Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment report entitled 'Industrial Research and Development in Australia' deals in Table 4.15 with the ratio of business enterprise research and development to government research and development in OECD countries.

The report goes on:</PARA></TALK.START>

Government funding of Australian GERD in 1968-69 was 46 per cent. In 1973-74 it was 56 per cent, in 1976-77 it was 64 per cent and in 1978-79 it was 62 per cent. The Minister's statement indicates that it is now 70 per cent. Industry, where its own survival is involved, is kicking in only 30 per cent towards industrial research and development. That is a national scandal. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst I agree with so much of what the Minister said, he failed to deal with the question of why this is so. He observes the fact; he does not say why it happens. The reason is Australia has come to depend on technology which is derivative and, because we have derivative technology, there is felt to be no need to develop our own. If one goes to the companies which determine so much of the commanding heights of the Australian economy-the food processing, computers, drugs, chemicals, plastics and petrol industries and so many other areas-and says: 'What about doing research and development?' They will say: 'Why? It is all done at head office. Why do we need to do it in Australia? What is the point of doing it? It is all done overseas'. As I said last week, why does General-Motors' need to do basic research and development in Australia on the Commodore? It is a German car. It was developed there. It would be completely superfluous to go through the exercise here. That is a reason which the Minister did not touch on. </PARA>
<PARA> We are following step by step with the Natsemi project in Canberra the same fatal path as we followed in the case of General Motors' and IBM. We are saying: 'If you come over and do it for us, we will buy your product'. I am glad to see the honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly) present. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;She agrees with me 100 per cent on the question of derivative technology. The Natsemi project is another example of that. We are following the same pattern. The Minister suggested, although he did not exactly say it, that there is a certain lack of entrepreneurial spirit in Australia. The Government has done very little to encourage innovative small companies. That is a very important task for the Minister in the next 18 months, or however long the Government lasts. In the United States of the 'Fortune 1,000' companies-that is to say, the 1,000 companies with the largest turnover-about 500 did not exist in 1950. In the United States, as new technologies have developed, new firms have 'hived off' from already existing corporations or universities and often they have further subdivided into a new generation of firms. Most innovation and employment generation has come from small, new firms. Some of the new high technology firms, such as Intel, Genentech and Cetus, are examples of this. In Australia we have a completely different tradition. We tend not to develop our own technology, preferring to buy it off the shelf, and when new technological firms are developed they tend to be owned or taken over by already existing companies. This is the exact reverse of the American hiving off process. Professor R. W. Connell has calculated that of Australia's top 50 companies only four have been established since 1936. None of these four is Australian owned. All are based on corporate structures which had an Australian presence long before 1936. We have in Australia a corporate profile of an ageing country. It is not the corporate profile of a young country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister touched on the question of job creation. I ought to say a few words about that as well. The Minister said that his Department had conducted a survey of estimated benefits which companies expect to receive this decade from project grants under the Government's Industrial Research and Development Incentives Scheme. Unfortunately, that paper is not incorporated in the science report. I hope that the Minister will make it available to the House. The companies estimate that new sales generated will total $8,600m in domestic sales and a similar amount in export sales and create an estimated 29,000 jobs. Like the great mineral boom, we wish them all the best of British luck. But we would like to see some evidence of where those jobs actually will be created. With an approximate average increase of 120,000 jobs per annum for this decade-a total of 1.2 million jobs-29,000 new jobs will be the equivalent of 2.4 per cent of the total. Even if the estimate is correct, this leaves a shortfall of 97.6 per cent in the potential new job market, bearing in mind that many of the former job areas will be subject to sharp contraction due to technological change. So we need much more information about that. </PARA>
<PARA> The most disappointing part of the statement-it ended not with a bang but a whimper-concerns who makes decisions on science and technology. Instead of saying that matters would be referred to the Parliament for its consideration and decision, the Minister says: 'It's all right. All this will be dealt with by a sub-committee of the Australian Science and Technology Council'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The report I have just tabled deals with item 15 in the 73rd series of variations of the plan of lay out of the City of Canberra and its environs. The Committee presented its report on the other 16 items contained in the 73rd series on 5 May 1981. At a meeting to consider the 73rd series the Committee decided to defer consideration of this item until further information on the proposal had been obtained from the Department of the Capital Territory. Variation 15 is in the Jerrabombera-Tuggeranong district and is part of the Hume industrial estate. It concerns the construction of a road which would service industrial sites. The industry which would initially use this road is Koppers Australia Pty Ltd, a timber processing plant. The proposed road reservation is in the southern portion of the estate designated by the National Capital Development Commission as an area identified for large-scale industrial use.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The main concern of this Committee and the reason further investigation of this proposal was undertaken was due to the lack of legislation controlling air, noise and water pollution in the Territory. The Committee wishes to place on record its disappointment concerning the slow progress of proposed pollution legislation which has been under consideration for some years. Assurances have now been given by the Department of the Capital Territory that such legislation will be introduced by the end of 1981 and the Committee welcomes this development. In its examination of the proposal the Committee is not satisfied with the practice of burning waste timber in the open which is presently taking place in the area. This is discussed in greater detail in the report. The Committee approves variation 15 but recommends that the period of grace for existing operators to conform with the proposed pollution legislation in the Australian Capital Territory be reduced to three years from when the new ordinance takes effect. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to advise the House that at the meeting of the Joint Committee this morning Senator Margaret Reid was nominated as Chairman of the Committee to replace the late Senator John Knight.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Fraser Government's provocative and improper appropriation of funds due to the States is a national scandal. It is the cause of notorious comment throughout the media. It has established widespread public disgust at the squalid way in which the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) went about this exercise. All that it has achieved is a split in the Government ranks and a welding into a common front of the State Premiers-regardless of political philosophy-determined to repudiate this tawdry behaviour by both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer (Mr Howard). It is in this respect that the Prime Minister is not only answerable but also responsible to this Parliament. One would never presume this to be a fact. It is almost impossible to capture the Prime Minister in this Parliament so that he will participate in a debate in which he should properly present the Government's defence of its actions which have led to widespread discontent and condemnation. This is such a case. I guess the greatest difficulty the Prime Minister has with a debate like this is, being unwarned several days beforehand, he has no opportunity to recycle the old speech which we heard on the occasion of the resignation of the former Minister for Industrial Relations, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), and last week on the occasion of the censure motion moved by the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact is that we have a Prime Minister in control of the affairs of this country who, after some 30 years in this Parliament, is terrified at the prospect that he might have to participate, off the cuff, in a debate in defence of his Government and his actions. I have to confess that I too would be terrified. I think the task is beyond human credulity or ability. Why will the Prime Minister not come into this Parliament and defend the Government, its actions and his own intolerable behaviour? I repeat, we have a Prime Minister, a parliamentarian, who is absolutely terrified of the proper processes of parliament. So we have this situation where Question Time is an empty farce with the Prime Minister droning on endlessly and irrelevantly to questions which are put-the knight behind the doleful countenance. The forms of the House have to be exploited by the Opposition in a desperate effort to draw the Prime Minister into debate in this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I give honourable members this fact so that it is understood on the record: The only way in which we can feel some certainty, but not total certainty, the only way in which we can draw the Prime Minister into a debate in this Parliament to defend properly his Government, its actions and his behaviour, is to move a censure motion. However, it seems to me that to move censure motions week after week is a very inappropriate procedure and an improper standard to establish. Yet what alternative is left to the Opposition? It debases the coinage. But it is the only measure which is available to us if we are to have the Prime Minister speak to us. He does not speak to his own members much so I suppose we should not cavil too much. But he should speak to the people of Australia and outline a defence of what his Government is about and how it got the country into this shambles. It is one of the strongest and wealthiest economies inherently in the world. There is no excuse for the problems that we have had in the past several years under the Fraser Administration. The fact is that administration of Government is in a state of suspense as a result of the internal brawling of this Government. There should be an explanation. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask honourable members to consider these facts: Six months after the third election success of the Fraser Government, at a point, therefore, when it should be bathing in the full flush of success, we find it in total disarray. Five and a half years after the initial election of the Fraser Government, at a stage when there should be no doubt as to the direction or the nature of policy, with no requirement for refinement that would arise with a new government because of the novelty and difficulties of certain policies, we find that there are no policies and no programs and there is no direction for this country. Instead we have a government that is reeling about and tripping over itself like a drunken man on a mindless binge. It is directionless, it is careening about in a storm of distress that is created by its own incompetence. Regrettably the nation is afficted by a crisis prone Prime Minister. Look at some of those crises such as the Peacock affair and all of the unseemly, dirty washing hung out for the view of the community. Another crisis involves the freedom of information legislation. The Government senators believed the Prime Minister when he said that he wanted freedom of information and now he cannot understand why they are trying to establish that. Another one is the broadcasting and television legislation amendments, the Murdoch amendments-the deal for a mate, as it were. It is a total corruption of the proper processes and standards that one would expect in national government. </PARA>
<PARA> It is bad enough under the backwards standards that apply in the Parliament of Queensland and under the Premier of Queensland. It is intolerable that there should be such a diminution of standards at the national level. The uncertainty and conflict about civil aviation policies, the confusion about health policies and, of course last but not least, the conflict over the States all boils down to this: The affairs of this country, a strong and secure country which is entitled to confidence, are being run by a man who is inherently insecure. Day by day he is trying to prove to himself that he is tough and he tries to do that at the expense of his colleagues and at the expense of the unity and harmony of this country. Some time ago he said that it was his purpose in government to establish co-operativeness with the States. I shall quote him exactly from his 1975 policy speech, in which he said:</PARA>
<PARA> We will provide a sound basis of financial independence and responsibility for the States and Local Governments with the most significant reform of the federal system since Federation. </PARA>
<PARA> Our policy has been hailed around Australia by State and Local Governments. </PARA>

<PARA> So, if these developmental proposals are to work it will require the kind of co-operation that comes from people of our political philosophy; the sort of co-operation that one finds from Sir Charles Court or Mr Hamer . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Should I say: 'Enough said'? Sir Charles Court, Mr Hamer, and every Premier in Australia now know that Fraser federalism is nothing more than a knee capping exercise designed to cripple the States. Let us hear what Sir Charles Court said about his colleague and friend, his party associate. He said that the Prime Minister's word is valueless and that the Prime Minister is dishonourable. He said that the Prime Minister disregards the States and that he has converted States into departments of the Federal Government. He goes on in an ancillary fashion to say that the hospital arrangements he is proposing are nothing more than a tax trap for the States whereby, in fact, they will end up far, far worse off. Of course by re-arranging the basis for funding the States from income tax revenue to the total of revenue, he aims at disadvantaging the States because the fact is that with the elimination of tax indexation in any form at all the public will be paying $1,000m more in tax than they would if the Government had honoured its promise to preserve or to establish full tax indexation. I ask honourable members not to take this from the Australian Labor Party because it may be a little prejudiced. Let us get an open mind on this at least. Let us go to the South Australian Premier, Mr Tonkin. He said: 'I have never seen anything so inept in all my life in politics'. He should be in the Labor Party. We have been saying that for years. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Obviously the Commonwealth regards the States as members of a kindergarten. The Commonwealth was dishonest with us and did not give us our fair share. I cannot tolerate dishonesty. Our relations have been damaged irreparably. The whole thing stinks. In two words Mr Bjelke-Petersen said: 'It is a crooked deal'. </PARA>
<PARA>Sir Charles Court's searing condemnations were contained in a letter which he sent to Liberal members of parliament and which has been telexed to the newspapers of this country. I repeat that it is a condemnation from a friend who knows the Prime Minister better than any of us. He said that the Prime Minister is dishonest and dishonourable. He cannot be trusted. His word cannot be relied on. There can be no confidence in an association or in a working relationship with a man like that. That is the standing of the Prime Minister with Sir Charles Court. The $70m that the States have been deceitfully deprived of is important in a symbolic sense because it shows the sorts of qualities the Prime Minister applies in government and in his negotiation with responsible public figures regardless of how close they may stand to him in political texture. It is important also because it shows the qualities of a cheat and a sneak. Those are squalid qualities. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not a game of fiscal bingo in which the Government is running a country, conducting the affairs of the nation and administering the national economy. It is a matter of responsible fiscal administration. The Government, in its negotiations with the States, establishes the level of expenditure which is proper for the States to receive. It allocates funds to the States on that basis. Those funds are not the Government's funds; they are the public's funds. They go back to the States to benefit the people living in the States. I repeat-I say this on the basis of experience as a former treasurer-that the assessments are made quite austerely and the States are not funded too abundantly. We are all in the same boat. We cannot have abundant funding because of limited resources. But it is nonsense to talk about parameters and the option for movement within those parameters and then, like a cheap braggart, give the story to the Press and expect that there will be no reaction. I guess that it is the quality of a braggart which more than anything else has offended the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> The amount of $70m is small beer to the States in terms of the overall disabilities that they will suffer. One must admit that the State Premiers have been particularly green in buying this fiscal version of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. But it is also symptomatic of the way in which the affairs of the Fraser Government are conducted. We have the Fraser Government leaking to the Press but not prepared to talk to the Parliament. Let me tell honourable members about the real nature of the disabilities. The total allocation of funds available to the States in real terms has been hacked back quite dramatically as against the preceding year. That will mean more unemployment at one level or another; it will mean more government charges. At the State level, they are inequitable charges and they will be inflationary. It will mean a reduction in the standard of services and the range of services available at the State level. In 1980-81, the actual allocation to the States is $6,541m. The amount that should have been allocated to them if allowances were made for inflationary movements and movements in population and wages was $6,821m-a $280m shortfall, to which must be added a shortfall of $267m in the health allocations. The States will have to make up the shortfall in one way or another. The total amount is nearly $550m. Let us project that figure in terms of employment-the total number of jobs at risk involved with that sort of shortfall. Directly, nearly 46,000 government employees could lose their jobs. But the multiplier effects will reach out into the community and into the private sector. When these government employees lose their jobs, they will not spend money. There will be contractions elsewhere and there will be a multiplier figure of three, not the ignoble multiplier of 10, 12 or whatever figure strikes the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner) when he is in the House. That will take the number of jobs in jeopardy to nearly 137,000. They will not all be lost in the public sector because governments will raise charges, but reducing spending outside government to pay for these things will reduce the number of jobs outside government. The State governments will not increase the employment of people at the rate they should to maintain standards. The consequence will be a diminution in standards. </PARA>
<PARA> Commonwealth-State relations are in a shambles. They are overridden by an atmosphere of total distrust. The Government is about to go into the June Loan Council meeting with this atmosphere prevailing. It will be a Loan Council meeting at which an impasse will arise. I want to move in a positive sense to suspend Standing Orders. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition moving-</PARA>
<PARA> That this House, in the light of the Prime Minister's admission that the States have been deprived of $70m to which they are entitled and the clear evidence, therefore, that the Fraser Government is appropriating funds to its own use which properly belong to the States, directs the Government to reconvene the Premiers' Conference immediately for the purpose of:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Making the additional $70m available to the States; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) taking such other steps as will restore the confidence of the States in the integrity of Commonwealth-State relations. </PARA>
<PARA>The problem is that the events of the past fortnight have confirmed and emphasised the flaws which we always knew existed in the Fraser Government. It is a government which lacks personal honour and integrity, a fact which the Premiers and the citizens of the States have discovered to their cost. It is a government that is paralysed by the open divisions and bitter rivalries that fester within it. This Government which, at the last three elections, has promised us reliable and responsible administration, instead has reduced the nation to chaos and confusion. This Government, which is prepared to do nothing but favours for its few friends, is incapable of bringing harmony and unity to the nation. If we ever needed proof of these fundamental truths about this Government, we had it pushed in our faces by the extraordinary events of the past two weeks. By its disgraceful and deceitful behaviour, the Government has forfeited the trust of this Parliament and the respect of the Australian people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I second the motion. No more important a meeting than a reconvened Premiers Conference could take place at this time. For the reasons outlined today by my leader, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden)-I believe they would be supported by the whole nation-it is important that the Premiers reassemble in Canberra next week to tell the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Treasurer (Mr Howard) clearly the real needs of their States. At Question Time this morning, the Prime Minister said, in effect: 'The Premiers decided to meet in secret without me'. Apparently, because of that, they are to be penalised. One could readily understand why the leaders of all the States would want to meet to have a uniform case to put forward to the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. It did not matter to the Prime Minister that he did not tell the Premiers that he had already met in secret with Cabinet and had decided not to give the Premiers as much as they were entitled to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In fact, he withheld from them some $70m. There is an urgency about this situation. To rub salt into the wound, the Treasurer and the Prime Minister clearly indicated to the Press by leaking information that the Premiers could have got more if they had asked for it. The Prime Minister has belittled the Premiers of every State. There is a complete fragmentation and a complete confrontation between the Federal Government and the Premiers of all States. Let us place on record that this is the same Prime Minister who said: 'A federal system offers protection against those elements which Liberals abhor'. The real problem we have now is that every Liberal Party leader in this country is against the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. Why would there not be some consternation? Let us have a look at the urgency of the situation. </PARA>
<PARA> You would understand, Mr Deputy Speaker, that under the new health arrangements it appears that Queensland is to get less money than, for example, is going to Western Australia. Queensland is to get a mere $142m and Western Australia $146m. Obviously, Western Australia is entitled to $146m, but why has the amount given to Queensland been reduced to a lesser figure than that allocated to Western Australia, bearing in mind that Western Australia has 8.7 per cent of the total national population and Queensland's has 15.2 per cent of the total national population? There are very good reasons why the Premiers Conference should be reconvened. Nobody has heard an explanation of why there was a diminution of $280m in funds provided. The scheme announced by the Federal Government, which was approved and accepted by the Premiers in February 1976, was that they were to get 39.87 per cent of personal income tax collections. The offer on this occasion meant really that they got something like 38 per cent. Was there any understanding that the Commonwealth would cut its share of the funds? Not at all. These are matters coming from the Premiers. They want to reassemble here next week because they have made very clear that they have rejected the offer made by the Commonwealth. It is for that reason and the reasons that we went into in detail last week that this conference should be reconvened. A reconvened meeting would consider not just the additional $70m. It would be reconvened also on the basis of honouring the arrangements that were made. The Premiers can put forward a very good case because if they had received 39.87 per cent of personal income tax they would have received a 13 per cent increase in funding not 9 per cent, which has been given to them. Of course, as we explained last week, it was suggested that they received 10 per cent. The only reason they got an additional one per cent was on the basis that there had been incorporated in the revenue grants money that had previously been allocated for specific purpose grants. Wherever one turns at the present time and whatever city one is in in Australia, one finds a whole nation in uproar because the Premiers-State leaders-have been deceived and cheated of moneys to which the Australian people are rightfully entitled. Let me place on record that every dollar that is received by way of tax is taken out of a constituent's pocket. Is the Government now saying that the States have to find more money for schools, hospitals and transport? If so, people will have to pay additional State taxes. That is a form of double taxation. It is for that reason that the people are prepared to decimate the Government at the polls. If the Government were to go to an election tomorrow, it would be lucky on the basis of what has happened to win even 20 seats. Every Premier would be working against it. </PARA>

Let me read to those people section 13 of the Act. This is the total answer to those who claim that there is an entitlement to additional money by the States. This is the total answer to those who claim that Standing Orders should be suspended. Section 13 of that Act reads--</PARA>

<PARA>So there can be no doubt that under the legislation that it is ultimately, after consultation, a matter for the Commonwealth Government to decide whether any amendment of the income tax sharing legislation is desired.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think what I have just said is singularly relevant to the terms of the motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition. The motion says that the States have been deprived of $70m to which they are entitled. How can they be entitled in circumstances where the Act of this Parliament which governs the actions of the Commonwealth Government says it is a matter for the Commonwealth Government, not the governments of the States, to present recommendations to the Parliament. So, on that count, the motion of the Leader of the Opposition is irrelevant. He is trying to establish a case for the suspension of Standing Orders which is also irrelevant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is little wonder, therefore, that it took eight minutes of the 15 minutes allocated to the proposer of a matter of public importance for the Leader of the Opposition even to reach the question of tax sharing with the States. It was not until the last three minutes of his remarks that he even got on to the specifics of the Premiers Conference of the last week. No charge is more insubstantial, no charge is more inaccurate and no charge is more irrelevant than that the money we are talking about belongs to other than the taxpayers of Australia. The proposition that in some way this money belongs either to the Commonwealth Government or to the State governments is a totally incorrect assumption. That money belongs to the Australian taxpayers. Under the clear terms of the legislation which governs tax sharing arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States it is a matter, after the processes of consultation, for the Commonwealth Government-and for the Commonwealth Government alone-to decide what arrangements should be made. This legislation talks about changes that the Commonwealth considers to be desirable as a result of those consultations. </PARA>
<PARA> Let there be no doubt that the Premiers Conference held last week was a Premiers Conference held as a result of the urgings of the States. Let there be no doubt that the States wanted further discussions and wanted a review of the tax sharing arrangements. Let there be no doubt that that consultation was held not only in consequence of the terms of the existing legislation and particularly in terms of the section which I have just read, but also in terms of the points of understanding which govern the financial arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States. It was as a result of matters raised by the States at the meeting of the Premiers Conference in 1980 and as a result of meetings that were held separately from the Commonwealth by the States between the Premiers Conference in June 1980 and the conference which took place last week and the formulation of a point of view by the States that was presented to the Commonwealth, that that meeting took place. </PARA>
<PARA> But, ultimately, as in all cases in which one party has to make a decision on how much money is to be provided and other parties have to make decisions on how that money is to be spent, there has to be a point at which a decision is made by the Government to provide the money and that, of course, is what has happened in this case. That decision was taken by the Commonwealth Government in the circumstances that have been described last week, during debate in this Parliament and in response to media inquiries over the past week. So it is incorrect to suggest that there is any substance in a proposition that there was a legal entitlement to a particular amount of money after 1 July. That is what is implied in the words of the Leader of the Opposition; that is what has been implied by some of the Premiers in their statements around Australia over the past week. We are told that in some way there was a legal entitlement to a sum of money after 1 July other than the sum of money which came out of the Premiers Conference last week. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Rarely have we heard so much drivel from a Treasurer as we just heard. The Treasurer (Mr Howard) talked about an Act of Parliament. Of course the Commonwealth has the final say. No one disputes that. But the issue is: What were the agreements made with the Premiers and what were the arrangements entered into under the new federalism proposals? The truth of the situation is that the States were guaranteed that there would be no real reduction for the current financial year. An agreement was made in terms of the promises that were made on federalism back in 1976. The whole basis for this move is to try to get the States to levy a second income tax; it is as simple as that. The Commonwealth is trying to offload these responsibilities on to the States. The contention of the Australian Labor Party in all the years since federalism has been talked about on the other side of the House is that it is simply a way of offloading responsibilities. The Fraser Government is turning the clock back to a confederation-not a federation-of individual States where the Commonwealth looks after currency, defence and a few other charges and nothing else. That is where the Fraser Government is heading.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> After the Treasurer had given certain promises to the States he indicated to journalists that another $70m could have been made available to the States under these arrangements. For him to hold up an Act of Parliament with some clause on the back of it about how the Commonwealth introduces legislation is just bunkum and the Treasurer knows it. The States are now very much worse off simply because of the fact that this money is for recurrent expenses. As the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) pointed out the other day, the government deflator is 13.3 per cent for this year, not 9 per cent. It is not a matter of goods; it is a matter of employees. These people were awarded a 14 per cent pay increase in 1980. This is why the government deflator is 4 percentage points higher than the ordinary deflator for goods. So the States are not down 0.5 per cent-that is, the difference between 9.5 per cent and 9 per cent. They are down from 13.3 per cent to 9 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> If we also include the 1.2 per cent increase in the population of the States over that period and look at the grant on a per head basis we find that the States are down 5.5 per cent; the real cut is 5.5 per cent. One per cent is equivalent to $70m and 5.5 per cent is equivalent to $385m. That is a massive amount of money. For the States to contract this money-this has nothing to do with capital; it is only recurrent expenditure-really means that they will have to contract on employment because the money goes to employees. The money is for recurrent expenditure. It goes to wages and salaries. How would one go about retracting $385m worth of employment? Imagine the slashing of State services which will apply as a result of the measures introduced at the Premiers Conference. The Treasurer talks about there being consultation. Every Premier rejected out of hand the arrangements with the Commonwealth. There was no consultation. The Treasurer told the Premiers that that was all the Commonwealth could pay and all the Commonwealth was prepared to give. The Treasurer told a lie because Cabinet had given him authority to go to at least another $70m. That is a long way short of the $385m which the Treasurer should have gone. At least the Treasurer should have gone to the $70m. The Treasurer told the Premiers that that was as far as the Commonwealth would negotiate. The Treasurer has not got a leg to stand on. </PARA>
<PARA> We saw the Treasurer's little boy act on television last week. He put on a Uriah Heep act, saying: 'Oh, yes, we know we made a mistake. Yes, in hindsight we erred'. The Treasurer erred all right. He did a Uriah Heep act. He was contrite and going on with his little boy act while Charlie Court was kicking him all around the country and Bjelke-Petersen was saying that the Treasurer was a fraud. The Premier of Queensland said: 'It is a crook deal'. When it comes to a crooked deal the Premier of Queensland would recognise one if he saw one. He knows that it was a crook deal and he knows damn well that the Treasurer cheated the States. The Treasurer has taken $385m from them. It is no wonder the Premier of New South Wales asks: 'Where are the tax cuts?' It is no wonder the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) risked all the questions last week about Sir Charles Court to answer the Premier of New South Wales on the question of tax cuts. Honourable members opposite are supposedly members of a party for small government but there has been no return to the public. All the Government is doing is slashing real government services. Another sleight of hand occurred in regard to specific purpose money for urban transport and soil conservation. It is included as well. I support the motion and ask the House to support it. </PARA>

I wish to put a case fairly, honestly and accurately. In 1975 a certain gentleman whom I regarded as a pretty good economist became the Treasurer and he had immediately to turn around and totally reverse the economic policy of the government of that day. That gentleman had to try to cut back the deficit of $3,500m.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition does not oppose the Beef Industry (Incentive Payments) Amendment Bill. At the outset, I would like to say that the Bill does reflect on the opportunism of the Government at an earlier time, namely in 1977, when the beef industry had been in a state of crisis for some three or four years and the Government decided to have yet another early election. Sir John Kerr was very happy to oblige in that regard and so a cooked-up scheme was introduced. This scheme was investigated by the Parliamentary Joint Committee of Public Accounts after the Auditor-General had pointed to certain deficiences in it. I congratulate the government of that day. At least it made some response to the industry at that time. That is very unlike the situation which exists today. The situation today is that the Government is rapidly abdicating its responsibility for Australia's great rural industries. It is doing that at a very rapid rate of knots. What we have now is a sort of razor gang approach to every area of policy in this country, even agricultural policy. What we are getting is ideology, not an analysis of the industry issues and problems. What we are getting is a foisting of functions on to the States and not an examination of the functions of the industries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us go back to 1975-76-1974 even-when the beef industry first started to get into trouble. That was in the day of the Labor Government. Some $19.6m in carry-on finance provided jointly by the Commonwealth and the States was allocated for assistance to the beef industry. In 1975 the Labor Government allocated some $28m to the Commonwealth Development Bank of Australia to assist the beef industry. The Labor Government of the day also made a reference to the Industries Assistance Commission for short term assistance to be provided to the beef industry. That assistance was provided in the Budget which was rejected by the Liberal Opposition at the time, with a little assistance from the Senate and Sir John Kerr. There was a response in that Budget to the beef industry. The Australian Labor Party, when in government, was developing a policy response. It was assisting the beef industry because it was in dire trouble at that time. In the first Budget which the present Government brought down-incidentally, the then Opposition accepted our Budget figure of $19.6m that was allocated jointly by the Commonwealth and the States to assist the beef industry-some $11.3m was taken up. By that time the Industries Assistance Commission's short term report had been brought in. By and large the report advocated that a continuation of short term assistance by way of loans be extended to the beef industry. The then Government said that it would allocate another $15m in 1976-77. That was a sort of response to the IAC short term report which was printed on 23 October 1975. If one looks at the Budget documents at that time one will see that by 1977-78 all we had was some reference to the fact that assistance to the specialist beef producers was now merged with the rural adjustment schemes. As I said, it was about this time that the Government felt another early election coming on; so it cooked up this scheme. Having hammered the ALP right through 1975 and after, doing nothing through 1977 and 1978 but only carrying on in a half hearted manner with the schemes that the Labor Government had set in train-there was no improvement-it decided it had to do something very quickly. </PARA>
<PARA> The Beef Industry Incentive Payments Scheme was to provide assistance to beef producers between the period from 23 September 1977 to 22 September 1978. By and large the Bill which we have before us now is to tidy up that scheme. We are talking about a scheme which originated three or four years ago. We are still trying to tidy it up. The scheme set out an eligibility rate of $10 per head of cattle for producers with a minimum of 50 cows up to a maximum of 200 cows. Supposedly one had to engage in some sort of treatment of the animal to get the $10. Basically, all one had to do was slap a cow on the bum to get the $10, but at least it was a response. The scheme was attempting to find a way of putting some money into the hands of beef producers. Part of the problem, in terms of interpreting the way in which the Department of Primary Industry had to process the claims, was because the legislation was regarded as beneficial legislation, in other words, welfare legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the time scales and the problems the Department faced at that time-here I refer to the report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts of which I was a member-we find the following statement in the report of the Public Accounts Committee:</PARA>
<PARA> Throughout this inquiry, the Committee--</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the Public Accounts Committee-</PARA>
<PARA>recognised the short time scale given to the Department to implement the Scheme. The Committee concurred with the Department's attributing much of the blame for the subsequent difficulties to the urgency of introducing the Scheme. The Committee was advised of the chronology of events leading to the initial payments made under the Act. This timetable appears at Appendix 4A. Seven weeks elapsed from 44 the initial Cabinet Decision that there should be a scheme until enabling legislation was assented to, and a further three weeks until the first payments were made. The Committee agrees with the Department that the Scheme was conceived in undue haste and led to administrative difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government should not place the blame on the Department. If we look at page 66 of the report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, Parliamentary Paper No. 277/1979, we see the rapid haste with which the Government introduced this half-baked scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> At the time the Government came down with a great song and dance about this proposal. Forms were circulated throughout the country; a lot of money was spent on publicity; and away the scheme went. Even though the Government carried on in a half-hearted way, at least it was a response to the industry's problems at that time. The Australian Labor Party measures of assistance to the beef industry were at least a response to the industry. Today we do not have any such responses by the Government to the problems of the beef industry. Today the problems of the beef industry do not concern price but drought, stocking levels, abattoirs, and the processing industry. The beef herd is down to about 25.5 million head and the eastern States are experiencing a great drought. </PARA>
<PARA> What has the Government done for the beef industry in recent years? After removing export inspection charges it brought them back in 1978-79. It has all but abdicated national responsibility for drought relief. Let us set out what this Government has done. This Liberal-National Country Party Government has refused again to accept its proper share of drought costs. Until 1978, the New South Wales Government, if we are just to take an example, agreed to pay the first $5m for drought relief and the Commonwealth undertook to pick up the rest of the tab. In June 1978, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Resources (Mr Anthony), in his capacity as Acting Prime Minister, took a decision to change the formula. It was typical of the sleight of hand which characterises this Government in all of its dealings so notoriously exemplified at the Premiers Conference the other day. Without any consultation, the Deputy Prime Minister changed the formula so that that State would have to pay the first $10m and $1 for every $4 thereafter each financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> With the drought continuing with all its severity into its third winter, the consequences of this sort of scheme promise to be ruinous for the farmers in New South Wales and the finances of New South Wales and other States affected by the drought. We should have none of this nonsense about the so-called National Country Party protecting the rural community from the worst ravages of Fraserism and the new federalism. They are up to their neck in it. The New South Wales Government has developed the most comprehensive package of drought relief measures in the history of New South Wales. Despite severe financial restraints-I draw attention to the action of the New South Wales Government because it has copped a caning in this House-the New South Wales Government increased the limit for carry on loans from $5,000 to $10,000 in April 1980, from $10,000 to $15,000 in September, and from $15,000 to $20,000 in October 1980. The maximum loan for farmers entering their second year of drought is $40,000. The limit for restocking loans was raised from $12,000 to $30,000 in December 1980 by the New South Wales Government. In October 1980, the New South Wales Government increased the rail freight subsidies from 50 per cent to 60 per cent. From 1 May 1980, the rebate applicable for owner-carriers under the drought water cartage subsidy scheme was substantially increased. At present in New South Wales road transport subsidies are available in respect of movements of stock to agistment, stock to further agistment, stock returning from agistment, restocking and fodder movements. Stockowners in drought declared areas are being paid $15 a head compensation. I could go on. The New South Wales drought scheme is most favourable when compared with others. In my view the abuse that has been heaped on the New South Wales Government with respect to drought measures has been rather misdirected. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the drought problems being experienced by the beef industry, we have big problems in the processing industries. Hundreds, if not thousands, of abattoir workers are out of work. Abattoirs are being shut down throughout the country. The New South Wales Government, for example, has had to make available assistance worth $5.1m which will apply from 1 January this year. It has paid out $8.25m since 1975 and all of that mainly since 1 January 1981. The figures to which I am referring are for local government abattoirs. The indebtedness of abattoirs in New South Wales is at present at least $50m. The private abattoirs are in a like situation. The end of the drought will make this situation worse for the abattoir industry because there simply will be no beasts for a considerable period. At the same time the abattoirs are paying something in the order of $16m for the meat processing export inspection levy of $1.80 alone. I realise that this Government will not entertain any reallocation of the $5.82 being paid by the industry which cannot be inbuilt into prices or costs. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the Government needs to give some attention to problems being faced by State governments with respect to the abattoirs that have had to shut down or are being financed. It should give some consideration also to the beef industry by way of taking on some of these costs. The industry cannot pay these costs. If the drought ends, the situation will get even worse. I point out to the House that the Federal and State governments guaranteed a $9m loan to the Consolidated Farmers and Graziers abattoir in Victoria but they are not prepared to do anything about the industry as a whole. If I were less charitable I would ask: Whose mate is involved down there in Victoria? It seems to me that the Government is prepared to respond sometimes but only for individuals, whereas it is not prepared to do anything at present for the industry as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> This is in keeping with the general direction the Federal Government has taken with respect to assistance to the rural sector and its policies to the rural sector. It is trying to get out of program or commodity assistance. This Federal Government-there is a lot of evidence for what I am about to say-seems to be trying to transform rural policy into guarantees for statutory authorities and it is hopeful of achieving a system whereby taxation deductions satisfy for everything else. If one looks at the razor gang report and some of the actions of the Government over the past year or two, one sees that it has consistently been trying to get out of quarantine, forestry, soil conservation and meat inspection. From the report of the Kelly Committee of Inquiry to Examine Commonwealth and State Meat Inspection Systems-I know that this report is still under consideration by the Government and State Ministers-it appears to me that the Government is indifferent as to whether the Commonwealth should continue with meat inspections. The Government is trying to get out of rural research and extension. It is trying to get out of reconstruction. It is even trying to get out of dealing with the locust problem. Somehow it believes that if it sacks the 18 people on the Australian Plague Locust Commission, locusts, grasshoppers and whatever one wishes to call them, will no longer cross State borders. One does not need to go on. </PARA>
<PARA> In the rural area the Government is very consistently trying to get out of program or commodity assistance. It is trying to foist functions on to the States. It is backing up the statutory marketing authorities. It is trying to solve a few other problems by taxation deduction measures. I do not think the Government is concerned about the needs of Australia's primary industries any more. The National Country Party has become a miners' party. I am not talking about miners at the mine face but about owners of the mines in the boardrooms in New York, London and Tokyo. The rest of the time the National Country Party seems to spend fighting with the Liberal Party for some of the provincial parliamentary seats. It is no longer a national party. It is no longer a country party. It has said nothing about the 5.2 per cent revaluation in the last year or so. It is saying nothing about what the impact of the so called resources boom will be on the rural sector in terms of access to finance or the infrastructure costs that will be imposed on the States. Nothing has been said about the fact that a lot of money that used to go to local government in the country areas will not now go to it due to the mining boom. The National Country Party is saying nothing about these things. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill sets out simply to remove an anomaly which affected the amounts that could be paid in partnership payments. The Opposition offers no objections to it. However, we take the opportunity validly to criticise the Government because it is not doing anything much for the beef industry. The scheme is really a device to give beef farmers money and nothing more. As I have said, the application forms were given to every post office, bank and pastoral agency prior to the 1977 election. The scheme had a large advertising budget. Of course, much of the motivation to introduce it was to save the seat of Capricornia, but subsequently it was lost. Due to the haste with which the scheme was concocted, administrative bungles quickly appeared. The Auditor-General's report of 1978-79 pointed to overpayments which subsequently totalled $432,000. The scheme overall cost $118m. The present amendment is designed to legitimise $700,000 worth of what could be regarded technically as overpayments. The scheme was designed in haste as an electoral bribe and, as a result, hundreds of thousands of dollars of taxpayers' money was overpaid. We do not know how many people had their hands in the till or how many fiddles were perpetrated. </PARA>
<PARA> Most importantly, the scheme was pretty useless in terms of helping the beef industry. After all, $2,000-that was the maximum-is about the price of eight or nine head of beef in a good year. It is well below the poverty line in terms of supplementing the incomes of producers. It was a scheme cooked up in haste. I appreciate the need for the Government to correct some of the existing remaining anomalies in it, but I hope that it will not entertain taking on such a scheme again simply for electoral purposes, designing it in so much haste and requiring the Department of Primary Industry to institute administrative procedures with no time to think them through, to look at the structure of the industry or to work out all the problems that could be faced. It was a most unfair task to give to the Department. At least, as I said, it was a response to an industry's problem at that time. The Government today does not seem to be willing to respond to any element of Australia's great rural industries. It is not prepared to respond in a proper way to the drought in the eastern States at present, particularly in New South Wales. It is not prepared to respond in any way to calls by the Australian Meat Council, the abattoirs and the processors of meat. It is not prepared to look at the real issues. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the Beef Industry (Incentive Payments) Amendment Bill 1981 which is to validate the existing procedures under which the Department of Primary Industry makes payments to beef producers under the Beef Industry (Incentive Payments) Act of 1977. The Beef Industry Incentive Scheme was introduced by this Government in 1977 to assist the beef industry which at that time faced serious difficulties. It indicated the interest of the Liberal and National Country parties in the beef industry, which is one of our great primary industries. Cattle producers were assisted with a payment of $10 per head for cattle receiving approved husbandry treatments during the 12 months from September 1977. Payments under this scheme were limited to 200 head of cattle with a maximum payment of $2,000.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The scheme was aimed at providing a cash flow for cattle producers. The Government provided $118m under the scheme. It was well received by producers and, as I have mentioned, it indicated the Government's concern for the industry, which is so important to Australia, both internally and in terms of exports. Beef exports have been amongst the three top agricultural exports of this country. Wool, wheat and beef are the backbone of Australia's primary industries and, indeed, our total exports. This Bill removes an anomaly in the 1977 Act which affected amounts which lawfully could be paid to certain claimants. Under the principal Act producers may be eligible for incentive payments in their own right or as members of groups of joint cattle owners nominated to receive and distribute the payments. It was made quite clear, however, that payment to one owner could not be made for more than 200 cattle or exceed $2,000. </PARA>
<PARA> The anomaly which the Bill sets out to correct concerns groups of producers who between them own more than one cattle herd. As the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) stated in his second reading speech, an example is the case of two producers who each have cattle of their own and who, as partners, also own a herd. As the 1977 Act stands, a payment of $2,000 to a partnership disqualifies the partners for any future payment in respect of their own individual herds. Conversely, when claims were first lodged and paid in respect of the individual herds, each of the owners could receive $2,000 or a total of $4,000 between them, but if this occurred the partnership would not qualify for any payment. </PARA>
<PARA> Other anomalies could occur, depending on the order in which claims were presented. Apparently it was the intention of the Act and the practice of the Department of Primary Industry to treat two or more claims by a person so as to maximise the payments to that person by ignoring the order in which claims were made. Clause 3 of the Bill validates the procedure of the Department of Primary Industry by making the necessary amendment, which is back dated to the commencement of the principal Act. Provision is also made under the amendment to increase past payments to the maximum payable where this has not already occurred. The amendment provides a safeguard to ensure that no legally made past payments become overpayments as a result of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> In the first instance the Department of Primary Industry assessed claims made by sole proprietors separately from claims submitted by partnerships. This resulted in overpayments and, as the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin) has said, these totalled $432,000 on 300 claims. It is very interesting to note that 83 per cent of those overpayments has since been recovered. There is no doubt that efforts will be made to recover the outstanding 17 per cent. The recovery of overpaid funds has been a successful achievement. Honourable members may recall that these matters were commented on by the Auditor-General in his 1978-79 report to the Parliament. There is no doubt that the urgency of the occasion demanded that the Government immediately bring down legislation to assist beef producers who were in dire straits because of drought throughout Australia. Many beef producers did not have sufficient funds to carry on their normal everyday life. This Government saw to it that cash payments were made to them. </PARA>
<PARA> Country abattoirs have been mentioned in the debate. There is no doubt that the abattoirs in the State which I represent are in serious trouble. From observations and experience in the beef industry I have no doubt that it is over-serviced. We have too many abattoirs in New South Wales. When we have a rundown in cattle numbers and sheep numbers, what is the result? These abattoirs are in financial trouble and they run immediately to government for assistance. It is known that a number of them are local government abattoirs. Of course, they are being supported financially by a State government, so they run to that government for financial support. If the abattoir situation in New South Wales had been properly planned by the New South Wales Government the abattoirs would not be experiencing the trouble that they are experiencing today. </PARA>
<PARA> It is good to see the Minister for Primary Industry at the table. Dual meat inspection has been a great problem in this industry for very many years. It is good to know that the Minister will make every effort to iron out this situation at the August meeting with the various State Ministers for Agriculture. Dual meat inspection is costing huge sums of money. It is affecting the prices paid by the housewives to the butcher shops. The honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown) would know all about that because he has considerable dealings with housewives concerning the supply of quality meat. If we get rid of the system of dual inspection of beef it will be of great benefit not only to the honourable member for Parramatta but also to the industry right throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Cattle numbers in this country are down; there is no doubt about that. Several years ago these numbers were to the order of 32 million. As has been stated tonight, they are down to approximately 26 million. Most of those cattle are in Queensland. New South Wales is experiencing the worst drought it has ever experienced. If we go into the winter without any water and with a shortage of feed we will witness a devastating scene. That will happen if we do not get substantial rain within the next few weeks. The meat industry is in dire straits in New South Wales. This is, of course, affecting employment in our country towns. A country abattoir of any size employs from 350 to 400 men, and if those men lose their jobs it is a disaster for the financial and economic situation of the town in which it is located. The works with which I am connected has been reasonably fortunate. It has been able to maintain its work force and to kill something like 1,500 head of cattle, 10,000 head of sheep and 1,000 head of pigs. It is not a profitable operation but it is fortunate that it is in a status quo situation. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Werriwa mentioned the investigation of the scheme by the Joint Parliamentary Committee of Public Accounts. He was a member of the Committee, and at the time so was I. The honourable member mentioned that there was undue haste in the bringing in of the 1977 legislation to assist the cattle producers. That legislation had to be brought in hastily because of the situation in which these people found themselves. It is not unusual under those circumstances to find some anomalies. The Bill with which we are dealing eliminates those anomalies and creates a splendid situation as far as the industry is concerned. It was said that the New South Wales Government is providing great assistance as far as drought relief is concerned. What a lot of rubbish! Here we have a situation where funds are available, as the Minister for Primary Industry has informed us, to the State Government for drought relief if it asks for them. Of course, the situation is that these funds are available after the State Government has spent $10m. The Minister knows only too well that we have taken this matter up with him from time to time and he has informed us that no efforts have been made by the State Government to apply for additional funds which are available to us. The State Government ought to be more appreciative of the drought situation in New South Wales and approach the Federal Minister for funds which, we understand, will be readily available. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the export of our beef, it was a great tragedy when we lost the European Economic Community market. A market for 80,000 tonnes of beef was lost just through the stroke of a pen. It appears that it will be very difficult for us to get back into that market, as the Community is dumping cattle on the market for $300 a carcass. That makes it terribly difficult for Australia's beef industry to enter the European Economic Community. So we have to find other markets for our beef. The Department of Primary Industry and the Department of Trade and Commerce are doing just that. The beef industry is one of the greatest primary industries in this country and we should be looking after it. I have no doubt that the Minister for Primary Industry is doing that. </PARA>
<PARA> I support this legislation in its entirety. I have no doubt that it will go through here today because members of the Opposition are not going to oppose it. They have had a few pertinent remarks to make about it. Just the same, the Opposition knows that it provides for a good scheme. It knows that anomalies will be eliminated from the 1977 legislation and that that will be good for the cattle industry and those associated with it. The legislation has my full support. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to support the Beef Industry (Incentive Payments) Amendment Bill, I will make just a few comments. Before I get on to the Bill, I will cover some of the points raised by the honourable member for Paterson (Mr O'Keefe), who covered a fairly wide range of subjects to do with agriculture. He mentioned the drought assistance provided in New South Wales and condemned the New South Wales Government for not doing enough for drought relief. He said that that the Federal Government stood ready to assist. Anybody who realises the situation would know that the States are requested to spend $X before the Federal Government makes any move at all. But, from the evidence presented to this House in the last few days and the actions of this Government in the way it treated the States, I do not think there would be anything stopping this Government, if it really were serious about assisting the primary producers in New South Wales, from making money available. From what we have seen, the Government is quite capable of pushing the States around in any way it likes. I do not think that there would be anything stopping the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) or the Government from making funds available.</PARA></TALK.START>

Yet supporters of the Government stand up in this House and say that the States have to ask for the money before it can be put across. The Government has the money and is refusing to give it to them. The States should not need to ask the Federal government for the money; it should just give it to them and they will spend it in the right places.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1977 this Government introduced a scheme to assist the beef industry. At that time the industry was in the middle of a world-wide slump-we all admit that-brought about by an excessive supply and a slump in demand. The slump was brought about by economic factors which had a lot of their roots in the dramatic increase in the price of crude oil. Many sectors of primary industry were affected by the downturn in the world economy at that time. Whilst all clear-thinking people are well aware of the necessity to assist those primary producers in need, the actions of the Fraser Government in 1977 when it introduced the Beef Industry (Incentive Payments) Bill were actions of that Government at its cynical best. At that time there were 85,900 beef producers with 50 or more head of beef cattle and 32,390-odd of them who owned 200 or more head. To put this whole debate into perspective we have to assess what was being provided by government at that time, why there was this need for this money to be available in this matter. Measures of Commonwealth assistance were available to the beef industry to alleviate the depression which had gripped the world trading economy at that time. These measures included appropriations of $20m to the Commonwealth Development Bank of Australia in 1974 by the then Labor Government. There was a further $8m in 1975 to be lent to viable beef cattle producers under the schemes keeping those farmers in business. The States Grants (Beef Industry) Act 1975 provided for the beef carry-on loans scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has been preaching of the need for less Government expenditure ever since it engineered its return to the Treasury benches. In this context it is interesting to relate how this Government used the Act, the amendment to which we are debating today, to assist many wealthy supporters of the Government. When we look at the numbers of farmers with 50 or more beef cattle-85,900 beef producers-we see that many of those farmers are very wealthy, with assets by the million and with no need whatever for a hand out of $2,000 from the public purse. With the assistance that the Commonwealth Bank had in train it could have quite easily done the job that this Bill sets out to do three years later. But instead the Government took the approach of handing out $2,000 willy-nilly, whether the people require it or not. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister says that I am not talking sense. On what basis, in any other schemes, does the Government hand money across the board to those who do not need it? It has a means test on pensioners. Where public public funds are accounted for in other departments, it is always done on the basis of need. Education grants are given on the basis of need. The Government does not just hand the money across the board to people who do not need it. The Minister preaches that the Government must cut its expenditure, yet it went ahead and spent something like $118m to $120m. That is money that could have been spent on much more worthwhile efforts in the last couple of years. We had a debate in the House last week on quarantine and surveillance of the coast of this country. We have no money to do that, yet the Minister wasted money on wealthy people. In relation to this Bill the Government is not concerned with cutting back expenditure when it comes to handing across money to its own supporters, but it is very savage on government expenditure when it deals with people who are really in need of funds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Auditor-General looked at this matter and found gross over-payments. What sort of a Bill was it? Would the Commonwealth Bank's approach have allowed that sort of thing to happen? I have dealt with that type of approach, and there is no way an organisation like the Commonwealth Bank would waste money the way this Government wastes it. The honourable member for Paterson said that the Government had got 83 per cent of the money back. What about the other 17 per cent? Are we ever going to see that again or has it gone down the gurgler, as they say? What a great way of running the country, is it not? Maybe some beef producers were very happy to get the $2,000 but I do not think I know of anybody who, if they were handed $2,000, would not say, 'Thank you very much' and take it. I am not arguing the point that those people were not appreciative that they got their money. They probably bought a slightly better car than they normally would have. Needless to say, an election for Capricornia was going on at the time. I would say that was probably the main reason for the haste to get the message across to the people at that time that money was available to those who supported the Country Party. </PARA>

It is not so anxious today to bring in legislation that will really help the Australian public. It puts away millions of dollars and sends it, as I said before, down the gurgler. We will never see any benefit whatever from it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not intend to speak for a long time in this debate but I refer to a few more of the points which were raised by the honourable member for Paterson. He referred to the fact that the abattoirs are in trouble. They are in trouble all over the country, not just in his State. Even though this Government spent some $118m over a short time in the beef industry, the numbers of beef cattle have continued to decline to the stage now where there is a massive over-supply of abattoirs and they are in trouble all over the country. It will be many years before there is a rebuilding of the herds to overcome that problem. I just say to the Minister that we hope we do not see this type of Bill introduced and this type of method used to support a section of the community where public funds are sent right across the board and are not accounted for. In this case a lot of the funds went to waste. This is the sort of thing that governments should not be dabbling in and it is the sort of thing we would not expect a responsible government to do, but apparently it has been done. We have the Bill before us now to rectify some of the anomalies in the Act and to make sure that there are no further overpayments. I stress that the Minister should make every effort he can to recover the money that is outstanding. It is public money and that should not be owing on a scheme such as this one. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had not intended to enter this debate but the rather provocative approach of the honourable member for McMillan (Mr Cunningham), has caused me to rise. When the original Bill came through this House about four years ago the Australian Labor Party supported it in toto. This afternoon we have a newly arrived honourable member trying to make his mark by standing up, going over ground, which is simply an amendment, trying to indicate that there are gross injustices and that there is foul play because the party of the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) is supposedly looking after its own lot. Furthermore, he refers to the chaos in the beef industry. One remembers that between 1972 and 1975, when the Whitlam Labor Government so upset those who purchased our beef, that we had a complete downturn in the market. The honourable member for McMillan should not drop his head back; he should drop it down in shame.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In my electorate of Fadden in southern Queensland there are lots of cattle producers. The honourable member for McMillan might have this airy-fairy idea that because a man has a cattle property, he is a very wealthy person. That is not the case. I have seen producers in my electorate going through bad times during drought periods, when there are downturns in the export market and when the honourable member for McMillan has been infinitely better off. Certainly the farmers have their good days, but they need those good days to ensure that that balance gives them a living and makes it attractive for them to turn to the land. I could not sit here and listen to the comments of the honourable member for McMillan without putting my point of view. As a member of the Liberal Party I am also hurt when the honourable member for McMillan keeps saying that all the beef producers support the National Party, because in my electorate I have their support 100 per cent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition does not oppose this very simple Bill. The purpose is to amend the Pig Slaughter Levy Act 1971 to raise the maximum permissible rate of levy for promotion purposes from 20c to $1 per pig. The amendment relates only to the maximum rate of levy, not to the operative rate of levy paid by producers. It is set by regulation. A levy has been paid by pig producers since 1975 to provide funds for the promotion of pig meat. The promotion is funded entirely by the industry and expenditure has been increasing because of the expanding activities at wholesale, retail and consumer levels and because of rising media costs. My colleague the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown) will speak about the success of these promotional activities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The request for an increase in the maximum rate of levy has been made by the national body of the pig industry, the Australian Commercial Pig Producers' Federation. The Federation sought this amendment as increases in the operative rate have taken the levy to 20c which is the maximum levy currently permitted under the Act. Without this amendment there is no scope to raise the levy further and expand promotional expenditure in the future. Any subsequent increase to the operative rate requires a recommendation from the Pig Meat Promotion Advisory Committee to the Minister for Primary Industry. The Committee consults with the industry before making its recommendation to the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition welcomes this Bill. We cannot possibly oppose it as the request for it comes from the industry. I want to say a few words about the pig industry. It is largely a self-help industry which does not want handouts. It rarely approaches government. It has been disappointed with the Government's response to the pig classification issue, the meat inspection issue and other things. By and large it is an industry that has been adjusting itself to the demands being put on it. It has a particular structure. It is largely an integrated industry. It is closely related to the processing part of the industry. As I said, it is a self-help industry and one that has been going along very well indeed. If we look at the problems the pig industry has been facing in recent times, we must refer to the importation of canned ham. The Industries Assistance Commission report on this matter was tabled on 6 May. The Government received the same report on 2 February 1981. The Opposition and I made the case that the Government had plenty of information on which to make up its mind on this issue. For the life of me, I do not understand why the Government put the pig industry through so much trauma by not making a decision on this matter. I, as did many other honourable members, received letters and complaints and well-documented cases from the Australian Commercial Pig Producers' Federation, the Queensland Pork Producers' State Council, the Federated Millers and Mill Employees' Association and the National Meat Canners' Association expressing great concern about the problems being faced by the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The amount of canned ham coming into this country is minimal but it is affecting the industry in more than a proportionate way. That well-known pig farmer, the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) announced that he was going to discuss restraint arrangements. I do not know what that means-I will not canvass what I think it might mean-but it would have the effect of limiting imports to around 14 per cent of the Australian market. That is a level of about 800 tonnes a year in respect of the canned ham market in Australia. Overall, the canned ham market represents only a small portion of the total processed pig market in Australia. But the Government does have a long term report on prepared meat products due to be presented to it late this year and again this question will arise. In the meantime, we have this restraint arrangement. The Deputy Prime Minister said, in his Press release of 1 May, that the Government had finally decided to make up its mind about this matter, after it had abundant evidence to make up its mind. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Although the Industries Assistance Commission recommended no short-term assistance, the Government considers that circumstances have changed since the IAC inquiry and that action should be taken to preserve market stability pending the Government's decision on the IAC's long-term report--</PARA>
<PARA>I wish the Deputy Prime Minister had told us exactly what the circumstances were that had changed. It is my view that the circumstances that have changed have been very much those whereby the processors, particularly the multinationals, Mayfair Hams and Bacon Co. and Plumrose (Aust.) Ltd, were virtually holding a gun at the Government's head because they were saying that they would get import licences and bring in supplies from overseas affiliates. For example, one of the companies which wrote to me stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Australian Bacon Ltd, an Adelaide based company, will be most adversely affected if the Government decision is to accept the IAC recommendation because the company is one of the largest pig suppliers to the two leading canners, Plumrose and Mayfair. These manufacturers have stated that they will import from overseas affiliates so as to remain competitive with duty free imports from Romania and Yugoslavia if no short-term assistance is provided to the industry. </PARA>
<PARA>The company made appropriate representations on the matter at State and Federal levels. Senator Flo Bjelke-Petersen, in her maiden question, in another place, referred to the wicked communist countries, Romania and Yugoslavia, from which we are importing canned ham. It was an issue that was causing the industry a lot of concern. The Government responded eventually, having before it all the facts. I wish to goodness the Government would tell us what the changed circumstances are and if there is a particular problem in this industry in relation to its integrated nature and whether the major processors are multinationals. If that were so a lot of the rationality of bodies such as the IAC would tend to fly out the door. </PARA>
<PARA> I have gathered a background to the industry. Something like 216,000 tonnes of pig meat is slaughtered in Australia each year. An amount of 10,000 tonnes of bone-in-meat is used to produce about 4,500 tonnes of canned boneless ham. The dimension of this issue is such that in 1979, 450 tonnes were imported. That is equivalent to about 1,000 tonnes of bone-in-meat, as I am sure you have calculated, Mr Deputy Speaker. About 800 tonnes was imported in 1980. Very little has been imported this year. The explanation for that could be that the retailers stockpiled lower priced ham during 1980. But imports this year could reach 1,000 tonnes. There has been about a four per cent increase in production in canned ham in 1979-80. There has been a 13 per cent increase in production in early 1980-81. Canned ham is only part of the canned meat industry which has expanded production in recent years. What I am trying to explain with these figures is that the canned ham part of the industry was the part that was expanding and was the one which, at the same time, was subjected to the threat of imports, if I may put it that way. </PARA>
<PARA> About 80 per cent of Australia's canned ham is produced in Victoria. The area from the northern New South Wales coast up to Toowoomba in Queensland also includes major producing centres. The pig producers, the local canners and the unions waged a very active campaign in opposition to the one importing firm, C. R. Lawrence Pty Ltd. They have also lobbied hard. I can understand why the Government was reticent to act in the face of all the lobbying that was going on. But if it had the facts before it all the time, if it had the IAC report and knew what the parameters of the issue were, there is no real reason for it not making a decision. I make no further comment except to say that the Opposition supports the Bill that is before the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It gives me great pleasure to support the Pig Slaughter Levy Amendment Bill 1981. This Bill has been introduced to help the pork industry increase the maximum amount it can levy up to a maximum of $1 per kilo. The scheme for promotion was established in 1975. At that time, the Pig Meat Promotion Advisory Committee was established. I wish to quote from the fifth annual report of that Committee. It consists of a representative from the Department of Primary Industry, two representatives from the Australian Commercial Pig Producers' Federation and a marketing specialist. That Committee has been very successful in its endeavours to promote the pork industry throughout Australia. Production of pig meat reached 216,000 tonnes in 1979-80. The gross value of pig slaughterings during that time is estimated at $310 million. So this industry which we are debating is no small industry. I believe that the Bill is most important because promotion is an important facet of any industry if it is to survive in our ever-competing world. The expenditure on pig meat promotion in that time was $452,000 which is an increase of $117,000 from the previous year. We can see from those figures that the industry is making a tremendous endeavour to sell all of its product.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it is important again to remind the House that the Commonwealth makes no contribution to the promotion fund. The industry has seen fit to stand on its own feet and establish such a fund. I believe that, as far as current Government thinking is concerned, that has been excellent for the industry because it has not had to suffer any cuts. In actual fact this Bill seeks to allow the industry to impose a promotion levy of up to $1. The Act established the Pig Meat Promotion Advisory Committee whose function is to recommend the rate of slaughter levy. I think it is important to remember that the $1 levy that this Bill seeks to allow is not necessarily spent or collected in full until the industry itself decides how much is needed for the industry to function properly as far as promotion is concerned. The initial levy was 5c in 1975. The levy was increased to 20c in 1978. This Bill now seeks to increase the levy to $1. </PARA>
<PARA> The request to increase the levy has come from the national body of the pig industry. I think it is important that the Government adopts most of the recommendations from the industry in respect of management and follows that practice. A recommendation to fix the levy comes from the Australian Commercial Pig Producers Federation. The Federation recommends to the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) the exact amount that it feels is needed adequately to promote its product. The information that I have from the industry is that it is seeking to increase the levy by 40c to 60c. This will allow another 40c to be spent in the future. I think that the proposal in the Bill to take the levy to $1 is good in that the legislation will not have to be amended in the foreseeable future. The proposed $1 levy ought to see the industry through for a number of years. The industry will recommend to the Minister that it be allowed to collect 60c of the upper limit of $1. </PARA>
<PARA> The pork industry has done a great deal of advertising, most of which has been through chain stores. The industry conducted a study last year in Adelaide which indicated that the sale of pork products in Adelaide stores jumped by 239 per cent. So I think that goes to show just what a good job money collected from the levy is doing for the industry. The overall increase in sales was 96 per cent. The Pig Meat Promotion Advisory Committee has concluded that the result was so good that it should seek the increase proposed in the Bill we are now considering. The Committee intends to conduct another nationwide television program this winter. Most of the capital cities as well as the Gold Coast and Toowoomba will be included in the program. It is hoped the television program will cover 47 per cent of households throughout Australia. If that can be achieved, the program again will have been excellent. The 1982 program, with an increase in funds, is expected to cover 72 per cent of households throughout the nation. So we can see that the industry is hoping to do an excellent job in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members should have no doubt from these figures that an increase in promotion funds is more than compensated for by an increase in sales. I think that this is an important point in respect of promotion. There is no point in spending a lot of money if we do not get an increase in sales. I believe that television is an excellent medium for promotion and should be encouraged especially if enough funds are available. We have seen what other industries, particularly the beef industry, are doing in this respect. </PARA>
<PARA> Before commending the Bill to the House, I congratulate the Government for the recommendation that there be a voluntary quota of 800 tonnes impost on imported processed pork products. The import of canned ham has been of great concern to pork producers throughout Australia. In reply to the remarks of the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin), I point out that the Government is not bound by any Industries Assistance Commission report. The Commission is an independent body set up to give reports to government and government does not necessarily have to do what it recommends. The textile industry gives recent example of a recommendation of which the Government has not necessarily taken complete note. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps unfortunately. But I would say in this case that it is fortunate for the pork producers of Australia that the Government has not taken note of the IAC report and that it has recommended that a voluntary quota be imposed. I believe that this is excellent for the industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also say to the honourable member for Werriwa that not all processors in Australia are multinationals. The canning facility at K. R. Darling Downs, which borders my electorate of Maranoa, is one of the biggest co-operative pork processing operations in Australia. I think it must be understood that Australian companies, as well as the odd multinational, are involved. I believe that applies to any industry one looks at in this country, particularly as Australia is a comparatively new industrialised nation. </PARA>
<PARA> Imports have been increasing from Yugoslavia and Romania and have built up to 920 tonnes this last 12 months. Danish and Canadian hams were ready to be imported to Australia; unfortunately the quota will see that stopped. These imports have caused prices of pigs at auction to drop from $1.55 a kilo to $1.25 a kilo. The canning facility at K.R. Darling Downs has also closed down. The quota allowed was higher than I was seeking for the industry but it was in the form I believe the industry deserved. An efficient pork industry in Australia should not be subject to the dumping of imports. The industry has suffered the burden of high grain prices and cannot withstand the competition of cheap imports. I warn all primary producers that these are the consequences of trading with communist nations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am suggesting to the honourable member that we ought to be careful in our trading negotiations, that these are the consequences. I have told the pork producers that these are the consequences when we are prepared to trade with Russia. Unfortunately this is something that we have to do. The Yugoslavs and the Russians produce most goods far cheaper than Australia can and are ruthless in dumping surplus products on our markets to earn foreign currency, in particular United States dollars, so that they can purchase strategic material which they do not possess. Therefore I give a legitimate warning to both sides that we have to be very careful in our trade negotiations with communist countries. It is important for government and industry that the producers still seek to reopen inquiries into the dumping of pork products in Australia. They are endeavouring to raise the price of the imported product so that the locally produced product will sell in competition with them. In other words, the industry is still trying to increase the price of the imported products to that it can compete. I urge the producers to put a good case in respect of the IAC report for long term assistance that will be brought down at the end of the year. The pork industry must have some form of promotion. I would suggest that the best form of protection is to sell at the best price possible as much pork as can be produced to meet the market. It is for that reason that I give on behalf of my Government full support to increase the funds that can be collected for pork promotion.</PARA></TALK.START>

I think that would indicate to the House that the Chair had no enthusiasm for taking the action it was required to take. The other thought to bear in mind, I suggest, is that these times might be termed extraordinary times and the Chair could not disallow the possibility that the honourable member for Lilley was engaged in some stratogem that sought the result that occurred.</PARA></TALK.START>

It had been moved and seconded. Questions were put that the mover and seconder respectively be not further heard. When those questions were resolved, it was incumbent on the Chair to put the question to the House for further attention. I put the question in that fashion. The Leader of the Opposition was free to rise to speak to the question, as he did. The Minister for Education, quite properly, rose to move that the question be put.</PARA></TALK.START>

You were then proposing that we proceed to debate the question. There is no point in delaying the House further on the matter but I make the point that you are proceeding with too much enthusiasm tonight in a way that suggests you are seeking to favour the Government in order to protect it from embarrassment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> My YOUNG-Yes, I do. During the debate a few minutes ago I mentioned in passing that all the States wanted the same arrangements as the arrangements that had been made privately this afternoon between the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Premier of Queensland regarding hospital funding. There was a quite audible interjection, which I am sure, will be recorded in Hansard, from the Minister for Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) asking me why I hate Tasmania. I mentioned Tasmania as being one of the States affected and one of the States that certainly need looking at in the same way as Queensland was looked at. I wish to remind the House that I mentioned Tasmania in my statement. I would like the House to know that Tasmania now has had the largest cut-a 23 per cent cut-in its hospital funding. Certainly Mr Lowe will be here like Mr Bjelke-Petersen-</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OD4">Mr JOHN BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In that case, I will speak about the new concept of pork which is the super-porker concept. This has been promoted very successfully by the Pig Meat Promotion Committee to the extent that in Adelaide as the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Ian Cameron) suggested, the proportion of super-pork which is sold in the shops has increased something like 230 per cent. When the Pig Meat Promotion Committee started to promote pork in a concentrated fashion, as it did, pork accounted for something like only 4 per cent of meat sales in Australia, but the advancement, in the time that the Committee has been promoting, is incredible. So I congratulate the Committee for that. I suggest to the House that the reason the levy is sought to be increased from 20 cents to 60 cents is to enable that promotion to go on all over Australia. I can only wish it success with that. One of the reasons the Committee had great success in South Australia was because of a great concentration of advertising on television. In fact, Miss Piggy was not the only pig to star on television where, of course, she is the sex symbol of the The Muppets. It appeared that the whole promotion of pork on television was an enormous success. I suggest to people that the generally held concept of pigs being dirty animals is wrong and that pigs are in fact the cleanest of all domesticated animals. Some of the misconceptions about pork meat should also be cleared up.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know that that is altogether correct. I was reading a report in the Sydney Morning Herald headed: 'All pigs want is love'. It suggested that, because of some survey that had been conducted in the Netherlands, the Dutch had worked out that pigs love a little affection. The report said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Where there was a good relationship between the stockman and the pigs the average number of pigs born per sow was significantly higher than on farms where the pigs were wary of humans. </PARA>
<PARA> The extent of affection meted out has not been determined yet-Dr Hemsworth said that a daily friendly pat on the snout may be sufficient. </PARA>
<PARA>That might well be the way for Kermit to win Miss Piggy's heart. I would like to make an observation or two about the value of pork as a culinary item. We all know that pork is one of the oldest foods known to man and also one of the tastiest and best loved of all meats. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Charles Lamb wrote an essay on it.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OD4">Mr JOHN BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right, a dissertation on roast pork. I have no doubt that the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), who has the reputation of being the greatest trencher-man in this House, would know about that. The concept of super-pork has enabled the housewife to buy a whole new range of pork cuts such as schnitzel, steaks, spare ribs, chops, roast, diced and minced pork which are all now very available, all delicious and all able to be prepared with other meats. In recent days it has been quite firmly established that today's pork, while being tender and full of protein, has larger amounts of thiamine-that is vitamin B-than any other meats, poultry or fish. Contrary to popular belief there is even a place for pork on special dishes. One hundred grams of lean pork contains fewer kilojoules than beef or lamb and the small amount of fat is more easily digested because it is less saturated than other animal fats. May I suggest to all housewives, who may or may not be listening, that if they really want to have their families healthy, well satisfied and totally appreciative of their culinary art, try a little pork.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset the Opposition proposes to move an amendment to the motion that the Companies Bill be read a second time. I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA> 'whilst not opposing the Bill, the House:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) expresses its concern- (a) at the Government's abdication of its responsibility to make national laws for companies and securities pursuant to the Commonwealth's own constitutional powers, and in accordance with the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange in 1974 (the Rae Report);</PARA>
<PARA> (b) at the lack of effective accountability of the National Companies and Securities Commission to either the Government or Parliament of the Commonwealth, or to any other single elected Government or Parliament, and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) that despite the inordinate delay in introducing the legislation, the Parliament of the Commonwealth has not been given an opportunity effectively to scrutinise this Bill and associated Bills and will not be able effectively to determine company law in the future under the Co-operative Companies and Securities Scheme;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) calls upon the Government in the event of the breakdown for any reason of the scheme, of which the Bill is a part, immediately to proceed to the introduction of Commonwealth legislation for the national regulation of companies;</PARA>
<PARA> (3) notes that this Bill places uniformity before reform in deference to powerful vested interest groups and represents a retreat to the lowest common denominator standard of company law;</PARA>
<PARA> (4) calls upon the Government to expedite the establishment of an Accounting Standards Review Board, and</PARA>
<PARA> (5) calls upon the Government immediately to pursue a fundamental reform of company law, including:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the abolition of the category of 'exempt proprietary company' and the privileges associated with it;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the provision of statutory directions and powers to the National Companies and Securities Commission and the courts to look behind the corporate entity in appropriate circumstances, to ascertain those who control it or hold shares in it, and, having regard to the purpose of the creation of the corporate entity and the manner of its control, to affix personal liability and adjudicate personal rights where it is just and equitable to do so;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the extension of the powers of inspection of the National Companies and Securities Commission to ensure the fullest reasonable access of the Commission to books;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) the amendment of any provision which enables questionable practices to be hidden by means of legal professional privilege;</PARA>
<PARA> (e) the requirement for all companies to raise and maintain a prescribed minimum nominal and paid up capital;</PARA>
<PARA> (f) rationalisation of the cumbersome provisions in respect of company names on the basis of single nationwide registration;</PARA>
<PARA> (g) a requirement that companies disclose all donations for political purposes;</PARA>
<PARA> (h) a requirement that dividends be paid only from the genuine profits of a company;</PARA>
<PARA> (i) full review of the provisions relating to fund-raising and prospectuses to ensure maximum disclosure and to require independent valuation of assets exchanged for isssued shares;</PARA>
<PARA> (j) reform of the provisions relating to companies financing dealings in their own shares, including the removal of the exemption given to financial assistance to salaried directors;</PARA>
<PARA> (k) provision for a higher required standard of competence, care and diligence for directors and officers of companies;</PARA>
<PARA> (l) a requirement that more frequent accounts be lodged by companies listed on the stock exchanges;</PARA>
<PARA> (m) in order to protect creditors and to assist the prevention of tax avoidance, the imposition of stringent disclosure requirements upon companies acting as trustees of trading trusts, in relation to their capacity as trustees and the accounts of the relevant trusts, and the imposition of heavy penalties for non-compliance;</PARA>
<PARA> (n) full disclosure to the public of the beneficial ownership of all shares in companies;</PARA>
<PARA> (o) published accounts to include full details of each director's and officer's remuneration and right of inspection for employees and shareholders of director's service contracts;</PARA>
<PARA> (p) adequate remedies for oppresive conduct, including extension of the concept of oppression to single and anticipated acts unfairly prejudicial to a shareholder; and provision of further means such as a 'Shareholders' Tribunal' to protect the interests of minority shareholders, and</PARA>
<PARA> (q) complete reform of the winding up provisions, including greater protection for unsecured creditors, following a reference on insolvency to the Australian Law Reform Commission'. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition has moved this amendment because it remains convinced that the co-operative companies and securities scheme is unsatisfactory and because the Companies Bill which forms a part of the scheme is deplorably inadequate. We have chosen, however, not to seek formal amendments to the Bill because to do so would, under the tedious arrangements of the co-operative scheme, lead to further delays in the establishment of a uniform companies code. Already, the delays have been incredible, and the passage of these Bills will not be the end of that. The States still have to enact their application legislation, so that there is no prospect for the code to be commenced before January 1982. In this context, it must be remembered that the proposal to establish a uniform companies code was first agreed to by a meeting of State and Commonwealth Attorneys-General in 1959. Moreover, it has been seven years since the Australian Labor Party sought to establish through its National Companies Bill a realistic national companies code. </PARA>
<PARA> Why have we waited and wasted these past seven years? Certainly, it has not resulted in a more modern, more comprehensive, or a more effective law being developed. This Bill shys away from virtually every conceivable area of reform. Its weaknesses in that respect will be dealt with in more detail later in these remarks, and also in the Committee stage. It is sufficient to record at this point that the Opposition considers this Bill to be a disgrace, all the more so for the many years that we have waited for it. But the Bill must also be considered in the context of the co-operative scheme of which it is only a part. If there could be any justification for our waiting seven years, it would be that a co-operative scheme proves to be constitutionally and practically more effective than a single national law exclusively the responsibility of this Parliament. Yet already, as the Opposition has consistently held and argued, the co-operative approach has no such superiority. The inordinate delays, for example, waiting for seven governments to reach agreement, are already testimony to one of the scheme's weaknesses. The fact that this Bill, as we have indicated in our amendment, represents the lowest common denominator of company law, is further evidence. </PARA>
<PARA> In previous debates on the other elements of the companies and securities package, the Opposition has clearly established that the constitutional authority, and more importantly the constitutional responsibility, for companies and securities law rests firmly with the Commonwealth. We have maintained consistently that placitum 20 of section 51 of the Constitution, which gives this Parliament power to legislate with respect to foreign corporations and trading or financial corporations formed within the limits of the Commonwealth, is a clear-cut power provided to the Commonwealth. We have enunciated the many decisions of the High Court of Australia which have clarified this power. Yet this Government, in keeping with its crippled ideology, has sought to avoid any extension of Commonwealth powers and responsibility. It has sought instead this strange hybrid, the co-operative scheme, whereby all seven governments have some say in the law, but no one of them has full responsibility for it. The excuse the Government has given for the creation of this complex mess is that, in fact, it does not have constitutional power. But that, of course, is clearly and quite demonstrably nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> But what of the constitutional position of the co-operative scheme itself? Already before any of the substantive legislative codes are in operation under the scheme, a question mark hangs over it. It is like a sword of Damocles. The takeover battle by Elder Smith Goldsbrough Mort Ltd earlier this year led the South Australian Corporate Affairs Commission to seek the assistance of the New South Wales Corporate Affairs Commission to obtain information from certain merchant banks. The response from the banks when the New South Wales body sought to comply was that it-the New South Wales CAC-was not acting in pursuit of the peace, order and good government of that State. What a farcical situation it is that a line drawn on a map of Australia by some ill-advised founding father could be such an impediment to the proper conduct of companies in Australia. So there we have it. Under this federal scheme there is, already, considerable uncertainty as to the rights and powers of one State to initiate action in another. We do not know how such a challenge would hold up in a court but, nonetheless, we have in actual experience, reason to question the constitutional validity of the scheme. Yet these seven years of delay are justified by the Government as avoiding constitutional problems. What arrant nonsense! All that the Government has avoided is its proper constitutional responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> I have dealt briefly with the problems of delay and the abdication of responsibility by the Government. I stress that of equal importance, is the contemptuous way with which the Government deals with the Parliament. As I have already indicated, no single Parliament is responsible for this co-operative law, and the National Companies and Securities Commission is not responsible to any one parliament. The Opposition considers this deplorable. I am sure, in his more rational moments that the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Moore) agrees with that. Equally, as our amendment indicates, we consider that it is lamentable that the Parliament has had no role during these seven years of delay in effectively scrutinising this Bill and the associated Bills. This is particularly regrettable given that the Parliament had such an important role, through the Rae Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange, in promoting the need for reform and national law in these areas. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to consider directly the Companies Bill and the associated Bills. Because this is a cognate debate, I must begin by indicating that the Opposition supports all of these Bills, except that we intend to oppose Part III of the Companies (Acquisition of Shares) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1981. I will give further details of our objections to this part during the Committee stages, except that I should indicate here that it is a further demonstration of the extraordinary contempt that the Government has for the parliamentary process. This is because there is no intention to proclaim Part III, which effectively lifts the prohibition on crossings, until the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities unanimously agrees to do so, after investigating whether stock exchange rules adequately deal with possible conflicts of interest. That is to say, the Government is asking the Parliament to pass a law which may or may not ever be proclaimed, because neither the Government nor the Parliament yet know how adequate are the alternative means of control. This is a preposterous insult to the Parliament and to pass a law in such circumstances would be a complete abrogation of the Parliament's responsibilities. So, I have foreshadowed what our action will be in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> The other Bill which requires some comment before we turn to the companies code itself, is the Crown Debts (Priority) Bill 1981. I foreshadowed that the Opposition will also be moving an amendment the motion for the second reading of this Bill. The amendment expresses our concern at the fact that the whole area of priority for the Crown remains unsatisfactory. We note that the Commonwealth, contrary to the report entitled 'Priority of Crown Debts' tabled in the Senate by the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs in 1978, has chosen to retain the prerogative priority of the Crown in relation to tax instalment deductions, withholding tax on dividends and interest remitted overseas. We understand that because the Commonwealth has retained its priority to this extent-a priority relating to about one-half of the total tax liability of bankrupts or companies in liquidation-the States have chosen to refuse to abrogate their own priority status. </PARA>
<PARA> We in the Opposition consider these actions of the Commonwealth and the States to be regrettable. We further believe that in situations of bankruptcy or liquidation, the highest priority should be afforded to the ordinary employees of the businesses concerned. I think that that is a moral judgment with which everybody should agree, not just the Opposition. Invariably, employees and those to whom compensation payments are owed are placed in the greatest hardship by business failures. The business is usually their only source of income, while most creditors and certainly the Crown have a greater spread of income sources and risks. The Opposition urges the Commonwealth Government and the States to re-examine urgently the issue of debt priorities which arise in the distribution of the assets of business in liquidation or bankruptcy. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the Companies Bill which is the main Bill and I guess the linchpin to the whole operation. I intend to deal with particular provisions during the Committee stage and confine my remarks at this time to some general observations which reflect the attitudes of the Opposition to company law. First of all, it must be observed that this Bill is a retreat to the lowest common denominator of attitudes to company law. It has achieved the objective of uniformity, as any Bill under the scheme does, but it has totally ignored the need for reform. I think any independent observer of the corporate scene in Australia would agree that this area of corporate concern is in great need of reform. This is so, not only against a high standard of modern corporate rule but also against the standard set in earlier drafts of this legislation and against the standard reached in 1974 in the Labor Government's National Companies Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The only substantial changes-I hesitate to refer to them as 'reforms'-are the substantial revision of the structure and level of penalties and completely new provisions in relation to the registration of priority of charges. These are supplemented by various minor changes which are generally worthwhile but, in relation to most areas in need of reform, a giant step backwards from previous drafts is evidenced. This backward step, I might say, appears to have been the result of pressure from powerful but minority vested interest groups. It certainly has not resulted from pressure from the thousands of small shareholders, small creditors and employees whose lives and livelihoods are so significantly affected by company law. The establishment of a new administration and a new law in relation to companies should have been seen as an opportunity to assess the role of company law from first principles. We regret that that opportunity was not undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA> The importance of the corporate entity in our society cannot be overstated. More and more, companies and trusts are being formed to conduct business and, regrettably, for other purposes including the avoidance of tax. So it is vitally important that in framing companies laws we keep in mind the objectives which we have. I suspect that the present Government's only objective has been uniformity, which in itself is worthwhile, but it does not in any way go to the heart of the issue. For instance, why should anyone be given the privilege of conducting business under circumstances of limited liability? Can anyone answer that with a positive response? The answer, surely, is that the modern corporation and the modern small business company provide an efficient vehicle for the mobilisation of risk capital. This modilisation has been a vital engine of economic development in the Western world. </PARA>
<PARA> This role of the privileges of limited liability in the corporate form carries with it a responsibility which must be exercised and be seen to be exercised. In the modern era, where corporations can be vast and where there are hundreds of thousands of small companies, the rules of the game must be uniform, clear and comprehensive. This Bill fails miserably on every one of those descriptions. The essential requirements include the imposition of a standard of skill, care and diligence appropriate to the high degree of responsibility which directors and other officers must accept. This Bill fails in this respect because it essentially reproduces the requirement which has long proven to be inadequate in the antiquated laws which we have inherited. I regret the fact that there was some evidence of reform in this area in the draft exposure Bill of some months ago which has now disappeared. </PARA>
<PARA> Another essential requirement is disclosure; but, once again, this Bill fails because it has constrained the powers of the NCSC. It retains such categories as 'exempt proprietary companies' with their lesser disclosure requirements and retreated from the urgent need to impose disclosure requirements on companies acting as trustees of trading trusts. I am sure that my colleague the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi) has some very pointed observations to make on that subject. But these are just some of the failures of this Bill. Several others are referred to in the amendment that I have moved. </PARA>
<PARA> To take the example of trading trusts, we have here a classic instance of a tail-tax avoidance by private business-wagging a dog, that is, carrying on a business with a proper legal structure. Typically we have in these cases the complete abrogation of all of the fundamental responsibilities which should be imposed in circumstances of limited liability. Formally, management of the business is vested not in the directors, but in the company itself. The directors avoid their responsibilities; the companies are typically under-capitalised; and creditors and employees are left virtually without protection. The only beneficiaries are the sharp operators who seek tax benefits in company-trust combinations. This is a clear example of what I mean when I say that, in framing company law, we must have our objectives in mind. Where a business structure does not serve our objectives, it should not be allowed to form. At a very minimum, full public disclosure of the facts of each case should be required. Disclosure, if it is to be effective, must also be in such a form that it can be trusted and interpreted. Everyone knows that companies can often decide each year what profits they will disclose. Accounting standards in Australia are entirely inadequate. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OD4">Mr JOHN BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for North Sydney thinks that is nonsense. I would suggest that the silk from Northern Sydney should go and have a look at the list of bankruptcies that litter the history of corporations in Australia and the enormous disasters that have been foist upon innocent people, be they shareholders, creditors or employees. The Opposition has repeatedly called for the establishment of a statutory body to review accounting standards. The proposal is resisted by those who work the current system. Obviously, of course they would resist it. It has been tossed about between the Ministerial Council and the National Companies and Securities Commission but, if anything, the signs are that it will never be implemented. Here again the Government is an abject failure. It is not having a very good fortnight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Finally, in the time that remains, I mention that the Bill also fails to deal with some of the more important new concerns which have emerged in relation to company law. Small shareholders regrettably have not been given any significant new roles in the management of companies, despite the continuation of nineteenth century concepts of the duties of directors. The divorcement of small shareholders from the affairs of companies remains total and complete. Employees continue to be ignored. There is no legislative recognition of the rights or responsibilities of employees insofar as company management is concerned. Provisions relating to employees gaining shareholdings in companies as part of their remuneration package are inadequately dealt with. There is not only no consideration of these aspects but also there is no protection afforded employees through disclosure requirements appropriate to them-despite the fact, and I will admit this, that some more progressive companies have voluntarily chosen to prepare reports to employees-and there is virtually no limit on the allocation of 'perks' to directors and others irrespective of the position of workers. The Government has ignored the employee in this Bill and shows no sign of ever waking up to the fact that social awareness and economc conditions increasingly require that employees be taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, the Opposition will support the passage of these Bills but only because it is concerned that they be no further delayed-the Government has made a high art form of delaying these things; there has been a 22 year delay between 1959 and 1981-and because the uniformity of law which they offer is preferable to the costly inefficiencies of the current system. We believe that the Bills presented to this Parliament are utterly inadequate. Whilst the current Minister is the fourth to have had responsibility for them, he must be ashamed to have been the one who had to introduce them. The Opposition hopes that the National Companies and Securities Commission will prove more diligent and more effective in promoting company law reform than the four Ministers of this Government have proven so far to be. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The amendment moved by the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown) is unacceptable because it is really based on one concept, that is, that this Parliament should be unilaterally making laws relating to corporations for application throughout the whole of Australia rather than adopting a co-operative approach, which the Government has done in the package of legislation before us this evening and in legislation already passed. Really, it comes down to this: Does the national Parliament ride rough-shod over the States? Does it ignore the fact that practically and constitutionally the States have had the carriage of company law since Federation? Does it ignore the fact that not all wisdom resides with the Commonwealth or that there ought, indeed, to be true co-operation as between the Commonwealth and the States on such important pieces of legislation?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Honourable members on this side of the House adopt the view that there ought to be a co-operative approach and that the Commonwealth ought not to ride rough-shod over the rights of the States, including the State of New South Wales. We adopt the view that this Parliament ought to take account of and, where necessary, learn from the experience of the States, which practically and constitutionally have had the carriage of corporate legislation since Federation. The amendment moved by the honourable member for Parramatta is unacceptabble because he does not want to take that into account. He wants this Parliament to ride rough-shod over the States. That is not something that honourable members on this side of the House will countenance. We will even take account of what Mr Wran and his colleagues have to say and go ahead with the co-operative package accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Parramatta made great reference to delays. Of course, if it is decided as a matter of principle that there ought to be co-operation with the States, regrettably some delays will be unavoidable. Nevertheless, we have already passed some parts of the total package of companies legislation. We have before us this evening the Companies Bill and its associated legislation, all of which brings to a climax a co-operative approach bringing about real uniformity in this area for Australia for the first time. That is in fact a monumental piece of progress. This package of legislation is a major feat of all governments in this nation. It involves probably some 50 Bills being passed by the parliaments of Australia. It is the largest legislative undertaking ever taken on by a Commonwealth government. It certainly represents a major step forward in providing uniform legislation through which much of Australia's commerce and business can be carried on. It is also worth noting that some of the delays referred to by the honourable member for Parramatta have been caused by the fact that the legislation has been given out for public exposure. I think that it is rather a good thing that the government of the day not only co-operates with the States in framing this legislation but also exposes draft legislation to the public at large so as to get back comment on it and tries to improve and amend the legislation as a result of that. </PARA>
<PARA> The final point that we should come to in talking about the legislation is that in future amendments between the Commonwealth and the States will be done on a majority basis. Now that uniform agreement has been achieved with the States we are in a situation where the foundation has been laid for continued uniformity and co-operation in the companies area as between the Commonwealth and the States. In other words, the package we have this evening and the packaging already passed by this Parliament lay the foundation-a very firm foundation-for continued reform in the companies area. The honourable member for Parramatta referred to a lot of problems that he sees in the Bill. The problems are either real-there may well be some that are real-or imaginary. The honourable member has a very fertile imagination. Whatever happens in practice, at least we now have the foundation whereby we can learn from experience. On the foundation of this co-operative package of legislation we can consider amendments and co-operatively the nation will continue, where necessary, to reform companies legislation. To say, therefore, that in this package of legislation the Government has shied away from real reform or has abrogated its constitutional responsibility is to ignore the fact that reform has been undertaken and that the foundation has now been laid in co-operation with the States for further reform as we gain experience from the enactment of this legislative package. </PARA>
<PARA> My further comments this evening will be related to the Companies Bill itself. Whilst I do not ignore the fact that there are important matters in all the other Bills in this package, for the remainder of my comments I will address myself to the Companies Bill because it is probably the major piece of legislation in the package before us tonight. Probably the most important concept that the new Companies Bill incorporates is the provision for one place registration within Australia for companies. Before going on to that in further detail it is probably worthwhile to go back a little in history to give an understanding of precisely what we have before us this evening and where it comes from. In December 1978 the Commonwealth and all six States executed a formal agreement to proceed with the preparation and enactment of uniform legislation in the companies area. That formal agreement contained four essential elements. Firstly, it formalised the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities comprised of one Minister representing each State and the Commonwealth. The Council was to reach unanimous agreement on all initial legislation, as we have it before us this evening. Subsequent amendments require only majority approval. The second element--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Jacobi" NAMEID="CV4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CV4">Mr Jacobi</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am with you old son.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="B87">Mr DEAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad to hear it. The second element is agreement to establish the National Companies and Securities Commission. The NCSC is subject to the direction of the Ministerial Council established by the formal agreement. The NCSC, subject to that direction, will administer the legislation under the scheme. It has various powers including powers to hold hearings, summon witnesses and delegate most of its powers and functions to the State and Territory corporate affairs officers. Thirdly, the formal agreement provides for maximum use of existing State and Territory corporate affairs officers. Although the legislation gives all powers and functions to the NCSC, the use of existing officers will ensure a decentralised administration of the scheme. The fourth element concerns a legislative framework which involves the States adopting the scheme legislation when it is placed in the Australian Capital Territory. The Australian Capital Territory will be the first to pass all this legislation, which is then to be adopted by the States and the Territory. Subsequent amendments to the legislation passed by this Parliament will automatically apply in the other jurisdictions. Therefore, we have a Companies Bill coming before us as part of that total framework established by the formal agreement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One place registration of companies has fairly obvious advantages as far as companies and all professions associated with them are concerned. A company can achieve nationwide recognition without the need to lodge company documents in other States or Territories. Overseas corporations will similarly have to seek registration in only one place. Associated with that measure is the fact that incorporated in the Companies Bill is a national system of registration for auditors and liquidators and, indeed, one winding-up of any corporation in all participating jurisdictions. In that respect, I refer the House to clause 420 of the Bill. That is one but probably the most significant of the modifications or innovations incorporated within this Companies Bill, but there are others. This Bill contains a rationalisation of penalties and sanctions. A close examination of those penalties and sanctions will show that the Companies Bill has teeth which are not so blunt, as is sometimes made out. The new Companies Bill has new powers of inspection which represent a dramatic improvement in the present position of companies Acts within the States themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer the House to the explanatory memorandum which has been circulated by the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Moore). The powers of inspection are referred to in some detail on page 52. The limited powers of inspection in the present main States companies Acts are not expressed in a way that enables them to be used to investigate suspected criminal activity. In addition, they do not enable a corporate affairs office to obtain the information and explanations needed to explain the records inspected. If inquiries do not produce voluntary co-operation a corporate affairs office either has to abandon the case or request a special investigation, with all the ramifications that that entails. It was considered in the formulation of this Companies Bill that those powers were inadequate. Therefore the Bill contains new powers of inspection which address themselves to some of the weaknesses that I have mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA> Significant reform is contained in the new Companies Bill in relation to pre-incorporation contracts. There has been some criticism that clause 81 of the Companies Bill does not effect any significant reform relating to contracts entered into prior to a company's formation. The question might have been asked: Why does the Bill not make personally liable, in the absence of an express agreement to the contrary, a person who purportedly entered into a contract in the name of or on behalf of the company, as might be seen in other codes? The object of clause 81 is certainly to modify the existing highly unsatisfactory common law position relating to pre-incorporation contracts. Under present law a company cannot effectively ratify pre-incorporation contracts so as to sue or to be sued on them. Under present law it is difficult to attach legal obligations of pre-incorporation contracts to promoters or other individuals purporting to act for companies. Clause 81 provides that a company, not formed at the time a contract was entered into, will be able later to ratify the contract so as to be bound by and entitled to the benefit of it. Under sub-clause 4 a person purporting to contract for the non-existent company will be personally liable in damages in some circumstances. There is a good basis for the modification to be expressed in this way, based largely on a 1979 report of the Victorian Law Reform Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA> The new Companies Bill contains substantial modifications to the provisions in general about shareholdings. I will not have time this evening to go into those matters in detail. Perhaps my colleague, the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender), will be able to do so. In relation to priority of charges, the new Bill ensures that there is a system of priorities in accordance with the recommendations of the Eggleston report. That system of priorities has been included as a substitute for earlier requirements that charges be registered within a certain time of creation, usually 30 days. In addition, the present Bill seeks to refine those priority provisions beyond those contained in the August 1980 draft. Another major change from the August draft is the removal of the sixth Schedule. That Schedule, which related to companies' accounts and group accounts, was similar to the old ninth Schedule in the Interstate Corporate Affairs Commission Companies Acts. The provision now is for the sixth Schedule requirements relating to accounts and group accounts to be made into regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> Some critics have said that this is unreasonable in that it might permit draconian amendments to be the regulations at a later time. But, on the other hand, by ensuring that these requirements can be enacted in regulation, the Parliament retains flexibility so that where deficiencies arise and where changes are found to be necessary they can be made more speedily and effectively than if an amendment to a Schedule were to be enshrined in an Act. It should be borne in mind also that the regulations are intended to take the same form substantially as the draft Schedule 6 or the old Schedule 9. To this date they contain no significant departure from the present law. As I said at the beginning, it should be remembered that this is a foundation for the future administration of company law in this nation. Where deficiencies arise and where changes are required the Ministerial Council and the parliaments of this nation should be prepared swiftly and effectively to make the changes necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> Some concern has been expressed about provisions relating to the duties of directors. Such provisions in the August Bill appear to have been removed. Questions have been raised as to why there are not more significant changes relating to directors' duties. The principal provision relating to directors' duties is clause 229, and it is certainly wider than the existing main States legislation. It applies to all officers of a company, not just directors. Directors and other officers are required to exercise a reasonable degree of care in performing their duties, in addition to the present requirement of reasonable diligence. The requirement that officers do not make improper use of information obtained by virtue of their position has been extended to cover former officers and employees. Provision has been made also for more severe penalties, involving terms of imprisonment. But, certainly, the present Bill does not impose a duty of skill on directors as was done in an earlier draft of the Bill. This change has been made in the light of public submissions received. Those submissions are to the effect that, firstly, it is not appropriate to impose an objective standard of skill on directors since they are employed in different capacities, for different purposes and with the expectation that they will contribute different skills. The test imposed unrealistic burdens on outside directors. Practice might show that those provisions are not severe or extensive enough. But surely it is desirable, having established this co-operative framework and having arrived at the terms of this co-operative Bill, to get it moving, to see it work and then to decide whether weaknesses need to be corrected or changes ought to be made. To imagine what may not in real trading practice come about is folly. I intended to spend a little time on the trading trust provisions and the excitement stirred up by one national newspaper recently when it suggested that the so-called tax lobby had won a major concession by having them removed. From all my inquiries I found that newspaper report to be quite erroneous. The changes were not the result of any so-called tax lobby; rather they were the result of further consideration by the Ministerial Council. I hope that my colleague the honourable member for North Sydney will have time to address himself more fully to that aspect of the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I refer to some Press criticism that the disclosure provisions in this Bill as they might relate to Australian operations or the operations within Australia of overseas corporations do not go far enough. I simply draw the attention of the House to the provisions of clauses 561 and 540 and the appeal provisions of 537. The legislative package that we have before us is but a foundation for the future advanced and uniform administration of company law in this nation. It is a tremendous step forward. It is a monumental feat of government and it ought to be enacted without any further delay. It is to be applauded by Australian business. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whilst I support this companies legislation, it is with pleasure that I second the amendment. This package of Bills that purports to regulate business corporations can be bluntly described as law by the privileged for the privileged and of the privileged. It does nothing more than perpetuate the existing inadequate regulation of business corporations. If the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Moore) were honest, the appropriate title of the Companies Bill would be the Companies' Directors Protection Bill. I repeat what I said in regard to earlier legislation: This legislation can be summed up in two brief sentences-if one is an honest investor, beware; if one is a market or company shark, it will be business as usual.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I challenge the Minister to indicate the corporate reforms that are so clearly needed to ensure security and protection to both corporations and the community. Where is the embodiment of the so-called complete reappraisal of the role of the company in society? Companies, institutions and organisations must be responsive to the community. This has become important, although it is difficult because of rapid political, economic, technological and social changes. The community has developed new and obviously greater expectations. Business corporations have suffered a considerable downturn in credibility over the last two decades, for a variety of reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> Company law must establish a solid framework which defines a company's responsibility to its shareholders, creditors and the society. Beyond quesion the coming decade will bring ever-increasing pressure to bear; it will test these laws to the limit. Regrettably, these Bills fail to meet the test. They will be inadequate and, as a consequence, ineffective. One can only describe them as completely outmoded. Even worse, they serve as nothing more than a charter for the unscrupulous. This so-called revamped companies law is almost the same as that in the laissez-faire Britain of the nineteenth century. Where are the profound and meaningful changes? Members of companies, particularly large companies, take little part in company affairs. Those members are poorly placed, and the provisions in these bills make sure that shareholders do not receive the information about their companies which would enable them to act as watchdogs on management. A classic example of that is the collapse of Associated Securities Ltd. Nothing in this legislation will remedy that situation. It is an indictment of all those who claim responsibility for these Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> There are no real changes to the legislation; changes which are so necessary if the corporate sector is to fulfil its responsibility in our complex society. For instance, it is essential that proxy voting be used for shareholders unable to attend meetings. I hope the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender), who is to follow me in this debate, will explain where that is provided for in the Companies Bill. There should be mandatory use of two-way proxies for important resolutions to provide a means for shareholders' participation and protection. There is not a word about that in the Bill. Why not? There are good reasons for it. We will come to that at the Committee stage. Creditors of limited liability companies will receive little protection from these laws. Unlike companies in Europe, Australian companies do not have to have a prescribed minimum paid up capital. There is no stringent regulation of the issue of shares for non-cash consideration. In that respect the legislation is utterly defective. There is no prohibition on the payment of dividends to shareholders if some or all of the share capital has been lost or the revenue losses have been incurred in the immediately preceding year. There is not a word about it. What a fraud the legislation is. In Australia the law-this legislation perpetuates it-permits a limited liability company to be formed with a share capital of 2c. Public companies must have a share capital of at least 5c. One may well ask whether this is a ridiculously low price to pay for the advantage of corporate status and limited liability. Certainly the plethora of $2 companies that the public all too frequently hears about tends to breed cynicism and contempt towards the corporate sector. It is scandalous. In short, limited liability status is not a privilege to be earned but a licence to be abused. The fact that most companies may not abuse the licence is no answer to the claim that our laws are recklessly permissive. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to some of the appalling deficiencies in the legislation. Firstly, there is a lack of creditor protection, an absence of minimum issue capital requirements, failure to regulate non-cash consideration share issues, failure to designate properly the funds from which dividends may be paid, failure to require all limited liability companies to make public audited annual accounts and failure to abolish exempt proprietary companies, which was done in Britain in 1967. I ask honourable members to contrast that with the Australian position, and to consider the situation in West European countries such as West Germany, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the European Economic Community countries. Secondly, there is failure to provide adequate protection to shareholders and failure to regulate new share issues so that existing shareholders are treated fairly. There is not a word in the legislation about pro rata issues and issues for non-cash consideration. There is also failure to remove the manifest weakness in the current section 186 of the Companies Act which in limited circumstances allows shareholders to seek judicial relief from the unfair conduct of the company's management or controlling shareholders. The honourable member for North Sydney agrees with that. I refer him to section 75 (1) of the United Kingdom Act of 1980. Thirdly, our companies laws have failed to deal with the fundamental weaknesses, which have been an affront for decades and there are separate State laws. There are problems for pacesetter States. Taking the lead to reform legislation could result in companies setting up operations in other jurisdictions. It has been done time after time. That could lead to a possible loss of State revenue and employment. Is this good company law? It is defective company law. Contrast that with the sensible positions that apply throughout the laws of the EEC countries. It is bad, lowest common denominator legislation. We are locking ourselves into a structure which by its very nature can only create weak and ineffective laws when clearly strong laws are needed. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of examples of that include the situation of exempt propriety companies. Most Australian limited liability companies are, within the existing Companies Act, defined as exempt propriety companies. Essentially, such a company is a propriety company in which no member of the public has direct or indirect interest in its shareholding. At least 90 per cent of Australian limited liability companies come within that definition. Such a company does not have to have its accounts audited annually. Its accounts can be audited but a copy of its audited balance sheet does not have to be filed with the Corporate Affairs Commission. Consequently, a creditor of such a company cannot search any public file for evidence of the credit worthiness of the company concerned. It is a scandal. The company does not have to pay for the privilege of limited liability by making adequate public disclosures of its financial position. If such a company does not have its accounts audited each year it must file a copy of its unaudited balance sheet with the Corporate Affairs Commission. Obviously, creditors rely on unaudited statements at their peril. The exempt propriety company concept was derived from the United Kingdom. In 1962 the English Jenkins committee on company law reform recommended that the concept be abolished and rightly so. Why did it do that? It took the view that such companies should have their accounts and balance sheets audited professionally each year, and for such accounts and balance sheets to be made public. They ought to be. Creditors of all such companies have a right to accurate information concerning their credit worthiness. The 1967 United Kingdom Companies Act abolished such companies, without creating any significant practical problems. Nothing better illustrates the gross inadequacy of Australian company law than the fact that the vast majority of such limited companies are entitled to secrecy in regard to their financial affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to dividends out of profits, which is referred to in clause 565 of the Companies Bill and section 376 of the current Act. Neither the current Act nor the Bill defines profits. That is a scandal. Consequently, as under the existing section 376 (1), a company could lose most of its share capital through trading losses and then in a particular accounting period make a profit. That profit could be used for dividend purposes under this clause without the previous losses first being made good. It is scandalous. It is ironic that the United Kingdom has adopted a more stringent definition of profits. Section 39 (1) of the United Kingdom Act states:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) A company shall not make a distribution . . . except out of profits available for the purposes . . . </PARA>
<PARA> (2) For the purpose of this part . . . a company's profit available for distribution, are its accumulated realised profits, so far as not previously utilised by distribution or capitalisation, less its accumulative or realised losses, so far as not previously written off in a reduction or re-organisation of capital duly made. </PARA>
<PARA>Section 40 of the United Kingdom Act states:</PARA>
<PARA> A public company may only make a distribution at any time:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) if at that time the amount of its net assets is not less than the aggregate of the companies called up share capital and its undistributable reserves; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) if, and to the extent that, the distribution does not reduce the amount of those assets to less than that aggregate. </PARA>
<PARA>Let us look at this Bill and what it does not do. It fails to make it difficult for a limited company to be formed. There are no minimum issued capital requirements-for instance, the requirement of a minimum of $50,000 in issued capital for public companies as is the case in the United Kingdom. That requirement is contained in the 1980 Act. The Australian Bill fails to strengthen the extraordinarily weak regulation of share issues for non-cash consideration. I will take up that matter with the sick at the back, the honourable member for North Sydney, in Committee. There is no requirement in the Bill that non-cash consideration should be expertly and independently valued and reported upon as is the case in the United Kingdom Companies Act, thus off-setting State cash transaction techniques for avoiding the limited disclosure of non-cash issues under proposed section 113 of the new legislation. This opening has not been closed off are recommended by the Eggleston Committee in 1970. Under this Bill the position remains exactly as it was. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no early warning device should there be a significant loss of share capital. Again, such a provision is contained in section 34 of the United Kingdom Act. There is no attempt to ensure that shareholders should receive equal and fair entitlements to new shares issued by companies. They ought to be protected. There is no attempt to enlarge the opportunities for minority shareholders to challenge the validity of acts of the board of directors or the general meeting. There is not a word on this matter in the Bill. I now read section 75 of the United Kingdom companies Act. </PARA>
<PARA> (1) A member of a company may apply to the Court by petition for an order under this section on the ground that the affairs of the company are being or have been conducted in a manner which is unfairly prejudicial to the interests of some part of the members (including at least himself) or that some actual or proposed act or omission . . . is or would be prejudicial.''</PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps the honourable member for North Sydney would be kind enough to explain to me where there is a provision in the Bill that gives protection. I challenge him to show me. In contrast to these necessary provisions which are operative throughout Western Europe, this Bill provides for a small privileged section-that is, company directions-the protection they neither warrant nor deserve. All other needs and protection are subjugated to these privileged few. </PARA>
<PARA> Why is the Bill so weak? The contents of the Bill were supposed to reflect closely the existing Interstate Corporate Affairs Commision legislation. That legislation was weak, for a number of obvious reasons. To add to the problem, the weak laws were not even uniform. The new State-Commonwealth co-operative venture may in the short term solve the uniformity problems, but it certainly will not result in significantly stronger laws. It is highly questionable whether uniform weak laws are better than divergent laws, some of which are progressive. Let me repeat that: It is highly questionable whether uniform weak laws are better than divergent laws, some of which are progressive. </PARA>
<PARA> The reasons strong new laws are unlikely are: Firstly, the initial legislation requires unanimous consent by all members of the Ministerial Council; and, secondly, the amendments are unlikely unless they are acceptable to the Ministerial Council. The agreement provides for amendments being approved by a mere majority vote. However, any dissenting member or members may threaten to leave the scheme unilaterally should these amendments be pressed home. Such action would ruin the scheme. Such a threat would be taken seriously with the result that planned majority reforms will be either jettisoned or watered down. This sort of compromise legislation is not what this country needs to lift its companies legislation out of the backwaters of the advanced Western world. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the answer? The dual goals of, firstly, uniform legislation and, secondly, strong legislation can be achieved only by the Commonwealth Government using its constitutional powers to pass laws relating to the formation of trading and financial corporations. Such laws would apply uniformly throughout Australia. They must be stronger laws than those contained in this package of Bills because the Commonwealth Government would not have to satisfy State governments. It would have the power to pass legislation thought necessary. It would be politically accountable for its legislation in a way that is completely absent from this co-operative venture. There is no direct political accountability in this legislation. This is admitted on both sides of the chamber. Rather, it is defused between all the members of the Ministerial Council. Surely strong uniform law is preferable to uniform but compromise law. If strong uniform law can be achieved by Commonwealth legislation, the onus is on those supporting the alternative approach to demonstrate clearly that it will work in practice. The evidence so far available suggests it will not. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia cannot afford to play around with company law for another decade as it has done over the last decade. Time will not permit that leeway. We all agree on the desperate need to maximise Australian investment and to minimise the appalling escalation of foreign investment. If we are to maintain that which is rightfully ours, such laws must be effective. They must provide the atmosphere to induce people to invest with security. They must be just to all, not selective as this legislation clearly is. </PARA>
<PARA> If we place on the statute book laws that are weak, fragmented and inadequate, laws that fail to give shareholders and creditors in the community the protection and the security needed, laws which fail to make directors and auditors both responsible and accountable, that give one section immunity and leave the rest vulnerable, we have failed to meet the test. We have failed to provide the strong framework which is so necessary if business corporations and the investing public are to operate in a secure and expanding market. </PARA>
<PARA> These Bills will provide laws which will do nothing more than has been done since the inception of legislation in this area. They will provide a breeding ground for the spiv, the charlatan and the corporate crook. They were eliminated in Europe a decade ago. It is a scandal that the so-called law makers of this country perpetuate ineffective law. But then, after all, we do not put gentlemen in gaol. </PARA>

However, let us look at one or two of the things which were said and consider, firstly, whether they are serious and, secondly, whether they have any support at all. Reference is made in paragraph (5) (b) of the amendment, in the convoluted language which is employed, to some power in the Commission to ascertain those who control or own shares in the company. The paragraph states further:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . having regard to the purpose of the creation of the corporate entity and the manner of its control, to affix personal liability and adjudicate personal rights where it is just and equitable to do so;</PARA>
<PARA>That is what courts have been doing for a long time. The honourable member raised the question at the end of his peroration: 'Tell me about any crooks in effect who have gone to gaol?' I will tell the honourable member about two such persons who went to gaol as a result of an investigation into an organisation called Gollan Holdings which, until its crash, was the largest trading company in Australia. I carried out that investigation and, as a consequence, the managing director went to gaol for 13 years and the financial director went to gaol for 12 years. </PARA>

<PARA> I wish to deal now with one or two other matters which were raised in this amendment. Paragraph (5) sub-paragraph (g) states:</PARA>
<PARA>a requirement that companies disclose all donations for political purposes;</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, that is the old call no doubt inspired by instructions from the Premier of New South Wales. Does that have anything to do with company law? Of course it does not! It has something to do with politics and the political objectives of those on the other side of the House. I turn now to another provision which was referred to in paragraph (5) (c) of the amendment which states:</PARA>
<PARA>the extension of the powers of inspection of the National Companies and Securities Commission to ensure the fullest reasonable access of the Commission to books;</PARA>
<PARA>If honourable gentlemen had examined the provisions in the Act relating to special investigations, and, as I have, had conducted two major special investigations, if they had seen that the provisions that now appear are in fact wider than they have ever been, and if they understood the truly draconic nature of a special investigation, they would not be putting to this House a proposition which either they know to be false or they do not really care whether it is true or false because it expresses a point of view-which is their point of view-that businessmen are the manipulators.

<PARA> Let us look at some of the other Alice in Wonderland assertions that have been made by some honourable members on the other side of the chamber. Firstly, we are told that there has been a delay of seven years and two of those years they were in power. Then we are told that there has been a delay from 1959 to 1981 during which they had a period in power. Lastly we get a period of 10 years. That complete overlooking and that desire to put to one side anything which is against them, illustrate the genuineness of the complaints that they have made. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Herbert (Mr Dean) stated that this was a most comprehensive package of legislation. Indeed, it certainly is. I said earlier that in legislation which was as wide, as complex and as embracing as this legislation is, unquestionably there are areas where one can differ. But what is not conceded by the Opposition is that there is anything good in this legislation whereas in truth it represents a most revolutionary attempt in this country to put forward legislation relying upon a joint Federal-State scheme and co-operation between the States and the Federal Government in the knowledge that, if one does not engage in that kind of an exercise, one will put forward legislation which more likely than not will be struck down in parts because it would not have constitutional power to uphold it. The honourable member for Parramatta said that the Australian Labor Party asserted that there was a certain way to construe the Constitution. No doubt the Labor Party would go ahead and make that assertion to the High Court and it would lose because it is perfectly plain that it cannot maintain such a wide and comprehensive collection of legislative proposals simply under the constitutional powers which, in a divided federal system, are granted to this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at some of the revolutionary aspects of this legislation. For the first time, we have a legislative scheme which embraces the entire area of companies and securities. All of this has been brought forward in one package. This is the first time this has ever taken place in this country. For the first time we find built into the legislation provision for automatic uniformity of amendments. Once they are passed by this Parliament, they flow on to the other States. This was something which was sadly lacking in the 1960 Uniform Companies Act. For the first time we find a permanent ministerial council for companies and securities which will act as a watchdog body with the task of ongoing review of legislation and general oversight and control of the implementation of this legislative scheme. For the first time we find uniform administration of a scheme and general superintendence by the National Companies and Securities Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> These elements are well known although the revolutionary nature of the proposals has not really been appreciated perhaps by the arguments that have been put in this House by those honourable gentlemen on the other side of the chamber. They amount in short to a fundamental change of approach to legislation in this field. The attainment of uniformity of laws and their administration, whilst in itself of great benefit, is not all that is offered by the scheme. Very much more is offered by considerable and detailed alterations that have been made to the code which is before the House. Not a great deal of public attention has been focused upon these matters. Where public attention has been focused on the Companies Act and other legislation, more often than not it has centred on those matters which are thought to be newsworthy rather than noteworthy. </PARA>
<PARA> I will name just four of those matters, one of which has been referred to already by the honourable member for Herbert. For the first time we have a single system of registration of companies, that is, a single incorporation concept. Once a person registers in one State, that person is not concerned with repeating the filing of accounts year in and year out in other States. Secondly, there is a capacity to transfer domiciles of companies. That is a most advantageous capacity for any businessman to have. I will give one example of why this can be deemed to be so. Assume, for example, that one has a business. One carries on that business in the State of New South Wales, through a company structure set up in that State. Let us say that one wishes to transfer that business to the sunnier climes of Queensland. Until now it has been impossible to do that. Once this Bill becomes an Act it will be possible to transfer the domicile of one's company from one State to the other so that once one transfers to the new State one is, for all purposes, regarded as domiciled in that State and the company is accepted in that State. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at something else. There is provision here for the first time for a multi-State scheme of arrangements. That is something to which neither of the Opposition members referred. What does that involve? A scheme of arrangement is simply an arrangement which is entered into between a company and its creditors. It is an arrangement which is supervised by the court. It is made pursuant to court convened meetings. Before the legislation which is presently before the House, if there were assets of a company in more than one State it was necessary to go to each State to have a separate scheme of arrangement. Not only was this highly technical, highly expensive and highly wasteful of funds that otherwise would go to creditors but also it was fraught with risk for the very simple reason that in one State the scheme might be accepted, in the next State the scheme might be accepted but in the third State it might be rejected with the consequence that the whole scheme would fail. It is now necessary to implement the scheme only in the State of incorporation; that is, the State in which the company has its home. </PARA>
<PARA> Lastly, I touch upon another of the improvements that have been made. I have referred to certain improvements in relation to the conduct of specal investigations. Let us look at two items there. First of all, if one looks at clause 296 (12)-honourable members opposite supposedly are interested in improvements but they seemed to be able to find none-one will find that there is a provision there which empowers the inspector, the person who is running the special investigation, to control the conduct of legal advisers appearing in front of him. This is very necessary because at times what takes place is that the legal adviser appearing on behalf of somebody who has been questioned will, by objections or by seeking to advise his client before questions are answered by his client, in effect entirely disrupts the conduct of the investigation. That is something to be avoided and it has been avoided. </PARA>
<PARA> In the same set of provisions we have provisions now for conditions in respect of confidentiality of the transcript of examination of witnesses. That, of course, is very necessary so that witnesses cannot pass round transcripts amongst themselves and get their stories together before they come to the inspector or before they come back to be re-examined. These are areas where the content has been altered, where the law has been improved. There are unquestionable areas where improvement can still be made. This will always be so in an area as complex as this. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me conclude in the time that I have left by correcting something which has been said in the Australian Financial Review and which has been referred to today in passing by the honourable member for Hawker and the honourable member for Parramatta. On 6 May 1981 on the front page of the Australian Financial Review appeared the headline 'Tax Avoidance Lobby's Big Win'. The course of the article went on to refer to trading trusts. The article stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The tax avoidance lobby has had a big win against the new companies legislation with a vital provision making avoidance more difficult being quietly dropped by the Federal Government. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two answers to that. First of all, the history of this Government has been that it has tried at all times and with considerable success to plug tax avoidance loopholes. Indeed, I would think that these could never be called tax avoidance loopholes in any event because trading trusts do not in any way facilitate avoidance in any different aspect to the way in which any other corporate vehicle works. The first point is that this Government has had a record in avoidance which is very hard to beat because it has closed the avoidance schemes. Secondly, the article entirely misconceives the history of the legislation now before the House. The exposure draft of April 1980 contained some provisions concerning trading trusts. They were complex, they were lengthy and they were dropped unanimously-I emphasise the word 'unanimously'-in August 1980. The then Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs in his second reading speech stated:</PARA>
<PARA> A considerable number of submissions were received on these provisions-</PARA>
<PARA>That is to say, the trading trust provisions-</PARA>
<PARA>many of them critical and many raising new issues that had not been dealt with in the exposure draft. After reviewing the submissions, the Ministers unanimously agreed that further work was required to be done on this matter before any legislation could be prepared. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Herbert did in fact refer to that. That should be made perfectly clear to this House. The article unfortunately and, no doubt, inadvertently proceeds upon a complete misapprehension of the basis on which the trading trust provisions were dropped from the legislation and the time when those provisions were dropped from the legislation. This was in August of last year, not just a few weeks ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I have said, the remarks made by honourable members on the other side of the House reveal a certain point of view. That point of view is that businessmen are never right, that businessmen are always wrong, that businessmen are crooks, and that businessmen seek to take advantage of people. That is implicit in everything that was said. It was admitted in passing that there might be some honest businessmen and it was said: 'We would like to see you build up a proper and decent capital market'. But the whole gist of the complaints was to the effect that we cannot trust them, that they will manipulate accounts, that they will manipulate people, that they will run shell companies and take benefits out of those companies, and that they will rob the poor. That seems to be what was being said. That reveals the difference in approach to this legislation between this side of the House and the other side of the House. We would certainly agree that change will have to be made as this legislation evolves. That will always be the case. The situation will have to change in order to meet circumstances as they arise, as new commercial situations have to be met and dealt with. But we proceed upon the basis that businessmen are usually responsible people. We have imposed in this Bill a wide variety of obligations upon businessmen to maintain confidentiality, to exercise diligence, not to take advantage of information that comes to them in confidence and otherwise. We have enclosed them with a variety of obligations which are there for one purpose and one purpose only-the protection of the investing public together with the protection of those who invest in the companies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What was needed was a truly effective national scheme based on strong, uniform legislation to regulate the companies and securities area throughout Australia into the 1980s. But what we have before us tonight is a weak excuse for the regulation of companies in Australia. It is a great pity that so little has come from so much talk, so much time and so much effort. Whilst the Opposition does not oppose this legislation, we are nevertheless reluctant to support these Bills which do not enact substantial reform. Clearly there has been a great need for effective reform in the areas of companies legislation and the Australian securities markets from the time of the Poseidon boom in the 1960s. If we are to believe the optimistic economic assessments of the Fraser Government that Australia is on the brink of a new resources boom in the 1980s then it should be even more important at this time to ensure that effective reform has been implemented. The general public has a right to be protected from the shady practices that we saw in the 1960s and the 1970s. The greatest need in relation to companies and the securities industry is for provisions which ensure effective public accountability.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Rae report of the Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchanges in 1974 has provided us with detailed evidence of some of the worst features of company practice. It also provided us with very strong recommendations on the need for a national scheme to regulate the activities of the Australian securities market and the related activities of companies and their directors. It is worth recalling some of the Committee's findings to remind ourselves of the importance of effective reform to overcome the massive abuses which were uncovered. Volume 1, Part 1, Section 15.1 of that report states:</PARA>
<PARA> We discovered numerous instances of improper practices in the making of new issues and in the distribution. There has been considerable evidence of insider trading, manipulation and other abuse in the stock markets . . .</PARA>
<PARA> In addition to our concern with abuses within the securities market, we are alarmed by evidence of improper, reckless and incompetent behaviour on the part of some of those in control of public companies and investment funds. The investor has too often been exploited by controllers of listed public companies and by managers of investment funds. We are alarmed by the frequency and serious nature of failures to meet appropriate standards of full accurate and timely disclosure . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That is what the Opposition wants reformed and that is what is not happening in this legislation. This Committee recommended the establishment of effective national regulation to overcome the glaring deficiencies uncovered during this investigation. Seven years later we are still waiting for such legislation to be developed. The Commonwealth has the constitutional power to enact legislation for this purpose. Several State governments have initiated some reforms. The general public-the small investors of Australia-have waited patiently. After all this delay one could be forgiven for expecting that the legislation presented would address itself seriously to the provisions of effective reform measures. Instead we find that we have been presented with ineffective, watered-down legislation that will be administratively very difficult to implement. This legislation relies on the concept of co-operative federalism which is a most cumbersome mechanism for implementing effective reforms. What is it, after all, we are trying to deal with? We are trying to deal with a national Australia-wide industry. There is, of course, some doubt that this Government is even interested in implementing effective reform. As the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Moore) said in his second reading speech, this was a matter of 'fine tuning rather than reform'.</PARA>
<PARA> The formal agreement of December 1978 provided complicated machinery to introduce co-operative regulation of the companies and the securities industry-a Ministerial Council, a National Companies and Securities Commission, use of State administrations for implementation of the new arrangements and provision of uniform legislation. Uniform legislation is to be provided by the constitutional device of, firstly, enacting legislation for the Australian Capital Territory and then having that legislation adopted in each State. The problems associated with synchronisation of this whole unnecessary exercise have already contributed to considerable delay. Not only is this legislation extremely limited in terms of providing effective protection for the public, but also it relies for its implementation on the achievement of consensus among other States-a task likely to be more difficult than passing the proverbial camel through the eye of a needle. It is clear that any commitment to effective reform has been shelved by this Government. By delegating responsibility to individual State bodies for the day to day administration matters-receipt of documents and so on-a complicated bureaucratic procedure has been duplicated in each State whereby the interests of the general public have been largely ignored. So much for the Government's commitment to streamlining and efficiency as espoused in the razor gang's review. A far more sensible approach would be to establish a single national scheme with effective powers and reform provisions.</PARA>
<PARA> The package of legislation we have before us has been modified heavily and indicates the success of the powerful lobbying campaigns against the reform provisions. We can see how effective the reform provisions now are by the attitude of the Confederation of Australian Industry, which, as has been reported in the Australian Financial Review today, urged speedy enactment of this modified legislation after having strongly opposed earlier drafts last year. There will clearly be a great deal of work ahead of the Companies and Securities Law Review Committee which was established to assist the Ministerial Council. If this legislation is to provide national regulation of companies and securities, then it is vital that an ongoing commitment to reform be made publicly and that the work of the Review Committee be encouraged. There are many areas for potential reform that have been deferred by the Ministers at this stage-for example, the question of dealers who are members of a stock exchange being prohibited from being directors of public companies, public companies being required to lodge quarterly reports on profit and loss and turnover, an accounting standards review board, and provision of a statutory remedy for shareholders. The list goes on and on. These are all areas of great concern if we are serious about protecting the public from unscrupulous wheelers and dealers.</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has suggested a detailed list of amendments which would greatly improve this package of legislation, and I turn briefly to some of them. Amendment 5 (b) calls for the provision of statutory powers to the courts to enable the lifting of the corporate veil in circumstances such as that where a holding and subsidiary company acts as a unit, and where a private company acts as trustee for a trading trust. An earlier draft of the Bill in April 1980 contained clauses 167A to 167G which ensured that the public knew the entity with which they were dealing. These clauses set out the extent to which nominee company accounts had to disclose assets and liabilities of the trust, and provided penalty provisions for non-compliance. As honourable members are all aware, the setting up of $2 nominee companies which act as trustees for trading trusts means that the persons shown on the register as shareholders or directors are merely nominees or puppets of the persons who operate the trading trust. This means that the real assets in the operation belong to the trading trust and cannot be reached by creditors of the company. Creditors are therefore misled as to the actual ownership of assets standing in the name of the company. Moreover, the concept of directors' duties and responsibilities is eroded by this arrangement. Also, there is doubt as to whether defaulting officers' provisions can apply to officers of a nominee company when its business fails. Again, it is the unsuspecting public which pays the penalty because of inadequate legislative protection.</PARA>
<PARA> Clauses 167D to 167G of the April draft have now been dropped from this legislation. This leaves room for considerable speculation as to whose interests are being protected by the present companies law package. Clause 261 of the Bill tackles to a small degree part of the problem outlined in the trading trust situation to which I have referred. It gives a company power to require information from persons holding voting shares in the company in relation to the beneficial ownership of those shares. The company must enter in its register whether someone other than the holder of the share has a relevant interest, but only after it has obtained this information. However, the clause is limited in its application because it is dependent on the company's seeking information. There is no way in which a member of the public wishing to deal with the company can find out who is the beneficial owner of shares unless the company has already sought this information from its shareholders and published it in the register. Of course, there is no obligation for the company to seek this information, and it is unlikely that many will avail themselves of the opportunity. Thus, this clause is an inadequate substitute for substantial provisions which would regulate the activities of trading trusts.</PARA>
<PARA> Many other modifications and much watering down of the provisions have taken place as a result of pressure and lobbying from many groups with a vested interest in preventing greater regulation and control of their activities. The small investor is no match for the corporate giants in this legal jungle. We cannot rely on the companies and securities industry to regulate itself. This Parliament has a duty and an obligation to the people of Australia to ensure that effective public accountability provisions are implemented. The provision of a shareholders tribunal to provide a legal remedy in the protection of the interests of minority shareholders would be very much welcomed by small investors, but we do not find any provision for that. When we look at the modifications to the director's duty of care that are contained in this Bill we see that this Government appears to have little interest in the small investor. These provisions have been steadily eroded. The earlier draft imposed stiff maximum penalties. Now these have been replaced by a sliding scale providing for the higher penalties to apply only where dishonesty or fraud is proven. This implies that the Government regards the duty of care owed by directors of companies in their management of other people's money as not being of great importance. Most Australians, I believe, would disagree with that.</PARA>
<PARA> In the coming decade many people expect increased economic activity as a result of the resources boom. Now is the time to establish the machinery to create an effective national system for the regulation of the companies and securities industry. The Companies Bill before the House tonight represents too little, too late, and will be a big disappointment for all those Australians who expect a reliable national scheme. This was a great opportunity to enact substantial companies' reform measures, which were obviously needed in the past and which will be even more necessary in the 1980s. It is a pity that this Government has put the interests of narrow sectional groups ahead of the interests of all Australians.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Hawker would know of the difficulty of getting States to agree to any one thing. In the future we will be able to achieve amendments by a majority decision of the Ministerial Council. In doing so, we will be able to achieve some of the reforms that not only honourable members have spoken about but also many people look forward to seeing. I particularly thank the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender), the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Dean), the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown), the honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly) and the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi) for their contributions. They have obviously taken some time out to inform themselves of what is contained in the complex series of Acts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will refer to some issues that came to light during the debate. I do not wish to canvass the question of trading trusts which seems to have been adequately handled. I do not wish to get on to the question of reforms and so forth. I will refer to three simple matters. There is no doubt that the accounts of public companies in Australia vary in standard. I sent for and received in the mail today the report of Conzinc Riotinto of Australia Ltd. That company provides an enormous range of information in its report. This contrasts with a number of other public companies whose annual reports are scanty and certainly do not refer to any of the basic facts which are generally required. It is regrettable that many people who receive these reports do not even read them. Only last Friday I attended an accounting convention at which a very prominent company director said that he felt that many of the glossy reports put out by public companies were nothing less than an ego trip containing photographs about what the companies were doing. He said that the real relevance of the reports was lost. I can only endorse those remarks. I recommend to honourable members that, rather than look at the glossy pictures which is the easy part and therefore the least informative, they look at the notes on the accounts- the small print. This is highly recommended also in regard to prospectuses. The report to which I have referred contains some real information on the company's credit and general standing and shows its contract positions. It also alludes to the remunerations of directors and, more importantly-this brings me to another point which the honourable member for Parramatta raised-the question of small shareholders. </PARA>
<PARA> This company, which is one of our largest and most significant, has 40,655 shareholders. Some 38,466, or just on 95 per cent, have a shareholding of less than 5,000 shares. As a consequence, we need to look at the shareholdings of directors. This is contained in the small print. I have to take issue with respect to this aspect. One thing which becomes very apparent to me when looking at corporate accounts in Australia is the very small shareholding of most directors and particularly executive directors. The report shows that Sir Russel Madigan has 1,030 shares, L. J. Carden has 2,396, Sir Frank Espei, a former executive, has 533 and J. T. Ralph has 587 shares. Those people were all executive directors. On the other hand, one of the non-executive directors had 102,000 shares and another 1,067. Relatively small numbers of shares are held by executive directors these days. That is fairly common. </PARA>

I say to those honourable members who are trying to interject that decrying people's honesty when one does not know much about it does not improve it. I take that stand in that respect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Parramatta raised the question of employee reports. I commend that practice to companies. Far too infrequently is the dialogue between management and employee adequate. In the corporations that I have had association with, the relationship between management and employees has had a very big effect on the performance of those organisations. Certainly, the general efficiency and, certainly, profitability of those bodies have been contributed to by the high level of co-operation and co-ordination between management and employees. I have seen one or two companies put out what I would have thought were pretty reasonable reports to employees. By doing that they contributed to their employees' welfare and certainly their own. I hope more companies adopt that practice. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Hawker made an impassioned speech mainly on strong laws and the need to set those off against, presumably, weak laws. My commercial experience attests that, no matter how hard the laws are, we cannot protect a person from himself. It is a question, therefore, of seeing how relatively effective the laws are and to look at the consequences of those laws. The regulation of an industry is done mainly in ignorance. People do not understand an industry and therefore it is regulated. That is the first thing that is done. Bureaucrats have said to me on numerous occasions that the first thing one does when one does not understand an industry is to regulate it. </PARA>
<PARA> I am a strong believer in the concept of self-regulation. I have been proved to be wrong in certain areas where it has not worked out. I happen to think that that is regrettable because I do not believe that people coming from outside know what goes on within certain technical areas. I apply my remarks particularly to the capital market. I have seen people, whose names are well known publicly, appointed from outside to committees of stock exchanges and, to be realistic, they have not made a major contribution towards the running of those shows. So much for the competence of people from these outside bodies! It would have been better, in my view, if something had been done to upgrade those bodies and enforce what was sought on the participants in the stock exchange or the capital market than to appoint a well known outsider and say: 'We will fix it this way'. It does not work out that way. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Hawker made a most valid point when he asked: 'What is profit?' I recommend the consideration of this question to the Ministerial Council. The question of what is profit has implications far beyond, I think, what the honourable member envisages. It also raises in that context the whole question of current cost accounting and exactly what a company has within its books. This influences where one takes a profit in historical terms, current terms, cash-flow terms, depreciated terms or other terms. This has an enormous impact on the balance of a company. This leads me to another point raised by the honourable member in relation to proprietary companies and the fact that, therefore, they are a credit risk. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the few minutes available to me I wish to refer to the great problem of the extraordinary delays in hearing veterans' appeals by the Department of Veterans' Affairs. I refer particularly to cases of veterans without standing service during the Second World War. The relevant legislation, as it now stands, was introduced in 1979. It has resulted in a great deal more work for the Department of Veterans' Affairs and also for the Repatriation Commission. The work has to be carried out by the same number of employees with the result that the appeals are slipping further and further behind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As an example I should like to refer to the case of Mr Leonard Allworth of Blacktown who was receiving the totally and permanently incapacitated pension. The Repatriation Board cancelled that pension from 17 April 1980 and increased the veteran's 100 per cent pension to the intermediate rate from 17 April 1980. That decision was made on 10 March 1980. He appealed to the President of the Repatriation Review Tribunal on 19 April 1980. The hearing was on 12 March 1981. The Tribunal was satisfied that the additional evidence presented by the Australian Legal Aid Office were relevant to the case and the matter was referred to the Repatriation Commission in accordance with section 107VI (2) of the Repatriation Act. This is as far as the case has gone to date. It is still awaiting a decision. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to refer to another individual who had his case rejected by the Repatriation Commission on 27 November 1979. He lodged an appeal to the Repatriation Review Tribunal on 10 January 1980 in respect of his two disabilities. He was advised on 15 January 1980 that the matter had been referred to the Repatriation Review Tribunal. The case was to be heard on 9 June 1980 but on 19 May 1980 the Repatriation Review Tribunal decided that it would not consider any appeals on vascular disease until such time as the Esprud case had been considered by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> These two cases are examples of massive delays in the hearing of veterans' cases. Some of these cases go back years. It is simply due to the attitude of the Government which altered the legislation in 1979. It has made the whole procedure much more complicated but has not increased the staff numbers to cope with it. This is causing a great deal of undue concern and grief to a large number of veterans. Some of them will not even be alive by the time their cases are finally heard. I think it is well and truly time that the Government did something on this issue. </PARA>
