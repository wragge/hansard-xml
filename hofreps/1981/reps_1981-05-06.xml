<PARA>Proposed Sale of Trans-Australia Airlines</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> Many Australians depend almost exclusively upon Trans-Australia Airlines for the provision of essential air services.</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Liberal Party policy objective of selling Trans-Australia Airlines within 4 years is contrary to the national interest.</PARA>
<PARA> Sale of Trans-Australia Airlines would inevitably result in:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the creation of a private monopoly of major airline services in Australia;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) higher domestic air fares.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House of Representatives will reject outright any proposal to sell Trans-Australia Airlines.</PARA>

<TITLE>Excise on Beer</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The hotel industry in Australia is long-established and a valuable part of the community of this nation, providing places where the people may partake of the three basic needs of life: a place to eat, a place to drink, a place to sleep.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. The hotel industry is accepted throughout the nation as occupying an important place in the social and economic activities of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. The hotel industry is almost entirely within the private sector and makes a large contribution to the government in taxes of various kinds.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. The hotel industry has a need to sustain an appropriate level of turnover and growth, to make profit, and to sustain and improve the level of employment.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. The hotel industry of Australia is gravely concerned at published reports that the Government intends to increase excise charges on beer in the forthcoming Budget.</PARA>
<PARA> 6. Sales of beer constitute the major source of income of most of the industry's 5,811 hotels in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> 7. The very steep rises in beer excise in 1975 and 1978 severely retarded the growth of the Australian hotel industry.</PARA>
<PARA> 8. Any further increases in excise on beer in the 1981 Budget would further retard the industry at a time when growth is essential to maintaining economic viability and the ability to serve the constantly growing needs of the community.</PARA>
<PARA> 9. Such is its significance as a community requirement, beer occupies a place on the Consumer Price Index, and any alteration to its costs to the community would have an inflationary effect.</PARA>
<PARA> 10. Any increase in excise would result in and force the hotel industry to pass on such increases to the consumer by way of higher prices for beer.</PARA>
<PARA> 11. Higher excise would be only the starting point for an upward spiral in beer prices because of the presence of other factors, such as State Licence Fee taxes, which are directly linked to excise rates.</PARA>
<PARA> 12. The hotel industry of Australia already is gravely handicapped by heavy excise and other tax imposts, its growth is at a standstill; and, inevitably must decline if beer excise is increased.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that Honourable Members of the House of Representatives:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Recognise the importance and place of the Australian hotel industry in the social and economic life of the nation.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Accept that the viability of the hotel industry is essential to the maintenance of employment opportunities and stability of the industry is essential to enable it to continue to provide for the hotel needs of the nation in this period of growing population and increasing tourism.</PARA>
<PARA> And further, that Honourable Members of the House of Representatives resist and reject any move to increase excise on beer.</PARA>

<TITLE>Taxation: Child Care Expenses</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> A substantial contribution to Australia's economy by the payment of taxation and to the quality of life of fellow Australians is made by parents in the work-force who have pre-school children.</PARA>
<PARA> Taxation relief for adequate child-care is necessary to enable these parents to avail themselves of child-care facilities in order to take paid employment.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that tax-payers who incur child-care expenses in order to earn income should be able to have those expenses exempt from income taxation in the same way as other tax-payers can deduct business expenses from their assessable income.</PARA>

<PARA> That the level of benefits for all unemployed people, and including people receiving sickness benefits and pensions, be raised to at least 120 per cent of the poverty line.</PARA>

<TITLE>Toxic Shock Syndrome</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned showeth that your petitioners are gravely concerned by the threats to women's health and lives posed by Toxic Shock Syndrome, and urge the following steps to be taken as a matter of urgency:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Tampons, sanitary napkins, vaginal deodorants and similar sanitary products to be re-classified under Therapeutic Agents (not under ''Cosmetics'' as at present), in order to bring them under the scrutiny of the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee. We believe manufacture must be under the strictest hygienic conditions.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) After re-classification, we urge an immediate government-funded inquiry into all aspects of manufacture and content of these products. This must lead to: (i) contents of product and instructions for correct usage to be shown on packaging; (ii) removal of synthetic fibres, chemicals or ingredients that are potentially or actually harmful to users.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Allocation of extra funding for ongoing research by the National Health and Medical Research Council into these products, results of this research to be made public to ensure all health workers and potential users are fully informed. This campaign of public education would necessitate multilingual distribution of the information where appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners, therefore, humbly request that Parliament take immediate and positive action to avert possible threats posed to women's health by implementation of the above measures.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RK4">Mr HAYDEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has the Treasurer's attention been drawn to the report in today's Canberra Times that the Australian Taxation Office has been unable to collect almost $1,000m in assessed tax because of staff shortages and that hundreds of millions of dollars in tax remains undiscovered because of a lack of staff? Is it a fact that each tax investigation officer employed generates revenue for the Government of around $200,000 a year, that is, at least ten times the officer's salary? Is it a fact that, as the Auditor-General's recent report has shown, staff shortages created by arbitrary staff ceilings have cost the Government considerably in terms of lost revenue and reduced control over spending? Finally, how does the Treasurer expect the ordinary pay-as-you-earn taxpayer to believe that legislation such as a revamped section 260 will reverse the clear trend towards tax being optional for the rich when the Government refuses to back up such legislation with the necessary staff to enforce it?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My attention has been drawn to that article. I can describe the figure used in the article only as being quite fanciful and having no basis in fact. Quite obviously, the number of people employed in certain activities of the Taxation Office does have an effect on revenue collections. That is particularly so in the area of the field audit operations of the Taxation Office, which is not concerned primarily with the detection of the sophisticated forms of tax avoidance to which the honourable member's question was directed. As he should know, the detection and countering of that kind of behaviour is more the province of the legislative sections of the Taxation Office and more a function of the rapidity with which tax avoidance schemes can be dealt with by legislation and, in particular, of whether an omnibus anti-avoidance provision such as section 260 can be introduced. In other words, sophisticated tax avoidance is best countered by sophisticated legislative response and does not necessarily depend upon the total number of people employed.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. I am aware of a meeting held last night of shopkeepers operating at the Belconnen Mall, and I understand that over 200 people attended. At the meeting it was resolved that a request would be made to me for strata titles to be issued and for the shopkeepers to purchase the premises they currently occupy. I further understand that a deputation from the Australian Association of Independent Businesses, specifically representing the Belconnen Traders Association, will be seeing me later today. In implementing the Government's decision to sell the Belconnen Mall and to wind up the Canberra Commercial Development Authority, a national consultant from the private enterprise sector is to be retained to advise and assist the Government. The proposal put forward by the honourable member is indeed a most interesting one, and I will be giving it most careful consideration, along with other proposals that no doubt will be coming before me.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BV4">Mr HODGMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am surprised that members of the Labor Party are not interested in this, because it is a very important question in Canberra at the moment. Whilst there is no legal obstacle to subdividing the complex and issuing independent strata titles, I must point out that that would be a most unusual course of action to follow for a major shopping complex. I am informed that nowhere in Australia has a major retail shopping centre been subdivided in the manner proposed. However, I am informed that this has been done in other countries. I indicate that the matter will be given most serious consideration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before concluding, I will make two further comments. In principle it can be stated, and is clearly stated, that the concept of private ownership accords with the Government's philosophy and the motivation behind the decision to release the Belconnen Mall to the private sector. I note the interest of the private sector, of both large and small private enterprise organisations, in the disposal of the Mall. The question of the price per unit, arrangements for management and maintenance of the common areas including escalators, stairs, car parks and pedestrian areas and access to the 172 shops in the complex are all matters which will have to be given the most careful consideration. Lastly, I draw attention to a statement made last night by the Leader of the Australian Labor Party in the House of Assembly. He said that if the Australian Labor Party wins the 1983 Federal election it will immediately repurchase the Belconnen Mall. Once again the Labor Party shows how completely out of touch it is with the real world of private enterprise. The views which it has expressed are totally opposed by the private sector and in particular the Belconnen Traders Association. The decision of the Government to release the Belconnen Mall to the private sector has been overwhelmingly accepted and approved in the Australian Capital Territory.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Health. I refer the Minister to the Hospitals and Health Services Commission's 'Discussion paper on Paying for Health Care', which, like the present Government's new health measures, expounds the user pays philosophy. I refer him also to the fact that the paper isolates higher prices for medical and hospital care as being responsible for over half-58 per cent-of the increase in health expenditures. Does the Minister not agree that the higher costs his announced policy forecasts for hospital accommodation, for transfers from public to private hospital sectors, for health insurance premiums and for reintroduced hospital charges will in fact further escalate the cost of the Australian health care system and that these increased costs will in fact benefit not the consumers of health services but the providers?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="014">Mr MacKELLAR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the House and the people of Australia must be aware that the cost of health care in all modern and developing countries is escalating quite rapidly. This is because of the developments in health technology, medical techniques and the sorts of institutions which are required and which are being utilised. What the Government has sought to do is to make people, both practitioners of health care and receivers of health care, more aware of the total costs in this area. It must not be thought for a moment that the health insurance costs cover anywhere near the real cost of a bed in, say, a public hospital, which cost is averaging between $150 and $200 per bed day, depending on the State. The cost per intensive bed day is naturally a very great deal more. Both State and Commonwealth governments subsidise the cost of health care very considerably. We not only subsidise it by direct payments to the States for hospitals but we also subsidise it-this has been announced-by payments for institutions such as nursing homes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The thrust behind the Commonwealth's approach to this whole problem of cost containment is to ensure that bodies such as the States accept responsibility for their constitutional requirements for the provision of health care-that is the general or public hospital system. It was very clearly pointed out in the Jamison Commission report that in fact there was a duplication of administrative arrangements for public hospitals. Surely, when one body has the constitutional responsibility to administer the public hospital system and the public health system it must and does provide an impetus for that administration to be as efficient and effective as possible. At the same time, if in some way we can bring home to the receivers of health care and the providers of health care the costs of the services that are being provided, then in this way the whole community will have a better idea of the enormous cost of modern health care.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Premiers were not told that. They were told that it was the Government's objective to get into a position where realistic tax cuts would be feasible. It was emphasised that expenditure restraint not just by the Commonwealth Government but by all governments would be necessary if this were to happen in a way that Australians would find acceptable. I think it was pointed out at the Premiers Conference that slightly over 50 per cent of all the dollars finally spent by governments are spent by State and local governments combined. Because of the weight and importance of State and local governments in relation, therefore, to the demands of government on the resources of Australia, their participation, and especially the States' participation, in the program of expenditure restraint is essential if Australia's taxpayers are to get the best possible deal. There is not the slightest doubt that, if the Commonwealth Government acceded to the requests of all Premiers, people's earnings could be paid to the State governments and there would be no need for those earnings to pass through the pockets of the individuals concerned because the governments would absorb the lot. I do not think anyone would regard that as a particularly sensible arrangement-certainly not the taxpayers, who were not even seeing their own income.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At Premiers conferences it is essential for the Federal Government to have very much in mind the interests of Australian taxpayers. At Premiers conferences the Commonwealth is the only government that speaks as though it has those interests in mind, because always there are requests put upon it to spend more funds. There is one Premier, in particular, who a few months ago recommended massive taxation reductions for the Commonwealth.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I daresay he will recognise himself. Those massive taxation reductions either would have been vastly inflationary by increasing our deficit or would have involved massive reductions in government expenditure-much greater reductions than the Review of Commonwealth Functions has been able to achieve. I think it was pointed out at the time, that if Premiers believed there ought to be tax reductions as a result of Commonwealth Government decisions, they would need to bear some part of that burden. At the Premiers Conference we made some progress, as a result of the final decisions, in achieving expenditure restraint, and therefore I believe the policy that we have urged upon the Premiers is intact and on course. It involves greater restraint in the Commonwealth's expenditure and in the expenditure of the States, and I hope that that policy will be followed through in their Budgets later in the year and in our Budget later in the year. All of this is very much in the interests of Australian taxpayers. It is the only way in which to make realistic tax reductions possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having said that as briefly as possible, I might add that half tax indexation does apply from 1 July, and that will cost half a billion dollars. From 1 July those who take out health insurance for themselves and their families at the standard or base rate will be able to claim a rebate for that expenditure in July of the year following that for which the rebate is claimed. Obviously those two things mean a reduction in the taxes that would otherwise be payable. As to other decisions that might be made, we will have to wait and see what is possible after the final expenditure and revenue figures become available to us.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Prime Minister announced in the House the other day, the Australia Post Courier service is to be terminated. It is true that one of the charges of Australia Post is to provide an expeditious mail service. That is a responsibility which all members of the House would expect Australia Post to continue to fulfil. It is a responsibility which involves mails being delivered as soon as possible after they are dispatched to the destination identified on them. I was disappointed to see the letter reported in this morning's Press which suggests that Australia Post has in mind that the new service will be identical to the old. There is a necessity, as I have explained, for an express mail service. To that degree and with articles that are within the ambit of Australia Post's responsibilities, it will remain Australia Post's responsibility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is intended, however, that a range of articles that were previously, as I understood, advertised as being carried by Australia Post Courier will not henceforth be carried. They include articles that, in Tasmania at least, were advertised as being across a wide range of articles and certainly not only those in the more restricted categories-those restricted for postage. The objective being to expedite mail deliveries, I hope that Australia Post looks at the degree to which private contractors can undertake to the maximum the work of speeding these mail deliveries. I do not know whether it was stated in the letter that was apparently written by Australia Post that it intends to extend the contract service. It is certainly the Government's objective to ensure that the private sector participates to the maximum in whatever way it can to ensure that Australia Post pursues and completes its task.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the great importance of regional airlines to aviation generally and certainly to regional areas throughout Australia. I am very concerned that East-West Airlines Ltd, which plays a very big part as a regional airline operating over a fairly vast network, has been going through a fairly difficult time due to a number of factors. The first was the disastrous commercial decision to take over Connair Pty Ltd in the Northern Territory. It has also suffered a downturn in revenue due to the continuing drought over a wide area of New South Wales. It has decided to suspend what was a profitable route, the Alice Springs-Sydney route, that it established some time ago, because of competition from larger aircraft operated by Ansett Airlines of Australia and Trans-Australia Airlines.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, I must say that I was surprised at some of the statements made by the chairman of East-West yesterday. They are misleading in that they allege that the new two airlines agreement will militate against regional airlines. Nothing could be further from the truth. Under the existing airlines agreement there is no definition of any route which is to the advantage of or which will be served by a regional airline.</PARA>
<PARA> Under the new two airlines arrangement the trunk routes and the prescribed routes are defined. They are prescribed in the following way: A regional operator will have the opportunity to operate over what are called prescribed routes in the new agreement. Prescribed routes can be trunk routes or part of trunk routes. Prescribed routes are defined in the agreement as including intrastate routes, intraterritorial routes, from a regional centre to anywhere in Australia, routes over which the airlines operated as at 1 July 1981 and a route over which neither TAA nor Ansett has provided a service at the request of the Minister or to the satisfaction of the Minister. There is no need to consult over the first four of those categories, but in respect to the latter category there is a need to consult with a major airline.</PARA>
<PARA> The opportunity is there for East-West to continue to expand. Indeed, honourable members will recall that Ansett Airlines made an arrangement with Bush Pilots Airways Pty Ltd to take over some of its unprofitable F27 routes in Queensland. East-West claims to have a specialty in handling F27 services. East-West I think would do its cause much good if it were to negotiate with TAA and the other major airline to see whether it can take over some of the routes that the major airlines are not operating efficiently or satisfactorily from their point of view. I hope that East-West will take a leaf out of the book of Bush Pilots which has taken a very bold initiative in Queensland. Rather than grumble and grizzle about a new airlines agreement that has not yet come into force, it ought to get on with the job and run the airline.</PARA>

Third World countries that attended the Bangladesh meeting of agricultural Ministers, which I attended a couple of months ago, drew attention to the fact that they are unable to develop their agricultural programs appropriately because they are getting so-called aid or assistance from the EEC in the form of food and fodder and this is causing a retardation of their agricultural programs.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I address my question to the Minister for Transport. Is it a fact that the Air Hostesses Association has asked the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to ratify a pay increase of $15 a week as a result of the settlement of last week's strike? Is such an increase within the wage indexation guidelines? Are air hostesses becoming too expensive to justify their role as highly paid waitresses? Will the Government consider altering the Air Navigation Regulations to allow safety officers to serve on passenger aircraft in place of air hostesses? Would that allow the airline companies to reduce air fares?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask a question of the Prime Minister. I refer to the Prime Minister's meeting with the Premiers last Monday at which the Prime Minister was able to force the States to accept a cut of $280m in funds from tax revenue for the coming year. I ask: Is it a fact that Cabinet had agreed to limit these cuts in State finances to $210m and not $280m? Does the Prime Minister have any advice on what effect this additional reduction of $70m will have in squeezing State finances and especially on State sponsored employment? Finally, will the Prime Minister assure the House that this windfall saving of $70m, at the States' expense, will now be used to limit the 17,000 jobs his Government intends to abolish under the decisions announced to Parliament last Thursday?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has been the practice of this Government for the Treasurer and the Prime Minister to be given guidelines by Cabinet decision in relation to the negotiations with Premiers at Premiers conferences. So long as it comes out within the guidelines, that can be finally consummated without reference back to the Cabinet. The negotiation with the States was achieved within the guidelines. Obviously there is expressed to the Treasurer and to the Prime Minister a general preference as to the end of the guidelines on which the Government would prefer the negotiations to conclude. What was achieved last Monday was thoroughly in accord with the Cabinet's directions to the Treasurer and to me in relation to that matter. Therefore, there is no question of any additional windfall gain. What was saved was within the expectation of Cabinet when the decision was first made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The last part of the honourable gentleman's question shows again that he fails utterly to understand the basic philosophical difference between the Australian Labor Party and the Government in relation to the management of the Australian economy. With every program that is proposed by the Opposition there is the underlying belief that, if the Government spends more, if the Government spends up big and if the Government puts more people on its own payroll, all Australians will be better off. The falsity of that Labor Party approach was demonstrated in Australia in the early 1970s. It has been demonstrated around the world time and again as countries have got into very great difficulties as the result of big spending governments. At a time when we have been exercising expenditure restraint for over five years now, we have been able to move our inflation rate below the average of our trading partners. The employment growth in Australia over the last two years, of over 300,000, is much more than governments would ever be able to provide on their own account. It has come about because we believe in smaller government and taxes being lower than they would otherwise be, strengthening the Australian economy and thus adding to jobs and growth and the well-being of Australian families. Until the Australian Labor Party understands that there is a basic difference in approach, it will never be able to propose policies that will advance the well-being of the Australian people.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Communications. I refer to the section of the Review of Commonwealth Functions report which deals with Telecom Australia and the suggestion that there is to be a sale to the private sector of functions of Telecom as well as the interconnect market. Is it not a fact that the interconnect market relates to the satellite? Is this a subtle way of saying that the satellite and all its potential will be given over to the private sector? For example, does it mean that the whole of data transmission will now be the business of the private sector? As that is the most profitable sector of the satellite, does it not mean that Telecom will have to increase its charges in other directions?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5E4">Mr SINCLAIR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The interconnect market basically is not the satellite peculiarly, as I understand the definition of the word. All sorts of words are used to define it. It is the add-on market. It is all those bits of equipment that go into the point in the wall of a house, office or installation where the telephone network actually plugs into each of the outlets around Australia. The interconnect market under the current jargon, as I have learned it, covers a whole range of equipment from videotex machines through to teledex and all the bits of electronic equipment, including computers, that are capable of being pinned in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As far as the satellite is concerned, it is the Government's intention that 49 per cent of the body to be established to operate that satellite should be owned by the private sector. The way and form in which that body will function and operate is still to be determined by the Government and is, of course, a matter for discussion with those involved and interested and ultimately for presentation and consideration by this House before it is finally ratified.</PARA>
<PARA> The intention in the Review of Commonwealth Functions report is that where very significant funds are required for the development of this interconnect market a judgment needs to be made as to whether or not those funds might more properly be raised in the private sector and that area operated privately. We see the demand for money to complete the network system around Australia to provide telephones and to provide adequately services that are the monopolised responsibility of Telecom as the prime capital requirement of Telecom. We are concerned that if funds are diverted into all those other areas which might be profitable it will be less possible for the telephone services that must be the prime responsibility of Telecom to be provided adequately. Therefore the decisions taken by the review committee chaired by my colleague the Minister for Industry and Commerce will in fact ensure that Telecom is more adequately able to meet its prime task, not hindered.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of that claim. I listened to it very carefully. I always listen very carefully to views put forward by the honourable member for Gellibrand. They are very instructive on occasions as to where the Labor Party stands on the position of the public sector. Just as he made very clear in his now famous speech to the Labor economists what he thinks of a larger public sector, he again nailed his colours to the mast this morning and said that the Labor Party stands for bigger government. We do not mind the honourable member for Gellibrand doing that as often as he likes. We on this side of the House believe that the national economic need at the moment and the demands of the Australian people are for less and not more government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is no argument in favour of the Labor Party position on the size of government to say that government in Australia is smaller than in other countries. All that means is that many of the policies which are successfully in place in this country are not being emulated sufficiently in other parts of the world. The policies of smaller government which this side of the House has followed so successfully over the last five years have resulted in the strength of the Australian economy becoming the envy of many parts of the industrialised world. It is no accident that the rate of growth of the Australian economy is stronger than the average of the industrialised world. If this is a consequence of the size of our government being smaller than that of the rest of the industrialised world, it is a case for making the size of our public sector still smaller.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last Monday the Fraser Government revealed phase 3 of its plan to dismember the Australian public sector. In the previous week we saw the enactment of the first two phases with the announcement of a further revison to health financing arrangements and the results of the so-called razor gang's efforts in reducing government expenditures. This week we saw phase 3-a severe reduction in funds for the States imposed by the Commonwealth at the Premiers Conference. Of course, these are far from being the first attempts by the Fraser Government to reduce government expenditure, but the extent and implications of these three announcements are such as to mark a change of policy. What we are now witnessing is an attempt to bring about increased privatisation of the Australian economy by dismembering the public sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look more closely at what happened at the Premiers Conference. In doing this we have to rely on newspapers because so far the Treasurer (Mr Howard) has made no statement to the Parliament or produced even a Press statement that I am aware of, or that his office can give my office. For information we have to rely on what has been published in the newspapers. We have to bear in mind the background to the Premiers Conference. It was called to consider the formula to be used in the future for deciding the amounts to be allocated to States by way of general revenue payments. This is one of four forms of payments to the States. These general revenue payments to States are funds to be spent as the States like, which is mostly on recurrent expenditures. Past funding arrangements for general revenue grants provided for a percentage-just under 40 per cent-of the previous year's personal income tax receipts to be paid to the States. There was a guarantee for the four years from 1976-77 to 1979-80 that the States would get no less than the previous formula would have given them. That was a formula which became known as the Whitlam formula. This guarantee was relied on by the States in each of the four years because the percentage of tax sharing would not have given them as much as that provided under the Whitlam formula. In 1980-81 there was only the guarantee that the States would get no less in real terms than they had been given in the previous year. </PARA>
<PARA> Last Monday the States and the Commonwealth were considering the funding arrangements for 1981-82 and future years. As was reported in the papers, it was decided that for 1980-81 a substantial real decline in revenue grants would occur and for 1982-83 and subsequent years there would be a change in the tax sharing base from income tax to total tax receipts. It was decided also that there would be a continuance of the reduced level of payments incorporated in 1981-82 by fixing the 1981-82 payments as a percentage of total tax. If we look at the detail of the real reduction in 1981-82 we see that the States receive an increase of only 9 per cent in general revenue payments. This is an increase of 9 per cent when the inflation rate, as measured by the consumer price index, is 9.5 per cent. That is not the inflation rate relevant to the States in this matter. What is relevant to the States in regard to these kinds of payments is the implicit deflator for Government consumption expenditure because the States spend this money on goods and, in particular, on wages-which account for 70 per cent of expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> The implicit deflator for government consumption expenditure is not running at 9.5 per cent, which is the rate for the last 12 months in the consumer price index, but 13.3 per cent. This is the inflation rate relevant to the expenditures which the States have to undertake with this money. The States have been given an increase of 9 per cent general revenue payments. Therefore, there is a very substantial difference between what was granted by the Commonwealth to the States and the inflation rate faced by the States in respect of those expenditures. Of course the implicit deflator figure could increase even more in the next 12 months as the inflation rate goes up. However, over the last 12 months the rate of increase has been 13.3. per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, of course, there has been an increase in the population. The rate of increase is 1.2 per cent. Therefore we have a 13.3 per cent inflation rate and a 1.2 per cent population increase, which means that the States have to meet an increase of 14.5 per cent in expenditures at the current level of services-and they have been given a 9 per cent increase in general revenue grants to meet this. Obviously, there is an enormous disparity. If there is no further increase in the rate of inflation, there has been a real cut of 5.5 per cent. There has not been a minor 0.5 per cent reduction but a 5.5 per cent reduction in the real grant per head of population. It is a very severe cutback indeed. It is not a minor cutback but a severe cutback which will have severe implications for the operations of the States. I should note in pasing that in addition to that, apparently an extra one per cent was given to compensate for the abolition of some specific purpose grants to the States. Of course, that made the overall increase 10 per cent but, since that was only compensating for cuts in other areas, it cannot really be included in this analysis. If we are looking at general revenue grants we should compare a 9 per cent increase with a 14.5 per cent requirement at the current inflation rate. That severe reduction must be looked at not only on its own but also in terms of the reductions which have occurred in the past. The fact is that this Government has already brought about a substantial, if not severe, reduction in payments to the States over the last five years. </PARA>
<PARA> General revenue grants have been the main growth area in Commonwealth payments to the States. They account for a little under 50 per cent of total payments to the States. Two of the other three forms of payments to the States have fallen in real terms over the last five years. In the last five years general revenue grants have increased in real terms by 19.4 per cent, general capital grants have fallen by 38.6 per cent, specific purpose recurrent payments have increased by 12.5 per cent and specific purpose capital payments have fallen by 54 per cent. In the area of capital payments-that is, general capital grants and specific purpose capital payments-there have been declines of 38.6 per cent and 54 per cent. So, overall there has been a considerable decline in the funds made available to the States. There has been a 6 per cent decline in real terms or, if one takes account of the increase in population of some 6 per cent over that five-year period, there is a decline of more than 12 per cent in real terms per head of population in the payments by this Government to the States. A 12 per cent decline is a very considerable decline indeed, especially when one bears in mind the fact that the payments by the Commonwealth to the States account for 70 per cent of the revenues available to the States. If 70 per cent of the funds available to the States are cut by 12 per cent, quite obviously a considerable reduction is brought about in the capacity of the States to perform. Of course, they have had to cut back in various areas. </PARA>
<PARA> That is only what has happened in the past. In addition to that we have now a new phase in which the major growth area-the area of general revenue grants; the one area which has shown a considerable increase over the last five years-has been reduced in real terms. That reduced rate will be incorporated in the increase in future years. This brings about a whole new ball game for the States, especially as in addition to that they have already been warned that there will be little joy in the other areas of payment apart from general revenue grants. They have been told not to expect anything great to happen-not that they would, on past experience-in the other three areas of payment to them. They have been told that their infrastructure borrowing approvals are likely to be cut back, so they will not be able to borrow as much for infrastructure development. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the decisions made last week in respect of hospital financing arrangements and the razor gang decisions, they have also been given a whole new array of responsibilities which they are expected to fund and which they have been compensated for to only a minor degree in the decisions announced on Monday. So, the States have been given a whole array of messages that their funds will be severely cut. They have been given more responsibilities and less finance and have been told that there will be less finance available in the future. This is all on top of the considerable reduction of 12 per cent in real terms per head of population, which reduction has occurred in Federal funding to them over the last five years. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect on the States of these cutbacks will be severe. Quite obviously the States will have to reduce expenditures or increase taxes and charges, or both. If we were to look at the aspect of reduced expenditures, we should examine the areas where States spend their money. The States spend their money, firstly, on education; secondly, on health; thirdly, on roads; fourthly, on law, order and public safety; and, fifthly, on social security and welfare. They are the five major areas of State expenditures. If there is a severe reduction in the funds available to them, those are the areas in which the cutbacks must be made. Let there be no doubt that this Government is deliberately bringing about, not only through its own direct actions but also through its indirect actions in respect of cutting back funds to the States, further cutbacks in these social infrastructure areas-if one might broadly term it as such-of education, health, roads, law and order and social security. In respect of increased taxes and charges, quite obviously the Government expects there will be some increases in State taxes and charges. The Treasurer said so. On the Australian Broadcasting Commission's lunchtime news broadcast yesterday he was reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> Some price increases and rises in State charges will be unavoidable. </PARA>
<PARA>There we have the Treasurer saying that he expects, as a result of the decisions which he forced on the States, that they will have to jack up their rates and charges. Of course, that will not only have an impact on the people who pay them but also it will have more general impacts which I will come to in a moment. Certainly in the hospital area there is no doubt that the charges will increase. I understand that the States were told by the Commonwealth that they would have to increase their public hospital charges by 60 per cent for public wards, from $50 a day to $80 a day. Whilst the Government has not denied that yet, as far as I am aware it has not affirmed it either. It has been reported and I understand that to be the case. The Commonwealth also expects that the States could utilise stage 2 of new federalism, which will be incorporated in the future arrangements. It allows for the States applying an income tax surcharge. So we could well have, as a result of the Government's decisions, the States applying an income tax surcharge. This means that we would have double income tax. The States clearly are reluctant to impose such a tax but they may be forced into the situation, if these cuts go on, where they have little alternative. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect on the economy generally is that it will cause increased unemployment. About 70 per cent of government recurrent expenditure is spent on wages. If the Government cuts back on that funding obviously it will have less money to spend on wages and so jobs will have to go. We will not just lose the 17,000 jobs as a result of the so-called razor gang's activities, we will clearly lose more jobs as a result of the Government's cutbacks in funding to the States. I ask the House to bear in mind that in the 12 months to April of last year-according to the latest figures which are available, because the Government stopped the publishing of figures which relate to the period after that-one-third of employment growth in the wage and salary earner area came from State government employment. That growth simply will not occur in the future because this Government is ensuring that it will not by cutting back these funds to the States. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously we will get increased inflation from the increased charges which the Treasurer expects to occur. Obviously we will have less economic growth because there will be less expenditure in the government area. At present one of the major stimuli to economic growth is, in fact, the increase in the public sector as occurred in this current financial year. That will clearly not occur next year because of various decisions taken by the Government, including this decision to cut back funding to the States. There are several reasons for these reductions. Firstly, there is the sheer ideological belief by the Treasurer and his cohorts that the public sector is too large and needs to be cut back because of the feeling in their blood that it prefers a larger private sector. That, I think, is the overwhelming motivation which they have. In addition to that, the Government says that the States are doing well. This is obviously a false claim. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government said in a paper given to the States at the Premiers Conference which was held on Monday that the States had been able to increase their services by some 3 per cent per annum per capita over the last five years because that had been the rate of growth in the States' recurrent expenditure on goods and services. Of course, that was only recurrent expenditure. If one looks at the total expenditure and includes capital, one finds there was a mere one per cent growth over that period. Capital expenditure declined by 5.7 per cent in real terms per head over that period. The Government has said that there is physical crowding out, that the public sector is too large and that there is no room for the private sector to grow. The Government does not give any proof of that. As I have said elsewhere and as the Treasurer mentioned at Question Time in reply to a Dorothy Dix question, the fact is that Australia's public sector is one of the smallest in the Western world. Many countries which have much larger public sectors than Australia have shown much faster rates of economic growth than Australia over the post-war period. The size of the public sector apparently has been no inhibition in those countries achieving that. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Government says that there is financial crowding out, that a large public sector causes high interest rates. The fact is that in the last three years the public sector borrowing requirement has declined from 5.7 per cent of gross domestic product to 3.4 per cent. Interest rates have gone up enormously while the public sector borrowing requirement, a factor which the Treasurer said we must look at, has gone down considerably as a proportion of GDP. How does he square that with his argument that we have to reduce the size of the public sector to get interest rates down? Of course, the Government also wants to make room for income tax cuts. There are other ways of providing for income tax cuts other than dismembering the public sector. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This matter of public importance relates specifically to the Premiers Conference and the reasonableness or otherwise of the arrangements settled on Monday for revenue-sharing between the Commonwealth and the States. I wish to spend a little time reminding the House that the purpose of the Premiers Conference last Monday which was convened at the request of the States was to talk about the long term arrangements which will prevail after 1 July this year between the Commonwealth and the States regarding general revenue-sharing. I make it quite clear that the arrangement entered into in 1976 after the election of the Fraser Government, contemplated a review of those arrangements within four years. As a result of an agreement between the Commonwealth and the States last year the arrangements were continued for a further year, with a short term guarantee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I mention that at the outset because some suggestions have been made from various quarters that in some way the new arrangements represent an abrogation by the Commonwealth of the commitments in the agreement entered into in 1976. Plainly that is quite wrong. It was always part of the agreement that the arrangements would come under review. During that review it was open to either party to argue that there should be fundamental changes to the arrangements. I reject completely the charges made in some State quarters that because the outcome of Monday's conference represented a significant change in certain areas of the original agreement in some way the Commonwealth has broken the agreement. Nothing could be further from the truth. In the new arrangements we have continued the concept of revenue-sharing. We have rejected a reversion to the old formula approach which was productive of at least as many arguments in the days when it operated and perhaps more than the arguments which have inevitably arisen between the Commonwealth and the States under the new revenue-sharing arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is fanciful to imagine that we could ever have a Premiers conference in which there was not some level of disagreement between the Commonwealth and the States. If the representatives of seven governments meet around a table and only one of those governments is the provider and the other six are the spenders of the money it is inevitable that the spenders will want more from the provider than the provider feels it responsible or possible to give. That is the truth and the inevitable circumstance surrounding Premiers Conferences. </PARA>
<PARA> We approached this Conference with a desire to see the revenue-sharing arrangements persist. We approached this Conference with a view to achieving a long term arrangment which was workable. Overall we approached it with a view to achieving an arrangement which was consonant with Australia's present economic needs. That means that we approached the Conference having very much in mind the considerations that affected the Government's deliberations in its recent Review of Commonwealth Functions. We approached it, recognising that the demand of the Australian people at present is for less and not more government. If the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) says that the Government is in the business of reducing the size of the public sector then I am quite prepared on behalf of the Governmenmt to plead guilty to that charge. We are concerned to reduce those aspects of the public sector which are unnecessary, unnecessarly expensive, and unnecessarily duplicate the activities of the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> Our commitment to that goal is very firm and very obvious. It has been in evidence very much in recent weeks and was in evidence last Monday. We believe the community need and the community sentiment at present are to have smaller government and to allow individuals greater command over decisions affecting the disposition of the resources that they control and the incomes that they earn. This does not mean a turning of the back upon areas of essential government responsibility. Rather it means turning our back on those areas which involve waste and duplication, turning our back on areas of unnecessary expenditure, applying far more rigorously the principle of directing welfare assistance to those who need the help most. It aids the vulnerable and the weak in our community little if we are to hitch our star to the concept of universal benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> There is nothing antagonistic to the interests of the vulnerable and the poor in this community in the new health arrangements. Rather what the new health arrangements recognise is that there is something quite wrong and something quite indefensible about an arrangement that enables a person, irrespective of income or assets, to walk in to the out-patients department of any public hospital in Australia and be treated for nothing. If that is humanitarian and if that is looking after the interests of the vulnerable in the community, those who argue that have a different concept of need and vulnerability than those who sit on this side of the House have. Because, to the extent that we require people who are able to pay for the provision of services so to pay, government is in a better position to give greater help to those people who really need help. That lies very much at the heart of the sort of priorities that this side of the House has and, of course, lies at the heart of the differences that exist in priorities between this Government and the other side of the House. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said at the outset, the approach that the Government adopted at the Premiers Conference is very much consistent with the approach that we have adopted in a number of other areas in recent weeks. The honourable member for Gellibrand spoke about a figure of 13.3 per cent as being the relevant inflation figure-I do not think I get him wrong-that one has to take into account in order to determine whether we have given the States a fair deal in general revenue payments. I understand that the honourable member chooses the figure of 13.3 per cent because that is the implicit deflator for government expenditure. I say to the honourable member for Gellibrand and to the House that not even the Premiers claimed that 13.3 per cent was the appropriate figure to use. One of the reasons that it is not the appropriate figure to use is that, being the implicit deflator for government expenditure, the base contains as a very significant component of defence expenditure, for which costs are rising at a very sharp rate. So is expenditure and rightly so. It will go up by 7 per cent in real terms next year and it will go on rising until it reaches about 3 per cent of gross domestic product. Everybody knows that defence expenditure is borne totally by the Commonwealth Government. To use in a debate on the reasonableness of the financial provision for the States a deflator that includes as one of its major components an item of expenditure of which not 1c is borne by the States is to use quite the wrong figure and quite the wrong measurement. That, of course, is probably the reason that the States and their representatives, the Premiers, on Monday did not use that figure. I reject the figure given by the honourable member for Gellibrand as being a reasonable bench-mark. It is neither relevant nor appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member talked about the pattern of payments to the States by the Fraser Government over the last five years. When we look at those payments I think we ought to remind ourselves what has happened to the pattern of overall government expenditure during that period. Of course, the levels of payments to the States were very high in 1976 because levels of all forms of government expenditure were very high in 1976 when this Government came to office. The levels had grown on average by about 10.5 per cent in real terms over the previous three years. Of course, payments to the States had been no exception. We inherited an arrangement and we applied an arrangement that involved a guarantee that provided a betterment factor of 3 per cent, that is, a guaranteed increase in real terms of 3 per cent in general revenue payments over the period that that guarantee operated. </PARA>
<PARA> Betwen 1976 and 1980-81 expenditure by the States in real terms through general revenue payments grew by 7.8 per cent, 7.5 per cent, 3 per cent, and 3.6 per cent and 0.3 per cent. That was a consequence of the quite generous arrangements that were adopted in 1976. As long ago as the Premiers Conference last year the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and I both indicated to the States that it would not be possible for us to continue an arrangement that was as generous as that, an arrangement which had enabled most State governments to provide tax reductions in a number of their Budgets during that period. We do not criticise the governments for doing that but we remind them of what we told them, and I remind the House too because it is relevant to the question of whether the States were being treated reasonably during that period. It is also relevant to the sorts of priorities that will have to be applied by the States as a consequence of the new arrangements that have been entered into. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Gellibrand upbraded me for saying yesterday that some State charges may rise. Unlike the honourable member for Gellibrand, I do not believe that it is possible always to prevent certain increases in charges and costs. It is unreal to imagine that one can. Of course, as a consequence of some of the new health arrangements we expect that certain charges made by the States will rise. Indeed, the basis of the arrangements that have been proposed in respect of hospitals is to take into account the assessed revenue raising capacity of the States in the hospitals area. This is not an inflationary approach. This is not an irresponsible approach. Rather it is an approach that recognises, and recognises very directly, certain realities. One of the realities is that services as expensive as health services cannot continue to be provided on the basis that, irrespective of need, they will be provided free. All that does, as I mentioned earlier, is to make available to people in the community who can well afford to pay for the health services themselves the same level of services as are made available to the poor and the vulnerable who are supposed to be the major concern of the people who sit opposite. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the House that the Premiers Conference was a very significant part of the Government's program of getting the balance between the public and private sector in our community into proper perspective. We believe that as a consequence of the arrangements worked out at the Premiers Conference it is within the capacities of States through the ordering of their own priorities to make their judgments because under our federalism arrangements there are fewer tied grants, there is less direction, there is less dictation, there is a lesser emphasis by the Commonwealth Government on its own priorities and there is a greater flexibility on the part of the States to set their priorities and to make their decisions as they should. It has been a consistent theme of this Commonwealth Government to provide the States with a much greater flexibility. That is once again the case in respect of the decisions we have made to absorb certain payments into the general revenue grants to the States. </PARA>
<PARA> This side of the House, this Government, stands for reducing the size of the public sector in a fashion which protects those programs which are needed to protect those in the community who really need assistance but reducing it in such a way as allows individuals to make a greater range of choices over the resources they own and over the incomes that they earn. We have that commitment and we are pursuing that path because we believe that is the economic need of Australia at present. We believe that that is the requirement of the Australian people. We believe that that type of society and that type of approach will more likely provide to the great majority of Australians the sort of incentive and the sort of climate for self-endeavour, self-fulfilment and self-achievement which are the basis of national economic prosperity. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Batman)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(3.40)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is now beginning to face up, or at least it is forcing the States to face up, to the consequences of its own failure. It has simply failed, after five years in office, to produce a consistent pattern of broadly based and balanced growth. Given its commitment to fiscal conservatism, it has now nowhere else to go and it has to cut deeply into the social wage. It has commenced what will be a bitter attack on the people and on the working families of Australia. The trend, of course, has been there. Commonwealth payments to the States have fallen by 12 per cent to 14 per cent over the last five years. Even including infrastructure, there has been a fall of 7 per cent in total funds available to the States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government commenced its term of office in 1975 with an attack on Labor's urban and regional programs which meant severe cutbacks in special purpose grants. It has sought to restrain the growth in Commonwealth spending in fields such as social security, health, public housing and education. In each of those areas, all crucial to any notion of equity on welfare in the community, it has not sought to reduce overall costs but simply to reduce the Commonwealth's responsibility. The aptly named razor gang is now on about a more profound savaging of those programs and, in some cases, their elimination as national programs. Through the cutbacks in general revenue grants it is seeking to ensure that the States slash programs in the area of the social wage while pressing them to introduce as widely as possible the user-pays principle, which will mean that those who can afford to pay for services will get them, those who cannot either will not get the services or will get them in an emasculated and depreciated form. </PARA>
<PARA> The savageness and insensitivity of the Government's action will shock many, but not us. We know from bitter experience that the Government is led by people whose experience is limited to the public schools, elite clubs, squatters' balls and corporate boardrooms. It is backed by a back bench of half-baked Friedmanite pseudo-economists who have been encouraged by restrictions to speaking engagements at blue-rinse-set socials and Apexian seminars, where novelty is required more than any serious contribution to economic policy. Indeed, it is the lack of a firm policy base for these cost cutting proposals which must cause thoughtful people the most profound concern. There is little feeling in the coalition party room for the consequences of the Government's decisions. There is little feeling for the problems which have arisen and which will arise in relation to the restructuring of the Australian economy around a renewed emphasis by corporate investors, if not by the Government, on resource development and the development of high technology industries. </PARA>
<PARA> It does not appear to be recognised that while long term gains may flow from this restructuring, there are certainly short term and will be future long term costs. It is the short term costs which have caused the Government to move towards such draconian measures. The Commonwealth, which has been unable to encourage economic growth, and therefore growth in revenues, at a fast enough rate, is now setting out to eliminate or reduce social programs. Having already encouraged the view that we are not one nation but a mere collection of States, it is seeking in two principal ways to shift the burden of the current transition onto the States. Firstly, it is seeking to move financial responsibility to the States for higher taxes; that is, it is seeking to press the States to take on the odium of double taxation. Secondly, it is seeking to give the States the responsibility for more of the welfare bill or, alternatively, for reducing social expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> The States certainly cannot win in these circumstances, and the people will lose, whatever the States try to do. But after all, the name of the game is to ensure that people are forced to reduce their standard of living without their being able to point to this unpopular Government as being responsible. Thus the States will continue to be given assistance in areas of physical infrastructure and support for the corporate sector. However, they will have funds reduced which would enable them to maintain basic housing, education, health and transport programs. We ought not for a moment buy the rubbish we have just heard from the Treasurer (Mr Howard) about how these programs will not turn on the question of basic services and basic equity in the community. These proposals are about inequity. If they are accepted by the Australian community we will be accepting a concept of two Australians, and we ought to recognise that. </PARA>
<PARA> One should not attempt to see any rationality in this program but rather the rationalisation of political opportunism. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), in political trouble, is implementing a program which he believes will save him and his Government. The reality of the cutbacks, as the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) has pointed out, is quite clear. Under general revenue grants, real cuts of the order of 5.5 per cent will be achieved in the next financial year. Many social programs will be affected, but let me single out some of those for special attention. Firstly, let us take health. In this area the Government has granted the same level of funding in real terms for the next financial year, less the amount the States could be expected to collect from the introduction of user charges for people in in-patient and out-patient facilities. This means that patients will have to pay or get into expensive health insurance schemes. Insurance premiums will go up because the States are being forced to increase their charges at the behest of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> The States are being pressed by these measures to move towards a rationalisation of hospital programs, particularly in the public sector. On the other hand, increased subsidies for private beds will mean that the States will see private beds increasing while public beds do not increase and, in fact, decrease. Furthermore, the Commonwealth funds will come through in a way in which the States will have to choose between the funding of hospitals and the need to take responsibility for community health centres, school dental programs and other community programs. This difficult choice will be compounded by the greater pressure which can be exerted by high technology hospitals against the much weaker community health and dental health programs. In addition, the States are to get the full responsibility for much of public health, including occupational health. The Commonwealth will transfer to the States the Commonwealth Laboratories' responsibility for many of the testing facilities at Commonwealth level and for a number of public health programs. Finance will be reduced even for a road safety program. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the area of education will be sharply affected by the razor gang proposals. Not only will it be affected by the reduction of funds for school capital works but also it will be fighting for funds from necessarily reduced State Budgets. The partial demolition of the Schools Commission will mean that resources will be lost for curricula planning, assessment of needs of schools, and the maintaining of some equity between the public and private sectors of education. The States are being forced to rationalise territory education or pay for it themselves, particularly in the area of colleges of advanced education. State members will have to pay the political price, not the members of this Government. The elimination of schools of engineering is staggering in view of the Government's commitment to resource-based development, and the rationalisation of teacher education is being carried out in a way which absolves the Commonwealth from the responsibility. There is considerable debate about what the demand for teachers will be, with shifting demographic patterns, and there is no question at the present time, at least in Victoria, that many more teachers could be helpfully employed if needs-based staffing were introduced. In areas such as education the States have already been involved in activities designed to rationalise. We will have a reduction in the quality of education which will take us back rapidly to the darkest days of the 1960s. Again, Australia is on a path different from that of almost every developed country. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area which over a number of years has felt the sharpness of the razor is the area of public housing. Net payments to the States, expressed in 1980-81 prices, have seen a dramatic decline since the Fraser Government was elected. Net funds have fallen from $515m in 1974-75 to $75m in the current financial year and will fall still further in the next financial year. As was pointed out by the Victorian Minister of Housing, Mr Kennett, total State repayments are likely to exceed the grant from the Commonwealth for the first time this year; that is, the States will be paying back more to the Commonwealth than they will actually receive. They will have no net money from the Commonwealth to spend in terms of meeting current housing needs. One could go on to talk about transport and the absurdity of a Government which is getting $3 billion from oil revenues cutting out the urban public transport grants which might do something about energy conservation within Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Essentially, what the Fraser Government is on about is making Australians the peasants of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. We are going to have the worst living standards in the developed world. The Treasurer shakes his head, but of course the Government is cutting out the compilation of the statistics which will enable us to measure these things. In terms of school retention rates, we have an appalling record. We have the lowest public housing sector of any country in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. No Federal government in the world is currently placing less emphasis on urban public transport in the face of the energy crisis than this Government is. In terms of health, we are being taken back to the 1950s. The Australian people will not put up with it. Members of the Government parties, wherever they go in Australia, will find increasing hostility. The Prime Minister will be swept out. I believe the whole of Cabinet will also be swept out because what they are doing is outrageous. </PARA>

I congratulate the honourable member for Batman on his contribution to this debate, because he has done more than many of his colleagues to ensure that this Government stays on these benches for years to come. I cannot let go by the opportunity to make passing reference to the fact that the honourable member for Batman refers to this Government attempting to make Australians the peasants of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. We only have to look at the record of what this country is achieving in terms of any standards of the OECD to realise that the policies of this Government, on any standard are taking Australia far in front of those countries with which we choose to compare ourselves. If we look at the situation that existed in 1973, 1974 and 1975, we will see that that Government of which the honourable member was a party was using the international situation as an excuse for the disastrous performance on the part of Australia at that time. This Government is demonstrating not only that we are able to do as well as other countries but also that we can do better. Under the Whitlam Government we did not do as well but worse than other countries. That is the reality of the situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This morning the Opposition spokesman on these matters said on the radio that the Australian Labor Party stands for bigger government. He said that as recently as this morning. The story does not change because Commonwealth outlays doubled in a couple of years under the Whitlam Administration, and tax went the same way. I remember a very interesting interview with the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr Whitlam, who subsequently became Prime Minister. He was asked: 'How will you finance your programs and your promises, Mr Whitlam?' He answered: 'By the inflationary growth in taxation'. That is the philosophy that the Labor Party has been following ever since, and it is the only bankrupt philosophy that it has been able to put forward in the last couple of election campaigns and in debates such as we are engaging in today. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian people have had enough of big government, big taxation, and government interference and regulation in the lives of individuals and corporations. This Government is rejecting the Labor Party's philosophies and the Australian people are backing this Government. We only have to look at the opinion polls that came out today to see exactly what is happening in the community. The Labor Party is out of step and it ought to understand that. The philosophy of this Government is clear. It is the philosophy expressed by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) to the South Australian Liberal Party before Christmas. We are now seeing this philosophy being implemented. It has taken us five years to do so but the disruption that was caused between 1972 to 1975 meant that we had no option but to tread softly and to implement change cautiously. However, we are implementing it and we are now starting to see the benefits of it. </PARA>
<PARA> Three major decisions were made last week. I regard last week as one of the watersheds of Australian economic management. Changes were announced on the matter of health, the Review of Commonwealth Functions made its report and decisions were taken at the Conference. Brilliant decisions were made on those occasions, decisions that the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and the Government can stand proudly behind because they are the sorts of decisions that will put this country right on the road to recovery and keep it way out in front of all these profligate spending socialist economies with which the Opposition wants us to compare ourselves. </PARA>
<PARA> We must reverse the process of the late 1960s and the early 1970s whereby governments used the power of the purse to buy into areas of traditional State responsibility-areas such as health, transport, education and housing. The theory then rife was that there should be standardisation and not differences among the States.The Australian Schools Commission is the greatest example of that. The theory was: 'Let us not have any competition among the States. Let us impose a common standard on all the States and make sure that every school achieves the same standard and does not get beyond it'. I reject that proposition, and I believe this Government rejects it. We must remove duplication and Commonwealth interference in areas for which we have no constitutional responsibility, other than through the back door of a section 96 grant. For my money the smaller the section 96 grants and the bigger the revenue sharing grants, the better I like it. The Government is moving in that direction and that is the way in which it should continue to move. That is the way in which we will achieve the sort of growth that we need in this country-not with the dead hand of governments trying to direct people, not with the dead hands of bureaucrats in ivory towers trying to determine where every dollar of the taxpayers money is to be spent. </PARA>
<PARA> We must remove waste, where waste is defined as expenditure for which there is no justification in terms of need. Any government is expected to respond to needs, not to wants. The Opposition's hand-out mentality is that all one has to do is to ask for something and big brother government will hand it out. I reject that and the Government rejects that. It is about time the Opposition came to its senses and realised that the people are fed up with that philosophy. We must clear the way to reduce the level of taxation by eliminating duplication, waste and unnecessary government involvement in the economy and in the market-place. This Government is taking the right steps along that path. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Treasurer so rightly stated, we must get the right balance between the Government's share of the gross domestic product and that of the private sector. We must provide room in the economy for the private sector to grow. Governments have no money. They have only the money that they take from people. The more money they take from people, the less money people and businesses have to invest and spend according to their priorities. The influence of the Labor Party in the Federal sphere and in the State sphere has been throttling this economy over the years. The revenue forgone by this Government, following a long series of reductions in taxation over the last five years, is a significant amount of money, and it must continue to be a significant amount of money. We must give people responsibility for spending their incomes. What reason for incentive is there if people work harder and governments of the philosophy that the Opposition aspire to and espouse take that money and tell them that they know better how to spend it. I would have preferred a full restoration of the economy before any tax cuts were made, but I give credit to the Government for achieving both at the same time. It is one of those occasions on which I was wrong and the Government was right. </PARA>
<PARA> The States have a responsibility to play their part in this process. In the past they have just not done so. They have had real increases in their expenditure every year. The States must examine their activities, as the Federal Government has. They must reduce their Public Service, as the Federal Government has. They must accept their constitutional responsibilities and not hide behind the Commonwealth apron-strings and the section 96 grants. The States must accept the odium of raising funds if they want to take the credit for spending funds. There is no doubt whatsoever that the States were fat after the years of Whitlam profligate spending and they have not reduced their spending. As I said, they have had real increases every year and have gone into even further extravagances as is evidenced by the incredible situation in New South Wales, which I know the Minister at the table is as violently against as I am, having been involved in political organisations. The New South Wales State Government is whinging about the amount of money it is getting from the Federal Government and yet it is introducing legislation into its Parliament to provide for the public funding of elections. If there is one thing that is the paragon of privacy and of freedom of the individual it is the way he votes in an election for the party of his choice. Yet there will be a situation in New South Wales, at least, where the public purse will determine payments to political parties for elections and for party political purposes.

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The main purpose of this Bill is to amend the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act 1975 to incorporate in that Act the new provisions of the revised General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade Anti-Dumping Code and the GATT Subsidies and Countervailing Measures Code. These codes were included in a number of understandings reached in the Tokyo round of the multi-lateral trade negotiations concluded in December 1979. The Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act 1975 is based on the principles and requirements of the original GATT Anti-Dumping Code. Australia acceded to that Code in 1975. The Government announced on 25 June 1980 that Australia should accede to the revised GATT Anti-Dumping Code. This decision took into account the views of State governments, industry associations and other interested groups within the community. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill contains the minor amendments which are necessary before Australia can accede to the revised code. The amendments empower the Minister to accept undertakings from exporters to raise their export prices to undumped levels. Retrospective dumping duties may be imposed where the undertakings have been violated. The amendments also include additional criteria for assessment of normal values of goods in countries where the Government substantially influences domestic prices. Other amendmenets are based on measures contained in the Subsidies and Countervailing Measures Code. Principally, they empower the Minister to accept undertaking by governments of the exporting country to offset the effect of any subsidy and to impose retrospective countervailing duties. They also include additional criteria for determining the amount of subsidy in the case of goods exported from countries where the Government substantially influences prices. </PARA>
<PARA> No final decision on the question of Australia's accession to the GATT Subsidies and Countervailing Measures Code has been announced. However, the proposed amendments are desirable in themselves. The Government is of the view that the amendments will strengthen the powers to protect Australian industry against any injurious effects of subsidised imports. The Bill also proposes further amendments designed to remedy deficiencies which have become apparent during administration of the Act since 1975. These amendments are technical and modify both dumping and countervailing provisions. They are expected to enhance the Government's ability to protect Australian industries against dumped or subsidised imports. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA>This Bill is associated with the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill 1981. Its main purpose is to amend section 45 of the Customs Act 1901 to vary the time for which the Customs may retain securities taken for the purposes of the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act. The amendments are consistent with the provisions of the revised General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade Anti-Dumping Code and the GATT Subsidies and Countervailing Measures Code. Both Codes provide for the taking of securities as provisional measures pending finalisation of inquiries into allegations of injurious dumping and subsidisation. To conform with the Anti-Dumping Code the provisions of the Customs Act 1901 will need to be amended to allow securities to be held for a period of four months and for the period to be extended to six months if so requested by the exporter of the goods. For the Subsidies and Countervailing Measures Code the period of retention is extended from three months to four months. I commend this Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1981 now before the House proposes amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1966. The Bill, which contains 18 schedules, is necessary to enact tariff changes which have been introduced into the Parliament at various times since May 1980, by Customs Tariff Proposals Nos. 8-20 (1980) and Proposals Nos. 1-5 (1981). In the main, the amendments give effect to decisions by the Government in respect of the following reports by the Industries Assistance Commission and the Temporary Assistance Authority: Apples and Pears; Certain Goods Made From Carbon or Graphite; Certain Soft Sided Containers; Certain Works Trucks and Stackers; Cheese; Chemical Products (Part B); Continuation of Assistance for Insulators; Crushing or Grinding Machines; Electric Motors, Generators and Rotary Converters; Fluorescent and Filament Lamps; Gearboxes, Gears and Shaft Couplings; Iron and Steel Industry; Manufactured Tobacco; Metal Cans and Canisters of Iron or Steel; Musical Instruments and Parts and Accessories Therefor; Polymeric Plasticisers and Certain Polyester Polyols; Tanned and Finished Leather; Dressed Fur; and Textiles, Clothing and Footwear. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members will recall that when the tariff proposals were introduced into the House, a comprehensive account of the IAC's recommendations and Government decisions were outlined each time. Other amendments contained in the Bill provide for: Amended tariff preference rates for certain goods from developing countries; changes arising from Australia's commitment to the South Pacific Regional Trade and Economic Co-operation Agreement; and the addition of certain goods to Schedule A of the New Zealand-Australia Free Trade Agreement. The only amendments not already included in the proposals make provision for the removal of all remaining preferential rates for goods from United Kingdom and Ireland with effect from 1 July 1981 and for some changes of an administrative nature. A summary of amendments for each schedule setting out the nature of the changes has been prepared and copies are available from the Table Office. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is an important Bill which extends and expands Australia's contribution to industrial research and development; and, one might add, not before time. A fundamental contradiction runs through the legislation. We, on the Opposition side, award it the sound of one-hand clapping, so far as it goes; but it does not go far enough. The Bill is grossly inadequate in scope. As I will indicate later and as will be eloquently put by the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi), the Bill's timing is very odd. It utterly contradicts the philosophy which was set out last Thursday in the report of the 'Razor Gang'. There are an extraordinary number of inconsistencies in the legislation. The Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Thomson) has indicated that the purpose of this legislation is to encourage industrial research and development. The Minister in his second reading speech said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Funding has risen from $14m in 1977-78 to $54m in 1980-81-nearly a four-fold rise within three years, despite the need for continuing expenditure restraints. </PARA>
<PARA>Actually if we take the factor of inflation into account it is more like a 2.7 increase. The sum is equivalent to $37.8m in 1977-78 dollars. The Minister went on:</PARA>
<PARA> The rationale for government assistance rests on the proposition that there are disparities between the private and national returns from research and development expenditure. The market--</PARA>
<PARA>These are the Minister's words, not someone from the Labor Party-</PARA>
<PARA>does not provide enough incentives for firms to undertake research and development. The result is a national under-investment in industrial research and development and a tendency for firms to concentrate on relatively short term industrial research and development. The fundamental purpose of the program is to correct this market failure. </PARA>
<PARA>We applaud what the Minister said. The Minister went on:</PARA>
<PARA>Against this background, the Government has decided that, in future, an industrial research and development project will be supported only where it involves a substantial degree of risk or where a firm is unable to gain enough of the profits generated by the industrial research and development to justify the project. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister went on:</PARA>
<PARA>To compensate for inflation as well as to strengthen the incentive to firms to undertake the industrial research and development, the Government proposes to increase ceilings from $500,000 to $750,000 per year for project grants and from $25,000 to $40,000 per year for commencement grants. The grants will remain taxable. </PARA>
<PARA>So the Government gives with one hand and takes away with the other. If we look at that famous document, the ministerial statement entitled Review of Commonwealth Functions, then look to see what has happened to the Department of Science and Technology and look in particular at attachment C which sets out the number of Commonwealth bodies which are to be abolished, we find that of the 18 bodies that are to be abolished 11 belong to the Department of Science and Technology. They include such areas as the Information Technology Council, the Advisory Committee on International Scientific and Technological Activities, the Australian Inventions Advisory Committee and the Technology Transfer Advisory Board. When we go back to other parts of the 'Razor Gang' report we find that there will no longer be a science adviser within the Department of Foreign Affairs-one of those listening points where we might expect to get information which could be brought back to our national advantage. Australia's scientific participation in the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation, for example, where there is a lot of information to be had, is to cease. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the provision under the Defence Department we find a Government decision in respect of defence science, research and development for direct Commonwealth involvement to be reduced. The private sector and universities are to be encouraged to perform activities. With what? When there has been an enormous cut-back in expenditure at the tertiary level, on what does the Government expect them to carry out these prodigies of research in defence when notoriously such research is extraordinarily expensive? We find somewhere else under the rationalisation of colleges of advanced education in the education sector that an amount has been earmarked to rationalise activities for the expansion of technological and business studies. How much do honourable members think the Government has offered? The amount is $5m. The Government is really big-hearted. Its argument normally is 'leave it to the market'. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of the very high-minded objectives that have been outlined by the Minister for Science and Technology in all candour and honesty, because he is perhaps the most candid and honest of the Ministers that we have in the present Government, have been destroyed or prejudiced by the 'Razor Gang'. It is virtually the old Department of Productivity which has been eliminated with the Department of Science and Technology. All the functions that were related to the former Department of Productivity have gone. These functions were very significant because they are the very parts of the Government which might have enabled Australia to assist its fight-back capacity, to assist us to move into high technology areas. </PARA>
<PARA> There are extraordinary inconsistencies and contradictions between what the Government says and what it is actually doing. Sometimes it is hard to tell whether the Government is following the ideas of Milton Friedman or of Marty Feldman. The Government says that it has based its legislation partly on the report of the Committee of Inquiry into Technological Change in Australia. I think the CITCA report showed the lowest level of intellectual vitality of any report put out, even by this Government. This intellectually disreputable report dodged every major issue, particularly on questions of technology transfer. In the technologically advanced world there is no country as disadvantaged as is Australia. The starvation of education and research by the Fraser Government is condemning Australia to third rate status in the technologically advanced world. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's future stability and development as a technologically advanced liberal democracy are already threatened by five factors: First, the prevailing lack of intellectual vitality; second, a contracting education base; third, an inadequate investment in research and development; fourth, absence of a entrepreneurial spirit; and fifth the absence of risk capital for new ventures. The Parliament is poorly informed on matters relating to science and technology and the media expresses total disinterest in the discussion of new ideas. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KH4">Mr BARRY JONES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, but we are on the wrong side of the House. Parliament has retreated into an embarrassed silence on the social impact of technological change, indistinguishable from a catatonic trance, but the media has never noticed or taken the matter up. I have referred several times lately to biotechnology which seems likely to be the area of greatest economic potential in the 1980s. Australia could make a major contribution in this area. Nevertheless, the subject has been almost totally neglected. Senior Ministers of this Government feel no shame at their total ignorance. I point out, for example, the recent report on the Australian Research Grants Scheme for 1980-81. The Australian Research Grants Committee will no longer exist in its present form. It is to be merged with the Queen Elizabeth II Advisory Committee, although what it advises Queen Elizabeth II on is not really clear. I notice in the provisions for grants approved for 1980-81-the total expenditure provided is $16m-in the areas that might be related to the biotechnology industry, including work on recombinant DNA, the total is $59,395. This is less than $60,000 for an area which will be perhaps the most dramatic area of economic growth in high technology for the 1980s.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I point out to the House the very close relationship between expenditure on education and the quality of research and development. It is a matter of profound concern to the Opposition that Australia has a very poor performance in expenditure in research and development, although the primary culprit is the private sector rather than the government. Government expenditure relatively speaking is far higher than private sector expenditure. Here we have what is described as a private enterprise government and we find that private enterprise is dragging the chain. Very few technologically advanced countries have such a small proportion of total gross domestic product directed from the private sector towards research and development. There are obvious reasons for that. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a fundamental contradiction between the expressed goals of the Government and what is actually happening in the area of research and development. I want to set out these two fundamental principles. The first is that in manufacturing and information based industries Australia cannot sell what it does not own. In industrial research and development areas the commanding heights are overwhelmingly not in Australian hands. In trying to get an internationally competitive motor industry in Australia it is necessary to ask whether it is possible to sell what we do not own. To what extent for example, is there Australian ownership in the motor car industry? I strongly urge those honourable members who have not read that very important book by Sir Laurence Hartnett Big Wheels and Little Wheels to do so. He tells the real horror story of the selling out of Australia's own car. There was an intention to produce a car using Australian intellect, capacity and human resources but in fact it was sold out completely. </PARA>
<PARA> What do we find in the Australian motor car industry? General Motors has 100 per cent overseas equity, as do Ford, Chrysler, Leyland, Nissen, Volvo and Renault. These are the firms which manufacture or assemble in Australia. Australian Motor Industries Ltd has 50 per cent Australian equity and is the only area where Australia has a share. It would be necessary to ask General Motors or Ford: 'What is the prospect for intensive work in research and development in this country?' They would argue: 'But what is the purpose of doing such research and development here? We are an international corporation. If we can get the research and development done on the Commodore car in Germany, and essentially we are using the German car as a prototype for the Commodore, what would the purpose be and to what end would there be independent Australian research and development?' That is the tragedy of the situation here in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The second proposition I want to make is that Australia cannot have a dynamic economic expansion in areas dependent on research and development if it has a shrinking educational base. It is not possible to expand and contract at the same time. I draw the attention of the House to the very disturbing figures which appeared in the last Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development economic report on Australia published in 1980. It is possible to extract from the report a table of full time school enrolments of 15 to 19-year-olds. I seek the leave of the House to incorporate the figures in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. I point out that in the United States 73.7 per cent of 15 to 19 year-olds are in full time enrolment. In Japan the figures is 70.9 per cent and in Switzerland 70.1 per cent. Australia is No. 14 on the list with only a 45 per cent involvement in full time enrolment. I put it to the House that it is quite impossible for Australia to develop the quality of life and level of imagination and invention to be found in other countries unless it develops a higher quality of education.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I draw the attention of the House to a very important document which has been insufficiently examined in the House. It is the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment entitled 'Industrial Research and Development in Australia' which was published in May 1979. The Committee made this comment on page 227 that:</PARA>
<PARA> Sometime during the last ten years, Australian Industry lost its entrepreneurial drive. Throughout the inquiry, witnesses remarked that while Australian managers recognise the value of conducting research and development activities, they are overall, reluctant to take financial risks. They lack what may be termed entrepreneurial spirit. Several witnesses said that they saw management's attitude to research and development as 'timid and parsimonious', generally lacking the confidence and long-range planning necessary for a sustained investment in research and development. One witness went so far as to call this caution 'a national characteristic'. Another witness observed that, while Australian investors had distinct tax advantages over their U.S. counterparts (U.S.: 50% capital gains tax, compared to Australia . . .) they are still reluctant to commit money to ''risky'' enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee also made this point on page 301:</PARA>
<PARA> It is generally accepted that the development phase of any innovation is the most costly, requiring 5 to 10 times initial research costs. From this it follows that there is little economic sense in spending $1 million on a research project unless there is a reasonable hope of obtaining a further $10 million to carry the project through development to commercial fruition. It is at this point that application of our native Australian inventive genius fails. The relative figures for 1976-77 of 44 per cent GERD to applied research compared with 25 per cent for experimental development reflect this dismal fact. </PARA>
<PARA>I point to the fact that notwithstanding the television programs The Inventors and What Will They Think of Next Australia has in world terms a comparatively small number of patents granted. There are two standard tests: One is the number of patents granted per million population each year and the second is the number of patents granted per thousand million dollars of GNP.

However, I draw the honourable member's attention to the Australian Bureau of Statistics publication 'Research and Experimental Development-Private Enterprises-1976-77', which provides the following information for that year: (a) total payments made for patent royalties were $37.363m; (b) total receipts for patent royalties were $4.599m. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Science publication 'Project Score' gives for 1973-74 the figure of $76.98m as the purchase of rights to technical know-how (e.g. patents licences and royalties) by the business enterprise sector. No figures were given for receipts. </PARA>
<PARA> For the year 1976-77, the figure given for all sectors is $67.3m for the purchase of technical know-how and $10.9m as receipts from the sale of technical know-how. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. In 1978 total patents granted numbered 9,038, of which 8,337 were granted to overseas owners. In 1979, 6,479 patents were granted, of which 6,012 were granted to overseas owners. Australians are in a very dependent position. In terms of technology transfer we are essentially part of the Third World. That is a national scandal. Some 94 per cent of Australia's payments in 'know-how', that is to say payments on royalties, goes overseas. For all practical purposes we are a technological colony of the United States and Japan. On the basis of what happened with the 'Razor Gang' I think the Fraser Government includes economic Quislings who have sold out our technological sovereignty or who, even worse, are indifferent to the question of our technological sovereignty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I mentioned earlier, I am concerned about the contraction of Australia's educational base. The report of the Williams Committee of Inquiry into Education, Training and Employment, which was discussed for a bare 40 minutes in this House in 1980 suggested the extent of the contraction of Australia's educational base. It found that in New South Wales, the State of the honourable member for Berowra (Dr Edwards), 17 per cent of school leavers were not able to read or could read only 'at a level below satisfactory comprehension of simple passages', and a further 32 per cent read 'at levels of comprehension below the levels required for a fully literate adult life'. This revelation by the Fraser Government's own committee has been received with massive indifference. I ask the Minister how Australia can expect to compete with nations that are ahead of us not just in the number of patents they have but also in the development of technology which we do not have the educational base to develop. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA> 'whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) expresses its concern at- (a) the low level of Government investment in research and development compared to other technologically advanced nations;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the failure of the Government to encourage significant private sector investment in research and development;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the low level of Australian innovation as measured by the number of patents taken out each year by Australian individuals and companies;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) the failure of the Government to stimulate Australian innovation in electronics, biotechnology and other high technology industries, and</PARA>
<PARA> (e) Australia's disadvantageous position in relation to technology transfer;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) condemns the Government for losing national control over significant industries based on high levels of research and development, including motor manufacturing, electronics, the computer industry and petrochemicals, and</PARA>
<PARA> (3) rejects those parts of the report of the Review of Commonwealth Functions (the 'Lynch Committee') which eliminate or downgrade Commonwealth instrumentalities concerned with the collection, dissemination and application of information about high technology in industry, thereby reducing Australia's fight back capacity in high technology areas'. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, the Lynch Committee is genially known, even by itself, as the 'Razor Gang'. Before I conclude there are two points that I want to make. I want to commend the Minister for the fact that the grants approved by the Australian Research Grants Scheme are not narrowly technical. I applaud the fact that they are broad and cover areas in the humanities. A point I have made very often is that we should reject the often expressed concern in the business world that too many students are undertaking 'soft' subjects such as literature, philosophy and physical science rather than 'hard' subjects such as mathematics, physics and chemistry. I think this expresses the naive view that exact sciences are rigorous and studies based on value systems are not. No doubt the humanities are taught in an insufficiently rigorous way in Australia, and teacher training has much to answer for, but Australia's future will depend as much on its politicians, writers, artists and humanities teachers as on its engineers and chemists. Our primary emphasis in education must still be on the general rather than the specific and vocational. </PARA>
<PARA> It is no coincidence that Sweden and Switzerland, the most scientifically innovated of all nations per capita, had the highest literacy rates in Europe 200 years ago. Their excellence springs from the general standard of their education and culture. If their educational goals had been set only to meet technological objectives, they would have failed. Their particular skills are a consequence of rigorous levels of general education. I think the significant role played by the Scots in British economic history is also based on Scotland's high level of literacy. </PARA>
<PARA> The last thing I want to mention is that one of the difficulties that every nation faces is the problem of whether it spreads its expenditure in reasearch and development or whether it concentrates it in a particular narrow field. Whilst obviously it would be attractive to try to pick the winners and to try to get into key industries, it is extraordinary difficult to know in advance how things will develop. If we were to try to estimate what would happen in 20 years time, there is a fair likelihood that we would be wrong. Interest has been generated lately in the area of biotechnology. In February this year I had a long discussion at the Salk Institution at La Jolla near San Diego with Professor Francis Crick, who is universally conceded to have been the most important figure in the discovery of the principle of recombinant DNA which, has led to the implications of the biotechnological industry. Francis Crick made the point that he with James Watson and Muarice Wilkins, made their epic discovery, one the the greatest scientific discoveries in the last 200 years in 1953. </PARA>
<PARA> They shared the Nobel Prize for Physiology and Medicine in 1962, nine years later. But he said it was not until 1966 that it dawned on them the recombinant DNA had any kind of economic potential at all, and it was not for another 10 years after that-in 1976-that the matter was actively pursued. By 1981, although as yet there is no large scale production of biotechnology on the market, it is generally conceded by scientists and economists to be potentially the area of greatest economic growth for the decade. Yet, as I have said, the father of the whole enterprise, Francis Crick, was not aware of the situation and it was 13 years after the great discovery that he first understood that it might have considerable economic significance. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of other points that we can take up at the Committee stage. However, the Opposition applauds the fact that there is increased expenditure on research and development and the fact that there is some breadth in this area, it is not being couched in unduly narrow terms. We also think the Minister has been placed in an appalling situation by the activities of the 'Razor Gang'. We believe in government intervention, not wholesale intervention and not where it is not required. However, we endorse entirely the Minister's words, in his second reading speech, that there are a number of areas where the market does not provide adequately. Because research and development is carried out abundantly in other countries, there has been an extraordinary reluctance to spend money on it here, particularly in the private sector. The private sector carries the great burden of responsibility in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleague the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins) will be talking about the educational implications of cutbacks in research and development. One cannot just look at this Bill in isolation; one has to look also at what has happened in the universities with the cutbacks they have suffered, because that is where so many of the long term implications of research and development have their genesis. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have just listened to a rather loud, very interesting but, in my judgment, biased and, to a significant extent, irrelevant speech by the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones). It is impossible for me to deal with the speech point by point but I will make reference to some of the points he made. The honourable member constantly came back to the so-called razor gang, the Review of Commonwealth Functions. Amongst other things, he referred to the number of bodies in the Department of Science and Technology that are to be amalgamated. We on this side of the House make no apology for the review of Commonwealth Functions which has been undertaken and stress that there is not a single change affecting any of the Government's programs on pensions and other income security support measures. The thrust of that exercise has been to prune back the Public Service and to cut out unnecessary duplication with the States and private enterprise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One other major thrust was to come to grips with some complex problems in the very field that attracted a lot of discussion by the honourable member- the field of higher education, with particular reference to colleges of advanced education which are involved with teacher training. The thrust of the Government's policy is to encourage them to amalgamate and to change emphasis precisely in the direction of technology and business studies. This is the type of change that the honourable member was talking about. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member had much to say about technology transfer. I suggest that the colonial mentality-he made several references to it-which he accused Australian business of having, and by implication this Government, exists very largely in his own mind. Of course, I am prepared to concede that Australia industry is dependent to a very significant extent of imported technology, but it is natural that a great deal of technology suitable for Australian conditions will come from countries with far larger and more sophisticated industrial bases than we have. Naturally, that is reflected in terms of the proportion of patents, to which the honourable member referred, which have overseas origin. What is important is that Australian companies should have a research and development capability to originate new technology and also to be in a position to adapt technology to suit local conditions and thereby benefit this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member made references to the situation which exists in Switzerland. I think it ought to be noted that in Switzerland 10 large multinational companies which have headquarters there, for a variety of reasons which are not applicable to Australia, account for 60 per cent of the industrial research and development carried out in that country. If one looks at the figures for gross expenditure on research and development as a result of GDP in, say, Sweden, Switzerland and Australia, one will see that in Sweden it is 1.8 per cent; in Switzerland it is 2.3 per cent and in Australia it is 0.9 per cent. I recognise that that is a comparatively low figure. However, if one makes some allowance for the fact that 60 per cent of Switzerland's expenditure is accounted for by those 10 large companies, one sees that the situation there is much more comparable to the Australian position. I make this point in passing because it is necessary to say something about the range of matters which the honourable member mentioned not directly related to the Industrial Research and Development Incentives Amendment Bill but I now wish to go back to focus the attention of the House on the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Notwithstanding a grudging approbation that came through at the beginning of the honourable member's speech and in the quieter moments at the end, the Bill does represent a substantial upgrading and enlargement of this whole program of industrial research and development incentive grants. The program is a very important component of the Government's overall industry policy. The Bill is necessary basically because the existing program expires on 30 June of this year. The purpose of the Bill, among other things, is to put in place a new five-year program to operate from that date. As an indication of the importance that the Government attaches to this measure, I point out that as recently as 1977-78 the amount of funding for it was some $14m and in this current 1980-81 financial year the amount is $54m. That is a four-fold increase within those three years. This has occured despite all the pressures placed upon the Government to contain overall expenditure-to which it is committed. I believe that is the best indication of the Government's commitment to this program. It is designed particularly to help the small and medium sized firms. </PARA>
<PARA> It is necessary to point out, in order to have the facts on the record, that the main focus of this program is in the area of 'project grants'. Project grants are paid to firms which have established research and development facilities in order to enable them to undertake significant projects of industrial research and development. The grants are prospective. An agreement is entered into between the Australian Industrial Research and Development Incentives Board and the company on a prospective basis. The ceiling for such grants has hitherto been limited to $500,000 a year in any particular case. It is a measure of the Government's commitment in this area that despite its firm resolve to reduce government spending overall and the results of the activities of the so-called razor gang, to give effect to the Governments commitment to foster development based on technological advance the Bill provides for the annual ceiling to increase from $500,000 to $750,000. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Barry Jones" NAMEID="KH4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9G4">Dr EDWARDS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is taxable, that is correct. The program also provides for what are called 'commencement grants' as well as projects of industrial research of a public interest character. These commencement grants are designed to encourage firms, particularly small to medium sized firms, whose research and development activities are only at an infant stage. Firms are encouraged to incur research and development expenditure on the basis that a predictable incentive payment in the form of a commencement grant can subsequently be sought to reimburse the firm for that spending, to the extent of 50 per cent of the amount incurred up to a maximum of $25,000 per annum. That is the maximum limit which applies to commencement grants on an annual basis at the moment. Now, under this Bill, that limit of $25,000 will be increased to $40,000. Again, that is indicative of the Government's determination in this area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are a number of other provisions in the Bill. It provides for improved administrative arrangements by restructuring the Australian Industrial Research and Development Incentives Board to ensure that there is a more effective and faster decision-making process. Again, the scope of grants is extended beyond the mining and manufacturing spheres, to which hitherto they have been largely confined, to include industrial research and development related to some on-site activities in the building and construction industry. The Bill also provides that project grants may be payable for computer software research and development related directly to new products or to processes employed in manufacturing, mining and on-site building activities. The Government's intention is to encourage the application of new or innovative software techniques which are in line with the overall aims of the scheme. Those are the principal provisions of the Bill and they indicate the Government's firm intentions in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> To inject a personal note, I put forward the suggestion that from recent experience in my electorate it has become apparent to me that particularly in the case of the smaller firms, which may nevertheless have a pretty good idea, have made a significant invention, requiring research and development, one of the difficulties that occurs throughout the process of bringing a project to fruition is the cost involved in patenting the idea, especially the very high cost of taking out overseas patents. Overseas patenting can cost in the order of $20,000 to $30,000. That can represent a very significant cost for a smaller firm. Some people might argue that a patent is not part of this process, that a patent so to speak crowns a research and development project. In practice, the two go hand in hand. Of course, the possibility of achieving such a patent and reaping the benefits so conferred keeps the shoulder to the wheel, so to speak. I make the following suggestion to the Minister: It might be possible that a discretion in this matter can be introduced into the Act. If such a project goes on to become a significant commercial success, the component to cover the patent costs-perhaps even other components of these grants-could be repayable since in a sense the grant has made possible the project's commercial success. </PARA>
<PARA> Be that as it may I want to stress that this measure is a key component of the Government's overall industrial development policy. It is this Government's policy to foster a manufacturing industry in Australia which is more specialised that at present, larger scale, more technology advanced, more export orientated, energy intensive and resource based. Of course, the most significant thing that the Government has done in its pursuit of that overall objective is to establish-I should say re-establish having regard to the upsurge in inflation and costs during 1973-75-Australia's international competitive position. This the Government has done via its anti-inflation and exchange rate policies. By those policies Australian industry is enabled to compete more effectively against imports and to make sales overseas. Indeed in recent years manufactured exports have expanded very significantly. They increased by the order of 30 per cent in 1979-80 and that rate of improvement continued through to the end of 1980, which is the latest available figure. It is basic that we get the fundamentals right in regard to the international competitiveness of the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Along with that basic thrust of overall economic policy is a complex of measures which comprise the 'positives' of the Government's industrial development policy. I refer to the investment allowance, higher depreciation rates for plant and equipment and export incentives which, after having got things moving in the way I have suggested, are to be curtailed somewhat, as announced last Thursday. And to come back to the Bill, there are these industrial research and development incentives. These and other positive measures are the carrots, so to speak, of industrial policy. They go along with the gradual movement towards a lower and less complicated structure of tariff and subsidy protection. I emphasise the word 'gradual'. There is no 25 per cent across-the-board tariff cuts such as those which we witnessed in 1973 under the previous Administration. There is a gradual movement toward lower and less complicated tariff structure. In that connection I believe it is worth stressing that the average nominal rate of protection afforded to Australian industry has fallen by about 40 per cent over the last decade. </PARA>
<PARA> So while the basic task of the Government is to set the stage to get these fundamentals right and thus release the dynamics of the unplannable forces for production and development in the economy, these specific elements of industry policy to which I have referred are also important. This measure is putting in place for the next five years the program of industrial research and development incentives the rationale of which is as the honourable member for Lalor said, that the national returns, in terms of greater innovation and greater home-grown technological development, exceed the private returns. It has to be agreed that there is insufficient industrial research and development in this country. The fundamental purpose of these industrial research and development in this country. The fundamental purpose of these industrial research and development grants is to contribute in a very significant way to correcting that underinvestment. Technological innovation and the development of new and improved products are basic to industry efficiency, competitiveness, thrust and growth. A technologically advanced manufacturing industry with a capacity for innovation can contribute importantly to providing Australia's well-educated and growing work force with the opportunity fully to utilise its skills and talents. Accordingly, I commend this Bill which, as I said at the outset, very substantially upgrades and enlarges the program of industrial research and development incentives. I reject the amendment moved by the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support with pleasure the amendment moved by the Opposition to the Industrial Research and Development Incentives Amendment Bill. This Government's attitude on research and development technology incentives, in particular the transfer of technology, is surely highlighted in this measure. It highlights this Government's lack of vision, lack of courage and lack of purpose. At a time when mineral resource exploitation is expanding a number of critically important questions have to be answered. The most important concerns the level and control of technology in mineral extraction and processing. It is this question which will determine the Government's capacity to provide the maximum employment opportunities and the generation of the highest levels of income from the exploitation of our resources. For the last 30 years the approach of Liberal Country Party governments has been to leave such matters to market forces. An interesting article in the Institute, dealing with the United States National Science Foundation report to the White House, states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While market forces may ultimately relieve current and future shortages . . . we believe that the innovative capacity of American industry will be severely hampered in the interim. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the US can't afford to wait for the 'slow workings of the marketplace,' . . . the NSF, along with the Departments of Defense Energy, Education, and other agencies anticipating personnel shortages, can encourage qualified undergraduates to transfer into the field of the projected shortage, co-operate with industry to offer post-graduate industrial traineeships in fields with projected shortages of people with advanced degrees, and study how to better project personnel needs. </PARA>
<PARA>How does one test the needs in this country at the present time? A Senate committee report on research and development in Australia states:</PARA>
<PARA> Between 1973-74 and 1976-77, gross expenditure on research and development in Australia as a percentage of the Gross Domestic Product fell from 1.29 per cent of GDP to 0.97 per cent of GDP a reduction of 25 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government sector increased in importance as a source of funds, providing 77 per cent of the total in 1976-77 compared to 63 per cent in 1973-74. The Business Enterprise sector's contribution dropped dramatically, from providing 35 per cent of the total expenditure in 1973-74 to only 19 per cent in 1976-77. </PARA>
<PARA> Manpower employed in R &amp; D-</PARA>
<PARA>Research and development-</PARA>
<PARA>by private enterprise fell by 40 per cent in 1976-77 compared to 1973-74. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to return now to the theme that I want to advance today-the question of transfer technology and what happened in previous years. This policy vaccuum resulted in three basic deficiencies in the introduction and control of mineral extraction and processing technology. Firstly, over the last 30 years there has been very little development of technology in these areas in Australia. A minimum of downstream processing of minerals has taken place, giving justification to the description that this country is nothing more than a vast quarry. The recent report of the Australian Trade Development Council on mineral processing summed up the problem as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> In comparison with other countries, Australia's industrial research and development performance rates very poorly in terms of both incentives provided by the Government and assistance to industry for research and development. </PARA>
<PARA>The second major deficiency resulting from this Government's abdication of responsibility has been a decline in our technical prowess, a shortage of skilled labour and a lack of technical support services to the mining industry. Professor Endersbee, President of the Institution of Engineers put his finger on the problem when he stated:</PARA>
<PARA> All these various projects will proceed at the latest level of modern technology, simply because that is the state of the art and the reflection of costs. But this also means that if Australian engineers, industries and workers are to participate in these projects we must have engineers and firms and skilled workers capable of operating at these top levels of modern technology. Do we have this national competence?</PARA>
<PARA> I believe we are losing ground. As an extreme example, we can see a warning in the situation that prevailed in the Middle East, where the international oil companies exploited the oil resources in that area for some time without regard for the people of the region, simply because of their limited technological capacility. I believe we are in danger of a similar loss of opportunities, simply because we are not sustaining and improving our national technological competence. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Thomson) gets up in this place and talks about government policy. The Government closed two engineering colleges in Victoria. How can we expect this area to survive? Thirdly, the absence of government policy has resulted in little effective transfer of technology from foreign corporations to this nation's control. As a consequence, foreign corporations have retained the development of new and improved technology within their corporate empires outside Australia and Australian hands. One has to look only at the motor vehicle industry, as my colleague the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) said, to see what this means. The highly skilled design side of motor vehicle production which once existed in this country no longer exists. It did not suit the plans of General Motors-Holden's Ltd or other trans-national producers to retain these high technology areas within Australia. What are we left with? All we are left with is becoming a place for assembly of motor cars-nothing more, nothing less. The fact that this Government and State governments accept virtually without question the package deal foreign investment proposals offered by foreign investors is a national scandal. </PARA>
<PARA> In a study of a number of major projects involving foreign ownership during the 1960s Professor McKern found that foreign equity participation was welcomed purely and simply because of the proven ability of trans-national corporations to execute agreed programs and find secure foreign markets. Huge bodies of ore were committed virtually in perpetuity and the question of technology transfer was ignored by governments while problems such as foreign control of key domestic resources, environmental damage, resource depletion and the opportunity cost of alternatives foreclosed went over the head or between the ears of all governments. McKern found that even the officers of transnational corporations taking part in negotiations on foreign investment were surprised at the lack of concern shown by Australian governments and corporations about such matters. Among the reluctant bridesmaids to foreign investment Australia has been a willing harlot. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not difficult to find reasons why foreign corporations are anxious to impose package deals on this country. Under the proposals offered by corporations technology is held secure under the control of the corporation and is not disseminated further. The threat of future competition against the corporation is obviously overcome. Local processing and exports are limited to suit the foreign corporation's plants in other countries. Further, favourable transfer pricing between plants and nations to minimise local tax and royalty payments is available to the vertically integrated corporations. It has taken us a long time to get around to putting some order into section 136 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The folly of ignoring questions of technology transfer is illustrated, as I have said before, in Australia's history in the aluminium industry and we ought to learn from it. When proposals to produce aluminium in Australia were first made after the First World War they had to be shelved because of the ease with which international aluminium cartels could destroy the new local industry. Even when the Second World War, and a world-wide shortage of aluminium, forced Commonwealth Government involvement in aluminium production, the design and construction of a plant were delayed by the refusal of Alcoa to provide any expertise at all. It was left to the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation in co-operation with the British Government to develop the Australian designed Bayer-Hall process. An Australian Aluminium Commission was formed in 1944 and an extensive survey was carried out in that year. </PARA>
<PARA> We now have the same technology-the Bayer process-being the subject of three separate international transfers in three different direct foreign investment packages. That is, we paid for the technology three times over. Yet the same technology had been worked up and operated at full scale by the Australian Government before any of the transfers were made. Not only that, but it is clear that the technological base in each case now lies outside this country so that significant process development no longer occurs in this country. None of these three companies operating alumina refineries in Australia is either capable of transferring or is empowered to transfer that technology to another country, least of all Australia. It is possible, therefore, to argue that massive international transfers of technology which have occurred have effectively deprived Australia of that very technology. </PARA>
<PARA> The same sorry story could be told about mineral sands. Wartime development could have provided the basis of an industry producing titanium dioxide pigment. But after the war this development again was by-passed when foreign corporations brought the same technology into this country at a higher price. I suggest to the Minister-we cannot divorce this from the matter before the chamber-that under the foreign investment packages involved any further transfers of technology to other countries could be made only by a multinational parent. The option of a viable Australian industry leading world trade in this commodity was foreclosed. It was shut off. The tragedy of these foreign investment sellouts will soon be added to which the expansion of the aluminium industry to take advantage of our cheap energy resources. Because this industry comprises a handful of vertically integrated foreign corporations the returns to Australians from their fortunate position as members of an energy and resource rich country will be far below what it ought to be. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose one could go on to develop the whole history of the Esso Australia Ltd involvement in the Rundle oil shale deposit. It clearly highlights the dangers of neglecting the technology transfer aspect of foreign investment. To my mind this was the critical issue of the Rundle shale oil deposit. The Government has in effect permitted what is the world's largest oil corporation to gain a stranglehold over Australia's most promising oil shale reserves. It is hardly surprising that the bullish propaganda of Esso at the time it moved into the Rundle shale should have dissipated into pessimism once its supremacy over the deposit was assured. That is not unusual; the company has done that for the last 30 years. The fact is that Esso and the world's other major countries are flush with profits from the huge escalation in oil prices. They are using their enormous cash flows to take control over mining companies and increase their holdings of key energy reserves throughout the world. We have no legislation at all in this country to block that; that is, we have anti-monopoly legislation. There is such legislation in England currently but none in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> No guarantee whatsoever was given by Esso, and none was asked for by the Government, that the company was serious about proceeding to ultimate development before it was allowed to secure control of the resource. It was not even thought of. It was not even asked for. The use of technology by Esso as a weapon to bludgeon this Government into submission began when the feasibility study for Rundle was undertaken. Esso's costing of the Rundle project was significantly in excess of that undertaken by international consultants acting for the original Australian partners in the project. The Australian partners also claimed that Esso's estimates appeared to involve a lot of plant additives which were believed to be unnecessary and expensive. The point is that the Australian Government is not in a position to judge these allegations but Esso is using the fact that it put up $30m for the feasibility study to gain control over further oil shale leases adjacent to Rundle. Esso's aim is to slow down the development of shale oil while the price of oil internationally remains static. Meanwhile, it manoeuvres to gain control over as much of the world's shale oil deposits as possible. This went on in the United States Colorado Basin 30 years ago. It has been repeated in this country. </PARA>
<PARA>Z While technology transfers are firmly in Esso's grasp it has total control over how and when Rundle will be developed. Australia's national interest is now irrelevant to any decision on oil shale in this country, as the Government has learned to its great embarrassment. This Government is an amateur in a professional league. If we are to control our resource exploitation, we must have effective control, as the Norwegians, the British, the Venezuelans and the Mexicans have found, over the technology used in that exploitation. We must be prepared to put greater effort into the development of our own technologies and mineral processing methods. I think the greatest travesty of this Government since it assumed office in 1975 is that it has not spent sufficient money on the Bureau of Mineral Resources. If it had spent a few more million dollars on improving its capability Australia may have been richer to the tune of billions of dollars. </PARA>
<PARA> Another aspect of mineral research and development should be faced by the Government. With the rapid escalation in the depletion of the level of our natural resources, the reality which must be faced is that we will progressively be forced to derive many minerals from non-conventional sources, from very low grade deposits or, in the case of oil, from secondary or tertiary recovery levels. If our consumption remains constant we will reach this position with some minerals in the next ten years. No better example of this can be found in this country at the moment than the domestic oil situation. New technology required to exploit unorthodox sources will not be cheap. It will be extremely expensive. The need for research is urgent because the lead time in developing any new techniques in this area varies from 10 to 20 years. The necessary research and development could be funded by a levy on resource exploitation. The Treasury supports this proposal but this Government, because of the extensive mining lobby, refuses to implement it. </PARA>
<PARA> Unless funds are allocated for research and development we, along with most of the West, will face a severe shortage of materials. Those that are available will be available at steeply escalated prices. Areas where such research funds are vital are the exploration and exploitation of the sea bed, deep buried mineral deposits, methods to process low grade and conventional ores, reducing the energy requirement of current processes and the use of alternative materials. I suggest to the Minister that if your Government's policy continues in the next decade you will do nothing for this country in relation to technology self-sufficiency. You have put all your eggs--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to contribute briefly to this debate to support the remarks of my colleagues, the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) and the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi). I refer particularly to that part of the amendment which suggests that this House express its concern at the low level of government investment in research and development compared to technologically advanced countries. I refer specifically to the lack of support for basic research in universities. That is where most of the basic research is undertaken in this country. I emphasise the importance of supporting basic research as a vital prerequisite to the sort of applied research and development which this Bill seeks to encourage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since 1966 the Commonwealth has had a program of supporting basic research under the Australian Research Grants Scheme which is administered by the Australian Research Grants Committee. However, the amount of funding which has been made available through that scheme has deteriorated markedly. For instance, the amount made available in 1980-81, which was $16m, was less in real terms than the amount made available when the scheme was introduced in 1966. If we were to restore the amount to an equivalent amount in real terms to that which was made available in 1966 the next Budget would have to appropriate $22m as opposed to the $16m which was appropriated last year for this purpose. One of the organisations which has taken up this point is the Federation of Australian University Staff Associations, otherwise known as FAUSA. It is concerned that a number of its members who have viable and exciting projects which would otherwise be supported are not being supported due to the lack of funds made available to the ARGC for allocation mainly to the universities. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to make the point that basic research has two parts, pure and strategic research. The Australian Science and Technology Council has estimated that of the research supported under the programs administered by the ARGC, 30 per cent are in the category of pure research and 70 per cent are in the category of strategic research. It is to some people difficult to justify in economic terms the importance of pure research. At the same time, it is terribly important to emphasise that it is fundamental that we support pure research as well as strategic and, of course, later applied research before we can have the important breakthroughs and discoveries which will make a real contribution to the economy of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I emphasise to the Government and the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Thomson) that if they want sensible and effective research programs under their administration they must not ignore the very important role of the kind of pure research which is conducted in universities. They rely on the ARGC for support for basic research. That Committee is the single most important source of funds for basic research in Australia. I think it is an absolute tragedy that a decreasing contribution as a proportion of total federal outlays has been made to this very important area. Over the last 15 years it has fallen by almost 50 per cent. In its reports for 1980 and 1981 the ARGC has pointed to the effect of this decline. In 1980 the Committee stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee . . . sees an urgent need to increase the real level of funds available to the ARGS. This urgency arises for two reasons</PARA>
<PARA> (a) The reduction in the average grant in real terms means that the Committee is unable to recommend sufficient support to enable the best investigators to achieve their research potential. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) The fact that an increasing number of investigators whom the Committee has assessed as proposers of good quality projects (112 in 1980), are being cut out completely from ARGS funds. </PARA>
<PARA>In 1981 the Committee indicated that the position was even worse. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The extent of the withdrawal of support for worthwhile projects can be gauged from the increased number of proposals judged by the Committee's external assessors to be of good quality which could not be supported. In 1980 there were 112 such cases; in 1981 this figure has risen to 296. </PARA>
<PARA>It is very alarming that the ARGC, which is highly respected throughout the academic community, having made its assessment of projects which are put up primarily by individuals and sometimes by teams for short term support, has been unable to support 296 proposals which it thought were worthy of support. I say again to the Minister: If the Government is going to miss out on the work of 296 legitimate investigations and research projects I cannot see how it can reap the true rewards from the sorts of proposals he is putting forward today in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one other matter in this regard that I should refer to, and that is this: Before the election the Government indicated that it was going to provide special assistance for what I think it rather impertinently called centres of excellence. I prefer to call them centres of concentration because there is no way in which it can be said that one group of research workers is excellent because that implies that all the others working in that area are somewhat deficient. I do not think those sorts of assessments can be made and I certainly do not think this Government is in a position to make them. But I think it is legitimate to provide extra and special assistance to centres of concentration where teams working on more complicated and long term research projects can be supported over a longer period. The alarm which exists in the academic community-I think it is a legitimate alarm-is that the funds available for centres of concentration may come out of the funds which would ordinarily have been made available in other ways. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is fundamentally important that there should be no diminution-in fact there should be an increase-in the amount of funds available to the ARGC at the same time as the centres of concentration, are being supported under this new proposal. If the Minister were able to say that that was the case and that the centres of concentration would not compete for funds with the ARGC, I think he would find his proposal welcomed with much greater enthusiasm in the universities around this country. I emphasise again that it is important to continue the sort of funding which the ARGC has been involved with because we cannot predict where important discoveries will be made. It may be that some groups, in particular universities, have made important contributions, but we cannot say that nobody else will make just as important or even more important contributions in other universities. Therefore, I think there is very important justification for continuing to support investigators and researchers on a project basis and on an individual basis and to encourage them to pursue their interests on the short term basis, which is what the ARGC is particularly concerned with. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention another matter which relates to this aspect. It is not simply a question of providing funds for researchers to continue their current work. The other important thing-my colleague the honourable member for Lalor has referred to this matter as well-is to ensure that we continue to have enough people who will be involved in research work. We must ensure that increasing numbers of people are going into universities and staying there to participate in this important research work. </PARA>
<PARA> The awful truth is that we have appalling levels of participation in tertiary education and in higher secondary education compared with those of some other countries. This situation is deteriorating. If we look at the Tertiary Education Commission report and at what has been happening in the last three years, there has been a phenomenal decline in the number of school leavers who have gone straight into tertiary institutions. Whereas three years ago 54 per cent of school leavers went straight on to some form of full time tertiary education, the number has now fallen to 42 per cent, at a time when we should be encouraging more and more people to be involved in full time higher education. Yet we have seen this decline. One of the reasons for this decline, which the TEC points to, is the lack of adequate student financial arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to get on to that aspect, except to say that the Government is now making a deliberate and specific assault on the major research body-that is, universities-around this country. The Government intends to apply fees to those people involved in post-graduate study in universities. The fact is that the major contribution to research work in universities in a manpower sense is in fact conducted by post-graduate students. There are about 20,000 full time and part time post-graduate students around Australia. We do not really know to what extent those students or new students will be discouraged from post-graduate studies as a result of these fees. It is clear however that many people will be prevented from carrying on this work, not because they are not good enough but because they cannot afford to, simply due to the fact that the Government is applying a quite inequitable and quite unjustifiable fee on the people who are primarily involved in basic research work in universities around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I want the Minister to realise that at least his colleague the Minister for Education (Mr Fife) seems to have partially realised the lunacy of this proposal because in a Press statement that he released on Sunday we see the first evidence of backsliding in relation to the Razor Gang's report. In relation to tertiary tuition fees, the report of the Razor Gang reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Tuition fees to be introduced in universities and CAE's for students undertaking degrees and diplomas subsequent to an initial tertiary qualification, except for recognised double degree or diploma combination. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Postgraduate students receiving Commonwealth Government Postgraduate Awards to be exempted from fees. </PARA>
<PARA>In the Press statement that he issued on 3 May the Minister for Education said that he had been misrepresented. He said that it was perfectly clear what the Government was doing in relation to tertiary fees. He said, inter alia, when talking about tertiary tuition fees:</PARA>
<PARA> Students in receipt of Commonwealth Government or university Postgraduate awards will be exempt. </PARA>
<PARA>There was no misrepresentation at all. It was perfectly clear in the beginning what the Government intended, but maybe as a result of some flash of brilliance on the Minister's part, on Saturday, 2 May-that may not be unrelated to the fact that the Minister on that day was at the University of Sydney and was button-holed by the Vice-Chancellor of the University, Professor Williams-the Minister obviously realised that the Government had made a serious mistake and to a very small extent tried to unravel the mess it had created. But that in itself will not be sufficient because both the Commonwealth Government and the university awards are granted primarily on the basis of merit, not on the basis of need. So we are going to have a lot of prospective post-graduate students-perhaps not the best but nevertheless promising-being denied an opportunity not only to further their education but also to participate in university research simply because this Government has decided to penalise them for wanting to continue in that direction. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that the honourable member for Lalor is right when he says that we cannot look at this proposal in isolation from the basic research work which is being done in the universities. We particularly cannot look at it in isolation from the success or failure of the education system as a whole. I urge the Minister, if he is genuinely interested, and I believe he is-I think he is having an awfully hard time of it at the moment, being beaten around the head by this Government--</PARA>

He has made no suggestions; his whole speech has been a knocking speech; he has produced no details of an alternative policy. Perhaps the Opposition does not have an alternative policy. It did nothing in this field when it was in government. This Government has encouraged industrial research and development. This Government has done a great deal to encourage new technology in Australia. The Opposition did nothing about industrial research and development in the three disastrous years it was in office. This Government is doing a great deal to help and encourage high technology industries in Australia. We have consistently supported industrial research and development.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Berowra (Dr Edwards) said that in the last three years the amount spent to support industrial research and development incentives with which this Bill is concerned has increased from $14m three years ago to $54m today. That is a very considerable increase. This legislation is good legislation. No Opposition members who spoke on this legislation complained about it in any way; they admitted that it is a good Bill. The honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins) spoke about the money spent on industrial research. The Australian Government has allocated about $180m to the Australian Research Grants Committee, the National Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Council, the Tertiary Education Commission and universities-for marine science research. That is a considerable amount. That amount is much more than has ever been spent in this field in Australia. I think the Government deserves great credit for its realisation of the need to encourage high level research in Australia. Of course, there is an immense amount to be done. There are limited resources and those resources are being used in the best possible way. This is a good Bill. That has been admitted by all Opposition members who have spoken in this debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise one point that relates to the definition clause-clause 3-of the Bill. The explanatory memorandum to the Bill states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The effect of sub-clauses 2 (f) and 2 (g) is that computer software R and D will be eligible where it relates directly to the development of new products of, or new or improved processes employed in manufacturing, mining or on-site building or construction activities. However, where software R and D has been eligible under the commencement grant scheme, that eligibility is retained. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Thomson) to explain why it is necessary to exclude the broader category of software production. The restrictions involved in sub-clause 3 (1) (f)' which seeks to insert the new definition of eligible software research and development, are far too narrow. At this stage we will not move an amendment but, depending on how the Minister answers the question, we may propose one in the Senate. I put it to the Minister that perhaps in the period between the Bill leaving this place and being introduced in the Senate he might reconsider. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me put this argument to him: There seems to be a strong case for a general eligibility for providing industrial research and development incentives grants to software development where appropriate. After all, the Australian Industrial Research and Development Incentives Board will presumably have a discretion. It can pick and choose between applications. We think software should be regared as a significant form of enterprise per se. Software requires intellectual skill, it has considerable market potential and is relatively labour intensive. Great Britain, for example, is not doing particularly well in the computer hardware area, but is successful in the computer software area. Why should there not be a broad capacity to include software where, in the opinion of the Board, it is warranted? If the Board can exercise a discretion as to what it provides grants for, that seems to be perfectly satisfactory. There is very likely to be a considerable development in the volume of software that will be required throughout the 1980s. I point out to the Minister that most packaged software in Australia is imported. This, again, is an area where we are suffering from a considerable technology imbalance. I would suggest to the Minister that he delete from paragraph (f) of sub-clause 3 (1) the words 'software for computers or for similar equipment'. He might also delete paragraph (g) as well. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It seems that the honourble member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) does not really understand the purpose of this Bill. The original legislaiton was restricted to research in both manufacturing and mining. We have extended the scope of the legislation to on-site building. We do not wish to expand it beyond that at the moment because the amount of money is limited. We believe they are the three most important sections in which we should be encouraging industrial research and technology. Software which is realted to these three areas is eligible. If we opened up a whole new field which the Bill is not intended to cover we would find that similar amendments would be sought in all other areas. It would open up the Bill to any sort of industrial reasearch and development. We wish to restrict the operation of the Bill to these three major areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is another point. Most software development is development. It involves a very small amount of research. This is a research and development Bill. The Australian Industrial Research and Develepment Incentives Board, when assessing applications, takes into account both research and development. In most cases software development does not contain a purely research element. Therefore the Government decided that this was not the best area in which to support the software industry. I must say that I agree with the honourable member that the software industry is a very important industry in Australia. I think it employs about 12,000 people at the moment. It is growing very fast. The industry does have problems in getting venture capital. We are looking at that. I propose to have a meeting with representatives of the software industry as soon as it can be arranged to discuss how the industry might be assisted in areas in which it is having real problems. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government considered very carefully this question raised by the honourable member. It decided that the Bill was not the most appropriate way in which to assist the software industry if it needs assistance. The industry is doing very well at the moment. However, there are areas in which it is experiencing problems. The Government will try to assist the industry in this respect after consultation with the industry itself. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer given by the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Thomson) is an extremely disappointing, and perhaps not properly thought-out. First of all I point out that the definition of 'industrial research and development' in the Industrial Research and Development Incentives Act 1976 is broad enough. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>'Industrial research and development', in relation to a company, means systematic experimentation or analysis in the field of science or technology carried on by the company, or procured by it to be carried out, in Australia with the object of-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) acquiring knowledge that may be of use for the purpose of devising or developing new or substantially improved material products or new or substantially improved processes for or in connection with the production or use of material products . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Then it states:</PARA>
<PARA> (b) applying knowledge for the purpose referred to in paragraph (a) . . . </PARA>
<PARA>What we have in this Bill is a narrowing of the principal Act, which was broad enough, by confining software incentives in effect to mining and construction operations. The position seems to be absolutely indefensible. One might say: 'Ah well, it might require too much money and it might be far too broad'. The answer is to say to the Government: 'What is your Board doing?' The Australian Industrial Research and Development Incentives Board, after all, receives applications. If it considers an application and says 'We do not think a grant is merited, we do not think there is enough evidence for it' it can reject the application. We could say to the Board: 'Oh yes, once upon a time under the 1976 Act you would have included a broader variety of software'. Now we are told that although the Government is enlarging the range of industrial research and development broadly, in this area it is cutting down. If software development is needed for construction or mining, it is in. If there is any alternative form it is out. The Government is not even giving the Board the opportunity to express a choice as to whether something ought to be included or not. This seems to me to be absolutely arbitrary. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest to the Minister that instead of coming out with what for him is an uncharacteristically peremptory reply he might give some consideration to this and in the period between now and when the Bill is transmitted to the Senate examine if the present wording is too narrow. He might read the definition of what is meant by eligible software research and development in conjunction with the definition of industrial research and development that is in the parent legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;(Leichhardt-Minister for Science and Technology) (5.50)-Under the previous Act software could be funded only when it was related to hardware development. This Bill has broadened the area of eligibility. The Bill provides for the extension to certain categories of mining, manufacturing and onsite building operations. That is a considerable widening of the Act. It is not as much as the software industry wants but under the legislation, the industry will now be eligible for grants in those areas-manufacturing, mining and onsite building operations.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not quite sure of the procedures here but I understand that the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar) has an amendment to move to the Quarantine Amendment Bill 1981. The Opposition wishes to move an amendment also. I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA> 'whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House is of the opinion that the maintenance of efficient and comprehensive quarantine arrangements is vital and that any transfer of remaining operational responsibilities to the States would jeopardise this and therefore should be opposed.'</PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition moves this amendment because since the Bill was introduced the Government has brought into the House a statement on the review of Commonwealth functions. In referring to quarantine the review stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government will also explore with State Governments the appropriateness and feasibility of transferring to the States the remaining Commonwealth operational elements of the administration of quarantine. That would leave policy matters in relation to quarantine with the Department of Health for people and the Department of Primary Industry for animals and plants. </PARA>
<PARA>I want to refer to two matters in respect of that statement. First of all the Bill says nothing about splitting quarantine arrangements between the Department of Health and between the Department of Primary Industry. The Opposition is very much opposed to transferring further operational aspects of quarantine to the States. People are already well aware of deficiencies pointed to by, for example, the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources in, for instance northern Australia. We believe it is a rather poor show when the review of Commonwealth functions statement directly reflects on a Bill before the House. If the statement is not in fact in opposition to the Bill then certainly it downgrades the importance of it. We all realise that if the review goes ahead the Department of Health will hardly have any functions to perform. </PARA>
<PARA> The report on the review of Commonwealth functions of the razor gang indicates that the function of quarantine was not reviewed. The Government in its razor gang report did not look at the best, the most efficient, the most effective or safest quarantine system or service. It simply looked at ways and means of foisting functions on to the States, doing away with some functions or selling off any functions that happen to pay. In very few cases did the razor gang look at the functions themselves. For example, the committee did not look at what was best for soil conservation, what should or should not be done, or whether there should or should not be a national program of soil conservation. It simply looked at ways and means of foisting functions on to the States. It did not look at soil conservation per se just as it did not look at quarantine per se. It did not look at what was best for quarantine. The razor gang's report simply is ideology masked as fiscal responsibility. The razor gang's report is really the ideological outpourings of a frugal and mendacious government. The Minister in his second reading speech said that part of the measure before the House was-</PARA>
<PARA> to give effect to outstanding recommendations for legislative change put forward by the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources in its report on the adequacy of quarantine. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government does that but many other recommendations in the report are not picked up. In the razor gang's report many recommendations are not looked at in terms of the Quarantine Amendment Bill. The Minister also said that the Bill is a reflection of the Government's strong commitment to an efficient quarantine service. As I said earlier, I think that the razor gang's report does not look at what is best for an efficient quarantine service but simply at foisting off quarantine functions. I seek leave of the House to incorporate the recommendations in Hansard because they are good and well thought through recommendations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister and the House. The Senate Standing Committee which examined the adequacy of quarantine procedures wanted a strong Australian quarantine service. The Government senators on that Committee-Senators Thomas, Maunsell and Teague-unanimously agreed that Australia needs a strong quarantine service. The recommendations for the organisation of this new structure for an Australian quarantine service appears at page 66 and 67 of the report. It is quite obvious from that report that the members of the Committee, after a searching inquiry, do not want more quarantine functions to be foisted on the States. They want to see a strong Australian quarantine service. They propose an Australian quarantine service covering animal, plant and health services under the aegis of an organisation to be known as the Australian Agricultural Health Service within the Department of Primary Industry. In other words, this would mean an upgrading of the present situation. Again it is quite clear that that searching examination by the Senate resulted in a proposal for a strong Australian quarantine service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Labor Party has no objection to the concept of putting quarantine procedures within the Department of Primary Industry. Administrative arrangements are nowhere near as important as trying to get the best and most efficient quarantine service. We are opposed to the remaining quarantine operational powers to the States, as the Razor Gang recommended. The Senate Committee report quite clearly showed just where the deficiencies were, particularly in northern Australia, where some arrangements involved quarantine inspections by private contractors as a 9 to 5 operation. The Senate Committee reported that some inspectors had been dumped on beaches and left for 24 or 36 hours. There are all sorts of problems with the States in handling some aspects of quarantine. It is downright irresponsible, in the Opposition's opinion, to hand any more facilities and operational aspects of quarantine over to the States. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps I should inform the House what the Quarantine Amendment Bill is all about. The broad purpose of the Bill is to incorporate the Cocos (Keeling) Islands into Australian quarantine arrangements so as to provide a secure off-shore quarantine station, to extend quarantine powers and activities provided for in the Act to remove the liability of the Commonwealth to pay compensation for imported livestock and certain other classes of animals destroyed in accordance with the Act where those animals have been in quarantine since importation. Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner I informed the House that the Opposition has no objection to this Bill. The only reason it has moved a second reading amendment is that it objects to the implications of what is contained in the razor gang's report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill draws together changes resulting from the decisions to establish an off-shore quarantine station on Cocos (Keeling) Islands, which is expected to be completed in September of this year; the 1979 findings of the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources in its report on the adequacy of quarantine; and various other measures which the Government considers necessary to continue Australia's geographic isolation from many of the worst human, plant and animal health risks found in nearby and distant countries. Mass international air travel, Australia's participation in large volume international trade and the unauthorised landings in Australia of refugees and others have contributed to the growing quarantine risks Australia faces. In economic and/or social terms the establishment in Australia of particular diseases such as foot and mouth disease, rabies or oriental fruit fly could be disastrous not only for the individuals immediately concerned but also for the community at large. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of interrupted production and trade, the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar) stated in 1980 that an outbreak of foot and mouth disease would result in a loss of $2,500m in rural output in the first year alone. In June 1980 the Government announced a national quarantine publicity campaign intended to inform the one million Australians who travel overseas and the 800,000 visitors who arrive here each year of the need to co-operate with quarantine regulations. That commitment by the Government gave me and the Opposition a clear indication that it regards quarantine as a national responsibility. We congratulate and encourage the Government in that. But this is a time when the country is being scoured by children and parents engaged in the hunt for some 250 gerbils and hamsters, due to the failure of interception procedures by our quarantine service. People are calling for the reactivation of the Army Veterinary Corps to deal with an outbreak of exotic diseases. It is very appropriate that the Parliament should devote time to a critical but constructive discussion about Australia's quarantine procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to devote my remarks to three areas: Firstly, the difficulty of the problem of completely quarantining Australia from the entry of that which is undesirable; secondly, the fact that we have not had more outbreaks of exotic diseases is due more to good luck than to good management, although I would say that on the evidence it is hard to prove that because we have not had much of a problem with such outbreaks; and, thirdly, the question of administrative arrangements and the need for Australia's quarantine service to be located within the Department of Primary Industry. I am leading for the Opposition in the debate because my major concern is in regard to the Bill and its relationship to the primary industries rather than human health. </PARA>
<PARA> As an aside to the three main points I will be addressing, I want to make some reference to the debate on whether we should have the Australian National Animal Health Laboratory and whether the quarantine station at the Cocos (Keeling) Islands is really necessary. I hope I understand the technological arguments that put both those facilities under a cloud if looked at scientifically, taking into account the progress likely to be made in the next few years. One of the first speeches I made in this place, as the member for Macarthur, was on the need for a maximum security animal health laboratory. I have been critical of the Fraser Government for its tardiness in not proceeding with the construction of the laboratory as quickly as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent outbreaks of vesicular disease in pigs it has been seen that we are still dependent on overseas diagnostic facilities, and the chills that pass down the spine of Australia's livestock industry every time an outbreak occurs would be lessened if we had more experts and facilities on the spot. I believe the ANAHL has a place, and will have a place even given advanced technology. In particular, the production of non-infective synthetic vaccines is the technology that gives people reason to say that we do not need the laboratory. I think we very definitely need the laboratory, particularly to meet the need for diagnosis, research, training, the quality control of vaccines and the need for scientific exchange. There is a range of lesser roles that it could carry out. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not so sure about the life or the utility of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands facility but there still seems to be an argument advanced that semen and ova imports can be carriers of a number of viruses. If one looks at the functions of the Bureau of Animal Health it is apparent that the ANAHL will be the focus of activity and the major facility at its disposal. It may be a negative argument, but even if technology does overtake the need for the laboratory in its original form, I believe such a facility will readily be able to be used for other scientific purposes such as research and training. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have mentioned the Bureau of Animal Health and the ANAHL, it may not be a bad time to itemise the responsibilities of the Bureau because it will fit very much into Australia's quarantine arrangements and into the whole area of the prevention of exotic diseases coming into Australia. As well as providing the Commonwealth Government's meat inspection services the Bureau of Animal Health provides a professional and technical advisory service on all matters relating to animal and poultry health, reports on the effects of animal health and breeding, undertakes research and investigation into epidemiology, operates a national disease recording system, supervises livestock export health testing, provides technical advice and representation at national and international meetings, provides the secretariat for the Animal Health Committee and the Cattle Tick Control Commission, co-ordinates major national animal disease programs, co-ordinates exotic disease contigency planning, provides advice on standards of export meat inspection and operates veterinary services within the Australian Capital Territory. Itemising the role of the Bureau of Animal Health provides another very strong reason for putting all these matters under discussion into the Department of Primary Industry. The human part of quarantine is no longer as important as it once was. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the three matters to which I said I would mainly address myself. I think the amendments contained in this Bill should be used to tighten considerably quarantine restrictions at major points of entry of people. However, the problem still remains of people entering Australia unchecked-for example, the refugees or boat people, or fishermen landing on isolated stretches of coast for short periods. I am talking about the problems of actually having a 100 per cent quarantine service. It is a massive task to do anything about unchecked entries and it is very much a case of catch as catch can. But I would say that there seems to have been no assessment of the costs versus the benefits of the actions we are taking. There is a need for a government to make that assessment and to make the results public. As it is, I often have the feeling that I am not quite sure what is happening or whether the measures taken are adequate. A moment ago-the Minister for Health agreed with me-I said that it is a common view that it is more by good luck than by good management-</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr KERIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is what the Minister agreed with: On the past record that can not be proved because we have done very well. As the threat gets larger-I think it is a growing threat-we have to be constantly vigilant in this area. Another problem that will remain concerns viruses borne by non-human carriers such as the wind, birds and insects. Page 36 of the report of the Senate Committee on National Resources on the adequacy of quarantine refers to this matter when it mentions the problem of the screw worm fly. The report reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the field of animal quarantine probably the most immediate known threat is the introduction of screw worm fly from Papua New Guinea. This fly is a threat particularly to the cattle industry-it lays its eggs in open wounds . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I will not go on with that since we have all just had dinner. Anyhow, it is hard to stop the flies flying across the border. It is a particular risk. Again, preventing entry is an impossible task. The Government needs also to develop a system which will ensure early detection and isolation of any viruses which do enter Australia and which are a threat. It needs to have worked out a strategy for the control of disease if an outbreak occurs. Again, this strategy should be made public. The compensation provisions of any strategy would also need to be worked out carefully and made public. Producers need to have their economic viability restored. For example, in a recent case in Tasmania the compensation paid did not cover the replacement cost of the destroyed property. We must acknowledge that there will be gaps in any quarantine system, but we need to be aware of what the gaps are and to know that Australia has a second line of defence ready to be implemented in the event of an outbreak of disease. Finally, we need to recognise that, because of the export orientation, livestock production in Australia is much more vulnerable to the adverse effects of exotic disease emergencies than is the case in most countries. For example, the discovery of foot and mouth disease in Australia would disrupt the export of 90 per cent of meats normally exported, and some reaction could be expected even against Australian wool, despite the technical evidence relating to the virus being unable to survive in wool. </PARA>
<PARA> In am trying to stress that this is a very serious matter. I have already given some qualification of this view, but I repeat that, to date, Australia's quarantine system has operated on a basis of good luck rather than good management. For example, in a keynote address to an exotic disease emergency seminar held last year, the director of the Bureau of Animal Health pointed out that our national luck in avoiding most major exotic disease influences might be wearing a bit thin, as the last five years had seen a series of eight exotic disease incidents and scares affecting various livestock-based industries. The Minister stated in his second reading speech:</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill is a reflection of the Government's strong commitment to an efficient quarantine service. </PARA>
<PARA>To achieve this efficient service, the Government's strategy is as follows, firstly, to establish a high security animal quarantine station on the Cocos Islands, at an estimated cost of quarantine of about $15,000 per animal, and to extend the application of the Quarantine Act to take in the Cocos Island. Secondly, and I quote from the Minister's speech:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . to make . . . changes to overcome deficiencies experienced in the administration of the Act and make it more responsive to modern situations. </PARA>
<PARA> One of those changes is to remove the liability of the Commonwealth to pay compensation for imported livestock destroyed in accordance with the Act where the animals has been in quarantine since importation. The Government's attitude is that that is an insurable risk, and again I can take quotations from the report of the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources which back the Government in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the major deficiences of the existing quarantine system relates to the administrative arrangements. This is ignored by the Government in its proposed amendments to modernise the Quarantine Act. The Quarantine Act currently is administered by the Commonwealth Department of Health, with that Department assuming overall responsibility for the administration of not only human but also plant and animal quarantine. One glance at a chart of the organisational structure of the quarantine system indicates the unnecessarily cumbersome procedures created by this allocation of responsibility. For the plant and animal quarantine services the line of authority moves from the Commonwealth Department of Health to the State departments of agriculture, which then effectively run the services. Only the human quarantine service functions totally within the Department of Health. </PARA>
<PARA> Since World War II the thrust of our quarantine system has shifted significantly away from human diseases towards plant and animal diseases. This reflects both a greater understanding of plant and animal quarantine problems and changes world wide in the human disease situation. Quarantine in Australia is now primarily concerned with preventing the entry of agricultural pests and diseases and not human disease, as was the case when the Quarantine Act was introduced in 1908. At the point of entry humans are now more important as carriers of animal and plant diseases than as carriers of human diseases. Exotic human diseases are rarely discovered at the point of entry because they tend to appear later, when the traveller is out in the community. An efficient and effective quarantine system is vital to the continued prosperity of Australia's rural industries. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude on this note: The outbreak of any new animal disease in Australia could result not only in the loss of a significant proportion of our livestock but also in a very serious and possibly complete reduction of opportunities to continue trading in overseas markets, which currently take the bulk of Australia's livestock production. Because of its export orientation, Australia's livestock production is particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of exotic disease emergencies, and I have already given some figures on that. In response to a recognition that it is Australia's industries that stand to lose the most from an in- efficient quarantine system, in recent years there have been a number of suggestions that the Commonwealth's administrative arrangements for quarantine should be reorganised to reflect the changed priorities which I have just set out. The suggested rearrangements were put forward mainly in the report of the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources, but other reports have dealt with this matter. The rearrangement referred to in the report relates to a formal link between agricultural quarantine and other Commonwealth responsibilities for agricultural matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Government initiated a proposal for a unified quarantine service to be operated solely by the Commonwealth. It is not so much the Bill before the House but the so-called razor gang report which seems to want to put it almost entirely into the State sphere. A second proposal was put forward in 1977 by the Australian Agricultural Council that animal and plant quarantine should be given to the Department of Primary Industry. In early 1978 the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) advised that there would be no change in the existing arrangements. As I have already pointed out, the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources inquiry into the adequacy of quarantine concluded that an Australian quarantine service located in the Commonwealth Department of Primary Industry should be created. True to the Prime Minister's word, the Quarantine Amendment Bill does not incorporate at that recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA> At the outset of these brief comments I said that we are not concerned very much about the administrative arrangements, except to say that the arguments are very strong. We are very concerned by what we read in the razor gang's report about handing over further functions to the States. We believe that the most important thing for Australia is to have a first rate quarantine service. Instead of the razor gang looking with an accountant's pen approach at how it can foist a few functions onto the States, we should be looking first of all at what is the best quarantine service for Australia and working out what the administrative arrangements should be. I believe that the Senate Committee looked at that. It proposed another structure that did not diminish the Commonwealth's role but seemed to be much more sensible. Now that the razor gang's report has come down, I hope that the Minister in his reply to the various points made in the House will take up this point. Will the quarantine arrangements be the main concern of the Government or is it simply and coldbloodedly trying to work out some way of getting rid of the quarantine service and making the States pay for the officers involved in quarantine surveillance? It is for those reasons that I moved my amendment, and I will not read it again. It is before honourable members. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin), who was once the member for Macarthur, made the point that, when he was the member for Macarthur, in one of his early speeches in this place he made reference to the need for an animal health laboratory to be established at Geelong. My second or third speech in this House was a little similar in that I referred to the need for a maximum security quarantine station. As I had been a director of the largest artificial breeding co-operative in Australia I had a considerable interest in the subject of animals and I have maintained that interest. I commend the Minister for Health (Mr McKellar) on these amendments to the Quarantine Act. Together with the 1979 amendments, they indicate that great progress has been made by this Government in updating the Quarantine Act to make it more appropriate for our present circumstances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also want to commend the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources for its report on the adequacy of quarantine procedures. That has been quite a catalyst in the updating of necessary legislation. The Minister pointed out in his second reading speech that this legislation covers several distinct sections of the Quarantine Act. The Cocos (Keeling) Islands Territory quarantine arrangements need to be made appropriate prior to the arrival of the first shipment of cattle from North America which I understand will be in November of this year. Those arrangements provide additional powers for quarantine officers, remove compensation for animals which have to be destroyed at a quarantine station and generally implement the remaining recommendations of the Senate Committee which the Government considers it can actually implement. </PARA>
<PARA> The Cocos (Keeling) Island Territory generally must have adequate quarantine regulations if there is to be an effective working of the high security quarantine station. I believe that is a very appropriate part of the amendments. The additional powers which this legislation gives to quarantine officers will give them the same powers as Customs officers with the exception of the power to order a body search. Officers should now have adequate power to apprehend and control animals and plants which may be brought to Australia either legally or illegally by ship or other vessel. I particularly congratulate the Minister on his decision to amend the Act to require the masters of all ships and aircraft travelling to Australia to advise all those on board of Australia's quarantine requirements. There has been a conscious effort over the last few years to inform Australians and those on flights entering Australia of the reasons for our Quarantine Act and to inform them of the requirements on flights into Australia. Generally the more that people are told the more that people will co-operate. </PARA>
<PARA> Until now information for those flying into Australia has been passive; that is, by pamphlet. A considerable step forward is an authoritative announcement by the captain of a vessel which is far more positive, effective and certain. There are two weaknesses in the system at the port of entry I want to refer to and draw to the Minister's attention. I believe adequate power already exists to overcome these two weaknesses. The first concerns the purchase of a souvenir overseas which is made from plants or animals, the entry of which will not be permitted for quarantine or endangered species reasons. Recently I dealt with a case of this nature in which people tried to bring back stuffed tortoises from the Philippines. I was advised that travel agents have booklets which give to those leaving Australia details of what they should or should not bring back. Unfortunately, quite often the person going overseas leaves Australia without being given such a booklet. I suggest to the Minister that the most likely person to purchase such a souvenir is an Australian tourist. If that booklet could be given to tourists together with their boarding pass-in other words it is forced into their hands at the time of departure when they are more likely to read and consider that sort of thing rather than relying on the travel agents giving them this booklet-this would have a beneficial effect. If my understanding of the presentation of that booklet is not correct I would welcome the Minister's correction. </PARA>
<PARA> The second and more serious problem with which I wish to deal is the passive and casual way in which people entering Australia and proceeding through Customs direct themselves to the quarantine section and the seemingly equally casual way in which those quarantine officers question those people. There is a widespread belief among passengers that the best way to beat Customs and avoid a baggage search is to get into the quarantine line because once they get into the quarantine line they are safe from Customs and can bring in all the illegal or over the limit goodies that they want to bring in. The Senate Committee report recommended that quarantine officers be given powers of search and that a separate random sampling technique for quarantine purposes-separate but similar to the random searches for Customs purposes-be initiated. This is a sensible suggestion. As quarantine officers have this power a random quarantine search additional to the self-declaration procedure should be introduced. It would please me to hear the Minister state whether that procedure is already in operation. On my recent return from Japan I saw no evidence of it at the Sydney airport. If it is not being used at present I believe it is essential that this procedure be instituted if we are to have any effective quarantine procedure for entry to this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Those who are put in the quarantine line, whether it is because of self-declaration or random sampling, should be required randomly to have a Customs search to overcome this widespread feeling that in order to avoid Customs one should put oneself into the quarantine line by stating that one has been on a farm somewhere. A further Senate Committee recommendation to which I wish to draw the attention of the Minister-I realise it is not his responsibility but it is most important in the prosecution of quarantine violators-is the Committee's reference to the fact that Australian surveillance aircraft had an unfortunate habit of flying along the coast at the same time every day. While they followed this procedure everybody knew the time at which this took place and adjusted their entry or exit from this country accordingly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe some of them were even that regular. I hope that now-as this was pointed out some time ago in that Committee report-that problem has been overcome by some form of staggered or random flying. I would welcome the Minister's comment on this point. The related issues of development of the Cocos quarantine station and the Australian National Animal Health Laboratory at Geelong at last have become a reality or are on their way to reality after years of discussion and debate. The quarantine station at Cocos is about to commence. The laboratory at Geelong is well under construction. These two centres were the subject of some controversy recently at the cattle council seminar on quarantine. The point was correctly made in reports on the seminar which I have read that after talking and planning for many years it is questionable whether these facilities are now appropriate or even necessary. Professor Morris, as reported in various newspapers, challenged their relevance and value.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin) has pointed out that the Geelong laboratory is redundant because of synthetic vaccines. However, my understanding of the report in the newspaper is that Professor Morris ignored a major function of the laboratory at Geelong which is the diagnosis of foot and mouth disease in cases such as the Tasmanian scare and the New Zealand scare. Irrespective of vaccines of any type, until the laboratory at Geelong is operating we will require the material to be sent to the Purbright laboratory in the United Kingdom and will experience time delay problems. Following upon that is the necessity for the development of particular strains of vaccines. This could be done more appropriately and quickly in this country if an outbreak ever occurs. The honourable member for Werriwa referred to the bad geographic position of the Cocos facility and the developments with semen and ova transplant technology et cetera. He pointed out also that semen can carry foot and mouth disease, bluetongue and other diseases of tremendous danger to this country. At least in the period ahead our best protection will be by obtaining live animals through Cocos. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members might remember the problems associated with the choice of the site for the animal quarantine station. It had to be sufficiently far away from the Australian mainland to be free of insect carriers et cetera. This brought with it the problem of under-utilisation because of costs. The geographical problem together with increased oil prices mean that transport costs to get an animal to Cocos are very high unless there is a full load. There would be problems also with the viability of bringing numbers of animals from a particular country or region and the fact that there is no backloading from Cocos. Putting aside the transport costs, I was reassured by the Minister's statement that due to the way in which the station is constructed and being managed the 1973 estimates of operational costs will still apply. That is quite an achievement. I understand that due to this problem of transport costs the first consignment of cattle from Europe has been cancelled. There does appear to be a need for a co-ordinated transport operation to make, if we like, the best use of the station as possible. Perhaps, the Australian Registered Cattle Breeders Association could act in some co-ordinating capacity for the stud breeders groups or the commercial groups. </PARA>
<PARA> It is recognised that the Cocos (Keeling) Islands station probably will have sporadic use. Initially there will be utilisation from North America and western Europe. Then there will probably be another period of greater activity once Geelong opens for those breeds from Africa and elsewhere which are not considered safe to bring in at the present time. I am pleased that earlier problems with the priorities committee and disputes between stud breeders and animal scientists on the question of priorities and use of the Cocos Islands have been satisfactorily overcome. I support the legislation and acknowledge the work of the Minister and the Department and after so many years the commencement of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands station. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Australia is one of the few countries that are virtually free of serious animal plagues, plant pests and disease. This could very well be because of the position of the country, because we are an island continent. That has given this country great advantages in the past. One of those great advantages of being an island continent no longer exists. We must realise that there have been changes in quarantine in that human disease is no longer the threat that it was when legislation on quarantine was first introduced. Exotic human diseases are rarely found at ports of entry because of the speed with which people are able to travel from place to place. Many factors have led to a changing philosophy in human quarantine in recent times. Medical science has advanced and, whilst quarantine is still vitally important, for humans it does not any longer have the same characteristics as quarantine does for animals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Quarantine Amendment Bill is almost totally related to animals and plants. In supporting the amendment moved by the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin), I am concerned at the changes that will take place with the implementation of the Lynch razor gang report-the Review of Commonwealth Functions. The Government appears to be hell-bent on shifting responsibility to the States and to others to carry the costs of the burden. The Senate Standing Committee on National Resources considered in its report:</PARA>
<PARA>That in meeting the new challenges facing quarantine steps should be taken to improve the status of the quarantine service, and to increase public awareness of, and respect for, quarantine requirements. </PARA>
<PARA>I am sure that when that report was brought down the Senate Standing Committee was not intending to increase public awareness in the way that it has been in the last couple of weeks. I quote from a couple of reports in newspapers from Victoria. There were reports in newspapers from all over Australia. On 30 April 1981 the Sun had a headline: 'Womble hunt for thousands'. The article read:</PARA>
<PARA> The hamster hunt along the eastern Australian coast took on a new twist yesterday when it was learned up to 22,000 'wombles' could be involved. </PARA>
<PARA>Here we have a situation in the recent past-in the last week or two-where the quarantine measures of this country, the very nature of the health of human beings and of animals, have been placed at risk. On 29 April 1981 the Age stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Quarantine officials have seized more than 250 pet hamsters and gerbils in Melbourne, Brisbane and Caloundra which they believe could be infected with rabies and meningitis. </PARA>
<PARA>Rabies is a disease that this country is free of. Yet, we have a situation where we have these creatures in this country at the present time. They have been brought in illegally. That shows that somewhere along the line there has been a very bad breakdown in our quarantine situation. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to a method that apparently this Government has decided to use to overcome this problem. I refer to a joint Press statement by the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar) and the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Moore). This apparently shows a new way of how we will protect this country with quarantine measures. The Press statement is headed: 'Children and parents asked to find hamsters'. The statement reads:</PARA>
<PARA> It is estimated that approximately 600 of the animals are at present in Australia. The Ministers said investigators had learnt that hamsters had been offered for sale in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria in the guise of cartoon characters known as 'Wombles'. </PARA>
<PARA>A few questions need to be answered as to how these creatures were able to get into the country. Why were they able to spread so widely before anybody realised that the whole future perhaps of agriculture in this country had been placed at risk as well as the fact that rabies could be spread throughout the country? I think the Minister should clearly answer in this debate the question as to why those wombles-as they are called-were able to get through the system. It shows a very poor weakness in the system and the way it works at the present time. </PARA>

We know how many rabbits there are around the country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer again to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The creation of an Australian quarantine service located in the Commonwealth Department of Primary Industry would reflect the changing priorities of quarantine and effectively link quarantine to the overall agricultural health responsibilities of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA>Whether the policy section of the Australian quarantine service is located in the Health Department or the Primary Industry Department is not the crucial issue. There may be good reasons for a decision to move the service to the Department of Primary Industry for administration benefits. However, what is important is how the quarantine is managed. To me, the alarming fact is that this Government, by its obsession with cutting out spending which can be publicly accounted for and by transferring responsibilities to private enterprise, is placing agriculture in this country at risk. I quote again from the Minister's second reading speech. On page 6 he stated:</PARA>
<PARA> During coastal surveillance operations, a number of unauthorised landings in Australia have been reported. In the main, these breaches of quarantine legislation have been by foreign fishing vessels. These quarantine breaches by small craft in remote areas of Australia pose grave threats to the introduction of major exotic diseases. </PARA>
<PARA>Maybe they also allow wombles to get into the country. The Minister continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Foot and mouth disease, Newcastle disease and rabies are some of the diseases from which Australia is free but which are all well established in adjacent countries. </PARA>
<PARA>We would not think so from some of the actions of this Government. The Minister continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Much of our northern coastline of this country is backed by economically important livestock areas which are also abundantly populated with feral animals and insect vectors capable of transmitting any introduced exotic disease. </PARA>
<PARA>These are all very important statements. The Minister went on:</PARA>
<PARA> For this reason any reports of an authorised landing evoke a quarantine investigation of the landing place and appropriate measures to minimise the possibility of disease introduction. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister mentioned coastal surveillance. Here I think, we are seeing where the greatest weakness is: This Commonwealth Government, this Fraser Government, does not want to take its full responsibility. First of all, coastal surveillance is done now by private enterprise. It is done on a tender system which means that the people who are doing the surveillance are cutting costs according to their budgets as much as they possibly can because they have to make a profit. </PARA>
<PARA> That tender system leaves a very large weakness in the whole system. It is open to infiltration. The staff who work for the private companies cannot be vetted by anybody in any public position. If this function were done by a navy, army, air force or some government body there could be vetting of the staff. As we know, surveillance is done on the basis of a five-day week. It is not done at weekends. Everybody in Darwin knows just when the planes are flying. It would not be very hard for the staff of an organisation to let those who wanted to import things into Australia know when to do so. The Government is letting the country down by not taking its full responsibility, by handing this matter over to private enterprise. Looking after the coastal surveillance of this country is not a private enterprise job. The planes fly set routes. Everybody knows what the routes are. Ask anybody in Darwin and they will soon say just when the planes are flying. It would not be very hard to bring in a boat load of wombles but we would need only a few because they breed like rabbits. I would like the Minister to tell us clearly how this legislation will improve our quarantine situation in any way at all. In the next paragraph of the Minister's second reading speech, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Quarantine actions of this type have highlighted serious practical deficiencies in the relevant enforcement and penalty provisions of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA>It is fair enough that we should tighten up the Act, because it has weaknesses. But we have to catch the culprit before we can take him to court. If the surveillance system is to work on a roster of eight hours a day or consist of a run down the coast and back which everybody knows about I do not think that we will be using this Act very often to prosecute many people. They will very easily dodge the surveillance system. That is a very poor situation for the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a few questions that the Minister can perhaps answer for me when he replies to the second reading debate. In the Senate Committee's report reference was made to the need for facilities for poultry as well as animals on the Cocos Islands. I would like the Minister to let us know what is going on in that regard. Another question relates to an incident which has occurred in the last few days. A B52 bomber has landed in Darwin. Are those aircraft subject to quarantine? If so, will the officers of his Department who have to go on board to fumigate the aircraft be notified if the bombers are carrying nuclear weapons? I would also like the Minister to tell us his attitude to the possibility of people entering Australia directly from Bali being treated as though they had been on a farm and having their shoes placed in disinfectant. The number of people coming to Australia from Bali could have very dangerous implications for Australia's quarantine laws. Australia's favourable disease status is of vital importance to its overseas trade in agricultural products. If we need proof of that we have only to look to the other side of the House to see who will be speaking in this debate tonight. Two members of the National Country Party, not the Liberal Party, will be speaking. </PARA>
<PARA> Freedom from major exotic diseases, is a pre-requisite for access to many markets which are of vital economic importance to this country. We have only to recall the range of restrictions imposed on Australia's exports as a result of the bluetongue scare in 1977-78. Freedom from exotic disease also enables many agricultural industries to minimise their costs of production. Being free of disease is a great asset for this country. I think it is the responsibility of the Federal Government to see that it stays that way. In recent years there have been a number of suggestions that the Commonwealth administrative arrangements for quarantine should be reorganised. The Labor Government of 1972 to 1975 initiated proposals for a unified quarantine service operated solely by the Commonwealth. The reason that the Opposition has moved this amendment this evening is that it is concerned that the Government seems hell-bent on switching functions to the States and not picking up its own responsibilities. Exports worth $5,000m depend on the Government's taking up its responsibilities in respect of quarantine. Let us consider the seriousness of what could happen if we had a plague of hamsters and gerbils running around the country like rabbits. Our total quarantine situation could be placed in jeopardy. Those animals would travel, breed and spread disease. The so-called Fraser federalism or razor gang proposals do not equate with a sensible approach to quarantine. An industry with exports in excess of $5,000m should be able to rely on Commonwealth support. It should not be fragmented and handed to private enterprise or broken up in such a way that there is no security. Another Bill relating to the beef industry will be introduced in this session. That industry has been handed $118m in concessions over the last three or four years. If the Commonwealth can make handouts to the industry for political purposes, surely it can make money available to guarantee the future of the industry. Money needs to be invested by the Commonwealth to guarantee the agricultural industry and the health of the people of this country. It is a shame that this Government is prepared to opt out of its responsibilities. I solidly support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Werriwa. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like briefly to support the Quarantine Amendment Bill and to compliment the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar) on bringing it before the House. I appreciate that the Opposition has moved an amendment to the Bill but, broadly speaking, we are all in accord with one thing, and that is that we must jealously guard the stock and the people of Australia in our quarantine measures. The amendments in the Bill before the House are principally concerned with tightening up the Act. They give to the officers concerned greater powers in relation to inspections. I am vitally concerned with the operation of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands quarantine station. Over the years we have witnessed our beef and dairy cattle breeders importing large quantities of semem. We appreciate that we are unable to import livestock from most of the primary producing countries. This legislation will enable us to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We cannot let this Bill pass without emphasising its very great importance to the primary industries of Australia. It tightens our quarantine measures and gives the people of Australia an awareness of their responsibilities in relation to them. We are virtually free of the major diseases that are present in most other countries. Those diseases are very close to our shores, not so much in Papua New Guinea, but within a couple of hours by air and a day or so by ship. We are trying to keep out exotic diseases such as bluetongue and foot and mouth. We cannot afford to be careless. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member should not interrupt. The honourable member for McMillan (Mr Cunningham) spent most of his speech not only criticising the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) but also talking about the gerbils that we have been reading about in the Press of late. If Opposition members opposite were to concentrate on agricultural, as the honourable member did only towards the end of his speech, there might be some substance in what they say.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I stress that this country has a very long coastline. From Geraldton to Cairns, is only half the coastline of Australia. It takes tremendous surveillance to protect us from ships and people coming into Australia. I do not agree with the honourable member for McMillan, who maintained that surveillance is not being conducted in a proper manner. Certainly, we would all like to see greater surveillance of the Australian coastline, whether it be in the north or the south. My information is that these surveillance flights are staggered. It is the Government's policy that they be carried out by private enterprise in most cases. That is a better way to carry out this task because these private enterprises have the aircraft and the facilities to do it. I do not think we can expect our armed forces to carry out this necessary work around the entire Australian coastline. The Government is concerned about the number of boats under 45 metres in length landing on the shores of Australia with people from other lands on board. They land here without letting us know before hand. I appreciate that under this Act there are quarantine measures carried out on their arrival but as far as we are concerned they are not adequate. </PARA>
<PARA> We feel that it is important that this Act is tightened up. The Government appreciates the responsibility it has to look after the quarantine of this country. I think that the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin) said that if foot and mouth disease broke out in Australia it would cost us $2,500m in the first year. There is no need to emphasise that this is basically a primary producing country and that we have to protect and assist in the building up of our national herds and plant life. We must not forget that a growing number of tourists visit Australia yearly, and that greater numbers of these are coming from countries to our north. I am very pleased that the Minister has indicated in the Bill that more information will be available to people entering Australia both by plane and ship of the quarantine measures we are conducting.</PARA>
<PARA> There is one particular matter appertaining to quarantine that I would like to stress this evening. Last Thursday night I spoke on the adjournment debate about the dangers one can see in relation to the disposal of garbage from visiting ships, appreciating the fact that these ships carry with them food from their countries of origin. I stressed the point then that in the Newcastle area one can generally see at any time anything between a dozen to 40-odd large container ships anchored off the harbour. If one goes to Wollongong, Port Kembla and, I dare say, other ports around Australia, one will find the same situation. I have been informed that the quarantine measures ensure that the garbage is sprayed before it leaves the ships. These ships that are at anchorage at various ports around Australia and those traversing our coastline are tipping garbage into the sea. That garbage is landing on our shores. I know that there are wild pigs and wild dogs in the Newcastle area because it is adjacent to bush land which runs to the forestry land in the areas of the Great Dividing Range. These pigs and dogs are able to get through to the coast and, if exotic disease were contained within the ships' garbage, it would certainly be spread around the Australian countryside. </PARA>
<PARA> I was informed only this afternoon that it is the feeling of the quarantine authorities that the garbage found in these regions is basically from the Newcastle area and not from the ships. This is hard to believe because only the other day the shire council concerned informed me that it believed after inspecting the area that the majority of the garbage came from the boats that were anchored off-shore. I stress that point because I believe it is very important that we are aware of this problem. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose that ships are basically the means by which we can expect diseases and animals to be brought into Australia. When I speak of animals I mean poultry. There have been reports that poultry has been landed on the shores of Australia from some of the fishing vessels from the East that have been fishing off-shore. Naturally these vessels are hard to detect. Although quarantine measures are conducted on container ships which are tied up at the wharves in any of the ports of Australia, there is a possibility that unless a close inspection is made, rats and other animals from the ships will trot off onto the wharves, get onto the trucks and distribute themselves around the farmlands and cities of Australia. We have to be aware of these things. I can assure honourable members that any measures that this Government can take to strengthen this Quarantine Act will be very important to the primary producers of Australia. They look to us to take the maximum measures that we possibly can to ensure that these measures are taken. </PARA>
<PARA> I said something earlier concerning the Cocos (Keeling) Islands quarantine station. As the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) said earlier, the station will be open from approximately November. I know that this is welcomed particularly by the breeders of pure bred animals within Australia. Previously semen imported from America had to come through great Britain and to comply with its quarantine regulations. It was required to remain in quarantine for two years before it was allowed to come into Australia. Although the Cocos (Keeling) Islands station at this time does not actually have the facilities for the quarantine of semen, it certainly does have the facilities for the quarantine of animals. The breeders of this country will be able to import beef stock, dairy stock and horses from the best breeds throughout the world. With artificially inseminated semen being available we have been able to improve the herds and we will certainly be able to do more so in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Minister is replying I ask him to say something about the future plans of the Department of Health so far as the quarantine of AI semen from overseas is concerned, both for the dairy herds and for the beef herds of Australia. I think many of our growers are interested to know just what the future will be in this respect. As I said earlier, this Bill contains most important amendments to a very important Act and certainly gives to the officers of the Department concerned every assurance on the tightening up they need. It brings the responsibility to the State, and rightfully so. It is a matter of philosophy as to whether the Commonwealth should control these things, and whether it should be the only body in this field. Certainly it is the duty of the Commonwealth to initiate the legislation. But we believe that the experts in the various departments of agriculture in our States are the people who understand on the farm agriculture and the measures that have to be taken to protect it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Quarantine is too important a matter to be the subject of small party debate. Some very serious concern has been shown in this House about its administration and effectiveness. I have to challenge the suggestions of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Cowan), that the present scrutiny of the Australian coastline is satisfactory. It is anything but satisfactory. Substantial proportions of the Australian coast are policed in the most cursory manner. I understand the difficulties associated with extending that policing in any form. I want to make one request of the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar), and that is, that he makes a clear statement of the Government's intentions under the razor gang's recommendations of handing quarantine facilities over to the States. If it did that it would be a disaster for primary industry in Australia because the States are neither competent nor capable of carrying out that function, nor would the State governments expend the funds necessary to do it properly. The honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) would probably confirm this, but in Victoria and New South Wales there are quarantine safeguards regarding fruit fly. At Yarrawonga there are two bridges over the Murray River with approximately the same distance-physical, not political-between them as now exists between me and the honourable member for Murray. One bridge is manned from nine until five and the other is not manned at all. So those who do want to bring in a case of oranges or some other goods--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, not apples, oranges. We fixed the apples. They have to get across the sea and the Commonwealth inspects them. Quite seriously, there is no real quarantine facility nor capacity. Those who often walk down the concourse at Melbourne airport will be aware that the last time it was manned for quarantine purposes was in about 1966. One is asked to comply with regulations on an honour system. Quarantine is important. The problems which this Parliament experienced over a number of years largely arose out of the Tourmer case but also out of the maladministration which was disclosed in the numbers of inquiries which took place into that case. They indicated quite clearly that the Commonwealth must handle the quarantine laws in Australia. It is not a matter which can be left to some political, theoretical position. It is real. Damage that would be done from any back-off would also be real. In the past the quarantine laws have not been administered as well as they should nor as tightly as they should. That is not the fault of any government. We have had problems over a long period with quarantine. It is a difficult matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I ask the Minister to assure the House that the Commonwealth intends to accept its responsibilities to protect Australia from the dangers of breaches of quarantine. I do not agree that the policing of the Australian coastline is satisfactory. I wish to raise a question which was raised by the honourable member for McMillian (Mr Cunningham). A civil aircraft landing in Australia is sprayed for insects and all other materials. I do not intend to labour the point, but I want to know whether military aircraft are subject to the same quarantine provisions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank all of those who took part in the debate this evening. I believe, as all speakers have said, that this is a most important matter. The Government is committed to a strong and efficient quarantine service. That is demonstrated by the comprehensive Bill before the House which must continue to play an effective and major role in Australia's social and economic well-being. We are all concerned to ensure that the quarantine service is strong and effective and that it does protect Australia's plant and livestock industries as well as our health. I assure the House that no decisions will be made by the Government which would weaken the quarantine service or compromise the quarantine controls on which we, as a nation, rely so heavily.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The report of the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources which has been mentioned by various speakers was welcomed by the Government. This was made abundantly clear in the Government's response which was tabled in another place in September 1980. This response, I remind honourable members, indicated acceptance of substantially all of the Senate Committee's recommendations. The Senate Standing Committee on National Resources strongly endorsed the long-established practice of delegation of animal and plant operational quarantine functions to the States. The Committee states in the summary of the report that:</PARA>
<PARA> The delegated role of the States in undertaking the operational role in respect of plant and animal quarantine has been very successful and should be continued. </PARA>
<PARA>We, on this side of the House, do not have the contempt for State governments and State administrations which is very evident in the contributions which have been made by honourable members opposite. But in view of that point it must therefore be regarded as totally responsible and in accordance with the spirit of the Senate Committee report to examine the feasibility-I underline that statement, to examine the feasibility-of extending an arrangement which the Senate Committee so heartily endorsed. I would also like to make brief reference to page 59 of the Standing Committee report which states, in respect to delegations to the States that:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the advantages of State involvement are numerous-particularly access to expert local knowledge, co-operation in policy making, and uniting operational responsibility for quarantine and disease control within the States. </PARA>
<PARA>I remind the House that, as stated in my second reading speech, the amendments contained in the Bill, taken in conjunction with the amendments effected in the Quarantine Amendment Act 1979, do meet the specific concern raised by the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources which is appropriate to quarantine legislation. Some other matters were raised by honourable member. The honourable member for Werriwa mentioned a number of matters. After his speech he asked me what would happen in relation to avian genetic material. I can assure him that the matter is under active consideration at present. It will not be going to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands quarantine station. We are looking at a mainland station for quarantine requirements in relation to the importation of avian material. </PARA>
<PARA> I am grateful to the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) for his contribution to the debate. He injected a note of perhaps unintentional levity when he spoke about staggered and random flying. I hope that it was not too staggered or random in the surveillance of the Australian coastline. I take the point that he was making. We do not need to have and we do not have the situation in which planes are undertaking surveillance of the Australian coastline at the same time each day. The point is well taken and was well taken some time ago and has been very much understood and catered for by the arrangements which are presently in place. He mentioned also the question of random checks of people coming into Australia through airports and particularly those who claim to have been in contact with farm animals or farm material. In fact, random checks are made of all passengers coming through Australian airports. So we are alive to the situation which has been mentioned by the honourable member for Murray and we seek to overcome any procedures which would allow a person or persons to try to get around our quarantine procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Werriwa said that it is only by good luck that Australia has been so successful in relation to quarantine matters. If it is only good luck that we have been successful then we have had good luck for a long time. I think the runs on the board are such that we can truthfully claim that the quarantine procedures are, in fact, working remarkably well. The honourable member for McMillan (Mr Cunningham) was concerned about animals he called wombles. Like so many people in the Australian Labor Party he has been reading a lot of fairy stories lately. There are no such things as wombles. They exist in people's imagination. In fact, there are animals called hamsters and gerbils. He is worried about them breeding like rabbits, but, in fact, they breed a little bit more quickly than rabbits We are extremely concerned about this question of hamsters and gerbils. There has been no breakdown in quarantine arrangements. It is easier for persons operating outside the law to hide a hamster, which is being sold as a womble, in Australia than it is to detect it. It is a fairly small animal after all. It is unrealistic to expect that any quarantine system could exclude all risks at the point of entry. What is essential is that once a risk is detected there is a rapid follow-up to overcome that situation. </PARA>
<PARA> We have received information which suggests that the joint Commonwealth-State control program has been extremely effective in apprehending-if one can use that term about these small animals-or in bringing to light the majority of these animals. I stress that our task is to respond quickly and effectively to any disease situation which does arise. This has been done and is being done. Further events are in the pipeline which, I believe, will add to the success of the campaign which has already been undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for McMillan also raised the question of B52 bombers, and that point was echoed later by the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes). I would just like to assure these honourable gentlemen and the House that B52 bombers are subject to quarantine regulations and are routinely disinfected. we are not going to abandon our quarantine procedures lightly or inadvisedly. In fact, and I make this point again, the quarantine procedures have been extremely successful over the years and we will ensure that we keep those successful quarantine procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> I am grateful to the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Cowan), who has had extensive experience in this area as a State member of parliament. I am quite sure he would not agree with any of the denigratory remarks about State governments which emanated from the Opposition side of the House. The honourable member for Corio talked about the question of handing over quarantine requirements to the States. I have outlined the situation which applies and I think that that situation is a totally responsible one. It is one which has at its heart the continued operation of an effective quarantine organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Werriwa raised the question of the location of the administration of the quarantine system. Of course, the administrative arrangements are a matter for the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). However, I point out that there are close links between human health, human quarantine and agricultural quarantine. Essentially, these links exist because people, goods, materials animals and plants and the vessels or aircraft in which they arrive and travel are possible avenues of diseases of humans, animals or plants. It is a fact that unfortunately many diseases are transmissable between animals and man by a variety of means. The factors I have outlined demand co-ordination of policies, operational strategies and procedures between all the branches of quarantine and that need is catered for in a simple, all-embracing Quarantine Act. I believe it is very well catered for under the current arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think it is fair to say, as has been implied by the honourable member for Werriwa, that we have only been lucky. I think great credit is due to those people who over the years have operated the quarantine service in Australia. That is in no sense a complacent statement. I am as much aware as anybody of the dangers of the introduction into this country of exotic plant and animal diseases and human diseases. As long as I have responsibility for the quarantine service I will be doing all I can to prevent any such introduction. </PARA>

The further amendment would insert an additional paragraph (c) in clause 15 of the Bill to extend the provisions of section 20 to make it an offence also for the master of an overseas vessel to beach the vessel or to anchor or moor the vessel above the low water mark around the shore of Australia or the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, excepting from stress of weather or other reasonable cause.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Mr Acting Speaker, I wish to make a short amendment to an answer that I provided to the House earlier in the day. I answered a question asked by the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Kent) in relation to Aboriginal health centres, womens refuges and the family planning program. I feel that my reply in relation to the family planning program may have been a little unclear. Therefore, I would like to clarify the position of the program under the new health funding arrangements. Whilst it is true to say, as I said, that the family planning program comes within the Community Health Program it is also a national program and therefore will not be funded through general revenue grants. This program will continue to be directly funded in the next financial year by the Commonwealth Government. As stated this afternoon, womens refuges will be funded in future throught the general revenue grants. A statement on Aboriginal medical assistance will be made to this House at a later time.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Bill seeks to amend the Census and Statistics Act to give effect to some of the recommendations on privacy in the census made by the Law Reform Commission some two years ago. The Government, through the Treasurer (Mr Howard) commented in November 1979 on these recommendations. The Bill gives legislative effect to those parts of the recommendations which the Government sees fit to adopt. The principal amendments involved are designed, to make clear that Australian Bureau of Statistics staff-collectors and interviewers-involved in the census are bound by the secrecy provision of the Act. It ensures that former officers of the Bureau are bound by the secrecy provisions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill substantially upgrades all penalties, as the Law Reform Commission recommended although it did not recommend any particular level of penalty to be applied. In fact, the increases in penalty are quite substantial. For failure to supply information to a census collector, failure to fill in a census form or refusal to answer all questions asked by Bureau officers the penalty is increased from $20 to $500 which is a very substantial increase indeed. For unauthorised disclosure of census information by Bureau officers or for supplying false information on a census form or in answer to a census officer the fine is increased from $100 to $1,000 or six months gaol or both. These large increases in penalty are obviously designed to ensure that in fact we have a census which accurately reflects the real situation in the nation. It seeks to ensure that we get full compliance by the population with the census and that the information provided is accurate and correct. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the increase in fines is very considerable and has given the Opposition some concern. We have decided not to oppose the legislation, bearing in mind the extreme importance of ensuring that the census is in fact very accurate and able to be relied on. However, the Law Reform Commission recommended in another report a general review of penalties applying in all Federal law make them consistent. In report No. 15 of the Law Reform Commission entitled 'Sentencing of Federal Offenders' recommendation 24 called for a sentencing council to be established to consider standardising penalties for federal offences. At present there are no clear standards for setting penalties; it is simply a rule of thumb. This is clearly not sufficiently specific to provide a rigorous, fair and equitable basis for setting penalties. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill fails to give effect to some of the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission on privacy in the census. I wish to refer to two of those recommendations which have not been adopted by the Government. The first of those is that census returns should be kept in the Archives with access, for most purposes, prohibited for 75 years. The second is that the precise wording of census questions should be included in regulations so they can be debated by Parliament. The second recommendation is one which does not concern us so much. I think it is regrettable that the Government did not adopt it, but the Opposition is not particularly upset about the fact that it is not in the legislation. I note that in a statement made by the Treasurer in November 1979 it was indicated that perhaps at some future date, for the next census, the Government would adopt this recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA> The other recommendation is of more importance. It is that returns should be kept in the Archives with possible access to them for medical purposes within 75 years. The fact is that at present Australia does not keep the census form returns. We simply destroy them. Up until 1971 we kept the census forms for the previous two censuses but in 1971 the Government decided to destroy all previous census records, and after the 1971 census had been processed the records for that census also were destroyed. In 1976 the census was, of course, only half processed as an economy measure-an absurd economy if ever I have seen one-and then all the returns were destroyed. So, we have had a history in the last decade or so of not keeping our census records, of destroying the census returns and the only records of censuses are those which are compiled on the computer tapes and in the documents published from the original census returns. </PARA>
<PARA> Idenified census returns would be of obvious benefit to historical, genealogical and sociological research because they would provide a unique snapshot of the Australian society at the particular time when the census is taken. I do not think it needs elaboration from me to see that in future years it may be of great benefit to researchers to be able to go back to the original documents and analyse them to get a much better idea of society at the time than would be available from the tabulations made by us now. In fact, the idea of keeping the census forms in the past-when we kept them-as I said, for the two previous censuses up until 1971-was to enable us to make further cross-tabulations after the original cross-tabulations had been made if it seemed sensible to do so later. Of course, in future years when we may wish to make those cross-tabulations in respect of years past we will not be able to do it because we will have destroyed the records. Obviously it would be of benefit for us in that regard but also, and probably much more importantly, it would be of benefit for researchers in the historical, genealogical and sociological areas to be able to make those researches. I am here talking of many years hence. </PARA>
<PARA> It has also been pointed out by the Law Reform Commission that census returns can be of great benefit for environmental medical research. It mentions in its report an example of the way in which that environmental medical research can be assisted by identified census returns. The evidence to which it refers was given to the United States House of Representatives Sub-committee on Census and the Population in 1975. On page 38 of the Law Reform Commission report on privacy and the census, it states:</PARA>
<PARA> The evidence examined by the House Committee included examples of the medical research uses to which census information might be put. A simple example is provided by the difficulties associated with proper location of cancer concentrations ('hot spots') in the United States. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commission then quotes the United States House of Representatives committee report, which states:</PARA>
<PARA> For some 'hot spots', the explanation is widespread pollution by industry; for others, direct hazards on the job. Other 'hot spots' are difficult to interpret for several reasons. One reason that demonstrates the need for census data relates to the extreme mobility of the U.S. people. The latent period for cancer is known to be long; that is, in man, ten to thirty years may pass from the time cancer is induced by an agent to the time it appears clinically. If a twenty-year-old man had lived for years under the carcinogenic plume of a smelter, then moved to Los Angeles and, five years later, died of lung cancer, Los Angeles would be credited with a case of lung cancer. Under present regulations, his earlier residence-the one more relevant to the cause of his cancer-would be unknown. Census data may help resolve this difficulty. </PARA>
<PARA>The Law Reform Commission continues:</PARA>
<PARA>In a similar manner, identified census information might supply crucial information in the study of the relationship between cancer, on the one hand, and occupational hazards and hereditary factors, on the other. One prominent cancer specialist went so far as to say that 'it is only by relating medical information on individuals to census information that proper epidemiological studies can be undertaken'. </PARA>
<PARA>It is quite obvious from that quotation from the Law Reform Commission report and from the other evidence which is given in the report that environmental medical research could be greatly assisted by access to identified census returns. Yet, here we are in this country destroying our census returns as soon as we have processed them in the way that we do, by putting them on to computer tapes and also by publishing various reports. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the great potential benefit of identified census records for these purposes, the Law Reform Commission recommended that they be left in the Archives with access forbidden for 75 years except for medical research purposes, when such information could clearly be of assistance, and made available on a strictly controlled basis to protect privacy. It recommended that the Director-General of Archives be given discretion to allow access for approved medical research within the 75-year period. In regard to that recommendation, the Law Reform Commission states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Commission recommends that the Director-General of Archives should be given discretion to allow access for approved medical research within the 75-year period. In all cases, access should be subject to such terms and conditions as to use and disclosure of the information as the Director-General lays down. In the case of access within the lapse period, unauthorised disclosure to third parties should be totally prohibited. A breach of the conditions laid down by the Director-General should be punishable as a serious offence, in the same manner as unauthorised disclosure of census information by an officer of the Bureau. In this manner, the confidentiality of identified census information should be ensured. </PARA>
<PARA>That recommendation seems very reasonable. It seems to be a fair balance between the important aims of protecting the privacy of the individual and of enabling socially beneficial research to be conducted. At present we simply cannot ensure that socially beneficial research can be conducted in the future, because the identified information is destroyed. However, even if one objects to any access being allowed for any purpose within a 75-year period, surely it is not unreasonable to keep the records and allow access after such a period. </PARA>
<PARA> We should realise that our practice of destroying census records is not normal in other countries. In Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom, all census forms are preserved. In New Zealand, every second census is retained indefinitely. In the United States, census forms are made available for historical, genealogical, sociological and medical research after 72 years. There have been various recommendations that for medical purposes the access should be available sooner than that. In the United Kingdom a similar situation applies but after 100 years. Here, we simply destroy our records. Certainly this guarantees privacy but it destroys a unique opportunity for future research. In our view it is not necessary to destroy census records in order to ensure privacy. Accordingly, we agree with the Law Reform Commission recommendation. I move as a second reading amendment:</PARA>
<PARA> That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA> 'whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House is of the opinion that the Bill is deficient in that it fails to give effect to the recommendation of the Australian Law Reform Commission's Report 'Privacy and the census' that indentified census information should be held in Archives with access forbidden for 75 years, except for strictly limited access for purposes of medical research'. </PARA>
<PARA>It is not surprising that a Government which is so uncaring about preserving valuable research material should also be uncaring about gathering statistics to enable worthwhile contemporary research to be conducted and about information relating to the workings of our society being made available. The Fraser Government has shown its lack of concern in this regard in various ways-for example, by processing only half of the 1976 census so that it was not a full census at all but simply a large sample and therefore subject to sampling error. Since many other research exercises are based on census material, if the census material has some error then the error which can occur in the subsequent research is exacerbated. A very serious destruction of the accuracy of census records occurred at that time in order to save $2m. An amount of $2m is an awfully small portion of total expenditure. To destroy the accuracy of the census to save such a small amount was, in our view, a disgusting activity by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also shown its lack of concern for ensuring full information by refusing to allow the Bureau to conduct various planned surveys. One of those was the consumer finance and expenditure survey which was planned when this Government came into office. This would have provided invaluable material. This Government has forced the Bureau of Statistics to abandon statistics on foreign ownership and control so we will not know from now on-we have not known even for the last couple of years-to what extent our industry and resources are foreign owned and controlled. The Government does not want us to know the extent to which we are foreign owned and controlled. </PARA>
<PARA> More recently, we have seen the razor gang's decision that 27 series of statistics be discontinued and another 29 be reviewed. Of the 27 to be scrapped there are certainly quite a few which are fairly inconsequential. I do not want to be seen to be going in to bat hard, for instance, in relation to the survey on rock lobsters which are in cold storage in Western Australia. I do not find that particularly helpful but perhaps some people in the community regard that as an important series. I do not object vehemently to the scrapping of a series such as that or a series on eggs set and chickens hatched. </PARA>
<PARA> Some are more important. For instance, included in that 27 series to be scrapped are five series relating to real estate: Transfers and conveyances and mortgages or real estate mortgages of real estate in Victoria, real estate transactions in New South Wales, land for housing in New South Wales and sales of land and houses in New South Wales. We simply do not have enough information in this country about real estate. To be scrapping series on real estate is, in our view, not wise or sensible. It is also interesting to note in the group of series to be discontinued is one on the production of minerals and mineral products. I find it amazing that at a time when we are moving into what we are told is a resources boom the Government is scrapping the collection of statistics on minerals and mineral products. It seems an absolutely extraordinary series to scrap. I would have thought it was a very important series to continue to compile. The same comments could be made about the series on forestry and workers compensation. </PARA>
<PARA> In the group of 29 series which are to be reviewed, there are many which I believe to be worthwhile. For instance, the survey of selected private pensions funds seems to me to compile very important information. There is not nearly enough information available at present about pension funds in Australia. To be scrapping one of the few sources of information which we have in this area seems extremely unwise. The agricultural census is to be reviewed. The agricultural census, surely, is important. I would have thought that all members of the National Country Party would have been very concerned to ensure that an agricultural census was retained. Apparently they are quite happy to see it scrapped and to know much less about the agricultural industry. The life insurance series is to be reviewed. Life insurance is surely an important aspect of our society. We should know what is happening in this area. We will not know to anything like the degree that we should what is going on if life insurance statistics are no longer compiled. </PARA>
<PARA> Then we have the labour costs survey. The labour costs survey is to be reviewed by this Government. The Government insisted that the Bureau undertake a labour costs survey last year. The Bureau was anxious not to rush into such a survey although, as I understand it, it was not unwilling to undertake such a survey eventually. The Bureau did not want to be pushed into it because it had not had time to prepare properly for it. It was forced by the Government to rush into that survey during the latter part of last year without being able to refine its questionnaire and without being able to undertake a pilot survey, with the result that the survey has been an absolute shambles. As I understand it only some 30 per cent of the returns are useable. An enormous number of complaints were received from businesses about the difficulty they had in following the questionnaire and so on. This was all because the Bureau was pushed into conducting the survey by the Government. Presumably the Government wanted to get information which it thought it could use against the unions in national wage cases. Now, having forced the Bureau to undertake a survey in a hurried and highly unsatisfactory way the Government has announced that it will review that survey. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that we need much more information that we have at present. Ralph Nader was right when he said that information is the currency of democracy. Governments which hide information from their people lose the right to be able to claim that they are democratic governments. In our view, very important statistics about our society are not being made available to the Australian people. Unless they are made available to the Australian people we cannot know what is going on, nor can the Government properly conduct the affairs of the nation if it does not fully understand the nature of society and the economy which it is administering. It is extremely important in our view that we have a greatly increased list of statistical series and collections. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention some of those statistics which we regard as being important to collect because they represent enormous gaps in our statistical collections at the present time. One of these is integrated economic censuses and surveys which are required annually for all industries. We need to know what is happening in each industry. Another is employment statistics by industry and occupation. We need detailed information on employment levels by industry and occupation at least quarterly. The previous source on employment levels, civilian employees, is no longer published. I understand that it is compiled by the Bureau but the government will not allow the Bureau to publish the figures. This is an extraordinary situation. The reason the Government will not publish them is that the figures coming out of this series do not show anything like as large an increase in employment as those figures coming out of the labour force series. Therefore, this series was scrapped. We do need these figures to be provided on a basis that I have mentioned; that is, by industry and occupations and at least quarterly. We cannot simply rely on information which is available from the labour force surveys. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to unemployment, we need details of unemployment on a monthly seasonally adjusted basis instead of having to rely on the labour force survey as it is at present. It would be useful also to have the figures published on a regional basis. That information is not supplied at present. I now refer to the ownership of wealth. There are no statistics in Australia on the ownership of wealth. We need information on the amount, distribution and type of assets which individuals and families own so that we can see how our society is structured-how equal or unequal the distribution of wealth in this country is. Surely it is of importance to governments and the nation at large to know that kind of information. The same situation applies with respect to income distribution. Statistics are required annually on the level and source of income, family type and number of dependants, particularly in respect of pensioners and beneficiaries. We need statistics on household expenditure. The last survey was conducted in 1975-76. We need data to be collected on a more regular basis than every five or six years. I think no survey is underway currently. Certainly, it would be desirable to have such information annually.</PARA>
<PARA> I now refer to the consumer price index. Most other Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries publish a consumer price index every month. Australia publishes its consumer price index every quarter. We are one of the very few countries that do not provide monthly consumer price index figures. We have to wait for three months to find out what our inflation rate is, whereas other countries can monitor that movement on a monthly basis. In regard to labour costs, we need statistics on non-wage labour costs which are required to assess the effects of changes in employment conditions. We need statistics on industrial accidents and absenteeism. Uniform statistics need to be collected on time lost through industrial accidents. There is no uniformity in the current statistics. Statistics are required on working days lost through absenteeism. We need statistics on occupational skills. Statistics are required on occupational skills possessed by the labour force. I have already mentioned foreign ownership and control of our industry and resources. The absence of those figures is an absolute scandal. It is absolutely essential that those figures are compiled. </PARA>
<PARA> Comprehensive statistics on capital raised in Australia and capital raised overseas by Australian corporations are required. Present statistics are restricted to listed companies and, therefore, are inadequate. We need complete statistics on the amounts borrowed by levels of government and types of borrowings because current information on government borrowings is not adequate. We need to know the level of government debt and interest liability of all sections of government. With regard to government finance, we need statistics on the operations of statutory authorities. Little information is available about statutory authorities at present. It would be desirable to have the national accounts on a State basis so that we can monitor how each State is performing economically. We simply cannot do that at present on a gross domestic product basis. We have to use other estimates. It is very important to have comprehensive statistics on house and land prices by regions. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention those figures as being what we regard as important gaps in the statistical series presently published by the Government. Doubtless there are other series which would also be of importance. I believe this is an area which, although it is not likely greatly to excite the Australian public, is of great importance to the Australian nation. If those of us who are interested in analysing what is happening in the society do not have that information we simply cannot know what is going on in this country and the Government cannot conduct the affairs of the nation properly because it simply does not know exactly what is happening in the economy and the nation over which it presides. If Australia is to be a democracy the Opposition believes it is terribly important for that information to be made available on as full and as comprehensive a basis as possible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The comments which I wish to make tonight will be somewhat different from those made by the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) who took the opportunity of this debate to make wide-ranging references to the recent report of the committee of Review of Commonwealth Functions. I make the observation that perhaps one of the greatest documents of understatement that can come before this Parliament is that which is read by a Minister and is described as a second reading speech. If one were to examine the contents of the second reading speech of the Treasurer (Mr Howard) when he introduced the Census and Statistics Amendment Bill last week one would hardly understand the scope of the changes to be brought about by these amendments to the Census and Statistics Act 1905. I am not for a moment being critical of that Minister because this is common to most second reading speeches. However, I believe that I am entitled tonight to reflect on almost a decade of campaigning for alterations to the procedures which have been used in the past in the collection of information for a census. When I realised that this Bill was coming on for debate this evening I asked for some quick research to be done on my own efforts to bring about changes. The Brisbane Telegraph of 1 July 1971 reported me as saying:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> . . . people were entitled to absolute protection of personal information. </PARA>
<PARA>That was in relation to the 1971 census. I went on to make some other references. The Sun Herald of 4 July described my campaign as 'fiddlesticks'. The Courier-Mail of 7 July reported me as saying that I would:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . try to bring about changes in the method of census collection. </PARA>
<PARA>During the 1971 census I led what might be described as a minor revolt in terms of some of the requirements which were being foisted upon the public. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If that is the most that the honourable member for Griffith has to offer he is not even a shadow of the former honourable member for Griffith. At that time I was accused of being disruptive. When one looks at the penalties which this Bill carries-a citizen who refuses to provide all the information supporting the form can be fined as much as $500-one can see that it will take a lot of inflation and many years before a person such as myself would dare to suggest to people that they buck the system. I notice that the Law Reform Commission report observes that a census penalty has never been invoked. Therefore, I pose the question: Why should we raise the penalty from $20 to $500 if it is never applied? I notice also that the Law Reform Commission notes that the actual census form never contains a reference to the penalty. I wonder why we have to adopt these procedures of introducing penalties which are probably more akin to the penalties that might be applied to criminal charges of some consequence. I do not believe we should spend too much time indulging in history but I do not think it is inappropriate for me to refer to some of the insensitivities which exist from time to time in government. Often the Australian Bureau of Statistics is only doing the biddings of the government of the day.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remember a survey commissioned by the Labor Government in 1975 which was called a household survey. A personal diary which contained 25 pages was given to people to detail in which areas their money was spent. There was also a 48 page expenditure questionaire and an income questionnaire of 13 pages. Those surveys had the audacity-I carefully selected that word-to request that people state the exact amount of their tax refund. They were even asked how many cheques they wrote in the previous month. They were asked also to provide the names of members of the family who had lent them money. That was bureaucracy gone mad. It is little wonder that at times people are apprehensive and suspicious of forms thrust into their hands for the purpose of the collection of data. I remember that in 1975-this shows how changes come about-the Bureau of Statistics conducted a survey into unreported crimes. It was even interviewing prostitutes and the like, but no one could get a copy of the questions that were being asked. How times change! Only a few weeks ago, as a member of this Parliament I was presented with a sample of the 1981 census form which is only weeks away. Even though it had 'In Confidence' and 'Sample Only' stamped across it, at least we were given an opportunity to see the form. That it was too late to do anything about the contents, is another matter altogether. </PARA>
<PARA> When the 1976 census was conducted I was well satisfied that the game was going to be played properly, that envelopes were to be provided for those who objected to having to leave their completed forms, which contained all their private information, in a letter-box or meter-box or under a doormat. These people were to be provided with envelopes in which to put the completed form and were to leave it at a pre-determined place for the collector to pick up. At the time the census was under way in Queensland, I discovered that thousands upon thousands of these envelopes were stored away in boxes in some government building or storehouse in the city of Brisbane. Again, I cut loose. Whilst I do not derive any satisfaction from disruption, it is not improper to recall that the census collectors took another 10 days beyond the time which had been anticipated to collect all the forms. Once again, I was subjected to abuse, et cetera, for my quaint ideas. </PARA>
<PARA> The House will see that for me there is considerable satisfaction in seeing this Parliament tonight legislating into the Census and Statistics Act on a permanent basis corrections to some of those things which I saw as being a risk to personal privacy. This Parliament is again indebted to the work of the Australian Law Reform Commission and to Mr Justice Michael Kirby and those who served on the Commission during the preparation of report No. 12, which deals with privacy and the census. I also wish to commend the attitude which now prevails in the Statistician's office. Although it may have taken years for it to become more-is the word sensitised?</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr John Brown" NAMEID="OD4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For the Statistician's office to become more up to date in terms of the recognition of the changing values of society and the right of people to command privacy, it is obviously making a major effort to comply with the wishes of the community. Indeed, when one looks at the way the people reacted in 1976 in refusing to answer some questions, as reported at page 13 of the Law Reform Commission's report, it was obvious that changes had to be made. I sincerely hope that this time we will not see any reason to object to the census once it is under way and that, for the first time since about 1966, Australia will have a census carried out without public objection.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Once again I commend the Law Reform Commission for its job. I commend the former Attorney-General, Mr Ellicott, now Mr Justice Ellicott, for his reference to the Commission. I hope that this little piece of history will not be lost or forgotten. No doubt the message is that many of us in this place sometimes will stand alone in the pursuit of a cause, but after a number of years success can be forthcoming if the cause espoused is of value and of worth. I notice that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) and the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) are both in the Parliament at the same time. I appreciate their listening to my contribution. I recognise that this unusual display of unity by that duo is not in appreciation of my comments. Obviously something of note is about to happen. </PARA>

<PARA> That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the Prime Minister from making a statement to the Parliament forthwith concerning the manner in which he has unfairly and deceitfully deprived the States of $70m and to justify his discreditable behaviour in leaking details to the Press on this matter with the aim of humiliating the State Premiers. </PARA>
<PARA>There has been an extraordinary series of events in the last few days but more particularly in the Parliament this evening. A series of Press conferences has been called by, respectively, the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). They are aimed at in some exculpating these two gentlemen from behaviour which, at best, can be described only as sordid. </PARA>
<PARA> What the Government has done through its tactics is to deprive the States of $70m to which they are justifiably entitled. It is clear that the Premiers Conference should be recalled not so that justice can be established to the State Premiers or to the State governments as such, but so that the proper entitlement of the people of the States can be provided by the national Government. What the Prime Minister did in arranging on Monday night through the Treasurer, because he approved the Treasurer doing it, to give a background briefing to the Press-we would call it, less euphemistically, a leak-and in doing it himself yesterday, was not so much to give technical details of how savings were made but to sneer and jeer at the Premiers, to humiliate the State governments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 31 March 1981 (Hansard, page 1090), the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown) asked me a question, without notice, about the present situation with regard to the Commonwealth's guarantee of $4.5m of a $9m loan from Barclays Australia Ltd to the Cooperative Farmers and Graziers Direct Meat Supply Ltd (CF &amp; G). I responded by outlining in a general way the considerations which led to the Government's provision of that guarantee but said that I would further inform him as to the precise situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Commonwealth guarantee, together with the Victorian Government guarantee for the remaining $4.5m of the loan, was aimed at assisting CF &amp; G to meet its receivership obligations and to trade out of its financial difficulties so that the farmer ownership of the facility could continue. The CF &amp; G abattoir is a large and modern meatworks whose slaughtering capacity represents a significant proportion of total capacity in the Melbourne metropolitan area. It has demonstrated its capacity to operate profitably on the basis of reasonable throughput.</PARA>
<PARA> Since 1978, however, the CF &amp; G abattoir, like many others, has experienced a sharp reduction in throughput as a result of a severe reduction in livestock numbers in southern Australia. Eventually the abattoir had to cease operations as the Cooperative's shareholders were not prepared to provide the necessary additional funds to enable it to survive in the circumstances of a depressed meat processing industry.</PARA>
<PARA> Messrs J. M. Poulton and D. A. Crawford of Peat, Marwick, Mitchell and Co were appointed Receivers and Managers of the Cooperative in December 1980. The Receivers are at present attempting to sell the abattoir at the best available price. Whether and to what extent there might be a call on the Commonwealth's guarantee will depend on the price achieved for the sale.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Veterans' Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Under arrangements with various government agencies in the United States the Australian Department of Veterans' Affairs has been provided with details of research studies being carried out in the U.S. on possible health effects of herbicides and their contaminants. The details which have been provided make no specific reference to studies involving liver biopsies on U.S. veterans.</PARA>
<PARA> It is understood that a registry has been established by the Veterans Administration in the U.S. to document base line medical information on individual veterans who are concerned about possible health effects resulting from exposure to herbicides in Vietnam. The information in the registry is derived from answers to a questionnaire, a physical examination and a set of baseline laboratory tests. As at December 1980, data from approximately 12,000 veterans had been entered into the registry. It is understood that a task force has been established to examine various aspects of the registry in order to evaluate its current and future usefulness.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes. Dr Burden's study has been examined by officers of my Department, and it was, in fact, one of the documents considered during the revision of Metals-in-Food Standards.</PARA>
<PARA> As to confirming the results of Dr Burden's study, there has been no follow-up study done on fruits and vegetables as carried out by him. Dr Burden's study compared lead levels in fruits and vegetables grown in Melbourne suburbs with those available from retail outlets. Data are available, however, on an Australia wide basis from the NH &amp; MRC Market Basket Survey. This survey shows that lead levels in those fresh fruits and vegetables sampled were below 1 mg/kg. Approximately 95% of samples showed lead levels of less than 0.5 mg/kg.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Information supplied to my Department by the Department of Home Affairs and Environment indicates that:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Atmospheric lead is regularly monitored by the following State/Territory authorities:</PARA>
<PARA> State Pollution Control Commission, NSW, Environment Protection Authority, Victoria, Department of Local Government, Queensland, Department for the Environment, South Australia, Department of Health and Medical Services, WA, Department of the Environment, Tasmania, Capital Territory Health Commission, ACT.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) (i) A sample is taken over a continuous 24-hour period repeated at intervals of six days. This is a recognised standard and has been adopted by many countries including Australia and the USA.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) and (iii) Monitoring is carried out by using an instrument called a high volume sampler which draws a measured quantity of air through a filter. The deposit on the filter is then weighed and chemically analysed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The meeting to which the honourable member refers was the first consultation between the Human Rights Bureau and national non-government organisations in the human rights field. In his address to that meeting the Attorney-General referred to the operations of the Meeting of Ministers on Human Rights which is a consultative body of Commonwealth and State Ministers responsible for human rights. All Governments, Commonwealth, State and Northern Territory, have responsibilities and interests in the field of human rights and the Commonwealth Government has adopted a policy of working with the States in matters of mutual concern. The Ministerial Meeting is the forum to which human rights matters affecting Australia are discussed.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Human Rights Bureau was established within my Department on 5 August 1980, and is staffed by officers of the Department. The Head of the Bureau is Mr Peter Bailey, O.B.E.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The United States Department of State submits an annual report to the United States Congress called 'Country Reports on Human Rights Practices'. The latest of these reports, which was published on 2 February 1981 contains a summary of human rights practices throughout the world. The part of the report which deals with Australia summarises Australian law and practice under a number of headings. The report makes no criticism of the human rights position in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The present Government's attitude to use of the external affairs power is well-known. Under the policy of co-operative federalism adopted by the Government, the Commonwealth and the States work together on matters of shared jurisdiction and interest. In matters of human rights the Meeting of Ministers on Human Rights is the appropriate vehicle for such consultations.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2088" SPEAKER="MacKellar The Hon M.J.R." NAMEID="014" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="MITCHELL" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="014">Mr MacKellar</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. The purchase was made in 1979.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The purchase price of the units was $334,268.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Air transit isolators (ATI) are located at the following places:</PARA>
<PARA> Sydney (North Head Quarantine Station)-2</PARA>
<PARA> Brisbane (Royal Brisbane Hospital)-1</PARA>
<PARA> Darwin (Darwin Hospital)-2</PARA>
<PARA> Perth (Queen Elizabeth II Medical Centre)-2</PARA>
<PARA> Adelaide (Northfield Wards, Royal Adelaide Hospital)-1</PARA>
<PARA> Canberra (Central Hospital Services Complex, Mitchell)-1</PARA>
<PARA> Melbourne (Fairfield Hospital)-3</PARA>
<PARA> Routine maintenance is carried out by local bio-medical engineers. Readiness of the ATIs is ensured by an inspection team from Fairfield Hospital officially examining each ATI every six months.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The acquisition of ATIs was approved by Government as a precautionary measure against the viral haemorrhagic fevers (VHF) which have been identified in recent years in Africa. In recommending this measure to Government, the Department of Health was aware that similar systems for the management of these diseases were being implemented at that time in the United States, Canada, Great Britain, Holland, Japan and Germany. Advice was sought from experts in Canada, South Africa, the United States and the United Kingdom. Before purchasing the isolators, the Department exhaustively tested a prototype specially brought from England for the purpose. Incorporated into the specification for the supply of the units in Australia were a number of modifications the need for which emerged from the Australian trials.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) (a) I am informed that the following countries have a mix of ATIs (long journeys), ambulance stretcher transit isolators (short journeys) and static isolators at one or more centres-Canada, Holland, South Africa, United States, U.S.S.R. The following countries have a mix of ambulance stretcher transit isolators and static isolators at one or more centres-Great Britain, Belgium, Germany, Denmark, Japan.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) I understand that New Zealand decided not to purchase such equipment.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Statistics to answer this question are difficult to obtain. The isolators in Great Britain undoubtedly have the greatest use. The only two published uses of isolators of which my Department is aware are:</PARA>
<PARA> November 1976-Africa-a case of VHF (Ebola) was transported in an ATI from Bumba to Kanshasa, Zaire by Fokker Friendship aircraft. The patient and transit isolator were subsequently transferred to a US Air Force C141 'Starlifter' for transport to Johannesburg, after which the patient was transferred to a static bed isolator. The patient recovered.</PARA>
<PARA> June 1977-Canada-A six-year old boy who had recently returned from West Africa was suspected to be suffering from a VHF (Lassa).</PARA>
<PARA> The boy was transported from Toronto to Ottawa using a transit isolator. Lassa fever was not identified and the boy recovered.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) An eight-bed high security ward in under construction at the Fairfield Infectious Diseases Hospital. Estimated costs are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>$  Building construction  2,104,000  Equipment purchase  103,000  High security laboratory extension-</PARA>
<PARA> Building construction  430,000  Equipment purchase  150,000</PARA>
<PARA> 2,787,000</PARA>
<PARA>  The capital cost of the ward and laboratory is being met by the Commonwealth. When not required for use by the Commonwealth for quarantine purposes, the ward will not lie idle but will be operated by Fairfield Hospital as an infectious diseases ward as an integrated part of the Victorian State health service. When required for quarantine purposes, the ward will be evacuated of patients and, by bringing into operation special air-conditioning systems, activating special alarm systems, automatic door closers, et cetera and the sealing of some doors, the ward can be quickly converted for high security use.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) Information available to my Department indicated that the bulk of international opinion favoured prompt transfer of VHF patients to a central specialised facility for containment of the disease and its treatment. The reported air evacuation in 1976 of a case of VHF from Zaire to Johannesburg in South Africa prompted inquiry into the practical use of an ATI. South African authorities recommended, in the light of their experience, adoption of the Canadian approach. Contingency plans developed in Australia to allow secure transportation of a case of VHF from geographically remote areas to a containment centre in a capital city are in line with these and other approaches in a number of developed countries. The Queen's Memorial Infectious Diseases Hospital at Fairfield in Melbourne catering for the infectious component of Victoria's hospital system was chosen because it is unique in Australia for its total commitment to the management of highly infectious diseases, and has the capability to cope with the problems of VHF.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) (a) to (e) Absolute assurances cannot be given. However, in close consultation, Commonwealth, State and Fairfield Hospital officers have developed plans for the operation and maintenance of the air transit isolators. Continuous training in the operation of the units is undertaken by doctors, nurses and maintenance engineers. All conceivable problems, including leakage, have been examined and contingency procedures developed and practised. Each six months a training flight is undertaken simulating an emergency airlift of a patient. Training flights have been held as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> 29 May 1979-Familiarisation exercise</PARA>
<PARA> 13 December 1979-Melbourne to Hobart and return</PARA>
<PARA> 30 May 1980-Melbourne to Sydney and return</PARA>
<PARA> 8-9 March 1981*-Melbourne to Adelaide and Perth and return</PARA>
<PARA> * Deferred from December 1980 due to airlines industrial problems.</PARA>
<PARA> The above arrangements and exhaustive prior testing of the ATI design and capabilities have reduced any risks associated with their use and transportation to minimal levels.</PARA>
<PARA> (10) (a) Yes. Procedures for the decontamination of road transport vehicles are included in the 'Handbook on Measures to Control Marburg Virus Disease, Ebola Virus Disease and Lassa Fever' issued by the Department of Health in November 1979. The procedures are based on those adopted by the United Kingdom in 'Memorandum on Lassa Fever' issued by Her Majesty's Stationery Office-1976.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Any decontamination of an aircraft will be carried out in accordance with procedures set out in a World Health Organisation publication-'Guide to Hygiene and Sanitation in Aviation'.</PARA>
<PARA> (11) Air carriers have been issued with appropriate sections of the publication mentioned in (10) (b) above. Incineration of the aircraft would not be required; decontamination procedures as set out are more than adequate.</PARA>
<PARA> (12) On 17 November 1978 a meeting with representatives of the following unions took place at Fairfield Hospital:</PARA>
<PARA> Australian Federation of Air Pilots</PARA>
<PARA> Federated Clerks Union</PARA>
<PARA> Australian Licensed Airline Engineers Association</PARA>
<PARA> Australian Airline Flight Engineers Association</PARA>
<PARA> Transport Workers Union</PARA>
<PARA> The air carrier, its insurer, Fairfield Hospital and the Departments of Transport and Health were also represented. All present were fully informed of the Government's proposals and their implementation. No objections have been received.</PARA>
<PARA> (13) If a patient suffering from, or suspected to be suffering from, VHF is too sick to be moved, a static isolator held at Fairfield could be taken to the patient for management of the patient until he is well enough to be moved. Experience has shown that the patient could be infectious for up to 38 days. Transfer of the patient in an ATI to the high security facilities available at Fairfield must therefore be undertaken as soon as possible. Overseas experience has shown that it is not practical to manage a VHF patient in a static isolator for long periods.</PARA>
<PARA> (14) VHF are explosively contagious in situations where appropriate facilities and expertise in management are lacking. VHF, for which contingency plans for management and containment have been developed, are endemic to Africa. These fevers emerge spasmodically, spread very quickly and have a very high mortality rate. They have an incubation period of 3-17 days. As a result, a person infected with the disease could have left Africa and be located anywhere in Australia when the disease becomes apparent. The safeguard of the health of the Australian people and the prevention of the spread of these diseases are paramount in the planning and facilities in hand. With the adoption of the Australian contingency plans the main hazard of contagion is not envisaged to the public but rather to medical personnel in their attendance and nursing of such patients and from examination of infected material such as blood and urine for diagnostic and therapeutic indication. The Fairfield Centre is the only Australian unit which will be equipped to the standard to provide safety to medical personnel in the performance of these duties. Expertise also exists at the Fairfield Centre to ensure that the high levels of containment required can be maintained.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Schedule fee for one of the items of service that may cover many of the estimations of substances is $24.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) This information is not available. It is believed that the practice of orthomolecular medicine could include many pathology tests, of which one service namely Items 1345 and 1346 (specialist and non-specialist respectively), may cover many. However, the purposes for which pathology tests are rendered is not recorded. Accordingly, the number of occasions that Items 1345/1346 are rendered would not necessarily relate to orthomolecular medicine. However, the approximate full year incidence of services itemized under Items 1345/1346 has been estimated at 340,000. At current (1 November 1980) Schedule fees and benefits, the Schedule fee cost would approximate $7.5m and Commonwealth medical benefits would approximate $2.3m. Due to the differing levels of health insurance cover, I am not able to provide details of the level of funding by registerd medical benefits organisations. If it is assumed that eligible persons are covered for the basic fund benefits, the fund benefit cost would approximate $3.4 million.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Cocos Island quarantine station will commence operation in late November 1981, when the first shipment of cattle from the USA and Canada will arrive. The station has been designed with capacity to accept 120 adult female cattle or comparable numbers of other sexes and species. It is estimated that up to 500 sheep or goats could be accommodated or a similar number of pigs.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Dairy and beef cattle will enter the station late this year in the initial shipment from the USA and Canada. Conditions have also been prepared to enable the importation of cattle from western Europe. Conditions to allow importation of pigs from the USA, UK and parts of western Europe in mid-1982 following the initial cattle importations are being developed. The importation of sheep and goats is still under preliminary consideration. Sheep and goats present specific problems in relation to 'slow virus diseases' which make the preparation of conditions under which importations may proceed a lengthy and complex operation.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Prior to the opening of the Australian National Animal Health Laboratory (ANAHL) in Geelong, animals will only be accepted from countries with a known disease status. These countries include the USA and Canada, western Europe, the UK and Japan. Animals from certain other regions such as South America, South Africa and Asia will not be considered until after ANAHL becomes operational.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Quarantine periods for imported animals will vary depending on species and country of origin. The quarantine periods on Cocos Island will vary between 3 and 5 months for cattle and pigs. Sheep and goats will require lengthier periods but it is not possible at this time to be specific due to the problems associated with detection of slow virus diseases. The quarantine periods on Cocos Island will follow quarantine periods in the country of origin.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) To date, applications from potential importers have only been sought for cattle from western Europe, Canada and the USA. Initial planning was for a shipment of cattle from western Europe to precede the cattle from the USA and Canada. However, construction delays and lack of firm demand have meant that cattle from the USA and Canada will be first. Applications for approximately 90 cattle from the USA and Canada have been received by my Department, all being from private breeders.</PARA>
