<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister for Administrative Services: Is it a fact that over recent months officers of the Australian Federal Police Force have entered the surgeries of a number of medical practitioners and have taken possession of patients' files? If so, can the Minister say how many times this has occurred in the past 12 months? Is it correct that in some instances original patients' files have been retained by the Federal Police for many months without any charges being laid? What official procedure has been adopted by the Federal Police Force to protect the private and confidential nature of patients' files? Finally, is the Minister satisfied that that procedure gives proper protection to the traditional relationship between patient and doctor?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="878" SPEAKER="Newman The Hon K.E." NAMEID="WM7" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="BASS" MINISTERIAL="ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WM7">Mr NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member asked a very important question. It relates to a matter which I know has concerned many honourable members. Perhaps I should respond to the last part of the question first; that is, that part relating to the relationship between the doctor and the patient. I think that really should be answered by my colleague, the Minister for Health. In cases which involve possible fraud, et cetera, against the National Health Act the procedure is this: Usually, the Department of Health conducts an investigation and at a certain stage in the investigation it calls in the police. The role of the police thereafter is to investigate any possible breach of the law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is true that under the law the police in their investigation have the power to seize documents. They can do that when a search warrant has been issued under the Commonwealth Crimes Act. Once the documents have been seized the police are very conscious of the need to maintain the confidentiality and security of those documents. I am advised that to that end last year the Commissioner of Police issued guidelines which set down the way in which those documents are to be kept confidential. I add that I am advised that the Australian Medical Association has sighted those guidelines and has expressed satisfaction with them.</PARA>
<PARA> I think the honourable member would be interested to know also that the Attorney-General has made a reference to the Australian Law Reform Commission on the matter of privacy. It is expected that the Law Reform Commission in that context will look at the whole matter of the seizure of medical documents. It is also interesting to note some comments made by Mr Justice Kirby when he was addressing members of the General Practitioners Society in Australia, which he is reported to have done on 23 March. In that speech he said that the Law Reform Commission was considering a uniform regime which would normally require judicial authorisation before powers of entry, search and seizure could be exercised by Federal officials. Mr Justice Kirby is reported to have said this also, which is very pertinent to the whole problem:</PARA>
<PARA> It would appear to me to be too facile to say that a doctor's records should not be examined without his consent, or even his patient's consent, when investigating an offence alleged against the doctor or patient himself . . . Otherwise we could be committing investigations and enforcement of the criminal law and breaches of statute to the consent of the very person under suspicion or other persons upon whom he may sometimes exercise influence.</PARA>
<PARA>I think another example of the enormity of the problem is a case reported on 24 March which relates to a doctor who has been charged and in which it has been alleged to the court that $200,000 may be involved in possible crimes against Medibank. All I would add is that I remind honourable members that, if there are problems with, and complaints against, the police, under the Commonwealth Ombudsman Act 1976 people may refer those complaints to the Commonwealth Ombudsman. That ability is enhanced by the powers which will be conferred under the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Bill which has just been before this Parliament.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XD4">Mr GOODLUCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister for Health aware of recent Press reports concerning the plight of hospitals in Tasmania in relation to cost cutting measures imposed by the Tasmanian Government? Is it correct that these measures have been forced on the Tasmanian Government because of the Federal Government's failure to honour the fifty-fifty cost sharing arrangements? Will the Minister please advise this House of the true situation in relation to the funding of hospitals in Tasmania and once and for all stop the Tasmanian Government battering this Federal Government over the head?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="879" SPEAKER="MacKellar The Hon M.J.R." NAMEID="014" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="WARRINGAH" MINISTERIAL="HEALTH" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="014">Mr MacKELLAR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware that some State governments, particularly those of the Labor States-New South Wales and Tasmania -seem to be endeavouring to whip up a climate of hysteria in relation to the funding of hospitals. It is not true in any way, shape, sense or form that the Commonwealth has at any time failed to live up to its promises in relation to the fifty-fifty cost sharing of the net operating costs of each State's public hospitals. In fact this year there is an increase in the total amount made available of about $144m, or overall about 12.3 per cent. It was made perfectly clear to the States that the Commonwealth would maintain the amount of money available at the 1979 levels. Any increases in services above those operating in 1979 would have to be offset by reductions in other parts of the agreed cost sharing formula.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So the States have the opportunity to organise their hospital systems as they wish. Of course there is the capacity to escalate some of the factors. I gave an undertaking to all the Ministers for Health at the recent Health Ministers conference in Western Australia that if they had particular matters they wished to bring before the Commonwealth we would be prepared to look at them. But the fact of the matter is that the funding for hospitals has not been reduced. In fact it has been maintained at the real levels operating in 1979. I repeat that overall there has been a 12.3 per cent increase this year, or about $144m. That increase applies throughout Australia, including Tasmania. Some of the instances of the administration of the hospitals in Tasmania that the Tasmanian Minister for Health brought before the Ministers conference in Western Australia would make me, if I were that State Minister, look very closely at the administration of that State's hospitals. It is up to the States to administer the hospitals, not to bleat to the Commonwealth.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Prime Minister aware of requests made by the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission that there be set up working parties representing metal trades employer organisations and metal union organisations to look at the introduction of shorter working hours in the metal industries? Has he directly used his office to persuade metal employers not to co-operate with the working parties, in defiance of the Arbitration Commission's requests?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="879" SPEAKER="Fraser The Rt Hon J.M." NAMEID="QS4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="WANNON" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QS4">Mr MALCOLM FRASER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I understand this proposal, it was basically a union proposal. The metal trades employers, initially indicated that they would examine it but they said that they wanted to assess the views of their membership around Australia. As I am advised, the view of the membership was that they should not participate in an arrangement which was designed to achieve a reduction in working hours and which was plainly seen to be designed to achieve a reduction in working hours. I find it very difficult to understand how leaders in the union movement and also in the Australian Labor Party so avidly support a 35-hour, working week and arrangements in relation to a 35-hour working week when they know quite well that will increase costs of manufacturing in Australia by 14 per cent to 20 per cent or more and when they know quite well that that will lead to the sale of less Australian made goods and therefore to the employment of fewer Australians. I would have thought that at the moment we would have wanted a circumstance where as many Australians as possible could be employed. To achieve that we need to sell as many Australian goods as possible. Why leaders of the union movement should show such a blatant and callous disregard for the employment of people who do not have jobs I fail utterly to understand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have only to look at the tactics in which certain trade unions indulged in relation to the Altona case. There were circumstances there of industrial blackmail and guerrilla tactics which would have been designed to put companies out of business totally. As a result of that kind of pressure and industrial force, some kind of agreement was put to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and the Commission was asked to endorse it. The whole process is a shabby one indeed. The whole process is one that can result only in higher unemployment than would otherwise be the case. The architect of higher unemployment in this Parliament, the honourable member for Wills and former President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, needs to be branded as the architect of wage policies and industrial policies which have done a great deal of damage to the Australian community. One of the odd things about it is that he has the intelligence to understand it and to know it very plainly.</PARA>

I use the word 'continuing' advisedly because it will be a continuing natural resource only if the three State governments concerned and the Commonwealth jointly undertake the appropriate management arrangements and pursue the appropriate policies which will protect the Murray for all the purposes and activities that are associated with it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Over a long period the Commonwealth has provided substantial funds to help the States combat salinity, and that process continues. At the moment Senator Carrick is negotiating with the States to achieve a new agreement, and as I understand it there is good progress in that direction. It is our hope that that agreement will be finalised quite shortly. The urgency is, of course, understood. This is not something that can be put off for five years or 10 years. With continuing dry times in New South Wales and in the south-eastern part of Australia it can become a very urgent problem very quickly. I believe the first step is to get that agreement with all the States. I think then we need to assess the priorities of the Commonwealth and the States in respect of the River Murray Agreement. I believe there would be complete agreement with the objectives that the honourable member would have in mind.</PARA>
<PARA> I know that the question was not asked purely from a South Australian point of view. Obviously, because South Australia is at the end of the River Murray, what happens in New South Wales and in Victoria is of vast importance to South Australia, so much of whose development depends on good quality water getting down the Murray. I know that the honourable gentleman's question was couched in terms of the River Murray as a whole. The concern that is presently felt in South Australia is something of which I and the Government are very conscious.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I preface my question to the Prime Minister by reminding him that this day, for the first time since August of last year, national figures on registered unemployed have been issued. They total just under half a million, at 482,366. That is an increase of just under 20,000 on the figures for February of last year, or an increase of 4.2 per cent over the last year. They are the highest February figures since the war. Does the Prime Minister seriously suggest that the member for Wills is the architect of these figures, or does he regard these figures as further evidence of the tragic inefficacy of his Government's economic policies in general and final proof of his failure to fulfil the promise made more than five years ago to establish full employment in this country?</PARA></TALK.START>

The honourable gentleman may not want to accept that, but that happens to be the case. Over the last 12 months, indeed over the last two years, employment in Australia has been growing very strongly. Total employment has grown in this country much more strongly than in nearly any other Western country. The Australian performance is all the more remarkable because in earlier times the Australian economy would grow if world trade was growing, if there was a buoyant situation overseas. But if there were difficulty and recession in Britain, the United States or the major countries of Europe, very severe recession would be felt in Australia. As a result of our policies over the last five years, this country has gone against the world trend. While the economies of other countries have been shrinking the Australian economy has been expanding, and Australian employment has been expanding. It will continue to expand and to grow under the policies of this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There has been some difficulty in respect of mail sorting and delivery staff at North Sydney Post Office. As I understand the position there have been some accommodation difficulties which are now under review by Australia Post. The difficulties have arisen in particular because of the presence of several agitators, all of whom have held or hold office as union delegates. One of those union delegates has been dismissed and the other one has been transferred to another office. I understand that the period within which appeals may be lodged against this disciplinary action expires at the end of this week. In the meantime there has been a series of rolling strikes which have seriously disrupted mail supplies in North Sydney. I am advised that successively different sectors of the staff have either failed to turn up for work or have failed to perform work when they have arrived. As a result, there have been very significant disruptions to mail deliveries in the electorate of the honourable gentleman. I am told that there is a large private box installation at North Sydney Post Office. Except for 80 bags, mail for box addresses that has come to the office has been sorted into the boxes. I am told that pension cheques have been delivered and a deal of other mail addressed to street addresses has also been delivered. However, there is two days mail in the office awaiting street delivery and about 900 bags for North Sydney are being held in other Sydney sorting offices because there is no space currently available at North Sydney. Existing staff would take about 10 days to clear all of the arrears. However, mail posted at North Sydney is being cleared. The present circumstances are of considerable concern to Australia Post.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable gentleman has raised a most important matter. Obviously the question of quarantine is of the utmost significance to a country such as Australia. When this incident occurred, anticipating that I might be asked a question of this nature, I took the trouble to find out in detail what the situation was. The outbreak was diagnosed on a property near Timaru on 11 February. The property was declared an infected place at about 4.30 New Zealand time on that day. The New Zealand Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries issued the first Press release of a suspected outbreak at 9.30 a.m. New Zealand time. Unofficial reports in Australia of this suspected outbreak were confirmed with New Zealand authorities by officers of my Department in a telephone discussion which took place at approximately 11.15 a.m. on the 12th. This further confirmatory advice on the suspected outbreak was contained in a cable received by my Department from New Zealand authorities at 1.43 p.m. Australian time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first reports that we did get about the suspected outbreak were from the media. They were received at 10.30 in the morning.

The House will remember, of course, that on about 4 April last year, I think it was, there was a determination that the remuneration should be reduced by 4c as a result of an inquiry which was carried out and certain events which took place in relation to the programming of a computer.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Communications. I note that he has made special arrangements for senators and members to view within Parliament House Channel 0-28, the multicultural television station, for the period 23 March to 27 March. Will the Minister consider bringing the same service to the people of the Australian Capital Territory? Can the Minister advise the House of the costs involved in providing multicultural telecasts to the Australian Capital Territory? Is the Minister of the view that the people of the Australian Capital Territory have the same right of access to multicultural television as residents of Sydney and Melbourne?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have considerable sympathy for the view expressed in the honourable member's question. However, yet another industrial dispute, involving the Black Mountain tower, has resulted in an interruption to the proposed telecast of Channel 0-28, which was intended for viewing by senators and members during this week. Channel 0-28 programs can be transmitted through Canberra fairly simply as the landline connecting Sydney and Melbourne passes through the national capital. However, the extension of Channel 0-28 services beyond Sydney and Melbourne has not yet been determined. Obviously in a number of major population centres around the country groups of individuals are very anxious to pick up the excellent material that is available on that channel. At the same time, the cost of providing those services varies from one area to the other and, whilst I understand and sympathise with the honourable member's concern for Canberra, it must take its place with each of the other centres around the continent. The management of Channel 0-28 is hoping that in due course it will be possible to extend its services as the honourable member requests. In the meantime, I hope that the picket line is withdrawn from the Black Mountain tower so that it is possible for honourable members to have some idea of the programs presently available.</PARA></TALK.START>

Is it a fact that the shire of Northam in Western Australia has offered to continue to supply competent and established meat inspectors under Commonwealth supervision at the Tip Top abattoirs in that shire?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industry is attending a funeral today but I will refer the honourable member's question to the Minister so that he can get a precise and detailed answer. My colleague has been having discussions with his counterparts in the States designed to achieve rationalisation of meat inspection services. The Commonwealth has certain responsibilities for export services of a very serious kind and these have to be maintained at the highest possible level to make sure that Australia's access to markets overseas is unimpaired. On top of that, various States have their own requirements. The attitudes of the States to the maintenance of the separate Commonwealth and State services differ quite markedly. My colleague has been having detailed discussions and negotiations with the States in an effort to achieve greater rationalisation and greater economies than exist in the present system. However, I will refer the question to my colleague who will give a more precise answer to the honourable member.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Since the time when the important work of the national population inquiry reached some unexpected conclusions about our population prospects, there has been a greater awareness of the need for continuing monitoring of the underlying trends. Accordingly, the Government has decided to present periodic reports to the Parliament and to the community in general on current and prospective demographic trends and on some of their implications for the Australian community. I have pleasure in tabling now the first such report entitled 'Review of Australia's Demographic Trends'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I draw the attention of honourable members to some of the main points in the report. Australia's population growth rate fell during the 1970s from around 2 per cent to a little above one per cent in 1975-76 before increasing to 1.35 per cent in 1979-80. About two-thirds of the growth in recent years was due to natural increase with the balance being the net effect of overseas migration. Births declined from 272,000 in 1971-72 to 227,000 in 1976-77 and have levelled out at around 223,000 in the past two years. Throughout the 1970s, the net reproduction rate, the most common summary measure of population replacement, taking into account both fertility and mortality trends, has continued to fall from 1.39 per cent to 0.92 per cent by 1979. This is 8 per cent below the long term replacement level. The most likely future is that Australia's net reproduction rate will continue to decline at least until later in the decade. However, even if fertility rates were to recover to around replacement level, it would be well below levels Australia has generally had in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> During the early 1970s the net population gain through migration generally declined. This trend has now been reversed with the net gain in 1979-80 being 82,000. Whilst there may be variations in future levels of net gain, the broad trends in the characteristics of Australia's population can be illustrated by population projections using a long term average annual gain through migration of 0.5 per cent to 0.6 per cent of the population. On the basis of the present population, this would be equivalent to a net migration gain of 73,000 to 88,000 annually. On these assumptions, it is likely that Australia's population growth rate will increase from about 1.4 per cent per annum over the next few years to about 1.5 per cent per annum in the second half of the 1980s, before declining to about 1.2 per cent by the end of the century. The population at the end of the century would be about 19,500,000, some two million more than it would be without a contribution through migration. </PARA>
<PARA> Significant changes in the age structure are anticipated between 1980 and 2001. Whilst the total population is expected to increase by a little over 30 per cent, the number of people aged 65 and over is expected to increase by about 70 per cent by 2001, whilst the number aged nought to 14 years is expected to increase by only 20 per cent. Following the variations in the annual numbers of births during the late 1960s and 1970s, there will be substantial fluctuations in the numbers reaching primary, secondary and tertiary education ages, calling for flexibility in manpower and infrastructure arrangements in education. There will also be significant fluctuations in the numbers of young people entering the labour force. For example, the number of 18-year-olds is expected to increase from a trough of about 250,000 in 1984 to a peak of around 290,000 in 1989 before declining to around 250,000 again in 1995. </PARA>
<PARA> The declining birth rates mean that there will be a general ageing of the population with the median age being likely to rise from 29.5 years in 1980 to about 33 years at the end of the century. This may result in the labour force becoming more experienced but less mobile. Lower occupational and geographic mobility makes it harder for the economy to adjust to structural changes and the introduction of new technology and increases the social and economic costs of moving people to new development projects, particularly in remote areas. Whilst migration will not halt the overall ageing of the population, it can change the dependency ratios by bringing in younger people. For example, on current assumptions, the proportion of the population in the 65 and over age group is expected to be about 12 per cent by 2001. With no net gains from migration, a figure of about 13 per cent would be expected. </PARA>
<PARA> The changing age distribution of the population also has implications for industry. The general trends in market growth will be away from products for teenagers to products for the over 30s. Growth in demand for products for the older age groups is expected to be particularly rapid. </PARA>
<PARA> Persons in the older age groups are of particular interest to policy makers. Whilst the number of people 65 and over is expected to increase rapidly, this growth is even more pronounced at older ages. For example, the number of persons 75 and over is expected virtually to double by the end of the century. The absolute size of these groups affects social welfare planning, including the provision of pensions and special medical care and accommodation. </PARA>
<PARA> These are some of the major population trends and implications. Whilst they may not appear to raise immediate issues, we must remember that demographic trends take generations to work their way through a population. We should not be misled into believing that issues arising from future population developments can be left to the future. We need to remain aware of these developments so that they can be taken into account in planning for the future. The matters covered in the 'Review of Australia's Demographic Trends' are very important long term issues. I commend the review to the House. I present the following papers:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to say a few words on the matter instantly, although I understand that the Government intends that it be discussed later in the session. Further discussion of it is certainly warranted. I believe the make-up of Australia's population, together with the decisions which have to be made in regard to immigration to Australia, are of enormous importance because there is not one facet of Australia's planning that is not affected by the decisions which we make in relation to the future population of this country. It does not matter what area people are involved in-whether it be social security, health, local government, education and so on-we should be looking ahead as to how the lifestyle and the lives of Australians are going to be affected by decisions which are made now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would go one step further and say that I believe the House of Representatives should have a committee which constantly monitors the movements of population in this country. We did have a minor discussion in the House some time ago on the question of immigration and the future population of this country. I said that it seemed to me to be an enormously important aspect of discussion in this House that the two major parties which can govern this country should come as near as possible to the same point of view. I have no reason to change that statement, because if we are talking about the future education standards of our people, about meeting the great challenges that might lie ahead over the next 20 years or 30 years, which is not very long in the life of a country, or about any other matter people need to know now what they are to be catering for. I believe this statement, following on the shock which I think many Australians got with the publication of the Borrie report, is further material which can be discussed. It is something on which perhaps some decisions can be made. </PARA>
<PARA> As the report points out, under certain circumstances, using certain criteria, much of which could be altered in the next 10 or 15 years, Australia at the turn of the century could have a population of 19 1/2 million people. Of course, there are many variables which the Government must acknowledge and which we on this side of the House acknowledge. We are not sure, for instance, what will happen as a result of the movements to and fro of New Zealanders. We are not sure of the demands which will be made upon Australia in terms of taking our share of refugees from whatever countries they may come from. We are not sure what the fertility rate may be at any time in Australia, although it would appear we are able to predict fairly accurately what that may be. I think the economy being what it is and the economic demands being what they are in the home now which have brought about a resurgence of married women going to work it is unlikely that we will see an uptake in the fertility rate in Australia which will markedly alter the figures given to us in the statement made today by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Macphee). Therefore these considerations are of importance. </PARA>
<PARA> We should look at some of the conclusions which have been reached in the report, assuming that the criteria prove to be accurate. We should look not only at the migration of people to this country and the numbers of people we may have but also at the internal migration machinations of people from one State to another. There would be some very grave long term consequences in South Australia, the State which I represent, about what the report has to say in terms of the aging population, the less demand for housing, the less demand for white goods, the less demand for perhaps motor cars and so on. South Australia, with a very narrow economic base, could be affected in 15 years time to a greater extent than it has over the last 10 years. We have to look at where the placement of population is going to be. I believe it is of great significance, when we are looking at the welfare area, to recognise the great increase that there will be in the number of people who will be retired and the burden that will be placed on taxpayers in looking after those people. We have an acknowledged but not a universal retiring age of 65 years. I do not believe 65 years will be the retiring age in this country for much longer. I believe the retiring age for working people will be lowered and I think this will come upon us very rapidly just as I believe the shorter working week-I do not want to get into the arguments about that-will be a reality for all people in the not too distant future. Those sorts of developments and changes will mean that planners will need advanced advice about what they should be doing. </PARA>
<PARA> We can see that there will be a transfer of people who have reached retiring age. They will want to head into areas in which they will have a more comfortable lifestyle. Perhaps they will want to live in places which have warmer weather. However, the demands upon the services in such places will really be enormous. The report deals with migration from the States of Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania to Western Australia and Queensland. Some of that migration is traditional in the case of retired people, who like to go to where the weather is warmer. Some of that migration is contemporary in terms of the jobs which may be available. The report deals also with the fact that as the Australian average age rises over the next 20 years, the majority of people will be aged between 29 and 33, and they will become less mobile. The Australian work force is already described as being immobile. If we become any more immobile, there may be greater demands on migration in order to fill the jobs wherever they may be, sometimes in remote areas. This raises extremely important questions about what will occur in this country. As I have said, there is no doubt that people in the welfare area will have to plan ahead for what will need to be done for the greater percentage of people who will have no earning capacity and who will have to be kept by the people who are still working, and what that means in terms of the taxation burden which will be placed upon those working. </PARA>
<PARA> Other important areas are covered in this report. As I said at the outset, it seems to be of enormous importance that a report of this nature should come back for proper discussion before the House. It seems important also that this House ought to give consideration to having a standing committee on the subject matter contained in this report so that we can be kept up to date on the demands which will be made on structures within Australia. It may be that the report has reached conclusions with which the majority of the people in this House do not agree. It may be that the majority of people in Australia want to see migration lowered. It may be that there are people who would rather see Australia, through its government agencies, encourage a rise in the fertility rate. Some countries are concerned about the number of people in their work forces. Countries in Eastern Europe have moved to try to encourage larger families, but this has not worked. I do not believe that it will work in Australia because of the demands made on the home economy. Women not only find it comfortable to go to work but also in the majority of instances they have to go to work to maintain the home or to maintain the standard of living which they expect to be able to provide for their families. I think that the report raises a number of very important questions which ought to be discussed in this House. I sincerely hope that the Government brings it back quickly for discussion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased that the Government has given me the opportunity to say a few words about this report on Australia's demographic trends. I commend the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Macphee) for bringing it forward. I believe that this report will be important. It is the first substantial report that we have had on population or demographic trends in this country since the Borrie report in the mid 70s.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When the then Prime Minister, the right honourable member for Lowe (Sir William McMahon), introduced the National Urban and Regional Development Authority legislation in this House in October 1972, he brought out the fact that during the years 1950 to 1970 the population of this country grew, on an average, of 1.9 per cent per year. At that time we had a population of 13 million. It was the guesstimate of his advisers at that time that our population would increase by another 10 million by the turn of the century, which meant that we would have a population of 23 million by then. The Borrie report destroyed that assessment. In fact, Borrie said that both natural population increase and immigration would have brought about a population of something like 17 1/2 million by the turn of the century. If any honourable member refers to my speech of October 1972, when I put forward the Australian Labor Party's policy at that time, he will see that I said that we wanted to work towards a population from both natural increase and migration of somewhere around 17 1/2 million by the turn of the century. I argued that if the population trend continued and we had been able to slow the growth rate in our cities by at least one million people, as has been done by the Commission for the New Towns in Britain, we would have had to absorb the other nine million people in our capital cities. The subsequent chaos, particularly in the cities of Sydney and Melbourne, could not have been coped with. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, the Labor Government supported the trend towards more rational growth which enabled us to create growth centres such as Albury-Wodonga, Bathurst-Orange and Macarthur. If the Victorian and Queensland governments had supported our proposals we could have created growth centres also in Geelong and Townsville. We did not have the co-operation of all State governments, but at least we had the co-operation of the State of New South Wales, which at that stage had a conservative government, and the Victorian Hamer Government, which also had a conservative government. That was the plan that we had and were developing between 1972 and 1975. We see now that again the trend has changed. The Minister has pointed out that on average there will be a net migration intake annually of between 73,000 and 88,000 resulting in a total population of about 19.5 million by the turn of the century. That has to be examined in the context of people living in cities particularly in urban and regional areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Regrettably, the Minister mentioned only two sectors of the community. I know that this is not his responsibility as he does not have the planning controls within his Department. He mentioned the education sector, which is an important aspect of our future population, and the industrial sector. It seems to me that planning has been lacking under this Government. Because it is a market forces government it does not really plan. It allows market forces to develop which results in incorrect growth of our cities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer (Mr Howard), who is seated at the table, knows that the new growth centres are receiving inadequate social infrastructure development. He knows that centres such as Gladstone, the Hunter Valley, Lithgow, Latrobe Valley and Portland will grow fast and that the social conditions in those areas will create great difficulties for most people. People in those areas will suffer because of the housing situation. This is the responsibility of the Government under the Commonwealth-State housing agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> What really has occurred in the housing area? This Government has cut Federal expenditure on housing from 3.9 per cent in 1974-75 to less than one per cent this year. It has made available to the States a total of $285m this year but has offered them only $1,000 over the next five years. So that represents a further cut in government spending. Inflation will make further cuts into the real money being spent on housing. How will we house the people of our country with this increasing growth in population? The Treasurer knows that the situation with regard to housing people, even by the private sector, has worsened because of this Government's resource development policy. This Government is allowing foreign companies in Australia to draw one-third of their finance for resource development from the local market. If there is further development of this Government's resource policy, semi-government authority loans of something--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are two ways in which we can house those people. They can be housed by the public sector, an area in which, as I have said, the Government has failed, or we have to find money through the private sector. This Government's policy is eroding the money available to the housing sector due to its policies of resource development. I have given figures which indicate that semi-government authority loans are draining the money away by offering interest rates of between 13.4 per cent and 13.9 per cent. How can lending institutions make available funds for private housing if they are offering an interest rate of only 11 1/2 per cent to depositors? Even the interest rate on Australian savings bonds was increased to 12 1/4 per cent the day before yesterday.</PARA></TALK.START>

It is on the basis of the population of our country that we must plan economic and social reforms so that the people living in urban and regional communities can have a decent standard of living.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Blaxland)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(3.38)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition has proposed this matter of public importance because of the continuing alienation of national resources to foreign companies and to governments which own those companies, particularly in the climate of questionable mineral tendering processes such as we have witnessed in some States and, more recently, in the State of Queensland. Last week we saw the Bjelke-Petersen Government award an important coal area in that State, which is worth about $2,000m in current prices, to a consortium headed by a foreign oil company which is 46 per cent owned by the British Government, without the Queensland Cabinet examining the other 32 tender proposals which had been placed before it, without the Queensland Cabinet knowing the detail of the successful tender proposal and without the Queensland Cabinet making the details of the successful tender proposal public. If the tender was so good for Queensland and the National Party in Queensland believed that the State was being advantaged by the acceptance of the tender, why was the tender not published so that the people of Australia could see just how good it was? Of course, we have seen no publication of the tender. In fact, we have seen reported on the front pages of the Queensland newspapers very terse comments by the Queensland Premier attacking that person in the Cabinet or within the Government who dared to leak the puny Cabinet submission which dealt only with the one tender document.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What we have witnessed is yet another corrupt mineral lease arrangement in Queensland, decided not by the Queensland Cabinet but by the National Party organisation without resort to fair and open practice, fair and open tendering processes. As we indicated in our outline of the matter of public importance, the problem is that the Commonwealth is left right out of this procedure. Because the States have had the constitutional prerogative to issue mineral licences where they have seen fit, when we want to pursue a national policy of maximising Australian ownership-we have an interventionist foreign investment policy as a result of that-we find ourselves in the position of the Federal Government and the Foreign Investment Review Board being left to ponder the arrangements after they have been decided by the States, in this case by the Queensland Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst the BP consortium has 51 per cent Australian equity-that is well within the present guidelines-we have reached this very sorry state in the administration of our affairs that nobody cares about 100 per cent Australian equity, or any level of Australian equity in excess of 51 per cent. Whilst the Government has been dragged screaming to the 51 per cent barrier and whilst it now on occasions, particularly in mineral leases, is trying to abide by the 51 per cent policy, the situation is virtually this: If a company comes along with a 100 per cent Australian equity proposal it is virtually obliged to let the Government know who its foreign partner is. So instead of having a minimum 51 per cent policy we have a 51 per cent policy per se. In the case of Queensland not so long ago we had the Queensland Premier bleating about takeovers of Queensland companies by companies from the south, yet apparently the Queensland Government does not mind surrendering large tracts of coal in Queensland to foreign companies. One wonders what the motivation is. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the most important factor in the awarding of this Winchester South lease area to this consortium headed by BP is that, from the knowledge we have, no up-front money was offered by the BP company or the other companies involved; and that includes Thiess and the Westfield company, which are part of the successful consortium. Some 32 consortiums applied for this lease area, many of which were exclusively Australian. Yet the offer by the successful consortium does not have any up-front money; it has only a royalty off the top after production starts. Any Australian company could have offered a royalty after production starts. One would have thought a rich international company or a consortium of rich companies would have been able to offer an up-front amount of money, as is the case with competitive mineral tenders in Canada and other parts of Australia. But that is not the case in this situation. What we see in this is a normal State royalty and then what is called a super royalty which operates after start-up. When we looked at what the super royalty was we found that it was $1 a tonne, escalating to $4 a tonne by the year 2005. Taking into account just the inflationary portents in that period, a quick calculation reveals that the $4 a tonne will be worth 50c. </PARA>
<PARA> What was special about the BP tender? The former Minister for Mines and Energy in Queensland, Mr Camm, was escorted or hosted on a trip overseas by the BP corporation after he retired as Minister. The dogs were barking the fact that the BP, Thiess or Drayton and Westfield offer would be accepted despite the fact that other tenderers had spent up to half a million dollars competing. In one celebrated case we saw a number of young men in Queensland resign from international companies to get an Australian consortium together. They have been rejected and no one knows why. Yet we find that Mr Sullivan, the Minister who replaced Mr Camm, was not in the job for long enough. When the Queensland election came along he was replaced as Minister for Mines, Energy and Police. He held the post for five months. Quite obviously, one has to ask the question: Was it because he dug his toes in and indicated to the Premier that he would not go along with that shonky process of awarding the BP consortium rights over Winchester South before the formal tendering processes had been before the Cabinet? Mr Gibbs was then appointed Minister for Mines, Energy and Police. </PARA>
<PARA> It is alleged that the successful consortium has been invited to donate to the Bjelke-Petersen fund; that is, a fund which sets up investments in Queensland, the earnings of which maintain the party machinery of the National Party. If that is the case it is corrupt. If it is not the case the company involved in the consortium should say so. I invite BP, Thiess and Westfield-God knows how Westfield, a property developer, got involved in this-to indicate whether that money in fact was sent on to the Bjelke-Petersen fund. The other 99 companies and 32 consortia have been knocked back. Apparently some companies have offered to the South East Queensland Electricity Board coal at cost in the future as part of their proposals. Apparently another tender proposal offered to build a power station without any charge to the public. We have had no explanation of why those proposals have been rejected. We have heard Sir Robert Sparkes, the President of the National Party in Queensland, saying that because someone dared to leak the scandal which is behind the issue a royal commission ought to be conducted into the leak. </PARA>
<PARA> We find that the Queensland Treasury was not even involved in the process. It was only when it got an inkling of the fact that the matter was going to Cabinet that it muscled its way in. We are told in the media and elsewhere that no economic benefits of any kind over and above the normal royalties and taxes would have flowed to Queensland from the BP-Thiess-Westfield tender had the Treasury not tried to improve the tender. After that we saw a report in the Australian Financial Review of 24 March, a copy of which I have here, headed: 'Queensland Government backs down on leaks between royalties, CPI'. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> Despite the efforts of its Treasury, the Queensland Government yesterday abandoned its attempt to inflation-proof the super-royalties which will be paid by the BP Australia-led consortium which will mine the big Winchester South steaming coal prospect. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead, State Cabinet has agreed to accept BP's original offer of a royalty rising in set steps or a charge related to the selling price of the Winchester coal on world markets. </PARA>
<PARA>If the tender was complete, what was the point of the Queensland Cabinet or its Government or the Treasury as its agent trying to do a deal after the tender had closed? The whole purpose of the competitive tender is to determine, on the basis of the offers, which is the competitive tender and to make a choice, not to go back to try to sew up a deal to inflation-proof the miserable royalty which will end up being worth 50c a tonne in 20 years. This is a scandalous situation which the Federal Government should deplore. I expect that when the Treasurer (Mr Howard) responds to this matter he will deplore the situation and will do the decent thing. </PARA>
<PARA> Some wonder why Australians feel there is a need for a Federal resource rent tax. Of course there is a need for it. How could anyone hope to marshal the wealth of this nation for Australians while those brigands in Queensland who run the Queensland Government give away the nation's resources in a scandalous and squandering way? Mr Sullivan, the Minister, had the hide to say in Cabinet that the consortium would offer the Australian public an opportunity to take up shareholdings at the appropriate time. Everyone knows when the appropriate time will be; it will be after the consortium has done some exploration drilling and quantifies the reserve. That is when those companies will offer the mugs, if you like, of the Australian investing public-the companies regard them as mugs-shares at a huge premium. Instead of the Australian public getting in on the ground floor at the exploration or authority to prospect stage they will be given a chance to invest after BP, Thiess and Westfield have had a chance to quantify an area which they already know is coal bearing. Then and only then will Australians other than the Australian shareholders involved in the consortium have a right to a shareholding. Even then it will be at a premium which suits the companies which are selling. What the consortium will end up with will be a carried interest in the project for next to nothing while the Australians pay the premium. Do honourable members think it is reasonable that BP or even Thiess or Westfield should reap those kinds of benefits? I do not believe it is reasonable. </PARA>
<PARA> Something else Mr Gibbs did was virtually to threaten unsuccessful applicants not to release the details of their tenders lest they be treated harshly in the future when next they submit a tender for consideration by the Queensland Government. Sir Robert Sparkes, the Tammany Hall crook who runs the National Party, came out and said that there ought to be a royal commission into the leak. How dare the public find out about this corrupt practice!</PARA>

Sir Robert Sparkes is saying that there should be a royal commission to determine who leaked the document. The document was leaked in the interest of truth and to expose the corrupt practices within the Queensland Government. We want to know what is happening and why. I think these questions should be answered. I think BP, as one of the successful tenderers, should make public its arrangements with the former Minister, Mr Camm. I think the company should reveal its tender documents and so should the consortium in general. It should tell us how and why it came to make arrangements with Thiess in the first place. It should tell us particularly how it made arrangements with Westfield. It should tell us why a company which is half owned by the British Government should be subverting-if it is-the legal tendering processes of a government in Australia to secure a rich resource over which it would otherwise have had no prior claim.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In all this the Fraser Government fails to act; it is powerless. The foreign investment rules as they are administered do not get down to the matter of authority to prospect. What happens is that the Fraser Government faces under its foreign investment regulations a fait accompli situation when these consortia have made their equity arrangements and have proven reserves beyond the authority to prospect stage. Then and only then does the Commonwealth involve itself. If the Commonwealth is interested in decent practices in terms of the awarding of rich coal bearing areas or mineral areas in the country which belong to the people of Australia it should be involved particularly in relation to investments at the authority to prospect stage and not wait until these resources have been hacked about, traded at all sorts of premiums. Just before the companies start to mine they trundle up to the Foreign Investment Review Board and the Treasurer is then in the position of trying to make some kind of sense, to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear, after the thing has been ripped and raped by all the speculators who are caught up in it or who happen to know the people who run the Queensland Government. It is a scandalous state of affairs. We have not seen anything as rough as this in a long time. </PARA>
<PARA> To think that the Queensland Government was deluged, as few governments are, with all these commercial offers for a very large lease of steam coal. Steam coal is one of the most sought after products in the world. It should not just be handed away. It is a public resource which should not be handed away to companies which happen to know the Queensland Premier, which kick into a National Party fund or which are mates with Sir Robert Sparkes. That is what is happening in this country. We want to know what the Fraser Government will do about it. I will be interested to hear the Treasurer condemn the awarding of this tender and let us know what he intends to do about the fact that 100 per cent Australian-owned consortia have been rejected in this auction in Queensland. Australians are disadvantaged to the advantage of foreigners-not just foreigners but companies which are substantially owned by a foreign government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) did himself less than justice today. I have heard a lot better from him on the subject of foreign investment in the past than we heard from him today. Predictably he spent most of his speech making wild, unsubstantiated allegations against the Queensland Government. If the honourable member for Blaxland has any facts to support the allegations that he made-I remind the House that he used works like 'corruption', 'brigands' and other words that are a very severe criticism of the Queensland Government-let the House hear them. Let him substantiate the claims that he has made against the Queensland Government. Let him support the accusations of bad faith, the accusations of favouritism and the accusations of corruption that he has made. It was only the great tolerance of the House and you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that allowed him to spend most of his time talking about decisions that are essentially quite outside the province of the Commonwealth Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The decision to award the authority to prospect to the BP-Westfield-Drayton consortium was a decision taken by the Queensland Government and one completely within the legal province of the Queensland Government. The honourable member for Blaxland and every other honourable member opposite knows as well as we on this side of the House know that the Commonwealth Government has no power whatever to stop any State government, be it the Queensland Government, the Wran Labor Government in New South Wales or indeed any other State government around Australia, from making a decision as to who is awarded an authority to prospect. I do not know the facts. I make it quite plain to the House that I am not in full possession of the facts. I do not know all the circumstances surrounding the awarding of the Winchester South authority to prospect by the Queensland Government. Therefore, I will not indulge in the sort of speculative rhetoric in which the honourable member for Blaxland allowed himself to indulge in trying to work out the motives of people in the decisions that were made. </PARA>
<PARA> I listened for quite a while to see whether there was any connection at all between the foreign investment responsibilities of the Federal Government and what has happened in respect of this coal project. It was only at the end of his speech that the honourable member for Blaxland finally said that what the Federal Government should really do is to apply its foreign equity guidelines at the authority to prospect stage and not at the exploration stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad that the honourable member for Blaxland acknowledges that because it would appear on the surface-without in any way pre-empting the consideration that the Foreign Investment Review Board has to give to this project-and on the published information that the BP consortium meets the foreign equity guidelines because it is at least 50 per cent Australian owned. On the logic of the honourable member for Blaxland, if we applied foreign equity rules further down the line, back to the authority to prospect stage, this project, on the evidence so far available as far as foreign equity is concerned, would meet that guideline. I hasten, of course, to point out that that in no way, of course, pre-empts consideration on other grounds which must properly be given by the Foreign Investment Review Board. On the score of equity levels this consortium has at least 50 per cent Australian equity.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Blaxland does not like being reminded of the principles of a foreign investment policy which he on a number of occasions in the past has said enjoys a certain degree of bipartisan support in this House. That has certainly been the position not only of himself but also of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) who, when addressing a seminar in Western Australia about 18 months ago on foreign investment, said that there was a great deal of bipartisan support. Let us have a bit of consistency on this issue. Let us remember that not only does this consortium have 50 per cent Australian equity but so also indeed did the consortium that was granted the authority to prospect for the Curragh deposit in Queensland some months ago which also was the subject of criticism from the Opposition. That consortium also had 50 per cent Australian equity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said earlier, it is not my intention in this debate, nor is it my responsibility, to pass a judgment on the decision of the Queensland Government to grant this authority to the BP-Drayton-Westfield consortium. I do not know all the circumstances of that matter. I expressly make it plain that I am not competent to pass a judgement on that decision. I am competent to make it very clear to the House that that was a decision made by the Queensland Government in full exercise of its authority in those matters. The Queensland Government had a 100 per cent right to take whatever decision could be taken in the circumstances so far as the granting of an authority to prospect was concerned. In that way its powers and the exercise of its powers were no different from the exercise of powers of any other State government. Indeed, numerous examples exist around Australia of State governments having granted authority to prospect in the teeth of fierce competition from a significant number of tenderers. The honourable member for Blaxland, as I understand his motion, would invite us to change the foreign investment policy so that questions as to whether the equity rules are met are asked at the time an authority to prospect is granted. If that is the policy of the honourable member, and he nods assent, he has forgotten what happened a few years ago when a Labor government was in office. He has forgotten the effect of that kind of approach upon exploration in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> That policy might work-although I regard it as being undesirable on general foreign investment grounds and make that plain on behalf of the Government-with less difficulty in certain areas, but he knows very well that in regard to oil exploration it would cause considerable difficulty, as it did between 1972 and 1975. One runs the risk that such a policy, if applied, would create those kinds of difficulties again. Of course, there can be legitimate debate about the type of foreign investment that a country can have. This Government is not totally blind to legitimate proposals in regard to its foreign investment policy. It does not claim that in every respect that policy is perfect but, by and large, over the last five years it has brought a degree of consistency, predictability and fairness to the development of this country's resources. We have been able to achieve that often difficult balance between the need to attract large amounts of foreign investment for the development of our resources and the need to ensure that Australians will receive a fair share of the action. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a strange irony that we should be debating the merits of a coal project in Queensland when, in respect of coal projects in Queensland, this Government has demonstrated more firmly then it has on any other issue its absolute determination to keep to the foreign equity guidelines and to ensure that Australians can participate fully in our resource development. I remind honourable members of the Government's insistence in respect of both the Blair Athol and Oaky Creek coal projects, two of the largest that this country has seen, against the criticism, I acknowledge, of the Queensland Government-criticism that the Government will continue to reject as not soundly based-that Australians will get a fair share of the action. But let us not lose our sense of perspective. Because we have now created an environment which is more conducive to domestic and overseas investment, because we have created a climate in which there is a good balance between the two objectives that I have mentioned there is no occasion to begin altering, willy-nilly, our foreign investment policy and to strive towards the attainment of objectives which might meet some theoretical goal but which, in reality, would produce a great deal of consternation and disturbance about our foreign investment policy. The existing approach, which holds that the equity guidelines must be met at the production stage rather than at the exploration stage, represent an appropriate balance. It represents, if I may put it, a trade-off between Australian participants paying a higher premium for later entry and our taking advantage of the greater willingness at the exploration stage of overseas companies to invest. All these issues involve matters of judgment and balance. In respect of our foreign investment policy, the goal of achieving the overall balance of which I have spoken is best attained by requiring that the 50 per cent guideline be met not at the exploration stage but rather when production begins. </PARA>
<PARA> We are referring here, of course, to the development of Australia's coal reserves, one of our most valuable resources. I remind the House that since 1976, under the foreign investment policy of this Government, 16 new coal development projects have been examined. Of these, 12 have met the 50 per cent equity guideline. Two are required to meet the guideline when production commences. Two have not been approved but are likely to be resubmitted with due regard to the 50 per cent rule. I ask honourable members: Does that represent a selling-out of this country's resources, an abnegation of the Government's responsibility in regard to foreign investment? Does it represent anything other than an entirely sensible and consistent approach to resource development, recognising that we must attract overseas capital to help develop Australia's resources?</PARA>
<PARA> The Government will yield to nobody in ensuring that Australians get a fair opportunity to participate in the development of Australia's natural resources. That is written into our foreign investment policy and will be applied without exception. But in defending that approach we will not blind ourselves to what foreign investment has done for this country. Unlike the Labor Party, we do not shrink from acknowledging the contribution of foreigners to Australia's development. In the same way as they helped to build a local car manufacturing industry when no one else was interested in doing so, they have participated, and will be allowed to participate, in our resource development. It is the height of absurdity and unrealism to ignore the contribution that overseas companies have made to the development of this country and of its resources. One must have a mature, sensible and practical approach to the subject, a mixture which both takes account of the benefits of foreign investment and ensures that Australians have an opportunity to participate on fair terms. That has been the thrust of this Government's policy over the last four years and will be its thrust in the future. On those grounds, I believe that the production stage is the appropriate stage at which the guidelines should operate. That maximises in the most practical and efficient way the benefits of foreign investment, while leaving it open for Australians to participate. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, the Government rejects the notion that the guidelines ought to be altered in the manner argued for by the honourable member for Blaxland, who spent most of his time not really talking about our foreign investment policy but about a decision that is not within the province of this Government-or a Labor government if it were in office-to make. The decision was made by the Queensland government. I do not know all of the circumstances and the honourable member for Blaxland has failed completely to substantiate any case for an alteration in the foreign investment policy of the Government, which has worked to such great benefit for the Australian nation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Once again, the Government has sent in its poor little Treasurer to defend the National Party in Queensland. John Howard, the honourable Treasurer, has fought more battles in this Parliament defending the National Party than have the members of that party themselves. I invite honourable members to look around the chamber. The National Party of Queensland is under attack, yet we have only two members of the National Country Party present today. I must congratulate the Treasurer upon being able to waffle on for 15 minutes about nothing. He is a very capable person but I must say that although I have always held him in very high esteem, after today I will not be able to do so. How he could ever defend the Liberal-National Party Government of Queensland in this House I do not know.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Treasurer said that we must have these foreign companies in Australia. I agree, but what about the 100 per cent Australian-owned companies that were knocked back in Queensland? The Treasurer did not defend them. He did not defend his old Aussie mates. After all, the Foreign Investment Review Board stipulates only 51 per cent Australian participation as a guideline. Those foreign companies could have been knocked back, and should have been. I intend to prove conclusively that if the Government wanted the razor gang to save a little more money it should have sent it to Queensland to investigate what was going on in that State. Let us really look at the situation. There was a $1,600m coal contract let in Queensland, one of the most important contracts ever undertaken in Australia. Yet, is it not gross incompetence on the part of the Queensland Government not even to have the Treasury undertake an economic evaluation?</PARA>

I point out to the Treasurer that it must have been a Liberal Minister in Queensland who started the headlines in the Queensland newspapers. Surely it would not have been a National Party Minister. Who is the Minister hiding? Who has the intestinal fortitude to tell the Queensland Opposition what is going on? I am glad to see that at least we have some honest Liberals in the Queensland Parliament. They know, and Joh knows, what the situation is. We see the headline 'Joh angry on coal . . .'. Why is he angry if it is such a great deal? The article states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Premier, Mr Bjelke-Petersen, yesterday vowed that any Minister found to have leaked the controversial Winchester South coal tender would have no future in the Cabinet. </PARA>
<PARA>He is threatening his Ministers once again. Sir Robert Sparkes and Mr D'Arcy are making different claims, but we all know what is going on in Queensland. The manner in which the Queensland Government is manipulating mining resources and development in Queensland should be of grave concern to Australians, especially members of this House. The matters to which I refer are of such urgency and national importance that they demand that the Federal Government takes steps to ensure the national interests are protected. I appeal in particular to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and to the Minister for National Development and Energy (Senator Carrick)-since the Treasurer is in the chamber I will appeal to him also-to instigate an investigation into all decisions taken by the Queensland Government with respect to resource and mining development in Queensland over the past five years. That is very necessary. If this Government wants to put its razor gang to work to get some more money for the Treasury it should undertake such an investigation because Joh is getting away with murder. The Government knows it, and all Australians know it. The Australian Government and the Australian people are entitled to a better deal and to more money. The money should not go overseas or into the pockets of the wealthy people of Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> The five decisions the Government should investigate are: The siting of the Tarong power station, the granting of authorities to prospect to former Ministers of the Crown, the Queensland Government's refusal to release details of the Winchester South tenders, thereby concealing the fact that tenders other than the successful tender offered better deals for Queensland, and the Queensland Government's failure to reveal the full facts relating to the expenses of the former Minister for Mines and Energy, Mr Ron Camm, on his overseas tour organised by the British Petroleum company. It is an alarming situation about which we all should be concerned. It is nothing other than a national scandal and a cover-up. I intend to prove that, and I intend to prove to the Treasurer that we can get more money if we take a little notice and interest. I know the Treasurer has explained that it is very hard to handle Joh, and he must be very worried now that he has one of Joh's closest relatives as a member of his Government. She will tell all the secrets. He is finished now, and I know that all Government members are running scared. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am saying how the Treasurer is running scared. I think the Prime Minister is, too. I refer to the granting of the lease to the British Petroleum-Theiss-Westfield group. I believe I speak on behalf of all Australians when I say that Australians have a priority interest in knowing how the Queensland Cabinet arrived at the decision to allocate a prospecting authority over a $1,600m coal field. The lack of answers to a number of questions strikes at the very heart of the concept of honesty in government. For instance, why should British Petroleum have thought it necessary to host the former Minister for Mines, Mr Ron Camm, on a trip overseas before he retired last year? British Petroleum dominates the successful Winchester South consortium. The Australian public should be told if that company knew at the time it organised Mr Camm's trip that tenders were being invited for the right to prospect and mine coal reserves worth $1,600m. We might all like to know why Mr Camm and Sir Leslie Thiess, while in London, met with British Petroleum officials. That is another interesting question. I wonder what happened at that meeting. I wonder why the British Petroleum company and Thiess were told that if they included Westfield in the deal, they would be sure of the contract.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are other inferences to be drawn from the fact that a man known to many people, and known well to the National Party, was at the head of this deal. I do not like naming people in the Parliament, but the matter has been reported and I think it is necessary that it all be cleared up in this House. The man is known to be Sir Edward Lyons. Sir Edward Lyons knows very well that he is being accused of these things. If the truth has to be known and the deals have to be put on the table then Sir Robert Sparkes, who wants everyone's name cleared, should clear the name of Sir Edward Lyons, too. His name is mentioned in dispatches, along with all these other accusations. They cannot all be wrong; they are not all made up by the Labor Party. They are made up by the Liberal Party, and honourable members opposite well know that. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition Government in Queensland is very shaky at the moment, and it will be shakier from here on in because of the leaks. If honourable members opposite condone these actions, I can only feel sorry for them. They can only be condemned for doing so. As the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) has said, Mr Camm's successor, Mr Sullivan, did not last long in the job. Why was his tenure cut short? Was it because he declined to use the rubber stamp again? He knew all about the rubber stamp Government of Queensland. A report in the Brisbane Courier-Mail of Wednesday, 11 March states:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Bjelke-Petersen said he reviewed the tenders last week, and the winning tender was 'so far ahead of the others there can be no argument about it.'</PARA>
<PARA>What a lot of nonsense that is. There can be no doubt about it because he had rubber-stamped it. He had gone to Mr Gibbs, and said that he would give him the job if he would rubber-stamp the issue. Everyone knows that that is what happened, and that is why Mr Sullivan, another honest Minister, got the chopper. Plenty of honest people get the chopper in the Queensland Parliament. Why was the consortium's bid pushed so hastily and with such great secrecy before a Cabinet which had no prior knowledge of the merits of this or other tenders? My time has run out. However, many more accusations have been made. Unfortunately I will not have time to put them before this Parliament. I hope that the Treasurer will take some action in regard to this matter and that he puts the razor gang to work in Queensland very quickly, especially so far as Bjelke-Petersen is concerned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It must be a grave disappointment to this House to have before it a subject which is so lengthy in its presentation but which is spoken to so little from the floor of the House. One wonders why the Labor Opposition has raised the matter. I can give only one reason-that the Labor Opposition in Queensland is so lacking-it is non-existent-that it has to forward the charge to Canberra for the cream puffs of this Opposition to take it up. I have no hesitation in defending the National Party of Queensland for its role in the coalition Government. It must be remembered that that coalition, of which the Liberal Party is the other partner, has developed the State of Queensland. It is doing that partly on foreign capital and under the guidelines of the Federal Parliament. I ask the honourable member for Griffith (Mr Humphreys) whom he supports-the old guard at Breakfast Creek, the new guard at Charlotte Street or just the rearguard of the Opposition in Queensland?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Bowman said, it is probably the mudguard, and that is fairly rusty too. Let me deal with some of the unsubstantiated charges that are being made in connection with the Bjelke-Petersen Foundation. I imagine that exactly the same criteria apply to that as applied to the John Curtin House when it was established a decade or so ago. I deny that there has been any corruption. The Foundation is sponsored not by the Queensland Parliament but by a political party. Accusations of corruption are beyond credibility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am also appalled that the opportunity has been taken to try to use parliamentary privilege in this place to cast a slur on the character of some very fine Queenslanders. Sir Edward Lyons, who was mentioned by the honourable member for Griffith, is a fine man and I believe that he had no part in the assessment of tenders or the letting of the contract for the Winchester South coal deposits; nor did Mr Camm. Mr Camm was a Queensland public servant at the time. I understand that he had no part in it whatsoever. The claims that he had anything to do with the acceptance of this tender are unsubstantiated. I hope that the public of Australia sees this as a very weak and futile attempt by the Federal Opposition in Canberra to take up the cudgels for a very weak Opposition in Queensland. I think that had to be said. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, the argument has been narrated as a long one, but the question must be: So what? This is a constitutional matter. Queensland has certain constitutional rights. We know that the Australian Labor Party, as a Federal party, would want to deny resources to the States and take them for itself. As far as I can see, this matter of public importance is not being raised so we can debate the subject in question but it is being used as a diversionary tactic to knock the multinationals or the transnationals and to promote the Opposition's argument in favour of some form of resource tax. We know that the Opposition wants to expand the coal levies it implemented between 1972 and 1975. It wants to impose a resource rent tax. It wants to put further controls on industry from Canberra, whether it be through the Foreign Investment Review Board or not. It wants to direct and not guide the policies of resource development in Australia. I think we have to be aware of the actual intention of the Opposition in bringing this matter up. </PARA>
<PARA> In bringing this matter forward the Opposition has shown very little enthusiasm and has provided little information to back its claims. For instance, has the Opposition talked about applying Australian ownership guidelines to prospecting? I do not think that it has been mentioned in more than two or three words. Certainly the honourable member for Griffith said nothing about it at all. But it favours such guidelines at the developmental stage. Why do we not let the foreign capital be used in prospecting provided-this is still the proviso with the Winchester South field-that at the time when the developmental lease is negotiated we do have Australian capital?</PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that the last report of the FIRB indicates that between 1974 and 1975 the degree of foreign ownership of the coal resources of Australia was 62.1 per cent and foreign control was 64.1 per cent. In 1979 the figures had dropped to 40.3 per cent for Australian ownership and 43.5 per cent for foreign control. The report also indicates that for new black coal projects the projected production is 127.7 million tonnes per annum. It is contemplated that 35.1 per cent will be foreign owned. So the percentage is decreasing. </PARA>
<PARA> A rather spurious argument was advanced by the member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) when he said that resources owned at the moment by foreign interests could be sold at a substantial premium later. This Government would not want to control the transfer of shares to the extent that was contemplated by the honourable member for Blaxland. One company floated in Australia, the Southern Pacific and Central Pacific Minerals Co., was 100 per cent Austalian owned. I would like to know what degree of Australian ownership there would now be and how loyal the original Australian shareholders have been when the price has fluctuated overseas. How can we control such things?</PARA>
<PARA> The Winchester South field, which is in the Dawson electorate, is one of a number of steaming coal developments. On the admission of the Labor Party, I understand that the project must be about 75 per cent Australian owned, particularly as BP Australia is in Australian hands. There were 32 applicants for the Winchester South lease. I understand that the matter was taken to Queensland Cabinet without details being given to the Ministers beforehand, as is normal over a weekend because of security. I understand also that Cabinet appraised the matter and made its decision in the normal way. A fat lot of good that security precaution was. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition in Queensland was able to bring leaked documents into the Parliament. But what a leak it was. It was just a damp squib. The Queensland Opposition was so unsuccessful that the Opposition's mouthpieces here, the powder-puffs of the Parliament, have had to take up the cudgels. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to recognise that coal resources are State-owned assets. The control the Commonwealth has over them through export licences and the Foreign Investment Review Board is sufficient. The Winchester South project is likely to return to Queensland more than the other projects have in the past. I think that is only to be expected when the history of coal mining development in Queensland is traced. In the past there has been a high degree of foreign ownership when developments have commenced, but foreign ownership is decreasing tremendously. On the face of it, why can we not let the multinationals undertake development in a very high risk area, which is what resource development has been in the past? Now the Government of Queensland has proved, as it did under the direction of the former Minister for Mines, Mr Camm, that it can progressively pick up more in royalties and State taxes as development goes along. It can benefit not only through government revenue but also through Australian participation. Our guidelines are to the effect that wherever possible Australian development should be in the hands of Australians if they can afford to put up the money. But if a development is to lapse for want of Australian funds, it is then that we should seek foreign ownership. We are talking in terms of only 25 per cent Australian ownership in this case. I believe there is nothing irregular. I believe there was tremendous lobbying and tremendous pressure from the 32 other applicants before the decision was made. I agree with the security arrangements that were implemented, but which were not successful in view of the leak. This Parliament-the Opposition and the Government-would seek maximum Australian participation, as it has, and that it would want to get maximum Australian revenue, as it has in this case. I agree wholeheartedly with the Treasurer in this regard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last night, the effluxion of time cut me off in my prime. I was proposing a case for the Australian Tourist Commission to be upgraded to the status of a full department. I mentioned some of the reasons why that should happen and I spoke briefly about the financial significance of the tourism industry, its labour intensive nature and my view of the Government's lack of a real understanding of the importance of tourism to Australia. I would go further and suggest that the chance to create jobs in the leisure industry by sensible forward planning by government would be a prime justification for bringing back the Department of Tourism and Recreation. Tourism will grow in response to increased leisure time, annual leave and rising real incomes. The 35-hour working week is inevitable, despite the sabre rattling against it by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). As Voltaire said-I am sure a man of your erudition, Mr Deputy Speaker, would know this quote-'no army can withstand an idea whose time has come.' The time has come for this Government to be much more aggressive in its promotion of tourism. Were the Government more prescient than stubborn, it would concede the merits and the inevitability of the 35-hour week and swing into a progressive strategy to maximise the resultant leisure boom that will come out of shorter working hours. This is just not happening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The tourist industry needs a great deal of Federal Government assistance. Many competing interests have facets of the tourist industry within their ambit; for instance, caravan manufacturers vying with motel proprietors, airlines in competition with coach companies right up to States versing States, all in competition for the leisure dollar. So a scheme to promote tourism generally would be difficult for private industry to undertake. The only real alternative, once we have decided just how important the tourit industry would be, is government funding. This is a prime example of public sector spending directly stimulating demand in the private sector. I would like to make this reservation in proposing a federal department to oversee tourism and leisure. I would not like to be seen to be ignoring the existing Australian Tourist Commission or the fine work it does. I am merely stating that the fine work that it does merits its being upgraded to departmental status. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned in my earlier remarks that the Government's net contribution to tourism in the last Budget was $10m. This parsimony on the part of the Federal Government belies its much heralded support for the tourist industry. I would like to quote the Chairman of the Australian Tourist Commission on the problems that he is having with staff ceilings which have been drastically reduced in the last few years. He said that staff ceilings 'caused extreme difficulty in adequately servicing the industry overseas'. The Chairman went on that this was in spite of the dedication of the staff who were 'very keen and highly enthusiastic' and worked long hours, deferring leave and other private commitments in order to achieve the goals they had been set. There is no need for slave labour to capitalise on the tourist boom. A separate department is the logical answer. The Commission, I might say, is very optimistic about the future growth prospects for inbound tourism. Although it does not expect the high growth of 1978-79 to continue into the 1980s it does predict a rate of about 13 per cent per annum-a very considerable figure. </PARA>
<PARA> I would suggest that under the auspices of a ministry we could get down to the very serious business of government involvement in the tourist industry. Of course, whenever the term 'government involvement' crops up we hear shrieks of 'socialism' from some quarters. Yet, as I argued previously, through government involvement the industry can function to its maximum capacity and efficiency being, as it is, fragmented and yet, so economically significant. I do not know why we fear this proven strategy. It has been proved overseas that if governments become involved in the tourist industry that involvement usually leads to prosperity. In the last 12 months I was a member of a government delegation to Mexico. The Mexican Government could not, by any stretch of the imagination, be described as socialist. I can tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, of the beautiful hotel at which we stayed in Mexico City-the best hotel in a city of 14 million people. That hotel-the Chapapultic Hotel-is owned and serviced by the Mexican Government. The New South Wales Government is presently involved in the building of the Sydney Regent in the Rocks area of Sydney. It will be the finest tourist hotel in Sydney and will provide immediately 300 full time jobs. I think that is fairly representative of what can happen if the Government is speculative, entrepreneurial or dynamic in promoting a tourist industry in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It is ironic that the great northern crusader against the dreaded socialists, the husband of Senator Flo Bjelke-Petersen, saw fit to hand over part of Queensland freehold to Japanese interests, namely, Iwasaki, but steadfastly refuses the same privilege to Australian Aborigines. They have to be content with a lease. Mr Deputy Speaker, whilst you might consider that what I am saying is fairly tenuously involved in this tourist argument, allow me to say this to you: 'I think the Iwasaki project could have gone along with a 50 per cent government involvement, with the Australian people still holding the freehold'. I think that is exactly the way in which the Government should be operating. Of course, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) spoke a while ago about this Government's allowing BP to have the Winchester lease in Queensland although this organisation is 46 per cent owned by the British Government. Yet, the Government refuses to involve itself in any sort of promotion of that type for fear of being branded socialist. I find that situation to be rather invidious. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to explain further how I think the Government should have involved itself in the financial sense. I was recently on the Gold Coast. I note that the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) at the table is from Queensland. I was told by the Gold Coast City Council about the dreadful trouble it is having in providing proper facilities in that area. It is very short of money which is needed to keep up proper water and sewerage services. It appears that each luxury unit in all the complexes which are presently being built right along the coast, particularly at Surfers Paradise, provides only $140 a year in local rates. That seems to me to be a very poor state of affairs. The people who own and live in these units have access to the beautiful beaches on the Gold Coast for only $140 a year. I think there would be a very good case for this Government to slap a luxury tax on those sorts of developments to ensure that money is provided so that local government can properly service those areas. After all, they are our future. </PARA>
<PARA> The only industry in Australia which appears to have some prospects in the labour intensive areas is the tourist industry. Unless governments of all sorts have the money to invest in the industry our hopes for the tourist industry will not be realised. The same thing that is happening on the Gold Coast is happening in Sydney. Areas such as Bondi and Coogee are known world wide as the great attractions in Sydney. The only money that local governments get to keep those beaches looking reasonably decent is from the local residents. It seems to me that governments should make subsidies available so that these facilities can be made the sorts of attractions they should be. Bondi is pretty chatty by anybody's estimation. I see the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Jull) is shaking his head, but it is true. If the Federal Government were prepared to subsidise those beachside areas with some funds perhaps they could be made the Acapulco of Australia and perhaps attract more tourists than they do. </PARA>
<PARA> We have golden opportunities to make and take from the exciting leisure industry. The Minister for the Capital Territory and Minister Assisting the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr Hodgman) said that we can expect a record one million tourists to Australia this year providing a $1,000m boost to the economy. We cannot talk up a boom. It we did it might be dangerous to the economy. We must underpin the tourist industry with sound and sensible infrastructures. We on this side of the House urge the Government to stop pussy-footing around and to come to grips with the true situation. We have great potential as a nation which is attractive to its own citizens to explore and equally attractive and interesting to foreign visitors. We must do all in our power as a government to foster the industry to the advantage of the Australian population, not forgetting the sensitive nature of our environment. The two are capable of existing harmoniously with forward planning of the right kind. </PARA>
<PARA> I will leave it to later speakers in the debate to refer to the great attractions of Australia. I know that the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Cohen) is anxious to tell us of the glories of the cosmopolitan city of Sydney. He will want to say something about its beautiful harbour and its magnificent Opera House which is attracting something like 90 per cent of all international visitors. We will be told about the Great Barrier Reef in Queensland, the uniquely Australian town of Alice Springs, the Red Centre, the Alps and the whole range of beautiful natural attractions which we have in Australia that are not properly exploited. </PARA>
<PARA> In urging the Government to take up our suggestions I leave honourable members with this thought in mind. I refer to a quotation from The Complete Life by John Erskine-a book which was written a long time ago. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> The body travels more easily than the mind, and until we have limbered up our imagination, we continue to think as though we had stayed at home. We have not really budged a step until we have taken up residence in someone else's point of view. </PARA>
<PARA>I put it to the House that our view is worthy of the Government's mental residence. I hope that it takes up our suggestion that by being more aggressive, more entrepreneurial and more dynamic in the promotion of the tourist industry, by means of some government involvement in terms of revenue, this industry which has enormous potential could prosper in Australia so that the resources boom, which inevitably we are going to have, will lead to shorter working hours and a greater possibility that the Australian population will enjoy all the wonders of Australia. In doing so we would provide employment for other people because this is the one industry in Australia which is capable of promotion and which is entirely capable of providing employment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think one of the features of the great debate on tourism in the last Parliament was the fact that both sides of the House took a bipartisan approach to the subject. The honourable member for Robertson (Mr Cohen) played a very real part in helping in the development of tourism for Australia. I was a little disappointed in some of the speeches, especially in the speech of the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown) last night. He seemed to forget that bipartisan approach and was terribly critical of some areas on which, frankly, he did not have the facts and figures. Perhaps I should spend the first part of my contribution to this debate today in stating exactly what the situation is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> More has happened in tourism in this country in the last five years than happened in the previous 25 years. Australia has increased its share of international visitors. I believe that last night the honourable member quoted the figure of 0.03 per cent. That figure has risen to 0.07 per cent, which represents not an insignificant number. He did admit this afternoon, however, that this year for the first time we are looking at the prospect of having one million international visitors to this country. That is indeed significant. We are fast heading to the time when Australian tourist accounts will be in the black. Previously we have had an outflow of dollars. Australians going overseas spent more than tourists coming in. It is significant that tourism receipt figures are rising. On present estimates, this year we can look forward to receiving $900m from international tourists. That is incredible. The latest figures which have come to hand would indicate that the average overseas visitor last year spent something in the vicinity of $1,013. That is a significant figure. </PARA>
<PARA> This year tourism will be worth in excess of $386 billion world wide. It is the second biggest industry after the oil industry, and by the middle of this decade the tourist industry will be as big as the oil industry. Thank goodness that Australia is now starting to take its share of that international tourist market. We have been able to do this for a number of reasons. It is true that the amount of money spent overseas by the Australian Tourist Commission has increased substantially. That has certainly helped. The lowering or partial lowering of international air fares has also helped in increasing the number of visitors coming here. But the real fact of the matter is that Australia now has become more competitive in international tourist terms. The fact that we have been able to keep our inflation rate lower than that of most of our competing countries has been significant. For example, the walk in off the street price at an Australian hotel is now appreciably lower than the prices which are charged in places such as Singapore or Bangkok. It is infinitely cheaper than the United Kingdom price and infinitely cheaper than prices in most of the countries of Europe and it is on a par with prices being charged in the United States. We can compete. Australia is a very desirable destination. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly the Australian Tourist Commission has a huge job to undertake. I think it does that job manfully and well with the resources that it has. I would not disagree that there is room to move in expanding the budget of the Australian Tourist Commission to help it in its promotion. At the moment it is limited by the number of overseas officers and the number of staff that it has. Those things being taken into account, the Commission is doing a magnificent job. As the honourable member for Parramatta pointed out, we must continue to support and develop this industry because it is this industry more than any other which provides job opportunities, especially for semi-skilled and unskilled labour. As I have said in this House, and I think it is worth repeating, the Bureau of Industry Economics has proved that for every extra 25,000 international visitors coming to this country another 1,400 jobs are created. That is a most significant figure. The evidence is already there; it is already working. </PARA>
<PARA> A very interesting study is being undertaken in Queensland at the moment. Last year, in terms of job growth, Queensland outpaced all other States. In excess of 30,000 new jobs were created. It would appear that the tremendous boom in Queensland tourism has brought about an absorption of so many of those unemployed about whom we are all concerned. This can be directly attributed to the tourist and other allied industries and I think we must continue to promote such development. Another interesting thing is that domestic tourism has become more competitive in recent years. Having taken their first trip overseas, Australians find on their return that it is now cheaper to holiday at home than it is to take an overseas trip. We are certainly competitive in that regard. It is cheaper now to take a holiday on a Great Barrier Reef island than it is to go to, say, Fiji. It is certainly much cheaper to do an Australian tour than it is to go to some of the Asian destinations. When we consider that last year we experienced occupancy rates in some of our hotels along the Queensland coast as high as 91 per cent, that speaks for itself. The boom is on at the Gold Coast. It is certainly on at the Sunshine Coast around Noosa and at Cairns. Frankly, it is magnificent. However, there are things that need to be done, and there are things which we must move on very quickly if we are to take full advantage of that international tourism boom. </PARA>
<PARA> I think one of the most significant things that the Government has introduced is the depreciation allowance for new hotel construction. Right now around Australia no fewer than 27 new hotels are under construction. It is estimated that this year in Queensland alone $600 billion will be invested in the tourist industry. That is a significant figure. A few years ago the industry was in a state of depression and tourist operators were going broke. It is almost unimaginable to think that with just that little bit of Government help we have now reached the stage at which $600m is about to be invested in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> I should like to turn to a couple of the aspects of the amendments to the Australian Tourist Commission Act which we are debating today. These amendments give the Australian Capital Territory the opportunity to have a full voice in terms of the decisions of the Australian Tourist Commission. That is important. I am certainly not a Canberra-basher. Canberra is a very significant tourist destination. It has tremendous growth potential, especially for international tourists. The figures which were released in recent days are interesting. They show that the second biggest tourist attraction in Australia after the Sydney Opera House is the Australian War Memorial. Tourist operators in Canberra can give us significant figures as to the increase in the number of international tourists going through Canberra, especially in the inclusive tour charter coach market. These tourists are staying in Canberra in excess of one day and the amount of money that they are spending in this city is significant. It would be very interesting indeed to do an analysis of just which is Canberra's biggest industry after the Public Service. From my knowledge, and from speaking with the tourist operators, it would seem that tourism is Canberra's second biggest industry. For that reason, the Australian Tourist Commission should have representation from the Australian Capital Territory. It should also have full representation from the Northern Territory. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I could not agree more. Airports are very much a key to the success of the industry. I should like to get on to the aviation side in just a moment. In terms of the Northern Territory, it was interesting to learn from the studies undertaken by the ATC, that the two most desirable destinations that people want to visit in Australia are the Great Barrier Reef and Ayers Rock in the Northern Territory. We must make every effort to make sure that we meet the requirements of our international visitors. I am sure, with the amount of money that is being spent by the Northern Territory tourist promotion people at the moment, and with their input into the Australian Tourist Commission, that that can be brought about and that there will be a promotion of the unique facilities that are being offered in the Northern Territory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It would seem to me that there is only one thing that is holding Australian tourism back at this time. That is certainly our international air policy which is married, of course, to our domestic air policy. I mentioned a moment ago that the institution of the advance purchase excursion fares system has helped significantly in generating people coming to Australia. The figures that were released following the survey of international visitors indicate just that. I pay full tribute to the Government for bringing in that measure. That experiment has not worked fully. International air fares are becoming detrimental to the inflow of tourists to this country. Our biggest single problem at present is probably not our physical position in the world. As someone once said, no longer is Australia's problem the tyranny of distance; it is the tyranny of the high air fare. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we should go back over the last three years to see exactly what has happened. The new air fare regime was heralded in many places as being the great salvation for Australian tourism. I admit that we have seen dramatic increases in the number of people coming to Australia to visit friends and relatives. We have seen quite good increases in the number of pure tourists coming to this country. If we look at where those pure tourists are coming from on their package holidays we will see that our biggest single international market is New Zealand. Because of our old links and old ties we should be looking more towards Great Britain and Europe providing us with international visitors. </PARA>
<PARA> I accept that there has been a dramatic increase in the number of people visiting friends and relatives. Frankly, I was quite shocked and horrified to find at recent public hearings on applications for air routes into Australia that the total number of package holidays sold to Australia from Great Britain last year was 2,000. Britons are the largest purchasers of package holidays in the world. In fact, last year five million Britons went overseas on package holidays, and Australia got 2,000 of them. What is even more horrifying is that British Airways, which has a monopoly situation with Qantas Airways Ltd on the Australian run, actually allocated a grand total of 20 seats a week to travel operators in Britain to sell package holidays to Australia. If that was not enough, with just a little over 100 people coming here on British Airways, it was later learned that Qantas contributed the princely sum of 700 seats during the year to travel operators to package Australian holidays. The rest of the package holidays were sold, probably on bodgey fares, by the Malaysian Airline System. MAS contributed more to the package holiday market in Australia last year than either of the national carriers operating on those two routes. We were told by Qantas and especially the Department of Transport that when the new international air fare regime came into operation it would be the greatest thing to promote tourism. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the things with which the Australian Tourism Commission is charged is looking after the promotion of Australian tourism and operating in conjunction with the airlines and the Department of Transport to encourage international visitors come to the country and to travel around the country. The point I wish to make is that there must be a closer relationship between the Australian Tourist Commission and the aviation authorities in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When the new air fare regime was introduced three years ago we thought there would be more flights, cheaper seats and cheaper fares. Let us look at the history of the route. I have spoken to Australian Tourist Commission officials in London who have given to me much of the information and have detailed many of the problems with which they are faced. They have produced some facts that really are quite startling. Although promises were made not one new flight has been introduced. Apart from the ten flights that were operating in 1978 not one new flight has been introduced by Qantas or British Airways on that route. International passenger survey figures indicate that 40 per cent of the traffic on the United Kingdom-Australia run is taken up by intermediate point traffic-the high yield traffic. Only one new Australian city, Darwin, is being serviced under this new air fare regime. That service was introduced only after a speech was made in this House in which Qantas was severely criticised for failing to serve Darwin. Services to Sydney and Melbourne have remained unchanged. Services to Brisbane operated by the two national carriers have been depleted. The service to Perth has deteriorated from 12 to 10 services a week and, at the moment, the super-Apex fare is not particularly low. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of the tourist related fares being operated on world routes the cheapest air fares to Australia at the moment are exactly twice those being charged on the major routes. The advance purchase air fares are subjected to those conditions to such an extent that Qantas actually advertises in the United Kingdom trade Press that seats are not available. We are told that that is a matter of commercial judgment for Qantas. If we ask the Department of Transport how many Apex seats are allocated they say that that is a commercial secret, that we are not allowed to know. I doubt whether the Australian Tourist Commission would know the number of seats allocated. Quite frankly, some of the figures I obtained in Britain were really staggering. Those figures show that as few as 15 seats to Australia were allocated on the cheaper fare. </PARA>
<PARA> Neither of our national carriers has really done much to promote true tourism traffic to Australia from Great Britain. The Australian Tourist Commission should have a much greater input in determining aviation policy. I spoke to people in the Australian Tourist Commission in London who said that their greatest frustration was in getting seats to make available to travel agents in Britain to provide package tours to sell to Australia. Frankly, that is just not good enough. It is fair to say that we cannot expect the Australian Tourist Commission to provide miraculous figures unless all the conditions are right. To my mind that would be the one point that needs to be rectified as soon as possible. We have to get that air fare component right in an international sense. I find it amazing that we were told three years ago that negotiations were under way to establish a tour basing fare between Britain, Europe and Australia. That tour basing fare has not yet come about. The negotiations have not been successful. </PARA>
<PARA> We have reached a situation in which officials of the Department of Transport are sneaking around the place, checking out passengers' tickets to see what is happening in the cut price air fare war. All that Australians are doing is reacting to the free market forces. I cannot see why an Australian traveller should have to pay twice as much as air fares should be. It is a lucrative market. I can blame no one but our own officials and perhaps this Government for setting up a protectionist area that has failed. We can only expect the free market forces to work. They will continue to work until such time as we take Qantas out of its quandary and let it compete in the market-place. Once we do that Qantas will absolutely kill the market. The Chairman of Qantas has already indicated that he is prepared to compete in the market-place. It is important that we get that absolutely right. </PARA>
<PARA> At the moment the domestic aviation situation also is in a state of flux and some very hard but very real decisions have to be made by the Government in the next few weeks. We have a new airline agreement. That agreement has been negotiated by the Department of Transport, the Government and the airlines but there has been no input regarding the terms of that agreement by the Australian Tourist Commission or the tourism section of the Department of Industry and Commerce. One wonders when one approaches the Department of Transport or the ATC just how much notice is taken by those bodies anyway. The problem with which we are faced is that we now have in Australia a cozy club in which Ansett Airlines of Australia, Trans-Australia Airlines, Qantas and the Department of Transport go behind closed doors in a secretive manner and negotiate air services. It is about time that those negotiations were brought out into the open. I suggest that this could be done by establishing in Australia some sort of authority which issued air licences and adjusted fares. If we could do that we could get the very real input of the ATC and the tourist industry into the whole decision-making process. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the questions that has to be asked by this Government in the near future is: 'How far can we go?' The fact that a tour basing fare is not available for Australian based travel agents from domestic airlines certainly is causing problems within the domestic industry. Travel agents in Australia receive only 5 per cent commission and we are reaching a stage where it is not in their best interests to try to promote Australian travel or Australian domestic fares. It is not in their interests to get good packages together so that they can be sold overseas. This is the sole prerogative of the domestic airlines. Unless the Australian Tourist Commission has the facility to package Australia in the best possible way we will never realise our true potential. We must realise our true potential if for no other reason than the tremendous employment prospects offered by international tourism. I support the amendments contained in this Bill. The Bill will be a tremendous help in promoting the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory as true parts of the total Australian holiday package experience. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As has been stated, the Opposition supports the Australian Tourist Commission Amendment Bill. Mr Deputy Speaker, I noticed that you pulled up the previous speaker, the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Jull), for not making comments relevant to this Bill. It is difficult, as you would appreciate, Mr Deputy Speaker, to talk for a long time about the actual increase of one in the number of commissioners. I think most of us would like to speak broadly about the question of tourism. I hope you will extend to me the same tolerance as you extended to the previous speaker. It is an exciting time for those of us who have been interested, involved and excited about tourism for many years-in my case since I first became a member of this House-finally to see this Government, this nation, recognising the value of tourism. I believe that our predictions of years ago will become increasingly more accurate as the years pass by.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Figures were given a few moments ago by the honourable member for Bowman indicating the expansion of the hotel industry. I read in today's Daily Mirror that in the electorate of the Opposition shadow Minister for tourism, the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown), a $25m hotel is to be built. Interestingly enough it will overlook Parramatta Park, a place with which I am vaguely familiar. </PARA>
<PARA> My interest in this matter goes back 12 years. I was instrumental in writing the policy for the Australian Labor Party prior to the 1972 Federal election and the policy which was implemented by the late Frank Stewart. It was a good policy. It was the first time, I think, that most people acknowledged that tourism was being taken seriously by a Federal government. I believe that we on this side have a very proud record with regard to the development of tourism by the national Parliament. When we went out of office I was determined that tourism would never again be relegated to the cinderella industry it once was. I asked the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) whether he would introduce a select committee on tourism. To our great pleasure and delight he did so. I served on it, as did the honourable member for Bowman. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the House of Representatives Select Committee on Tourism had one of the most profound effects upon industry of any select committee in this Parliament's history. Many of its recommendations were implemented. First and foremost, of course, the Committee placed the spotlight on the tourist industry. It received enormous publicity through the media. People started to discuss tourism and as a result the Government responded to the recommendations. The great majority of those recommendations, which were bipartisan, have been implemented. I have complimented the Government on the things it has done. </PARA>
<PARA> I always thought that the report of the Bureau of Industry Economics was most significant because it pointed out what we had known for years but could not prove, that the industry made a major contribution to employment and gross domestic product in this country. However, the recommendation that delighted this side of the House when it was implemented by the Government was the 2 1/2 per cent depreciation allowance on all new income producing hotel accommodation. Clearly that has had a significant effect on the increase in the number of hotels that are being built. Overseas promotion has increased substantially. Of course we now have international airports at Hobart and Townsville. </PARA>
<PARA> Today I wish to talk about what this Bill does not do. I wish the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch) were present in the chamber because I believe we do have problems in the industry. </PARA>

I ask this House to listen to what I am about to say because I believe we have to overcome these problems. If we take the right action there will be even more exciting times ahead of us. In Australia vast numbers of tourist towns see themselves as the tourist mecca. That will not occur. We cannot develop hundreds of tourist villages in Australia. We have to be relatively selective in promoting and planning specific areas for tourist development.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is also a growth in the number of aged people moving to the same tourist areas to retire. This has meant that there are hundreds of thousands of aged people moving into some towns, creating a conflict of interest between the retired and the business community which is seeking to increase the tourist traffic. The benefits of tourism-increased shopping and recreational facilities-often are not perceived as benefits by the retired, who resent the intrusion of the tourist, whom they regard as an intruder. Increased rates enable local government to provide infrastructure-water, sewerage, paved roads and cultural and social amenities. As the retired are, in the main, no longer seeking employment, the most obvious benefit of tourism is of little interest to them. The less obvious indirect benefits often are not related by them to tourism. Each new attempt to increase tourist attractions and accommodation is resisted. It is also true that in many cases the two lifestyles come into direct conflict. A very large number of tourists look for excitement on their annual vacation. Hotels, restaurants, bars, sporting events and facilities may well delight the tourist but in the numbers required for a successful tourist resort they may be anathema to the permanent resident, particularly the retired. Quite a number of tourist villages and towns are now resisting or at least questioning the large-scale tourist development that is being planned in their regions. Yeppoon, Noosa and Cairns are a few examples. We ignore this problem at our peril. </PARA>
<PARA> A feature of Australian tourist development is that in earlier times the rush to encourage development led local councils to accept virtually any application providing they increased rate revenue. Approved by councils were subdivisions which did not have water, sewerage, drainage and paved roads; facilities alongside poorly built shopping centres, and which lacked adequate community cultural and recreational centres. Although councils are now lifting their standards, in some areas the damage has already been done. Many seaside tourist and retirement areas are blighted by the past lack of planning and aesthetic standards and are too costly and fraught with administration difficulty to redevelop. Cheap, shoddy fibro and weatherboard holiday cottages alongside fading prefabricated jerry-built shopping centres have given many areas reputations that they are finding it difficult to recover from. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some notable exceptions such as Surfers Paradise, Port Macquarie, Coffs Harbour and Cairns which have attracted quality developers who are investing in international standard accommodation and tourist attractions. However, even these areas suffer from the mistakes of the past when earlier administrations lacked a vision of the future. I often give my own area, the central coast of New South Wales, as an example of that. There is also a marked reluctance by major hotel groups to become involved in tourist development outside the major capital cities. They prefer to concentrate on the business traffic in the cities. Earlier I mentioned the development at Parramatta by the South Pacific group. I have a great admiration for the South Pacific group but it has not been prepared to develop in the wilderness areas. Earlier I mentioned the hotel which is to be built at Parramatta. I appreciate that it is a business decision, but it is a shame the South Pacific group has not done so. </PARA>
<PARA> Developers are now seeking unspoiled areas to develop quality tourist resorts demanded by international visitors. Once again a clash occurs as Australian residents resent their intrusion. Noosa appears to be a particularly good example of this sort of clash of interests. Conservation groups are alert to any further alienation of the coastline, having seen so much degradation in the past. Tourist development is equated with the worst sort of coastal mismanagement. If Australia is to compete with the resort development that is occurring in other parts of the world where whole towns are being built for tourism where previously nothing existed then it is essential that total tourist complexes are developed along with existing centres and in tune with the environment. I think that can be done but we have to recognise this problem and separate, in some instances, the retired and local population from the tourist complex itself. </PARA>
<PARA> Opposition to total tourist development is often misdirected. Alienation of the coastal environment is occurring, whether we like it or not, by a number of kilometres each year. It attracts little attention because it is so gradual and occurs in so many small projects. I could never understand the opposition to the Yeppoon development. We have had problems-I will not go into them now-but I thought it was an excellent concept. Australians who have sought peace and tranquility for vacations or retirement are entitled to have that uninterrupted. However, if Australia is to attract international visitors and encourage Australians to spend more time holidaying in Australia, we must develop international quality tourist resorts for those who want a more active holiday, including sporting facilities, nightlife, restaurants and man-made attractions. Different people seek different things in holidays and I would be the last person to say: 'This is the sort of holiday you should have'. If people want nightlife and restaurants, let them have it. If they want to camp in the bush, that is fine. We should not impose one standard on everybody. </PARA>
<PARA> At the moment Australia has only one town totally planned for tourism-Thredbo. Another project of a similar nature being planned is the Yulara Village at Ayers Rock, and I compliment the Government on that project. The Iwasaki development at Yeppoon is, of course, in the same category. How do we resolve the problem caused by the lack of tourist facilities? In my view, Australia must build planned tourist developments to match what is happening in other parts of the world. Bali, Fiji, the Philippines and Mexico are just a few examples of countries which have set out after the tourist dollar and are going about it in a thoroughly planned and professional manner. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to talk about Mexico which was mentioned in this debate by the shadow Minister. The best example of a properly planned tourist development that I have seen is in Mexico. The Mexican Government has created a body, the National Trust for Tourist Development, which is known as FONATUR. It was established in 1974. It plans and builds, in co-operation with private enterprise, international standard resorts. Last year I visited two projects, as a guest of FONATUR, at Can-Cun and Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo. Can-Cun is located on the Yucatan Peninsula in the Caribbean near the ancient Mayan cities of Tulum and Chichen-Itza. It was selected after a search of 10,000 kilometres of coastline to find a remote area suitable for tourist development that offered all the essential requirements for discerning tourists-climate, scenery, beaches and proximity to places of historic and cultural interest. </PARA>
<PARA> FONATUR operates similarly to our own National Capital Development Commission. It acquired the whole area, 10,000 hectares, for total development and moved in to provide the infrastructure required for Can-Cun to attract the private investment necessary to ensure its success. The resort is on an island about 21 kilometres in length and 400 to 500 metres at its widest part which is separated from the mainland by only a few hundred metres or so. The local director of the Can-Cun FONATUR project informed me that about $75m had been invested in the infrastructure costs of the township alone. The Trust had already received all that money back from the proceeds of the sale of land to private developers and hoteliers. I was not able to obtain details of the total cost of the international airport, telecommunications or road developments, but this was probably about a further $200m. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole area is planned to ensure that there is maximum harmony between the tourists and the local residents. Hotels and condominiums, residential areas, shopping centres, the airport, convention facilities and the commercial centre are all located in properly planned areas to ensure ease of movement and aesthetic standards. The project has been developed in stages. At the moment it has reached the 4,000 hotel-room mark and is well on the way to establishing 10,000 rooms. Virtually all the major international tourist hotel chains are represented, including Hilton, Sheraton, Club Mediterranee, alongside the Government's own chain, El Presidente. Twelve months ago private investment was estimated at between $350m and $400m in five or six years. Public and private investment, therefore, is probably between $600m and $700m. It needs to be remembered that the Can-Cun development is in a remote part of Mexico well away from the developed communities. It could be compared with our building in the Gulf of Carpentaria. I was informed that no existing communities were in the immediate area. </PARA>
<PARA> Figures on the development are very interesting. In the few years since Can-Cun was established, its growth has been phenomenal. The 4,000 hotel rooms have an occupancy rate of 89 per cent. In 1979 Can-Cun received 400,000 visitors-five years after its establishment. Fifty per cent were domestic visitors and 50 per cent were foreign visitors. Of the 50 per cent foreign visitors 82 per cent were from the United States and most of the remainder were from Canada. The city of Can-Cun, which has no employment other than tourism, has created employment for 9,000 people. If we include the families of those people, 36,000 people gain a living from tourism there. In 1979 those 9,000 employees earned an average of $US40 a week. That may not seem much but it was about 30 per cent higher than the earnings of the average Mexican. One hotel room in Can-Cun provides food for 10 Mexicans. </PARA>
<PARA> Although FONATUR sells land to private developers for hotels, motels and so on, it retains tight control on the type of development that occurs. Mexico has some of the finest and most imaginative architects in the world. This is evident in the design of the hotels which clearly bear the mark of the early Mayan architecture. Every private development proposal has to be passed by FONATUR. That does not mean only the physical dimensions. Unless the sketch plans are aesthetically pleasing and fit in with the overall design, they are sent back to the developer to be redrawn. No conflict exists between high-rise and low-rise buildings because the two areas are separate. Special zones are created for hotels, condominiums and private residential areas. The main commercial administrative centre is located well away from the main resort area. Light industry also has its own region. </PARA>
<PARA> I also visited Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo which is on the west coast, about 200 kilometres from Acapulco. This project is a smaller version of Can-Cun. It has about 1,500 hotel rooms and is aiming for a total of 5,000 rooms. I liked it better because I thought it was more in keeping with the sort of thing we could develop in Australia. Can-Cun was a bit grand for us. Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo is an area similar to the Cairns area with tropical rainforest and mountains in the background. It is absolutely beautiful, beautifully planned and it in no way interferes with the local community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the honourable member is right. The development is financed by government and initiated by government but in total is a private and public enterprise operation. No conflict of interest exists. People in private enterprise are delighted because the facilities are all laid out. They know the project will be a success because the Government is behind it and is providing the infrastructure. The Government gets its money back by selling the land to private enterprise and private enterprise knows the project will be fully promoted because the Government has a large investment in it. It seems to me to be the perfect sort of co-operation and initiative for a government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If Australia is to become a major tourist destination it must upgrade its tourist resorts and develop total tourist complexes such as I have outlined. Only governments have the constitutional power and the funds to initiate such projects. Only when governments indicate that they are prepared to commit their resources wholeheartedly to specific projects will they encourage major international hotel chains to invest in development outside the major capital cities. That is the point I am trying to make. Sure, we will encourage them into the big cities but we will not get great tourist resorts in the areas where we want to encourage tourists unless we do it that way. Last year I put forward a proposition which did not hit the deck but I hope that if I keep pushing it, it will. I want to see an Australian government, be it a Labor or Liberal government, set up an Australian tourist development corporation to develop tourist resorts of international standing. That proposal should have been incorporated in this Bill. Such development could occur only if it were invited by a State government and done in co-operation with that government. I think that would be essential. This should all be done in the total context of a national tourist plan. </PARA>
<PARA> The next questions would probably be where to build these projects and how many to build. I do not think it is right for me to say where these developments should take place, but clearly areas such as north Queensland and Tasmania would be suitable. I have spent a great deal of time talking to Tasmanians about this concept. I would like to spend another hour talking about Tasmania's potential as a tourist area. It needs tourist resorts more than any other State. One could perhaps be developed in the Hobart region, one in the Strahan area and one near Launceston. I do not know specifically where they should be situated. Tasmania needs to generate a little more excitement about what it has to offer. Without question, it is the most beautiful State in Australia but it lacks--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you very much for your guidance, Mr Deputy Speaker. As has been pointed out by the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Cohen), the Australian Tourist Commission Amendment Bill introduces three important and welcome but very specific amendments to the structure and the financial operation of the Commission. Being the fourth speaker after the Minister for the Capital Territory and Minister Assisting the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr Hodgman) in this debate it is very difficult to wax eloquent and at length on the amendments in the Bill. When, however, one realises that the Commision was set up for the purpose of encouraging visits to Australia by people from other countries and of encouraging travel within Australia, including travel by people who have arrived from overseas, I am sure the House will agree with me that the debate provides an opportunity for a freer ranging discussion of matters of importance to tourism. It is in that vein that I would like to contribute to the debate this afternoon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the constant complaints heard about travel in Australia, especially air travel, is that it is so expensive compared with international travel to and from Australia. For example, without dwelling on figures too much, it is cheaper to fly from Perth to Bali than it is to fly from Perth to Sydney or, in the other direction, it is cheaper to fly from Sydney to some of the South Pacific regions than it is to fly from Sydney to Perth. There is no doubt that this fare discrepancy inhibits domestic tourism. When one thinks of overseas visitors arriving in Australia, staying largely at the gateway of arrival and not venturing far afield into our country because of what they consider to be the prohibitive cost of domestic air travel, one realises that this is a problem for Australia's tourism. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Bowman (Mr Jull) correctly highlighted the report of the Holcroft Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares and the fact that the Government has before it a report of extreme significance to the Australian tourist industry. The Government has to make some decisions very shortly on that report-decisions which are of vital concern to the tourist industry, to travel agents operating in that industry and to anybody who wants to fly anywhere in Australia, be they a tourist or not. I will spend a couple of minutes, of course referring at all times back to the legislation before us, examining the Holcroft report. I review the position to date. The Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) tabled in the House on 25 February the report of the Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares. Associated with that tabling, the Minister issued a Press statement announcing that detailed consideration of the report would be pursued as a matter of urgency and that the Minister hoped to be in a position to make an announcement as to the Government's decisions on that report when the Government introduced the airlines agreement legislation later this session. The Minister repeated that statement when he delivered a recent speech to the National Country Party Federal Council in Canberra on Saturday, 7 March. The Minister called for constructive debate in this decision-making period. The Government has before it a report. The Government has rightly welcomed debate on that report, rightly welcomed input into its decision making process. I hope this afternoon in the few minutes that I have I can contribute to that constructive debate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government set up the Holcroft inquiry in May last year. Its terms of reference are well known to honourable members but to facilitate the subsequent reading of what I have to say I seek leave to incorporate the terms of reference in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>TERMS OF REFERENCE</PARA>
<PARA> The Terms of Reference of the Inquiry are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The Inquiry is to examine air fares on the trunk routes and regional routes operated by the two major domestic airlines, Trans Australia Airlines and Ansett Airlines of Australia, with special reference to the way in which fares are set on individual routes in the national network by use of an air fare formula. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. In respect of these routes the Inquiry should report, and make recommendations as appropriate, on:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) costs, revenues and load factors,</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) existing and alternative pricing policies including special discount arrangements,</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) the degree of cross-subsidisation. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. The Inquiry shall have regard to:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the public interest,</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) government domestic aviation policy including the objective of increasing competition,</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) the effect of competition on fares,</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) the report of the Domestic Air Transport Policy Review Committee,</PARA>
<PARA> (v) the desirability of a nationally consistent approach to setting first, economy and standard class fares,</PARA>
<PARA> (vi) factors which affect operating costs on particular routes,</PARA>
<PARA> (vii) the assignment of corporate overheads,</PARA>
<PARA> (viii) operations of other airlines over routes referred to in (l),</PARA>
<PARA> (ix) other relevant factors. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9J4">Mr SHACK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. It is important to note that the Government established that inquiry only one year after the publication of the Department of Transport's Domestic Air Transport Policy Review Committee report. Notwithstanding that departmental report and its conclusions there have been, and there were at the time, considerable and long-standing representations from all over Australia concerned about the fact that domestic fares were too high generally, that long haul routes were subsidising some of the short haul routes and that these two facts were, in fact, products of an inefficient airline system not the best for Australia's domestic air transport needs and not the best for Australian tourism needs. I think the last point is important because those who pressed for the establishment of the inquiry in the first place-the fair internal air fares campaign from Western Australia, the Western Australian Government, participants in the tourism industry and Western Australian members and senators from both sides-were under no doubt that the inquiry's terms of reference brought into focus the two-airline agreement.</PARA></TALK.START>

(iii) the effect of competition on fares and 3. (viii) operations of other airlines over routes I do not think it can be denied that the two-airline system itself is brought into focus. The public believes so because the bulk of submissions made substantial reference to the two-airline system and not just to fares. Submissions were received not only from the State governments of South Australia, Western Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory but also from the tourist industry. The members of the inquiry believed their terms of reference extended that far because they accepted such evidence and they brought down recommendations on the basis of those findings. I do not believe it is sustainable to argue in isolation that fares are separate from the system because it is the system which provides for the fare setting formula, which provides for the fare setting procedure based on inputs from that system. It is put into context with the system. Fares are but a product of the system. I do not think they can be considered in isolation. I want to turn to the report. It is a bulky three-volume document.</PARA></TALK.START>

I ask the honourable member to try to help the Chair in that regard.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I certainly accept that guidance. We heard from the honourable member for Robertson a very important speech about providing tourist facilities and about the need for providing such resorts and important venues around the country. The point I want to make in connection with our air fare system is that even the provision of those facilities, warranted as they are, is of little benefit to the Australian tourism if people cannot afford to fly there or make the discretionary judgment that it is too expensive for them to fly there. I really believe, in the context of this debate, this report is a watershed for Australian tourism. It is something that I am certain the Commission is acutely aware of. The decisions the Government makes with respect to that report will have long term consequences with respect to the development of tourism in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Briefly, the report identifies gross cross-subsidisation between routes. The report identifies the deficiencies of the present air fare setting formula and procedure. The report points to a lack of desirable accountability necessary in a regulated environment. Let us turn and look at cross-subsidisation for a minute. These findings alone indicate the need for the inquiry in the first place. They certainly vindicate those who called for the inquiry. As I did before in tabling the terms of reference of the inquiry I also seek leave of the House to incorporate in Hansard two tables coming from the report which identify the extent of cross-subsidisation. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9J4">Mr SHACK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. For example, in the year 1979-80 passengers on the Perth-Sydney sector subsidised passengers on other routes to the extent of some $8.8m. If this cross-subsidisation is going on it helps to explain why many tourists from overseas, upon landing at the gateway of Sydney, for example, do not venture any further west simply because they make the decision that the fares involved in doing so are simply too expensive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second point identified in the report relates to the deficiencies of the fare setting procedure. The committe considered that the very existence of cross-subsidisation was a serious indictment of the existing pricing policy. That policy is based on the technically inefficient operation of the two participants, Ansett and TAA, in a system which in itself enshrines inefficiency. When tourists arrive in Australia the only way in which they can fly about the country in the major air networks is with these two airlines. One can appreciate that the cost of fares will affect whether those tourists travel further than the gateway of arrival. Throughout the report the committee brings down findings in similar vein. If people have the time, I would refer them especially to chapter 6. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the third point that the inquiry identifies relates to the lack of the accountability and regulatory control needed in such a regulated environment. The committee argues that where the two airlines are operating in an environment which is devoid of market forces and commercial considerations there is evident a lack of control which should be exercised by the regulatory authority-a control which should be exercised in the public interest, not only in terms of those who need to fly about Australia in the course of ordinary business but also of our tourist trade. </PARA>
<PARA> In response to those three major findings, the Holcroft report presents 36 recommendations which, taken as a complete package in the context of the two-airline system, represent an attempt to improve that system and better safeguard the public interest. I see as a first option open to the Government in considering the report the complete implementation of the 36 Holcroft recommendations. I do not think that it would be good enough to adopt only the fare setting recommendations and simply remove the cross-subsidisation inequities. It is the monitoring role and the need for public accountability which underpin the fare setting procedure. As I said earlier, these provisions are necessary to discipline the airlines in the absence of competitive market forces. Once again it demonstrates the point that fares are but a product of the system and cannot be considered in isolation. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government were to pick up what I have labelled the first option in an effort to improve the situation two difficulties would be presented. Firstly, it cannot be implemented without substantial renegotiation of either the present two-airline agreement under which the system works or that which the Government hopes to bring in later in the session. For example, the necessary monitoring role of the regulatory authority and the increased public accountability that is called for by the report cannot be put into effect in conjunction with either the present or the proposed agreement. The 36 recommendations, taken as a package, represent an attempt to improve the domestic air fares situation to the benefit of regular commercial travellers, private travellers and tourists. But even if the Government in an effort to assist tourism were to pick up all 36 recommendations, we would end up with what Holcroft himself describes as a second best option. Holcroft examines the two-airline system, as indeed he must if he is to consider fares. In various parts of the report the conclusion is reached that the two-airline system operates as a barrier to competition; it is out-of-date; it is a system which enshrines inefficiency; one which promotes waste and one which provides for fares being higher than they could be if another system were to take its place. In short, in response to these findings, the committee states:</PARA>
<PARA> The inquiry feels that progressive deregulation of all but safety requirements is the preferred solution. </PARA>
<PARA>It is no secret that I support this conclusion. In September 1979, in this House, I attacked the two-airline policy and called for its scrapping. I have repeated that call on many occasions and will continue to do so, if for no other reason than it has important consequences, as the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Jull) pointed out, for Australia's tourism. That, in turn, has important consequences for employment in that service area. </PARA>
<PARA> I am opposed to the two-airline policy because, among other things-if we are talking of tourism this is important-it denies to entrepreneurs freedom of entry to the market, the ability to be able to present a package-based fare in an endeavour to cater for the tourist market. It denies to the Australian travelling public significant carrier choice and offers little realistic price value choice in terms of fares. I admit that the policy, as it has operated, has some benefits. These relate to flight frequency and an especially high standard of in-flight service. But I do not believe that those benefits outweigh the disadvantages, and they are provided to the travelling public at an inflated cost. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier I called the two-airline system a piece of economic madness which is costing Australia dearly. Certainly it is costing Australian tourism dearly. It is one based on inflated costs due to enshrined operational inefficiency caused by an absence of real competition. A deregulated system, one more open to competition and to competitive market forces, would ensure that all features, not just frequency of service but most importantly price, would be based on, and responsive to, consumer demand. </PARA>
<PARA> I propose that the Government adopt the second option related to the Holcroft report. Briefly, I believe that it should pick the recommendations which relate to fare setting and the removal of cross-subsidisation. I believe that to be an absolute must. It is not an opportunity for the Government to bring in some new initiative, but simply for it to rectify a long-standing injustice and to remove long-standing inequities. Secondly, and fundamentally, I believe that the Government should give five years' notice of termination of the present two-airline agreement, as provided for therein. </PARA>
<PARA> When one compares the two agreements, present and proposed, side by side one can see some advantages in that which is proposed for freight, postal services and the like, but one also realises that it would enshrine the present system for a further 10 years and would have drastic effects for regional operators, who could play a large part in servicing the internal tourist market. One also realises that it would have severe disadvantages for Australian travel agents. Therefore, the Government should drop the proposed agreement and give five years' notice of termination of the present agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> During the five-year run down period prior to expiration-here I take up a point that the honourable member for Bowman made-the Government should establish a civil aviation type of authority with two specific roles. Within the restrictions of the present agreement the authority should monitor and regulate the airlines system a la Holcroft. A specialist body is needed because, as the Holcroft report correctly points out, to date the Department of Transport has not been capable of fulfilling that role. Secondly, that civil aviation type of authority needs to investigate and prepare for the progressive deregulation of our airline system at the end of the five-year period, with a view to bringing about ultimately one which will be truly competitive, responsive to consumer demands and needs, and one which will require all operators to be subject to commercial considerations and market forces. Mr Deputy Speaker, time has got away from me. I thank you for your lenience and hope to continue this debate on a subsequent occasion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Tourist Commission Amendment Bill proposes amendments to the Australian Tourist Commission Act 1967. I would like briefly to outline the proposed major amendments and to comment on them. Section 6 of the principal Act is being amended to provide for membership of the Commission to be increased from nine to 10 members. The additional member enables the States and Territories to have three members on the Commission on a rotational basis. This is a very desirable amendment, one which the States and Territories have been seeking for some time. If there were to be any criticism of the membership of the Commission it would be that there should be greater membership representation by the States and Territories.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Present membership of the Commission comprises members drawn from the tourist industry, the Public Service and the States and Territories in the following proportion: Six from the industry, one from the Public Service and two from the States and Territories. Because the tourist industry is such an important part of Australia's economy and because its growth is dependent on the involvement of State and Territory government, I suggest that the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch) should give consideration at a later date to increasing the number of representatives from the States and Territories so that each is continually represented on the Commission. I believe it is desirable to have closer liaison with the States and Territories for a number of reasons which I will outline later. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to section 12 of the Act concern the disclosure by members of the Commission of any pecuniary interest that they may have in matters coming before the Commission for consideration. I notice that the proposed amendments, although requiring a disclosure of any pecuniary interest, do not require a member to refrain from voting on a matter in which he or she has an interest. If the Act provides for disclosure of such an interest it should provide also for a member not to take part in or to vote on the matter under discussion. It appears that there is only a subtle difference between the amendments to Part V of the Act, which deals with finance, and the original sections. Funds appropriated to the Commission by the Parliament will remain with the Treasury and be paid to the Commission when required instead of being paid into the Commission's bank account, as was the case previously. In other words, the Treasury will earn interest on unspent funds rather than the Commission. I have no argument with that intention. In summary, the amendments appear to be desirable. Apart from those few matters dealing with representation on the Commission and the pecuniary interests of members, I support the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I now wish to speak generally on the role of the Australian Tourist Commission and the value of tourism to Australia. The Australian Tourist Commission was established to encourage visits to Australia by people from other countries, as well as travel within Australia. It is therefore a very important organisation which can become the catalyst for much increased visitation to Australia and for increased travel within Australia. I say that it can become the catalyst because I believe in previous years the Commission has had insufficient funds really to get on with the job of promoting Australia overseas and of getting people to travel within their own country. The credit for the significant increase in visitation to Australia in recent years must go not only to the efforts of the Commission but also to the reduction in international air fares and a shift in overseas currencies. As a result Australia has been made more appealing to visit from an economic point of view. The Commission's expenditure budget has grown from $1.520m in the first year of its operation, in 1967-68, to $8.9m in the current financial year. I seek leave of the House to incorporate in Hansard a table which shows the yearly expenditure budgets from 1967-68 to 1980-81. It also shows the real growth in expenditure. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. The table shows that the Commission's expenditure grew steadily from 1967-68 until 1972-73 after which, in real terms, it steadily decreased until the 1979-80 financial year. The table shows that although expenditure has grown almost sixfold since 1967-68, in real terms it has grown only slightly in excess of 1 1/2 times. If the expenditure budget had kept pace with the deflator index, the expenditure budget for the current financial year would have been in the order of $16m. Obviously there needs to be further massive increases in funding to the Commission if Australia is to increase its share of the very competitive tourist market. Additional funds could be allocated by diverting from Consolidated Revenue to the Australian Tourist Commission the $10m presently received from the gateway exit tax. It is not good enough for the Government to point to the increased growth in tourism to Australia over recent years as an excuse for maintaining funds at a low level because other factors have been the cause of that tourist boom. The enormous drop in international air fares a couple of years ago and changes in overseas currency rates have combined to make Australia a more enticing tourist destination for many overseas visitors. That is why during 1979 a total of 793,000 short term visitors came to Australia, an increase of 25.8 per cent over the previous year. In 1980 the number of visitations continued to increase, and 893,000 people came to Australia on short term visits. The growth rate between 1979 and 1980 dropped to approximately 12 per cent and unless we devote more funds to promoting tourism to Australia the rate obviously will drop further.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Tourism is big business to any country and some smaller countries rely on tourism for their basic wealth. It is estimated that during 1979 overseas visitors added $650m to the Australian economy. When we take into consideration the tourist and visitation pattern of movement within and between the States and Territories of Australia by our fellow Australians revenue to Australia from tourism is around $1,000m. In my State of New South Wales during 1979-80, domestic tourism generated 16.3 million trips, 83 per cent of which were within New South Wales. There is great potential for domestic tourism within Australia but the $300,000 set aside in the current Budget for the Australian Tourist Commission to promote such activity is insufficient to get across to Australians the message that they should see their own country first. </PARA>
<PARA> Almost half of the Australian people do not take a holiday away from their usual place of residence, so there is still a lot of promoting to be done if we are to realise the full tourism potential of our country. Many of these people, particularly low income families, cannot afford to go away on holidays. To help overcome that problem I believe the Australian Government should provide funds to non-profit organisations such as local councils and the Youth Hostels Association of Australia to enable the construction of low cost accommodation facilities for use by low income families and the youth of our community. I congratulate the New South Wales Minister for Tourism and the New South Wales Department of Tourism for the manner in which they have provided low cost accommodation facilities by funding, mainly on a dollar for dollar basis, organisations such as those I have mentioned. Over $1m has been provided in recent years by the New South Wales Government for the construction of such facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> The national capital of Australia, Canberra, needs such accommodation facilities so that school children and low income families can come to this great city and enjoy its splendours. As an Australian, I am proud of our national capital and no citizen should be denied the privilege of seeing our capital and seat of government because he cannot afford to pay for accommodation. It is our duty to ensure that this city and this Parliament are accessible to our fellow Australians. As a pilot project I commend to the Government the provision of sufficient funds to the Youth Hostels Association to enable the building of low cost accommodation facilities in the Australian Capital Territory for use by school children and low income families. Half a million dollars is all that would be required for the project. </PARA>
<PARA> Returning to the activities of the Australian Tourist Commission, I would briefly comment on the level of staff ceilings set by the Government. Those countries from which we attract the largest number of visitors-New Zealand, the United Kingdom, the United States of America and Japan-have been the hardest hit by staff cuts. In fact all those countries have had or now have less staff to promote Australia than they had in 1977. If we look at the annual report of the Australian Tourist Commission we will see a staff summary on the last page. It shows that in 1977 in the United States of America there were 13 staff members on the Commission but in 1980 the number had dropped to 11. In the United Kindgom there were five staff members in 1977 and that number remains the same today. In New Zealand there were five in 1977 but in 1980 that number dropped to four. In Japan the number of staff in 1977 was six and that number dropped to four in 1980. I think that summary shows that there is a great need in the Australian Tourist Commission for an increase in staff, particularly in those countries from which we have most of our visitors. It is a ludicrous state of affairs if the Government is genuinely expecting the Commission adequately to promote Australia in those countries. It is little wonder that the New South Wales Government has opened its own tourist offices with staff in each of those four countries I have just mentioned. I suggest that the Minister look at this as a matter of urgency, because we cannot hope to increase visitation from those countries without adequate staff for promotional and informational purposes. In my opinion it would be far better for the Commission to promote Australia overseas as a total country rather than allowing the States to promote their own areas on a purely parochial basis. </PARA>
<PARA> However, in recent years we have seen some of the States, including New South Wales and Victoria, promoting themselves overseas because of the inadequate level of promotional activity carried out by the Commission. I do not like this purely parochial promotion by the States, mainly because a lot of the promotional material does not place Australia as a whole in proper perspective in comparison to the State being promoted. One would think, by looking at some promotional material, that all the attractions and natural wonders of this nation are the preserve of some States. Some of it reminds me of maps of the world printed in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries by certain oriental countries which showed their own sizes in an inflated manner in an effort to distort their true influence in world affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> I consider, therefore, that the Minister should attempt to obtain agreements from the States and Territories that the responsibility for promotion of Australia overseas should rest with the Australian Tourist Commission. The States could then utilise their funds on internal promotional activities and on the improvement of facilities. Sydney, for example, is the gateway to Australia. In 1980, 571,000 overseas visitors, or 64 per cent of the total, entered Australia through that city. The reason is, of course, that the nation's birthplace has much to offer the tourist with both natural and man-made attractions. Careful planning by The Rocks Development Authority has now transformed the Rocks area of Sydney into an historical delight. The Sydney Opera House is, of course, the most popular tourist attraction in Australia, and the linking of that attraction with the Rocks area has made the harbourside and Circular Quay area of Sydney a marvellous and most self-satisfying tourist visitation area. The New South Wales Department of Tourism is to be congratulated on its many initiatives in promoting and servicing the needs of tourists coming to Sydney. The Department's new tourist bus service, which transports tourists and visitors to the major tourist attractions in Sydney, is proving to be of great success. The New South Wales Government, by the introduction of financial incentives and, I believe, a depreciation incentive which is available from the Federal Government, has been able to attract a number of entrepreneurs and convince them to build international hotels in Sydney, some of which are already under construction. These international hotels, numbering some eight in total, will provide by the mid-1980s an additional 2,500 rooms for use by tourists. With the continued increase in tourism they will certainly satisfy a need at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst I have been somewhat critical of the Government's lack of adequate funding of the Australian Tourist Commission to enable it properly to promote tourism to and within Australia, I do give due recognition to the fact that during the last two financial years expenditure by the Commission has doubled. In conclusion, I request the Minister to look at the suggestions that I have outlined. I urge the Government to make a greater contribution to the promotion of tourism so that the Australian economy and employment in Australia can be further improved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Human Rights Commission Bill is a piece of legislation which is not new to this House. Human Rights Commission legislation has been before the House of Representatives on a number of occasions. We are now debating what could be termed a reframed but not altogether new Human Rights Commission Bill. The first Human Rights Commission Bill was introduced into the Parliament by a former Attorney-General, the now Mr Justice Ellicott. That Bill was debated at length in 1979. Honourable members will recall that in 1979 the whole Bill was lost over an impasse between the Senate and the House of Representatives concerning the so-called Simon and Martyr amendments dealing with the abortion issue. The Bill now before the House is substantially the same Bill as that of 1979.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Adverting to the debate on the abortion issue, this Bill is different because those amendments which were the subject of so much bitterness were moved by the members concerned as private members; obviously, they had not been accepted by the Government and incorporated in the Bill which at that stage had been passed by the Senate. The validity of the amendments moved then is somewhat doubtful when one takes into account the fact that the amendments moved at that time by the Opposition suggesting that the human rights provision ought to apply to the States and Territories were opposed by the same gentlemen who moved their amendments on the basis of their belief that those amendments would provide a means of protecting the unborn child. Many of us did not accept the validity of their amendments as they had voted against the proposition that the human rights legislation should apply to the States. Without the acceptance of that proposition, their amendments in fact would have had very little application because the human rights legislation would not have affected State law. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, this Bill also is a weak Bill. The amendment which we will move to the motion that the Bill be read a second time adequately sums up our opposition to this legislation and the constructive proposals with which we would replace it. Firstly, we object to the fact that the Bill has no application to the laws and practices of the States and the Northern Territory. It is perhaps interesting in this context to look at the second reading speech which former Attorney-General, now His Honour Mr Justice Ellicott, made on 1 June 1977. The then Attorney-General referred to the fact that his initial proposal in late 1976 was for the establishment of a joint Commonwealth-State venture. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Under this proposal the Commission would have had power, amongst other things, to examine and report on Commonwealth and State laws and practices that were inconsistent with the International Convenant and it was proposed that individuals would be able to bring complaints affecting them to the Commission for investigation. It was proposed that reports of the Commission would be made by the Commission to all governments and it would then have been a matter for the relevant government, State or Commonwealth, to take any legislative or administrative action that might be appropriate to provide a remedy for any violation of the Covenant. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the initial proposal was that at least the Commission would have some power to inquire into the laws and practices of the States. Under the 1979 and 1981 legislation this would not be possible unless we were to have a very activist commission which was prepared to take a broad view of its powers. Under clause 9 (1)(c) the Commission would be able to report to the Minister on Commonwealth law or actions which should be taken by the Commonwealth on matters relating to human rights. It would be possible-I certainly hope it will be the case-for the Commission on its own initiative to suggest overriding Commonwealth laws in a number of areas, particularly in relation to Aboriginal rights. </PARA>
<PARA> The second of our major objections to this Bill is that it provides no judicially enforceable remedies of any kind. We all recall how what is now known as the Murphy Human Rights Bill of 1973 was vilified in a disgraceful and dishonest campaign to have it rejected. Now even Government senators agree on the need for judicially enforceable remedies. Senator Missen described our proposed amendment as very attractive. He said that there was very little in the amendment with which he did not agree. Most of the criticisms advanced against the Bill were sound, he said. But we note that he voted against the amendment. It is perhaps interesting to note the comments which Mr Justice Ellicott made on the role of judges on the introduction of the 1977 Bill. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is fundamental in a democracy that our basic human rights should be defined by Parliament and not by judges. </PARA>
<PARA>No one disputes that Australian courts and judges are conservative and reactionary, by and large more concerned with the preservation of the property rights of the wealthy than with the civil and political rights of individuals. However, passing a Bill of Rights does not mean that a parliament gives up its role in relation to human rights; it means that parliaments are prepared to say that there are some rights which are so basic that not even elected governments may take them away. As Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau put it, those rights depend on the outcome of no elections. It is those two matters-the lack of application to the States and the lack of enforceable remedy-which underscore the weakness of the whole Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has a litany of sins of both omission and commission in the human rights area. It is the most illiberal government since the Menzies Government of the 1950s and the Bruce-Page governments of the 1920s. However, no one would dispute that the majority of human rights violations have been and will continue to be perpetrated by the States. The Ellicott joint approach has failed and the Durack approach is simply to ignore the States. It is clear that only a Labor government will be prepared to take the step that will give us effective human rights legislation; that is, the enactment of Commonwealth legislation under the external affairs power, placitum (xxix) of section 51 of the Constitution. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZE4">Mr LIONEL BOWEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not a dangerous exercise. Human rights are never dangerous. The Minister is not frightened of even the voters in his electorate. The present Government, after signing the two important declarations on human rights-that is, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Convenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights-finally got around to ratifying the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights on 31 August last year. The terms of the ratification are quite extraordinary. There are no fewer than 14 objections to the Covenant. Perhaps the most contentious of all of those is the reservation relating to Article 50 of the Covenant. Article 50 states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The provisions of the present Covenant shall extend to all parts of federal States without any limitations or exceptions. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, in 1979 Article 50 was the subject of considerable debate concerning the non-applicability of the Covenant to the States. No other federation, West Germany or Canada for instance, has ever attempted a reservation based on federalism along the lines of the Australian reservation. It has been suggested that that reservation may actually be void or, at the very least, there will be problems of reciprocal arrangements between Australia and other nations which have made no such reservations. The point has been made by Mr James Crawford of the University of Adelaide that the Soviet Union could use Australia's reservation as a ground for arguing that Australia has no standing to challenge the Soviet Union's violation of the Covenant. </PARA>
<PARA> Among Australia's other reservations was the refusal to accept the application of the electoral principle of one vote one value. Even the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr Viner) would not object to that. That is why we still seek the enactment of a Bill drafted along the lines of the 1973 Human Rights Bill. Such a Bill would apply not only to the Commonwealth and the State parliaments and governments but also to the courts themselves. Recently the High Court dismissed an application for special leave to appeal from a conviction on a rape charge received from a person named McInnis in Western Australia. In effect, a majority of the High Court said that whilst it was desirable that people be legally represented, the trial was not void if there was not legal representation. Such a decision would have been impossible under the United States Bill of Rights. So it is important that we realise that the Bill of Rights is an instruction to both governments and parliaments, as well as to the courts. It will be noticed that there is an obligation under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights that people before the courts be entitled to legal aid and be legally represented before any judicial tribunal. But we find a high court saying that it is not necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the differences between the 1981 Bill and the 1979 Bill. One of these matters is particularly relevant, that is the removal of the provision allowing an applicant's complaint to be dismissed on the grounds that the complainant did not have sufficient interest or concern in the proceedings. We are glad that at least on this small issue the Government has now seen the logic which it failed to see two years ago. The other matter concerns the requirement for disclosure of interests by members of the Commission, no doubt brought about in part by the fairly inadequate report of the Bowen Committee of Inquiry concerning Public Duty and Private Interest. We have always found that report to be inadequate, but at least the subject of pecuniary interest is now part of the Australian legislative agenda. The major difference between the 1979 and 1981 Bills lies in the widening of the jurisdiction of the Commission to possible breaches of rights related to the Declaration of the Rights of the Child, the Declaration on the Rights of the Mentally Retarded and the Declaration on the Rights of the Disabled. Some people might see this simply as an attempt to diffuse the abortion issue. However, there is nothing in any of these declarations that is anything other than totally worthy. All children, the mentally retarded, and disabled people, should enjoy special protection under the law. I hope that perhaps even in a small way these amendments can do something toward that end. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of the fact that the work of the Commission will not be limited now to easily enforceable civil and political rights, but also to rights which may involve government appropriations and community resources in general, it seems strange that the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, signed by Australia in December 1972, and ratified in December 1975, is not included. Matters covered by the Covenant or by the Convention are spelt out in the amendment. These include guarantees of the right to form and join trade unions, social security, an adequate standard of living, work, physical and mental health, education, and to take part in cultural life. I refer to some of Clause 2 of Article 10 of that Covenant. It provides:</PARA>
<PARA> Special protection should be accorded to mothers during a reasonable period before and after childbirth. During such period working mothers should be accorded paid leave or leave with adequate social security benefits. </PARA>
<PARA>The Article then goes on to deal with other matters. I think it is significant that we have failed to embrace that Covenant in this legislation. In the Senate the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) did not reply on this issue. One would hope that the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs, who represents the Attorney-General in this place, would at least seek from the Attorney-General consideration of that proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter which we seek to have incorporated in the Commission's jurisdiction is the United Nation's International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women. In the Senate on 12 March, Senator Ryan gave notice that she would be moving a private member's Bill after July because of the Government's inaction in this area. Some of the States appear to believe that discrimination against women does not exist. In the Australian Capital Territory the whole subject is a long-running saga. At this stage there seems to be no reason, pending comprehensive Federal legislation dealing with discrimination against women, that the rather ineffectual Human Rights Commission should not be given jurisdiction over matters concerning the Copenhagen convention, that is the convention outlawing all forms of discrimination against women. I am told that that convention has been accepted by 78 countries. It is surprising to think that Australia is not amongst them. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, given the lack of enforcement provisions in the Bill, the Government could have given serious consideration to ratifying the optional protocol to the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights so that people could appeal to the International Human Rights Commission. I would suggest that it is precisely for the same reasons that the reservations were made to Article 50 of the Convention. That is because the Government is concerned that the international community should not find out that Australia's human rights record is not as rosy as it would like to portray it to be. Indeed, this Government speaks with a great deal of duplicity on human rights generally, both by its failure to do anything about human rights at State level in Australia, and because of the view it seems to take that human rights are devisible; something that we should urge for people in the Soviet Union-a view which we share-but that we should do nothing about human rights where our economic or strategic interests may be affected, a view which we reject totally. The uselessness of this Bill and the extraordinary width of Australia's reservations to the Covenant make Australia's position on international human rights much weaker than it should be. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I wish to refer to paragraph (g) of the Opposition's amendment. We remain concerned at the whittling away of the powers and the status of the Commissioner for Community Relations. The Commissioner will lose his power to report directly to Parliament, and he will lose a great deal of the resources which have made the office under Mr Grassby so successful for the last five years. Whilst the Government's amendment to the Racial Discrimination Act is technical, its defeat would mean that the 1979 Act would not come into operation, and we will oppose outright the Racial Discrimination Amendment Bill 1981. Over the years the Opposition has made its position clear. The Government is not concerned about human rights, either in Australia or elsewhere. Posturing at international forums is about as far as it ever gets. Knowing as we do that some Government back benchers would support our amendment if they were free to do so, we can simply urge the acceptance of our amendment, well knowing that it could be defeated and that this tame Commission will come into operation. As Australians, we all regret that this country has not been able to do a great deal better on human rights. Accordingly, I move:</PARA>
<PARA> That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'the Bill be withdrawn and re-drafted to provide for-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) its application to the laws and practices of the States and the Northern Territory;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the full application, without the reservations and declarations embodied in Australia's ratification, of the rights contained in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the specific adoption in judicially enforceable form (along the lines of the Human Rights Bill 1973) of the rights contained in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) the extension of the Commission's jurisdiction to enable it to investigate and report upon possible breaches of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (which includes guarantees of the rights to form and join trade unions, social security, and adequate standards of living, work, physical and mental health, education and to take part in cultural life);</PARA>
<PARA> (e) the extension of the Commission's jurisdiction to enable it to enforce the rights contained in the U.N. Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women;</PARA>
<PARA> (f) the expansion of the powers and functions of the Commission to give it a more effective enforcement role, especially in relation to civil and political rights, and</PARA>
<PARA> (g) in relation to racial discrimination matters, the retention of the independent status and functions, and especially the power to report directly to Parliament of the Commissioner for Community Relations.'</PARA>

Principle 10 of the Declaration of the Rights of the Child as proclaimed by the United Nations on 20 November 1959, which document it is proposed be incorporated in Australia's Human Rights Commission Bill, declares:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The child shall be protected from practices which may foster racial, religious and any other form of discrimination. He shall be brought up in a spirit of understanding, tolerance, friendship amongst peoples, peace and universal brotherhood, and in full consciousness that his energy and talents should be devoted to the service of his fellow men. </PARA>
<PARA>If the sentiments expressed in this passage were achieved, we would hear the sigh of relief rising across the world, because our major problems would be resolved. If they were achieved and applied, firstly, to the deliberations in this chamber and thence to those in every boardroom, union, factory, school, home and institution in Australia, social injustice would be resolved in this country and one would hear a shout of glee from our pensioners. We in this chamber would be voting in unison to lift the burden of the disadvantaged in our nation. Rather than there being opposition to the constructive amendments being put forward by the Opposition I hoped that there would be consideration of the facts put forward by Government members and that we would vote to pass these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a sobering thought that we in this chamber should have the task and responsibility of weighing up and choosing those basic rights which we believe every Australian citizen should possess. Having made this choice it is necessary to strengthen it with legislation as strong as that which strengthens the ideological direction 'thou shalt not kill'. But this is not the case with the legislation under review. That is one of the sound reasons why the Opposition is putting forward amendments to rectify the omission. I repeat that I hope that Government members who really believe in the basic rights of man, woman and child, will support these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> To date this debate on human rights in this country has generated a lot of noise, a lot of hot air. I am concerned that this will be as far as the Government's commitment to ensuring real rights for humans in need of protection will go. The only noise created by the Human Rights Commission will be the gnashing of gums of a toothless paper tiger. Australia must not use this legislation merely to demonstrate its bona fide in the brotherhood of nations or its justification in claiming to be a soul brother to the black African nations. The Commission must not become a sop to the international pretensions of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), something for him to tuck under one arm as he strides the world stage of international affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not necessarily subscribe to the edict that charity begins at home if home means one's own parish only. We are part of a global village and should accept a broad responsibility for the welfare of our fellow man. Surely the achievement of human rights should begin at home. How can we offer to cure the ills of other societies when we have shown that we cannot cure our own. We appear to have an ingrained parochial notion that human rights are those rights which other nations infringe. Nothing could be further from the truth. Australia, and particularly Queensland, is blazed with a trail of instances where people without status or power in our community are denied their fundamental rights. This legislation, as far as it goes, aims to rectify this undesirable situation in two ways: Firstly, by widening the terms of reference of the Human Rights Commission as provided in the Human Rights Commission Bill 1979 and, secondly, by extending the so-called jurisdiction of the Commission to possible infringements of those rights proclaimed through recent United Nations declarations-the declarations on the rights of the child, the rights of the mentally retarded and the rights of the disabled. </PARA>
<PARA> The wider application of the legislation serves to explain and highlight the wider implications of human rights as being more than a report in the overseas news section of the morning newspaper. Let us take as an example the implication regarding the rights of the unborn child. Recognition of prenatal injuries or accidents gives to the human who has been injured or affected by accident the right to sue. If Labor's amendments are adopted and the Commission is given power, inclusion of the rights of the child will enable the Federal Government to investigate through the Commission the operation of State laws relating to children and minors. There are aspects of Queensland's child welfare system which frankly are appalling. The rights of minors is an area of authority in which State governments have been traditionally unchallenged to the detriment of minors. In 1979, 4,000 minors came before the Children's Court in Queensland. Estimates suggest that seven or eight out of every ten were not legally represented. </PARA>
<PARA> Some provisions of the Children's Services Act in Queensland are brutal and archaic. I know of young girls aged 12, 13 or 14 in my electorate of Lilley who have been forced from the family home through brutalisation at home. Such girls are picked up by the police and institutionalised because they are in moral danger. They are housed with convicted felons. That is a shocking situation. The fact that it should be allowed to exist is an indictment of our society. Juvenile justice in Queensland ought to be high on the Commission's agenda for investigation. I place on record my support for the submission made by the Reverend Wally Dethless for the Brisbane Youth Advocacy Centre, the aims of which I would like to have incorporated in Hansard. This ties in with what I am talking about, and the Centre is meeting an existing need. I seek leave to incorporate the document in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. Unfortunately, if the Bill in question is left unamended, recording moral support for such a worthy initiative is just about the limit of a Federal member's power in this area. Even with the Human Rights Commission and the extension of its charter to include the rights of the child I fear that the Queensland Government's children's services legislation and the implementing authorities will remain untouchable. The United States Federal Government has begun withholding or withdrawing funds from the States where those funds are used to incarcerate young people. It has some power as the overriding authority which gives the money, and it requires certain standards. At the same time it is making more funds available for rehabilitative strategies and programs, which is a much better way of dealing with this situation. If this House passes amendments which give power to the Commission I hope this sort of action will eventuate from the work of the Commission. The Commission is useless without that power. This is the sort of action which I would like to see the Commission recommending to the Federal Government. Why should it not recommend such action? I am afraid that such action would be considered unthinkable by the Federal Government which is bound by the policies of federalism put forward by the Prime Minister and which appears to treat the Queensland Premier as an unchallengable, independent foreign head of state.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I put it to those thinking members on the Government benches-I know that there are some of them-that the Commission can consider but it cannot act. Admittedly, it cannot act and it does not purport to do so. The Commission can consider breaches of rights beyond the traditional civil and political rights but its functions extend very little beyond consideration of human rights violations. In the 1979 legislation the Commission was conceived to ensure compliance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights adopted by the United Nations in 1966 and signed by Australia on 18 December 1972. The signing of that Covenant was one of the first actions of the then Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The establishment of the Commission was one of the obligations Australia accepted as a signatory. The range of rights encompassed by that Covenant includes the inherent rights to life-sadly that has become a slogan rather than a statement of principle-freedom from cruel and degrading treatment, freedom from arbitrary arrest and detention, freedom of thought, the presumption of innocence, the right to trial within a reasonable time, the liberty of movement, the freedoms of conscience, religion, expression and peaceful assembly. One additional covenant which should be considered for inclusion within the scope of the Commission is the 1966 International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights which was signed by Australia at the same time as the Covenant to which I referred previously. </PARA>
<PARA> Another obvious extension of the field of human rights would be the inclusion of the 1979 United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. Who on the Government benches is prepared to deny that women face disadvantages and discrimination in gaining access to housing, credit, employment, training, education and legal representation, and in the taxation and social security systems? It seems the height of hypocrisy and inconsistency to sign a declaration outlawing all forms of discrimination against women and then do absolutely nothing to enforce or back up that commitment. To call such an exercise window dressing is an understatement. It can be nothing more than base political expediency. I note with pleasure that Senator Susan Ryan will be moving to rectify the situation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has put the view that the legislation, by widening the areas of concern through the inclusion of some United Nations covenants not previously included in the 1979 legislation, is merely extending the Commission's inadequacy and inefficacy to new areas of human rights. Instead of being useless in two categories of human rights as already tabled, it will now be useless in four categories. That is this Government's version of progress. It is virtually pointless to extend the Commission's scope as this legislation would do, or to call, as the Opposition has done, for even greater extension if the Commission does not have the authority, the executive power and the statutory muscle to support its jurisdiction. This Commission is charged with monitoring, investigation and reporting on some but not all human rights violations. </PARA>
<PARA> One does not need glasses to see the holes in this legislation. The Bill's provisions are not judicially enforceable. As the Women's Electoral Lobby has observed, the Bill has so many exclusions to the obtaining of information by subpoena that it is almost impossible to make a case to put before a court. Alternatively, cases which are brought before a court can be dismissed on the basis that they would somehow be against the public interest. Defendants or witnesses in such cases can refuse to testify on the grounds of self-incrimination. The greatest inadequacy of the Commission is that its limited powers do not extend to the jurisdiction of State and Northern Territory governments. I speak as a Queenslander. In my maiden question in this Parliament, which was on human rights in Queensland, specifically the treatment of Aborigines in that State, which is shocking, I sought to draw the Prime Minister's attention to his greatest constitutional weapon in enforcing human rights observance on the States-the external affairs power. The Prime Minister rejected my suggestion. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA> In the view of this Government it--</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the foreign affairs power-</PARA>
<PARA>would be a wrong way to achieve a desirable objective. </PARA>
<PARA>Is the elimination of what I referred to in my question as 'the infringements of human rights and maltreatment of minorities in Queensland' not a desirable objective? I say that it is not only a desirable objective; two imminent events make it an immediate objective. If it is not achievable by the foreign affairs power, even greater attention should be given to the Australian Labor Party's amendments which are under discussion now. The events I refer to are the Commonwealth Games which are to be held in Brisbane and the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. The Prime Minister runs the risk of having the termites from Queensland undermining his international platforms. With the spotlight on Australia and on his own back yard, the Prime Minister may feel a little less self-righteous in championing the cause of human rights and may feel a little more disposed to using the only real and effective means he has at his disposal to achieve that desirable objective. Implicit in the Prime Minister's reply was the fact that the foreign affairs power does exist and could be used. The only question mark hangs over whether it should be used. We on this side have no hesitation in saying that it must be used. </PARA>
<PARA> As a Queenslander, I would note that the Premier of my State has the same attitude to the issue of civil and human rights as he does to income tax. He prefers to flatten it and, if he cannot do that, then avoid it. His Government's suppression of civil and political rights is already well documented. It is a catalogue of incredible political and personal abuse of human rights violations and infringements of civil liberties which has earned for the Queensland Government the odious distinction of being included in a list which was compiled by the United States Department of State of governments accused of such violations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to address myself to two aspects of the Human Rights Commission Bill. The purpose of this Bill is to establish, as we all know, a Human Rights Commission. This Commission would promote the observance of human rights throughout Australia and immediately within the limits of Commonwealth law. It is contemplated, I hope, that in co-operation with the States regarding human rights matters, the Commission will assist the Government in carrying out Australia's international responsibilities in the cause of human rights. This obligation was undertaken by Australia as a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. I am glad that the Bill seems likely, finally, to pass in to law. It has had a difficult and much delayed course in this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I have said, there are two matters which I wish to discuss. The first is that the Commission will, at least initially, be limited in its operation to the laws of the Commonwealth and its Territories. It is true that clause 11 of the Bill provides for arrangements to be made between the Federal Government, and the State governments and the Government of the Northern Territory. Pursuant to that clause the Attorney-General may make arrangements for the performance on a joint basis of functions relating to the promotion of the observance of human rights in a State or a Territory. He may arrange for the performance by a State or a Territory or by an authority of a State or Territory on behalf of the Commonwealth of functions relating to the promotion of the observance of human rights. That includes the functions of the Human Rights Commission itself. Further, that clause permits, by agreement, the performance by the Commission of functions on behalf of a State or a Territory relating to the promotion of the observance of human rights. There can be no argument that the kind of arrangements proposed in clause 11 would enable the laws of a State or a Territory to be subject to the provisions of the Bill and the attentions of the Human Rights Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> The Attorney-General (Senator Durack) has said that clause 11 provides for a range of co-operative arrangements to be entered into with the States and that it is his expectation that this mechanism will be fully used. I certainly hope so. On a previous occasion when I spoke in this place I argued, in a different area of law, for a reference of State powers to the Commonwealth. I would not like it to be thought that I am seeking a wholesale takeover of State responsibilities by the Commonwealth. That is simply not so. On the prior occasion I was simply talking about the area of family law, which in my view ought to come under one law covering the whole Commonwealth. Here I concede and readily accept that what we are talking about in regard to State laws is a whole variety of laws which, in my view, quite rightly, are the domain of the States. In many of those areas they affect human rights. Clearly the kinds of things which we are contemplating in this Human Rights Bill ought to apply to State law as they will do to Federal law. </PARA>
<PARA> I would greatly prefer that the arrangements proposed in clause 11 be used and work successfully. I would much prefer that we work as a federal body and not intrude into areas which the States ought to be managing. It must be acknowledged, as has been mentioned earlier in this debate, that in some areas of State activity the human rights record is scarcely one which is commendable. The record of the States, put at its gentlest, can be described as an uneven one. I hope the States realise that if they wish federalism to work, as I am sure all of us on our side of the House, and I hope all of us do, they must play their part. Where opportunities are there for co-operation they ought to co-operate. </PARA>
<PARA> The provisions in clause 11 do not in any way impugn State sovereignty. If the States co-operate pursuant to that provision they will have their own means of ensuring that their laws comply with the Human Rights Commission Bill. The Attorney has said that ministerial meetings on human rights will continue to exercise a role at a top policy level in considering these issues. He believes continuing consultation between the various levels of government will promote generally the cause of human rights in Australia. As I have said, I hope that he is right. I urge him to take every opportunity to encourage the use of the procedures provided in the Bill. As I have said, I hope that the State governments appreciate that if they do not contribute as they ought one day one government in the federal sphere may seek to intrude where the States would not wish it to. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter I wish to raise relates to the inclusion in the schedules to the present Bill of three Declarations. Schedules 2, 3 and 4 contain the Declaration of the Rights of the Child, 1959; the Declaration on the Rights of the Mentally Retarded, 1971; and the Declaration on the Rights of the Disabled, 1975. When a similar Bill was last before the Parliament its passage was stalled because of the differences of view concerning what was described as the Simon amendment. The Bill in its present form has been defused very largely by including the Declaration of the Rights of the Child in Schedule 2. The third paragraph in the preamble to the Declaration recites:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the child, by reason of his physical and mental immaturity, needs special safeguards and care, including appropriate legal protection, before as well as after birth . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Declaration of the Rights of the Child calls for men and women everywhere, in voluntary organisations and in governments, to strive for the observance of the rights of the child which it proclaims. Each of the three declarations does not involve the same kind of commitment in international law as does the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. It is intended that the Human Rights Commission will monitor and report on the way in which the Commonwealth departments and agencies conform to them. It can be only for the best that the different views expressed in the previous debate have now been able to be resolved with the inclusion of these three declarations. This is not the kind of measure that we would wish to have passed in an atmosphere of bitterness, as I think the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) described the prior debate. To succeed, the Commission needs to have the widest possible support throughout the community. </PARA>
<PARA> The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has moved an amendment which commences with the request that the Bill be withdrawn and redrafted to provide for various measures. I do not wish to discuss the substance of those proposed matters for redrafting. It seems to me that if we do that we will be back where we started and the Bill may never be successfully passed. To withdraw and redraft now would impose further delay. Whenever the Bill next comes before the Parliament-of course, it would have to go back through the two Houses-would be the opportunity to reopen matters which have previously been debated. We cannot be sure what the course of this legislation would then be. The amendment indeed is not an amendment to the Bill itself. It is an amendment to the motion that the Bill be now read a second time. As I understand it, if the amendment were carried the Bill would certainly not be proceeded with today. In fact, one assumes that it would never proceed. That I think would be the worst possible result. I hope that the Bill can now be passed with the general agreement of all, notwithstanding reservations people may have about various facets of it. I hope that the Commission can be brought into operation as soon as possible. I support the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In joining in the debate on the Human Rights Commission Bill I take the opportunity of declaring my disappointment at certain aspects of the Bill which, I believe, indicate considerable deficiencies in the proposed operation of the Human Rights Commission. Australia has been long overdue for a Bill of Rights, but the present Bill is a rather pale imitation of the kind of safeguards of civil liberties which many Australians have been demanding for years. It is questionable whether the proposed Human Rights Commission is better than nothing at all. One thing is certain, however, and that is that there are serious omissions which I would now like to draw to the attention of honourable members.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In referring to the provisions of the Bill I will not be using the precise language of the Bill. I believe honourable members will not find any difficulty in following the points I wish to make. I turn to sub-clause (4) of clause 10 which gives the Commission the power to decide not to hold an inquiry as a result of a complaint if, amongst other things:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the complaint is frivolous or vexatious or is not made in good faith;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the subject-matter of the complaint is trivial;</PARA>
<PARA>Note the words 'frivolous', 'vexatious' and 'trivial' and the phrase 'not made in good faith'. These terms are highly subjective. In effect, they mean that the Commission could decide not to hold an inquiry for a variety of political reasons. How many street marchers and demonstrators have been described by our national newspapers as frivolous and vexatious people?</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DI4">Mr MILTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. Is it likely that the Commission would consider a complaint of a violation of human rights from such a person as worthy of an inquiry? Likewise the word 'frivolous' can be applied quite differently depending upon the political or philosophical view of a commissioner. At the very least there should be a right of appeal against a decision of the Commission not to hold an inquiry on the grounds contained in paragraphs (a) and (b) of sub-clause (4) of clause 10. Again, in sub-clause (5) of clause 10 the Commission has the power not to hold an inquiry if 12 months has elapsed since the act complained of occurred. This time limit appears unreasonably restrictive. One could envisage many possible cases of a violation of human rights when it may take a considerable time before sufficient evidence could be accumulated which would convince the commissioners that the complaint was genuine. The time limit should be extended to at least two years. There should also be a right of appeal against the decision of the commissioners.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another provision of the Bill which contains considerable deficiencies is sub-clause (2) of clause 15 by which it is possible to prevent the disclosure of evidence relevant to a human rights violation by certification from the Attorney-General that this disclosure would be contrary to the public interest. Here we have another of these vague, indeterminate terms-'contrary to the public interest'. What is the public interest? Let us take the example of the Vietnam war. The then Liberal Party-led Federal Government considered that any protest against the war was contrary to the public interest. Had this Bill been in operation at that time, any person whose human rights had been violated because of his protest against such a war would have been unable to obtain evidence to support his complaint. Yet we all know that Australia's participation in the Vietnam war was a crime against the Vietnamese people. What is contrary to the public interest is a subjective judgment which depends upon the political complexion of the government in power at the time of the alleged human rights violation. The invoking of sub-clause (2) could mean that a multitude of human rights violations could not be proceeded against because the complainant was unable to obtain essential information. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DI4">Mr MILTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member is right; it would be worse. It is true that it is not the Attorney-General but the Chairman of the Commission who is to decide whether the disclosure of the information would be contrary to the public interest, but does anyone believe that the Chairman would oppose the view of the Attorney-General? The precedents provided by the actions of the chairmen of other such statutory bodies do not give me any confidence that the Chairman of this Commission would take an independent view on such a matter. In its practical effect, the provisions of clause 15 (2) would make the gathering of information almost impossible-in circumstances in which human rights violations could be legion. Another serious flaw in clause 15 is contained in sub-clause (8), which declares:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> . . . that it is a reasonable excuse for a person to refuse to furnish information or produce a document . . . or to refuse to answer a question . . . when giving evidence under this section that the information, the production of the document or the answer to the question might tend to incriminate him. </PARA>
<PARA>That is, I might add, a sexist phrase. I would have hoped that our legislators might have come to terms with that matter. Why is a guilty party given such an option? The violation of human rights is a serious matter and no guilty person should be permitted to take this easy way of evading his or her responsibility. Surely it would have been possible to include a sub-clause which would have effectively ensured that the incriminating evidence would not be used against such a person. When the effect of this sub-clause is added to that of sub-clause (2), and so many potential violators can use those escape clauses to avoid the publication of their activities, one wonders whether the Government is really serious in its avowed intention of promoting the observance of human rights. </PARA>
<PARA> Another grave deficiency is the lack of publicity which will be given by the Commission to human rights violations. Clause 16 specifies that where, after inquiry, the Commission finds that an act or practice is inconsistent with or contrary to any human rights, it shall report to the appropriate Minister accordingly. Publicity is not required and no sanctions are specified, so non-government offenders could completely ignore the findings. It is true that in due course, the Minister would table the report in Parliament, but the progress of a report through the parliamentary procedures can be long and tedious. It would not be difficult to conceive an item's being delayed or even perhaps overlooked. My point is that the Commission should have the power to make public in a far more effective way, perhaps by official Press release, any transgression of human rights. These public announcements could be made immediately the Commission had concluded its inquiry and need not be subject to the delay and undue formality that are associated with publishing a report.</PARA>
<PARA> I consider that another important deficiency in the Bill is that there is no right of appeal against the findings of the commissioners which arise from their inquiry. I believe that the adoption of a Bill on human rights in Australia has been long overdue, but it gives me cause for great regret that the Government has abdicated its responsibilities by producing such a weak and ineffective body as the proposed Human Rights Commission. Of course, I accept that in practical terms there can be no such thing as a value-free or neutral interpretation of human rights. Frequently, debates on human rights in Australia ignore the economic, cultural and social processes which result in millions of Australian workers and their families suffering unemployment, poverty and cultural deprivation. Such people suffer the deprivation of their human rights just as surely as if they were physically restrained or maltreated. In particular, the human rights of the Aboriginal people of Australia are being violated every day, in the States of Western Australia and Queensland especially. </PARA>
<PARA> Another aspect of human rights which is often neglected is the right of workers in their work place. At present few employers are willing to grant their employees the right to participate in the decision-making processes in relation to their work, yet in many countries this elementary human right is well recognised and is operating as a part of normal industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have mentioned these few matters it must be clear to honourable members that I am less than enthusiastic about the provisions of the Bill. I realise that they have been before the House on a previous occasion. I can only express my disappointment that the Government, in resubmitting the Bill, has not seen fit to remedy the serious deficiencies that I have outlined. I support the amendment that has been moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen). </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -The Human Rights Commission Bill is a very significant piece of legislation. As is well known to honourable members, it has been before the House on a previous occasion. In my submission, it cannot be denied that the present Bill is a far more desirable piece of legislation than that which was previously before us. That is so for a number of reasons, one of which is that it now includes in its schedules a covenant, the full title of which is the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and three very significant declarations. The first, which is contained in Schedule 2, is the Declaration of the Rights of the Child, one of whose preambles includes the statement:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whereas the child, by reason of his physical and mental immaturity, needs special safeguards and care, including appropriate legal protection, before as well as after birth. </PARA>
<PARA>It is appropriate that the House should have before it a piece of legislation which recognises that fact and recognises it as a proposition which is contained in the Declaration of the Rights of the Child. Too often, I suspect, we overlook in legislation the rights of those who, for whatever reason, cannot speak for themselves. The paragraph which I have read refers to one such reason. We are concerned with children before as well as after they are born. I support the manner in which the Government has approached this issue-by including in a schedule the Declaration of the Rights of the Child, to which the Human Rights Commision of course will have regard in its deliberations. So it is appropriate in every respect that we have on the record now, as one of the matters to which the Human Rights Commission will have regard, recognition of the fact that one important group of people to whom attention should be given when we are considering human rights is unborn children. I compliment the Government upon approaching the issue in this manner. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill establishes a Human Rights Commission. One of its functions, as set out in clause 9 (1) (f), is 'to promote an understanding and acceptance, and the public discussion, of human rights in Australia and the external Territories'. I presume that means, amongst other things, that the Commission will encourage discussion in Australia of issues of human rights. It is on one of those subjects that I wish to address some remarks to the House tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> Debate on the Bill is, in general terms, important for a number of reasons. The first is that it provides an opportunity to express our concern for human rights and their preservation; secondly, it enables us to consider the human rights issues involved when we set up machinery to examine breaches of human rights, as we are doing now by means of this Bill; and, thirdly, the legislation reminds us, because of the international treaties that in effect we are implementing by means of this legislation, that human rights is an international issue. I have already drawn the attention of the House to the fact that one of the functions of the Commission is to promote an understanding and acceptance, and the public discussion, of human rights in Australia and the external Territories. It is in that area that I wish to make some remarks. The basis of those remarks is a motion of which notice was given by the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton) on 4 December 1980. That motion relates to the denial of human rights of the Baha'i people in Iran. The motion of which the honourable member for Mackellar gave notice reads:</PARA>
<PARA> That this House-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) expresses its grave concern over the persecution of the 200,000 adherents of the Baha'i faith in Iran by the regime of the Ayatollah Khomeini, and notes with alarm the recent execution of a member of the Baha'i faith in Tabriz solely on the grounds of his religion;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) calls upon the Government of Iran to release from custody those Baha'is, including 9 members of the National Spiritual Assembly of Baha'is of Iran, who have been unjustly detained, and to restore the holy places, properties, community centres and companies that have been confiscated;</PARA>
<PARA> (3) commends the Australian Government for its assistance to Australian Baha'is in expressing their protest to the Iranian Government, and</PARA>
<PARA> (4) requests the Australian Government to lend its support to moves in international forums designed to restore to the Iranian Baha'is their freedom to live their lives in peace and practice their religion in harmony with their fellow citizens of other faiths. </PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member for Mackellar also spoke on that issue in the adjournment debate on an earlier occasion. I give him credit for raising the issue by that means. Part of the motion commends the Australian Government for its assistance to Australian Baha'is in expressing their protest to the Iranian Government against this particular and fundamental denial of human rights. It is therefore appropriate to consider this issue further in the debate on this legislation. It is also appropriate to do so because, as I have already said, one of the functions of the Commission will be to promote an understanding and acceptance, and the public discussion, of human rights in Australia and the external Territories. </PARA>
<PARA> The substance of the matter can be compressed into a number of short points. I hope that I can put them on the record in a few moments. The situation is that, in the first place, the 300,000 to 400,000 members of the Baha'i religion in Iran have been harassed in the exercise of their religion; secondly, their centres have been raided and documents, including their membership lists, have been seized; thirdly, their spiritual meetings and religious classes have been broken up and their teachers have been arrested; and, fourthly, their trading company has been confiscated and its employees interrogated. Their buildings and land which have been used solely for religious purposes have been taken over by the Government and their national headquarters, cemeteries and hospital have been confiscated. Fifthly, some of the members have been dismissed from government service in Iran because of religious beliefs and for no other reason whatsoever; and, sixthly, one of the Ayatollahs has said that Baha'is are people whom Moslems may annihilate without fear of punishment. They have been branded as apostates and abused, and their religion has been denied as a legitimate religion. Seventhly-this is far worse than all that-they have been persecuted and beaten and their leaders have been arrested. Indeed, some adherents of this faith have been executed. </PARA>
<PARA> These are violations of the most fundamental human rights that we could possibly articulate. They deserve to be condemned in the strongest terms. In particular, they are violations of Article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which was signed by Iran, amongst other countries. These violations are also contrary to Article 27 of the Covenant, which is set out in a schedule to the very Bill that we are debating tonight. Article 27 reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> In those States in which ethnic, religious or linguistic minorities exist, persons belonging to such minorities shall not be denied the right, in community with the other members of their group, to enjoy their own culture, to profess and practise their own religion, or to use their own language. </PARA>
<PARA>The first two paragraphs of Article 18 state:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Everyone shall have the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. This right shall include freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice, and freedom, either individually or in community with others and in public or private to manifest his religion or belief in worship, observance, practice and teaching. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. No one shall be subject to coercion which would impair his freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice. </PARA>
<PARA>It is appropriate that we should have it very firmly in our minds that the Covenant contains those declarations of very basic human rights. I hope that when the Commission is established it has regard to those rights and to breaches which occur, even if they occur outside Australia; so long as that can help to illustrate in accordance with the Commission's functions the fact that basic human rights exist, that on occasions those human rights are broken and that when they are broken those breaches should be condemned. We can conclude from all of this that, first of all, the adherents of the Baha'i faith are being persecuted in breach of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which is annexed to this Bill, and in breach of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We can conclude secondly that their religion and its survival in Iran are at risk. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank you for your indulgence in enabling me to make those points which may not, on immediate consideration, be relevant to the precise clauses of the legislation but I know that the views I have expressed are the views also of many, if not all, members of the Opposition in this Parliament who would, like honourable members on this side of the Parliament, wish to record their condemnation of the denial of basic human rights. Without taking up more of the time of the House, I wish to incorporate in Hansard-I think permission has been given in advance by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen)-some declarations which are similar to the views I have expressed. That will avoid the necessity of my speaking longer. Nevertheless it will put on the record the views of both this Parliament and a number of international bodies about these very grievous breaches of human rights to which I have been referring. The first document is a resolution of the European Parliament passed on 19 September 1980. The second is a written declaration, being No. 88 of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, dated 29 September 1980. The third is a motion passed by the House of Commons of Canada on 16 July 1980. The fourth is a declaration on the state of religious minorities in Iran made by the Federation of Protestant Churches in Switzerland, Human Rights Commission, on 12 September 1979. I ask leave to incorporate those documents in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>

<PARA>DECLARATION ON THE STATE OF RELIGIOUS MINORITIES IN IRAN</PARA>
<PARA> In agreement with the executive committee of the federation of protestant Churches in Switzerland, its human rights commission publishes the enclosed document on the state of the Baha'is in Iran. </PARA>
<PARA> At the beginning of July all federal parliamentarian groups appealed to the Iranian authorities to grant freedom of conscience (in german it means religious freedom K.S.) to the Baha'is in Iran. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, the human rights commission of the federation of protestant Churches in Switzerland received this documentation on the situation of the Baha'is in Iran, with the request to publish it once notified. </PARA>
<PARA> End of August we were notified to proceed. Meanwhile the Iranian government has taken further actions against the Baha'is. Thus, at the registration, children who declare their membership in this religious community are not admitted to school. Further, 37 national Baha'i leaders have been put on the list of those who may not leave Iran. At present their sanctuaries which are of international importance, are profaned and destroyed. </PARA>
<PARA> The 300,000 Christians, who mostly belong to ethnical minorities are, it seems, subjected to less important oppressions. Nevertheless their hospitals have been confiscated, correspondence courses had to be stopped and libraries were closed. The Iranian members of the episcopal-Church have been affected most. </PARA>
<PARA> We are aware that here it is not only a question of the rights of Baha'is or Christians, but of the religious freedom of minorities and the respect of the dignity of all the peoples living in Iran in general. Terrified by the persecution of the Kurds, we are publishing this document today in the hope that those personalities invested with the task of elaboration a new constitution for Iran would pay special attention to the protection of minorities and would grant religious freedom. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Human Rights Commission Bill 1981 now before this House contains essentially the same unsatisfactory elements as the original 1979 Bill. The major objections now are as they were then and I will just outline them briefly. They are, firstly, the failure of the Bill to apply to the States; secondly, the failure to create judicially enforceable rights of any kind; thirdly, the failure to give the proposed Human Rights Commission any effective power; and fourthly, the absorption of the Office of the Commissioner for Community Relations into this Commission, thus downgrading the status and independence of the Office of Community Relations. The Opposition has proposed amendments to rectify these deficiencies in the legislation. I hope that the Government will give these very serious consideration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A further aspect of the 1981 Bill also deserves some attention. In extending the provisions of the Bill in relation to children, the mentally retarded and the disabled, we are moving into an area of social, economic and cultural rights. These are indisputably human rights too, but they require the provision of services and resources to achieve their ends, rather than merely judicial decisions and judgments as in the case of civil and political rights. It would be preferable to include all the areas under the umbrella of social, economic and cultural rights rather than just these three examples and consider giving the Commission jurisdiction to enable it to investigate and report on possible breaches of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, as outlined in the Opposition's amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> There are several glaring omissions in this respect are provisions for Aboriginals, migrants and women, as well as many others. In particular the Bill does not extend the jurisdiction of the Human Rights Commission to the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women signed by Australia in July 1980. There should be no need for me to explain the great improvements that are needed for improving the status of women in this country. All we have to do is look around this House to see a glaring example of the inequalities of women in our society. We have only three female members in this House, all from the Opposition, and there have only ever been six women members of the House of Representatives. That is appalling discrimination. But more importantly, women in Australia continue to be discriminated against in terms of educational and employment opportunities. Eight years after an Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission decision giving equal pay for men and women, there is still an average 48 per cent gap in pay rates. Average weekly earnings for women are $142 compared with $227 for men. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course it is not only in terms of remuneration that women in the work force suffer discrimination. Women have traditionally been confined by their training and by their social expectations, to the lower status, lower-paid sales, clerical, factory and service occupations. An Australian Council of Trade Union working women's survey which was recently undertaken illustrated that even in the most traditional female occupation, that is housekeeping, women were paid an average of $173.80 compared with male housekeepers, who received an average of $286.30. As well as menial, low-paid work, sexual harassment and poor conditions further disadvantaged the female work force. When we examine the professional, higher-paid, higher status occupations we find them largely monopolised by men. Many studies have shown that it is not enough for a woman to be equal in competence to men, but that the woman has to be markedly superior in competence to do a particular job in order to overcome the negative and entrenched social attitudes which cause so much of the discrimination suffered by women. </PARA>
<PARA> These same negative attitudes contribute to enormous discrimination against women in many other areas as well as the work force. In access to housing, credit, financial services and legal services women must battle strongly to be treated as persons and to be treated with dignity and respect. Australia has paid lip service to the concept of human rights for some considerable time and has not sought actively to promote the rights of women. Although some States have recently introduced encouraging anti-discrimination legislation, I note that the Federal Government has still failed to introduce such legislation, its own employees and residents of the Australian Capital Territory have no protection under anti-discrimination legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to rights for women and other disadvantaged groups, Australia has committed itself to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Article 2 of this Declaration states:</PARA>
<PARA> Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status. </PARA>
<PARA>We might also look at Article 7, which states:</PARA>
<PARA>All are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to equal protection of the law. </PARA>
<PARA>We compare these words with the realities facing women in Australia who need legal assistance or protection. For example, we might consider the plight of those who cannot meet the means test requirement for legal aid, or the plight of women in refuges, or the plight of those affected by inequitable family law property settlements. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has also ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which extends the provisions of the Universal Declaration, and we have signed the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, although this has not yet been ratified. It is time that this rhetoric was translated into action. The Federal Government should take the lead in this matter and not just leave it to the States. We need a uniform, coherent policy and commitment to the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government has constitutional powers on its side as well as a strong moral obligation to provide effective legislation in these matters. The Commonwealth, as the largest employer in this country, could set a standard for all employers in ensuring that equality of opportunity exists for women in the Public Service. The current situation, as outlined in the 1980 Statistical Year Book of the Public Service Board, points out some of the discrimination in this area. There are no female First Division officers and only 27 out of 1,319 Second Division officers are females. This is totally unacceptable. This inequitable situation clearly indicates that the Federal Government should put its own house in order if it wishes to claim that it supports the various human rights conventions outlined earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleague, Senator Ryan, in another place has drawn attention to the powers of the Commonwealth Government to outlaw discrimination in finance and banking. These are indeed crucial areas as many women have experienced the humiliating and degrading form of discrimination practised by lending institutions and have had to give up their attempts to provide a home for themselves and their families. The Bill before this House does not provide effective legislation for the establishment and promotion of human rights in Australia. It is poorly conceived and lacks any real power to achieve reform. The Women's Electoral Lobby, a group well known over the past 10 years for its work in promoting improvements in the status of women, has expressed strong reservations about this Bill and has argued for its rejection. I will quote from its recent statements on this matter. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill as drafted confers no further rights on women, Aborigines, other disadvantaged groups, or anyone at all. A commission set up under the proposed legislation would be ineffective, inconsequential and would have no teeth. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill has so many exclusions that to the obtaining of information by subpoena that it is almost impossible to make a case . . . </PARA>
<PARA> There are no real sanctions in the Bill-the commissioner can write a letter to the culprit or take a report in some future parliamentary session. The Bill does not provide the right of appeal to the judiciary. </PARA>
<PARA>The inescapable conclusion of all this is, as WEL says:</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill is window dressing by the Australian Government to fool other nations into believing that Australia is carrying out its obligations under the United Nations Convention on Human Rights. </PARA>
<PARA>The issue of human rights is of great significance to us all as members of Australian society and deserved to be treated seriously and conscientiously, instead of in this cavalier fashion. I would urge all honourable members to consider the amendment moved by the Opposition and consult their conscience carefully before casting their vote on this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;May I first of all thank my colleague the honourable member for Diamond Valley (Mr N. A. Brown) for his kind support for my efforts to draw the attention of the House and the Australian people to the plight of the Baha'i community in Iran. I draw the attention of honourable members to my notice of motion No. 25 under General Business and hope that other honourable members will approach the Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair) to see whether this matter can be brought before this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Tonight I would like to address my remarks to the amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) to the Human Rights Commission Bill. The amendment contains a number of parts. The main objections put forward by the Opposition, which are reflected in this amendment, are that the Bill relates only to the Commonwealth jurisdiction and does not seek to override State legislation by using the power of foreign affairs under the Constitution. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has made quite clear why the Commonwealth does not wish to use that power. I regard this power as a somewhat artificial device. I believe it leads to a continuing warfare with the State governments which is very unproductive, and we had examples of this under the Labor Government. It kids people that the job of convincing citizens within each of the States to change attitudes over a period can somehow be neglected and that certain results can be obtained in a very fast fashion merely by passing legislation in this Federal Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly) in her speech used the words 'negative and entrenched social attitudes'. I would certainly endorse her remarks in relation to a number of situations in the Australian community. I would urge all members of the House, particularly members of the Opposition, if they are gravely dissatisfied with the way certain rights are not protected, as they believe, in certain States, to go about convincing the large number of citizens of those States that negative and entrenched social attitudes of the kind of which they disapprove, and of which I think we would all disapprove, ought to be dealt with by working to alter the policies of the governments which have the constitutional responsibility for those matters within those areas. I would certainly support that kind of activity and I believe that is the place for it to be done. If there is not any change in the hearts and minds of the people living in various parts of this Commonwealth, we can pass legislation here until we are black in the face; we can cause enormous disruption between federal and State governments as was done under the Whitlam Government. However, this would be totally counterproductive and would lead to a hardening of those attitudes. Therefore I think it is important to give the kind of lead we are giving in this legislation by setting up the Human Rights Commission and to raise these kinds of issues in a way which will lead progressively to real reform and real changes in those attitudes. In other words, it will be done by coaxing, by illustration, by example, by probing, by public debate, by gradually changing people's minds and not by entering into some kind of war with the States. Therefore I believe paragraph (a) of the amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition regarding the application of these laws to the States and the Northern Territory is ill-advised. </PARA>
<PARA> The second paragraph of the amendment relates to full application, without the reservations and declarations embodied in Australia's ratification of the rights contained in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. This mainly relates to the same issue in that Australia's ratification of that covenant excluded its application to the States, unless the State governments themselves wished to enact their own legislation. Of course, these matters are taken up in the ministerial committee. So that part of the amendment is really much the same as the first part. Paragraph (c) of the amendment relates to the specific adoption in judicially enforceable form, along the lines of the Human Rights Bill 1973, of the rights contained in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. This relates to judicially enforceable powers given to the Commission. I think the Government's view is a sensible one since we are grafting on to a basically English system of civil rights which we already possess. When one looks at the position around the world one realises that Australia's commitment to the United Nations Convention on Human Rights is much more effective than the commitment in most other countries. We are drafting a new instrument on to a system of human rights which has been developed over some hundreds of years and which is generally very effective. Before determining whether any additional judicial enforcement is needed, we would like firstly to see which nooks and crannies require improvement before we bring in sweeping enforceable legislation across the whole range of issues, most of which are already the subject of laws which are enforceable by the courts in the existing system. So at this stage I think it would be unwise to proceed as far as that. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth paragraph of the amendment relates to the extension of the Commission's jurisdiction to enable it to investigate and report upon possible breaches of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which includes guarantees of the right to form and join trade unions; to enjoy social security, adequate standards of living, work, physical and mental health, and education; and to take part in cultural life. Enormous groups of laws, federal and State, cover all those things. We have been enacting laws in the Commonwealth Parliament since 1901 to cover all these things. The State parliaments have done so before that. To bring in an overriding set of further legislation in all those areas seems to me to be absolutely superfluous. </PARA>
<PARA> Paragraph (e) of the amendment relates to the extension of the Commission's jurisdiction to enable it to enforce the rights contained in the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. Whilst I think one might examine this matter more closely I think the remarks made by the honourable member for Canberra about negative and entrenched attitudes, particularly towards women, have a great deal of validity. I think there is an advance within this Bill because Article 3 of Schedule 1 states:</PARA>
<PARA> The States Parties to the present Covenant undertake to ensure the equal right of men and women to the enjoyment of all civil and political rights set forth in the present Covenant. </PARA>
<PARA>Since the Commission as established under this legislation would be required to take that into account with respect to federal legislation it is open to people to ask this Commission to take up those very issues under Commonwealth legislation. For instance, the employment of women by the Commonwealth could be taken up under the Public Service Act. It is up to people to get the Commission to look into those areas and to report to this Parliament on any cases where it believes there should be alterations to the legislation to protect the equal rights of women in the Commonwealth work force. Whilst conceding that in that area a great deal more needs to be done, I believe that contrary to what the honourable member for Canberra has said, there is a specific advance within this legislation enabling women and the Women's Electoral Lobby, in particular, who have drawn objection to it, to be very active within this area, I think to the advantage of women. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already covered paragraph (f) of the amendment relating to the expansion of the powers and functions of the Commission to give it a more effective enforcement role, especially in relation to civil and political rights. Finally, paragraph (g) of the amendment relates to racial discrimination matters and the retention of the independent status and functions, especially the power to report directly to Parliament, of the Commissioner for Community Relations. I think an historical reason exists as to why Opposition members are sensitive on this matter, their having appointed a former Labor Cabinet Minister to that position. The fact that he is in that position has no interest for me in relation to this legislation. It is perfectly sensible to combine that area of activity within the concept of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> In the few remaining minutes left for me to speak I refer to the holier than thou attitude which is adopted by members of the Opposition on legislation of this kind. Anyone would think that Opposition members are paragons of virtue in relation to human rights. Listening to them, one would think that this country is somehow gravely deficient in its responsibilities under the United Nations Convention on Human Rights. That is clearly not so. Australia is one of the outstanding countries in the world, with a developed system of human rights under its legal systems, State and Federal, which provides an extraordinary measure of freedom to the citizen. That does not mean that the system cannot be improved. This relatively modest measure seeks to improve the system in a way which will not damage it but will leave it open for further changes to be made in the future, should they be necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make some remarks about an area of threat to human rights which is totally overlooked by the Opposition. Grave threats to human rights are embodied in the federal platform of the Opposition party. I refer to threats to human rights within the area of industrial relations. No aspect of the life of the Australian community presents a more striking contrast between what the average person regards as fair and reasonable and what actually happens in practice than does the field of industrial relations. Denial of fundamental human freedoms such as freedom of association, practices designed to restrict trade thus reducing choice, and increasing costs and coercion of individuals without legal redress are all commonplace in the area of industrial relations. The ordinary citizen finds it hard to accept that such unjust practices can apparently be allowed to continue without the intrusion of the law when he himself is without doubt subject to the law. Equally, he cannot understand why parliaments, particularly the Federal Parliament, cannot pass legislation and enforce it to prevent these injustices, which occur every day and are reported in the media. They are well known--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DF4">Mr CARLTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The comments from the honourable member for Melbourne Ports attract my attention. I am not suggesting that because incidents are reported in the media they are right. I am suggesting that they are drawn to the attention of the public by the media and that those practices are clearly wrong. It is not only through the media that they become known. They become known through the common experience of people every day. An essential guarantee of freedom for the individual is that all people should be equal under the law. In successive generations a number of powerful groups seeking to exert unreasonable pressures on individual freedom have been circumscribed by legislation passed by parliaments and enforced through the courts. For example, in the course of the twentieth century, the powers of corporations have been subject to a wide range of legislation in such areas as companies and securities, trade practices, wages and conditions, industrial safety and environmental protection. All this legislation has been enforceable in the courts. The legislative restrictions on corporations were reinforced by the emergence of the trade union movement and established as a further countervailing force to the power of corporations and individual employers before the turn of the century and subsequently. It was and still is necessary for workers in some enterprises or industries to come together in trade unions or other forms of association to bargain with employers on an equal basis in order to secure what they regard to be fair returns for their work. Their right to do this is recognised and supported. A complete framework of legislation has been developed in Australia in order to ensure this right.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In recent years trade unions have increased their power relative to other groups in the community. Many trade unions have used this power in ways that individuals and corporations are prevented by law from using. In addition, particularly since 1969, some of them-only a few, but enough to make it very inconvenient for people-have felt free to defy industrial laws under the Federal Conciliation and Arbitration Act and similar State Acts, leading to serious industrial disruption and a serious denial of human rights for workers and consumers. Beyond the use of growing bargaining power within the area of industrial law, unions have also disputed the applicability of the general body of law to their actions. They become virtually exempt from the application of civil actions for damages arising out of disputes, using the threat of further industrial retaliation to prevent action being taken against them. They have also declared that they will resist the application of laws designed to prevent restrictive trade practices, although those laws already apply to corporations. </PARA>
<PARA> I merely point out that whilst we are being lectured by the Opposition, day in and day out, on our alleged lack of concern about human rights, the Opposition, by its very party platform-any honourable member can read it-is suggesting that the legal restraints on the trade union movement in the course of disputes be removed altogether. At the moment the restraints are there. They are almost unenforceable because of the use of power by trade unions. Yet the Opposition is suggesting that they be further weakened or removed. This is an area recognised within Australia as being one of severe denial of individual human rights. Certainly we need the freedom to join a trade union but perhaps we also need the freedom not to join a trade union. We need the freedom to go on strike and, perhaps, the freedom to decline to go on strike. We have to look only at the pressures being exerted on teachers within my electorate at this very moment. A majority of teachers do not wish to take industrial action. Their human rights are being denied in trying to force them to go on strike by using all sorts of social and other pressures against them. I am not prepared to be lectured by the Opposition on the grave failure of Australia to meet its obligations under the United Nations Convention on Human Rights while the Opposition not only condones but also actively defends practices which are occurring within the industrial arena. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I believe that this Bill is a cautious but proper advance in the area of human rights in Australia. It builds on a long tradition of human rights guaranteed already under a substantial system of equality under the law. I think it will raise interesting new issues. The appointment of the commissioners will be important. As an example I refer to the Australian Law Reform Commission and the interesting questions raised by His Honour Mr Justice Kirby and his colleagues. We will see similar interesting issues raised by the Human Rights Commission. If this Parliament is asked by the Commission to examine areas where further legislation is needed, I am sure it will be happy to do so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The arguments advanced by the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton) illustrate the fundamental differences between Government and Opposition members in respect of this legislation. One can judge human rights only by the exercise of legislation relating to human rights in Australia. One can determine the level of racial discrimination and the way in which it operates in our community only by looking at a number of situations which have been developed over a period, largely by the Commissioner for Community Relations. For the last five years this Parliament has had annual reports submitted to it by the Commissioner for Community Relations in which he has pointed out and highlighted not merely denials of human rights but also conscious acts of racial discrimination as they occur within our community. Although the honourable member for Mackellar may wax large and say that by and large Australia is better than most other countries in regard to human rights, and I suppose that if we were to compare Australia with El Salvador that is probably a valid statement-perhaps one should look at the evidence put forward in this House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This House has spent hours with Government members opposite giving notices of motions. We have spent hours debating human rights in the Soviet Union. But I cannot recall a single occasion on which the Government, a Government member or a Minister of the Government has initiated a debate in the Australian Parliament based upon the reports of its Commissioner for Community Relations. These reports are substantive documents. They run into many pages. The most alarming aspect of the reports-and their substance has never been attacked-is that not only is there racial discrimination in Australia but also one of the vehicles for the continuing perpetration of the racism is the administration of State governments. The Commissioner for Community Relations has, with regret and concern but essentially in discharge of his obligations, cited example after example where racial discrimination has not taken place by accident, it has not taken place as a result of a conservative or boorish attitude in some outback community, but has been the positive result of the ongoing administration and the philosophy of the governments of Queensland and Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Has that been a matter of concern to this Government? No, says the honourable member for Mackellar. Let me use his own terms. To an Aboriginal in Queensland or in Western Australia it does not much matter whether one is on the receiving end of Sir Charles Court or Mr Bjelke-Petersen. It does not matter much whether one is a member of the Yungngora community or the Aurukun or Mornington Island community. Cases of racial discrimination have been illustrated and documented time after time. They have been brought to the attention of this House. They have been brought to the attention of the honourable member for Mackellar. But what is his advice to the Australian people? He says: 'With someone like Mr Bjelke-Petersen or Sir Charles Court, it is not a question of the Commonwealth's exercising its constitutional rights. It is not a question of our discharging the mandate which was given to us by the people of Australia in a referendum. It is not even a matter of our honouring the obligations which we undertook as part of the international conventions, which we freely signed'. Oh no. When we are dealing with the political backwoodsmen who represent some of the effective money power that keeps the honourable gentleman opposite in office, to use the terms of the honourable member, what we have to do is to 'engage in public discussion and debate'. We have to coalesce the States into agreeing with our propositions. If the honourable member had read the continuing reports of the Commissioner for Community Relations to the Parliament that gave him the obligation to report instances of discrimination, the honourable member would not simply regard himself as being involved in some kind of awful jest. </PARA>
<PARA> Pages 23 to 31 of the 1980 report of the Commissioner for Community Relations deals in detail with racial discrimination in Queensland. It follows the 1979 report in which the Commissioner referred to documents and official policy statements of the Government of Queensland. The infringement of human rights and exercises in racial discrimination do not always involve breaches of State law. What they often involve are continuing acts of administration, one heaped upon another, which in terms of the rights of the individual citizen at the receiving end of that exercise involve a very considerable abrogation of human rights and freedom. I have no doubt that if the honourable member for Mackellar were driving his car along one of the roads in the more remote areas of Queensland and were stopped by a member of the Queensland police force, he would be treated quite differently from the way in which an Aboriginal driver would be treated. That is not something that I am throwing in a glad-handing exercise. It is demonstrated time and again in the reports which have come before this Parliament, reports which have been ignored by this Government and honourable members opposite. </PARA>
<PARA> What this legislation is designed to do is to go through the exercise of saying to the people of Australia that of course Malcolm Fraser cares about human rights and one can trust Bjelke-Petersen on issues such as the right to march and Aboriginal land rights. We all know that deep in his heart he has really only been misunderstood on these issues, and we should ignore the track record! The problem with this legislation is that whilst it says yes, we will be very serious in our implementation of human rights documents and we will be very concerned to see that our international obligations are honoured, we will be relying upon the very governments, the very Ministers and the very administrations that have been named time after time, day after day, page after page as being in continual infringement of these rights. Now they will be partners. </PARA>

The Government is asking this Parliament to make these State governments equal partners in enforcing international conventions on human rights. This legislation-whatever good might be extracted from it-essentially is a smokescreen designed to dismember the existing Racial Discrimination Act; it is designed to force the present Commissioner for Community Relations out of office; and it is designed to dismember the whole structure of administration which has been created over a period to enable the people of Australia to have reported to them on a continuing basis infringements of human rights and exercies of racial discrimination which have taken place in our community.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen). I wish to say a few words also regarding the inclusion of three declarations in the schedules to the Human Rights Commission Bill. Australia does not have a constitutional Bill of Rights and, until recently, had no guarantee of protection of individual freedoms. This was very eloquently spelt out by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) who preceded me in the debate. Recently, legislation has been passed in the human rights area at both Commonwealth and State levels but that legislation basically concentrates on prohibiting certain actions on specified grounds such as racial discrimination under the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. Under section 51 of the Constitution the Commonwealth can make laws in respect of external affairs for the peace, order and good government of Australia. This power extends to the implementation of an international treaty which imposes obligations on Australia. The general rule is subject to some restrictions so that the treaty is not used just to attract domestic jurisdiction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Human Rights Bill introduced in 1973 by the then Attorney-General, Senator Murphy, relied on those external affairs powers as a means of enacting legislation covering civil rights in Australia. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1966 and entered into force in 1976. Australia signed the Covenant in December 1972. The Human Rights Bill 1973 sought to give parliamentary approval to its ratification by Australia. It is interesting to go through that Covenant and to repeat the rights contained therein. The Covenant covers such rights as the right to life, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly and association, freedom of religion and conscience, freedom of movement, the right to vote and to hold public office, the right to privacy, freedom from arbitrary arrest, the right to a fair trial and the right not to be subjected to cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Human Rights Commission Bill 1981 adopts an approach completely different from that of the 1973 Bill. It does not confer human rights on anybody, it does not override inconsistent State laws, and it does not allow for court proceedings if human rights are infringed. It is based on the Covenant which is set out in Schedule 1 to the Bill and also on the three international declarations which are included in the schedules to the Bill and which concern the rights of the child, the rights of the mentally retarded and the rights of disabled persons. There is provision also for other covenants or declarations to be added. </PARA>
<PARA> The definition of 'human rights' in the Bill is the rights set out in these declarations. However, only human rights under Commonwealth jurisdiction-that is, under Commonwealth law or practices or in territories other than the Northern Territory-are covered. The functions of the Commission are basically to examine Commonwealth laws and proposed laws to see whether they are in conformity with the Covenant. The Commission can examine also the three declarations-that is, the declaration concerning the rights of the child, the mentally retarded and the disabled-and any new covenants or declarations that are declared. It will report on laws that should be made about human rights and on action necessary to comply with the covenant and other instruments. It will inquire into any act or practice that may be inconsistent with human rights. The last function of the Commission involves the examination of acts or practices by the Commonwealth or its authorities based on the Commonwealth law within a territory or partly within a territory. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission's powers, when inquiring into an act or practice, are sufficient to enable it to call for information or papers and to call witnesses. Failure to assist the Commission when directed is a criminal offence even though some evidence may be withheld on a certificate from the Attorney-General. A person about whom a complaint is made must be given an opportunity to make a submission. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some glaring weaknesses in the powers of the Commission. It does not have the power to make orders, not is there an entitlement to go to court if conciliation fails. The Commission is to report to the Minister where it finds that there has been a breach of human rights following an inquiry and where it has not succeeded in conciliating the matter. What can we expect from this Government when that happens? It does not appear that these reports have to be tabled in the Parliament. However, the Commission must make an annual report on its operations which is to be tabled in the Parliament. If a State or the Northern Territory makes an arrangement with the Government the Commission will be able to perform functions on behalf of a State or the Northern Territory, or jointly with the State or Northern Territory authorities. From past performances this would not lead to people having a great deal of confidence in the Commission. Apart from that, the conduct of the States and the Northern Territory will not be at all affected by this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> In August 1980 the Government lodged an instrument of ratification of the Covenant with the United Nations. That Covenant has now come into force in Australia but it was subject to reservations, by far the most important of which was in relation to Article 2 and Article 50 which state that as Australia is a federation it will be for the Commonwealth to implement those matters in relation to which it has power. It will be for the States to implement those matters in relation to which they have power and, where both have the power, the implementation is to be by the constitutionally appropriate authority. The international legality and domestic effect of this reservation is not clear. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the Vienna Convention on Treaties reservations are allowed but they must not expressly prohibit or be incompatible with the object and purpose of the treaty. Article 50 of the Covenant is an attempt to prevent federal states from opting out of their responsibilities. It can be argued that the reservations to Article 2 and Article 50 may be regarded as being prohibited by Article 50. If not, it can be argued that a reservation which leaves responsibility for implementing the great majority of rights to State governments is contrary to the object and purpose of the treaty and, as such, is invalid. If provisions of the Covenant are not implemented it will be the responsibility of this Parliament and not of the States. It has become quite clear that reservations in relation to Article 2 and Article 50 by this Government were for the purpose of satisfying the States and, therefore, the Commonwealth could not in the future use the external affairs power to pass legislation overriding State laws. The argument would be that no obligations had arisen under the Covenant for the Commonwealth to legislate except on matters where it had exclusive powers. Accordingly, no occasion has arisen for the use of the external affairs power. Against this it could be argued that if the reservation is illegal internationally it has no effect and cannot be seen as limiting the obligations placed on the Commonwealth to have the convention implemented for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to comment briefly on the provisions of the Bill and to make a specific reference to the unborn child by means of the inclusion of the United Nations Declaration of the Rights of the Child. That declaration contains a preamble which reads in part:</PARA>
<PARA> Whereas the child, by reason of his physical and mental immaturity needs special safeguards and care, including appropriate legal protection, before as well as after birth. </PARA>
<PARA>Some honourable members could say that as the honourable member for McMillan, I have more than a casual interest in matters relating to this issue. In 1980, in this House, Mr Martyr moved an amendment which was further amended by my predecessor. That amendment was passed by the House of Representatives but was never accepted by the Senate. I am pleased to support the inclusion of the reference to the unborn child. I made it quite plain last year before the election that I intended to support legislation which recognised the rights of the child before birth. I believe in 1981 we are far past unscientific ideas as to when life begins. Today it is an undisputed scientific fact that human life begins at fertilisation. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently I had the privilege of hearing Dr Bernard Natheson speaking at Melbourne University. Dr Natheson, who was in the forefront of the campaign in the United States to get early available abortions in that country, spoke eloquently about certain new data and information which he now specialises in. This new data has convinced Dr Natheson that the life and rights of the child before birth ought to be protected by law. In fact, he goes so far as to say that in the United States it should be done by constitutional amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> Those in Australia who are concerned with human rights should be pleased that for the first time in Federal legislation the child before birth is getting explicit recognition. It should be seen as a first step, a step forward in overcoming the discrimination practised against the unborn. I wish to quote from an article which I read in the Age dated 24 March. The article stated:</PARA>
<PARA> A girl born as doctors were trying to perform an abortion on a woman about eight months' pregnant was ''stabilised and . . . doing fine'', hospital officials in Phoenix, Arizona, said yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA> The woman told doctors she was 19 weeks pregnant. The only examination she received before the operation on Friday failed to reveal how advanced the pregnancy was. </PARA>
<PARA>Those operations are taking place in the United States. With the repeal of the laws which have taken place there it is no wonder there is some need to protect the rights of the unborn. That is the way I see the recognition of the unborn. I would hope that the Commission will take a lead in educating the Australian community in the true status and rights of the unborn child. The Commission is to promote an awareness of human rights and to promote an understanding and an acceptance of those rights. If the Commission exercises its role in relation to the child before birth, it is hoped that we will see a decline in the present figure for abortions, which almost everybody agrees is quite unacceptably high. I look to other measures in the future designed to reduce the loss of human life resulting from abortions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to comment on one or two aspects of the Human Rights Commission Bill. I support the amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen). When the Government considered this Bill it was presented with an opportunity to make full use of its external affairs power as defined in section 51, placitum (xix) of the Constitution to remedy abuses of human rights in this nation. This is evident from the fact that it is essentially international convenants which the Bill utilises to provide the criteria against which human rights violations shall be judged. In the Bill the Government has chosen not to do this. It is largely on its failure to make the operations of the Human Rights Commission applicable to areas of State jurisdiction and even the Northern Territory and to provide it with teeth to enforce its findings that we object to it in its current form.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Bill is a monument to the poverty of the Liberal Party's philosophy, about which we are supposed to hear a great deal in this Parliament. There is the assertion that this Government is committed to and values human freedom above all other considerations but we cannot permit a Bill to apply to State legislation and actions because this would upset the separation of powers between the States and the centre, a separation based on political expendiency at the time of its enactment and justified in the long term in terms of administrative and political convenience. Administrative arrangements have been elevated to the plain of high principle by this Government. As this Bill stands, they override considerations of human freedom. That is done both explicitly and tacitly throughout the Bill. Occasionally an argument is put forward by honourable members opposite that this separation of powers guarantees a decentralisation of power which in itself promotes freedom. There is nothing essentially wrong with this argument in principle. Where it falls flat in this instance is in its application to this Bill and in the operations of State governments. </PARA>
<PARA> It might be argued legitimately that the powers of the Schools Commission, for example, ought not be extended because this would encroach on the freedom of local populations to have a say in the educational process. It might be argued that total Commonwealth authority over determining the pace and character of mineral developments, particularly the developments of mining communities, undermines to a degree democratic practice and that State rights here are a value. It cannot be argued that in any shape or form the defence of individual liberties and rights at the expense of State authority offends any democratising effects of our current Federal arrangements. This is precisely because an appropiately empowered Human Rights Commission would pick up State legislation and action at those points where decentralised power does not have a democratising effect. In other words, an education policy which is good for Western Australia may not be good for Queensland. However, if human rights mean anything at all, in no circumstances can an internationally agreed definition of human liberty be valid for Canberra and a test of Commonwealth legislation but not for Western Australia and legislation in the various States. </PARA>
<PARA> The offences committed by conservative governments in my home State against the civil and political liberties entailed in international convenants which provide the frame of reference for this albeit toothless Commission have been gross. They have called into question the rights of citizens to assemble and speak. They have called into question the rights of individuals to vote. They have made a mockery of the extension to the original inhabitants of this land of some form of recognition of their original proprietary rights. These actions are possible largely because the Electoral Act of the State of Western Australia operates in systematic violation of the spirit and letter of Article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which is the basis of the operations of this Commission. In part that guarantee states:</PARA>
<PARA> To vote and to be elected at genuine periodic elections which shall be universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret ballot, guaranteeing the free expression of the will of electors. </PARA>
<PARA>The term 'equal suffrage' implies an equal value in every individual's vote. Only by such a process can the free expression of the will of the electors be guaranteed. The United States Bill of Rights, which contains similar provisions, has been used to end malapportionment. A proper human rights Bill here might well have done the same and may have stopped the ludicrous situation that exists in Western Australia. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And Queensland, but it is much worse in Western Australia. This is not generally realised. Western Australia is divided into three zones-metropolitan and country, where quotas for seats are set, and a northern zone, where the seat boundaries are covered by separate statutes. In the metropolitan area the quota for electors per seat for the Legislative Assembly is 17,264. In the country zone the quota is 9,139. The metropolitan zone has a total of 466,150 electors for 27 representatives. The country and statute zones have a total of 246,060 electors for 28 representatives. The largest Assembly seat is Whitford with 30,790 electors on the roll. All these figures are for January this year. The smallest seat is Murchison-Eyre, a statute seat, with 1,925 electors on the roll. The ratio is 16 to one. The situation in the Upper House, the Legislative Council, is even worse. A quarter of a million country voters have 20 members whilst half a million city voters have 12 members. The largest Council province is North Metropolitan with 97,556 electors. The smallest is Lower North with 5,764. That is a margin of 17 to one. It may well be that in political terms the current governing authorities in Queensland are not the greatest burglars; they are outdone by those who operate our system in Western Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the Human Rights Commission Bill had contained the capacity to intervene and to examine where State legislation offended against the rights of individual Australians, there would have been some possibility of bringing these matters to the attention of the general Australian community and having them redressed. The Bill denies us that opportunity. Had the Bill been in the same form as it was originally proposed by the Labor Government at least those of us who desire to see democratic practice extended to the decentralised aspects of the Australian governing process would have found the Human Rights Commission of ready assistance in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill, in its revised form, now includes within the Commission's terms of reference an area of human rights which are not strictly civil and political. The Attorney-General (Senator Durack) has done this in order to incorporate within the Bill, without directly stating it, an interpretation of the right to life which extends prior to birth. This has been, I believe-I agree here with the honourable member for McMillan (Mr Cunningham)-a positive step. It also needs to be recognised that this extends the nature of the rights considered in this legislation in directions not normally contemplated by honourable members opposite. In dealing with the rights of children, handicapped and disabled people we are entering the realm of social and economic policy. For example, principle 4 of the Declaration of the Rights of the Child states:</PARA>
<PARA> The child shall enjoy the benefits of social security. He shall be entitled to grow and develop in health; to this end, special care and protection shall be provided both to him and to his mother, including adequate pre-natal and post-natal care. The child shall have the right to adequate nutrition, housing, recreation and medical services. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable members have never accepted that these areas of social welfare involve individual's rights. The theory of the social policy of honourable members opposite has always been founded on the notion of the deserving poor. Those termed undeserving have been the object on occasions of attack and vilification. This has been the case, of course, as we are all aware in this House, with the young unemployed. The deserving and the undeserving alike are assigned a status which permits a certain level of government parsimoniousness. That ought not to be permitted if we regard these matters-the Government evidently does, as shown by its approach to this legislation-as matters of fundamental right. </PARA>
<PARA> I for one intend to encourage the many electors in my constituency who do not have adequate access to post-natal and pre-natal care for their children with the decline of our hospital system; who do not have adequate housing and recreation; who do not, if disabled, have adequate opportunities to work; who do not have access to free education; and who have had in real terms family support cut back to them to appear before this Commission and demand their rights in the terms that the Government has permitted them to proceed to do. If mothers and fathers receive adequate support in childbirth and rearing-by 'adequate' I mean support which will permit them their right to pursue a chosen profession as well as the assumption of responsibility for the child rearing-this legislation might well have an impact on abortion statistics in ways not wholly to be anticipated by the way in which the debate on the subject has proceeded to this point. In other words, it will deal not only with the question of the legal rights of the unborn child but also with the level of assistance to the mothers and the parents at all stages not only at the child's birth but also in the child's life. That would create a situation where abortion, for many people who are using the option of abortion at the moment, would not seem necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not really think, however, the Government will follow up this legislation with the very necessary social legislation to ensure that these rights as they are now defined are in fact adequately protected. Were the Government to do so, I think we would find, certainly in my electorate, an extremely grateful population. The fact that the Government has not done so imposes upon me an obligation to assist my constituents in whatever way I can, under whatever terms, conditions and opportunities that this Commission provides, to get the limited succour that is possible. I hope the amendment moved by the Opposition is carried. It would give the social as well as the civil and political, libertarian aspects of this legislation a chance to be enforced not only at the Federal but also at the State level. I am pleased to support the very sensible amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I thank honourable members for the contribution that they have made to the debate on the Human Rights Commission Bill. I regret that the Opposition should feel disposed to move the amendment which would have the effect of withdrawing the Bill and therefore defeating its passage. I would have thought, with the time that this Parliament has spent in the endeavours that it has undertaken to put on the statute book a Bill to establish a Human Rights Commission, the Opposition would have been as anxious as the Government to see that this Commission comes into being. The Government cannot accept the amendment for that fundamental reason. We believe the establishment of this Commission and the bringing into operation of the covenants that it endorses are so important that we ought not to delay any longer the passage of this Bill. Therefore, the Government will be voting against the amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Both sides of this House have applauded at least two matters. The first is the declarations with regard to children that were referred to in my second reading speech-the Declaration of the Rights of the Child, 1959, the Declaration on the Rights of the Mentally Retarded, 1971, and the Declaration on the Rights of the Disabled, 1975. The Declaration of the Rights of the Child, as honourable members on both sides of the House have recognised, states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the child, by reason of his physical and mental immaturity, needs special safeguards and care, including appropriate legal protection, before as well as after birth . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The second matter which has received some but not a great deal of attention is the deletion from sub-clause (4) of clause 10 of the original Bill of paragraph (f) which would have given to the Commission a discretion to decide not to hold an inquiry with regard to a complaint which was thought not of sufficient concern to the complainant. That discretion has been removed. Therefore, it should strengthen the power and authority of the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> This debate like so many debates with regard to rights of any kind has evoked a variety of opinion as to what are rights and in particular what rights ought to be protected one way or another within the political framework of the country. Of course, if one goes back through history the debate on the rights of the individual has been one of constant philosophical and social argument. The debate in this House tonight is no exception. History has not changed nor have the attitudes of people. It is a fact that some of us approach the meaning of rights in a different way to others. I listened with interest to the contribution of the honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly). Perhaps over the course of history this debate about what is meant by rights is rather epitomised by the way in which St Paul viewed the rights of women and the way in which the Women's Electoral Lobby of today views the rights of women. </PARA>
<PARA> Some rights, some of us would say, are fundamental. If we wish to look at the matter in a Christian sense, the Ten Commandments are as fundamental as anything which has ever been expressed by humans in the course of history. In the course of legal development through parts of the United Kingdom-the history of that country has been brought down to us through the common law-some rights are derived from those fundamental Christian rights, some are the result of the development of human attitudes and are reflected in the statutes of the United Kingdom and hence in this country. It may well be said that the rights expressed through statute law are more changeable, more dynamic in a sense, than those that are expressed through the common law. That is understandable because people of different views come and go from government. Hence they have the power which government gives to them through the parliamentary system. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the difference of view as to what are rights and whether they ought to be enforced in one way or another meets its modern classic expression in the dichotomy of views with regard to abortion. We have heard something about that tonight. There are those who say that a women has a right to destroy life. There are others, such as myself and the honourable member for McMillan (Mr Cunningham), who say that the right of a person created is the right to survive. That is a modern, classic expression of difference of views on what are meant by rights. </PARA>
<PARA> So when we listen to a debate such as we have heard tonight we ought to consider the different expression of views in that way. Therefore, it is fair to say that neither side of this House should gather around itself the cloak of righteousness in its belief as to what is best for individuals in this country. On this side we happen to have a particular view based on a philosophy of liberalism, which in its most simple terms is an expression of the liberty of the individual. That does differ from the socialist attitude of members of the Opposition and we will, as long as we are in this Parliament, debate with vigour that difference in philosophy and uphold the correctness of our view. </PARA>
<PARA> Another expression of difference of view is in the way in which we believe that the Constitution of Australia should be utilised for the benefit of the citizens of Australia. Whether the Opposition likes it or not, Australia has a Federal political structure. Again, whether the Opposition likes it or not, our Constitution is based on the fundamental premise of the distribution of power, both legal and political. We recognise that. We believe that it is a virtue in political terms, historically in its recognition of human nature and in the fact that the people of Australia live in geographically different parts; that there is value in allowing people in those different parts of Australia to express their aspirations through their own political structure. Of course, that is reflected in the political structure of the States and the Territories. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite clearly, if the external affairs power of the Constitution, which has been referred to by the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley) with such admiration, were allowed its full blossoming under a socialist government such as we experienced during the Whitlam years, the fundamental distribution of powers, as expressed in the Constitution, would be destroyed by the socialist objective of the Labor Party-to centralise political and economic power in Canberra. We on this side have no hesitation in saying that we believe that such a concentration of power would be bad. There is no proper distinction, such as the honourable member for Swan sought to draw, between the use of the external affairs power in the human rights field and its use in any other field. So the Government has no hesitation in affirming its policy, often stated publicly, that it will not use the external affairs power to subvert that fundamental distribution of political power that is provided for by the Constitution. Some honourable members opposite have expressed regret that the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights is not to fall within the jurisdiction of this Commission but as the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) pointed out in the Senate, the legislation contains powers by which the charter of the Commission can be extended to include covenants of that kind. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to the complaint-perhaps not un- naturally made-by the female members of this House that the Commission's jurisdiction will not extend to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, I would point out that Australia is as yet only a signatory to that Convention. It was not until July 1980, I believe, that the Convention was framed and Australia became a signatory. As is natural in the course of international events, all countries must consider whether and when they will ratify that convention. Ratification is a separate and distinctive international act which flows from merely being a signatory. So the Commonwealth is conducting discussions with the States in accordance with its federalist policy before determining whether Australia will ratify that convention. When it makes such a decision it will be appropriate to consider whether the Commission will have jurisdiction in regard to that Convention. </PARA>
<PARA> It is always very difficult for a male member of the House to answer comment such as we heard from the honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly) who declared that much discrimination is perpetrated against women in our community. The honourable member mentioned discrimination with respect to employment. I was very glad to support not only the efforts of my Department, but also those of other departments of the Commonwealth, including the Public Service Board, and to identify myself with the actions of the National Labour Consultative Council, which includes representatives of both employers and unions, in embarking upon a vigorous program to promote equal opportunity for the employment of women. That program will be implemented as fully as it can be. Likewise, within the Public Service Board the equal opportunity unit is a vigorous, constructive unit aimed at opening up ever widening opportunities for women to be employed. Although certain numbers were quoted by the honourable member with respect to the proportion of women who were in the First and Second divisions of the Public Service, I think it is fair to consider history. We can understand why, because of social attitudes, those numbers are so small today, but it is likewise equally fair to judge that, because of the continuing change in those attitudes, and programs such as the equal opportunity program for the employment of women, we will see an increasing number of women in the higher levels of the Commonwealth Public Service and also, I would hope, in the public services of the various States and Territories of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> Some mention was made of the reservations expressed by Australia in regard to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. I firmly believe, as does the Attorney-General, that the reservations and declarations that have been expressed are completely in accord with the Vienna Convention. We simply do not accept that, in the form in which they are drafted, the Federal-State paragraphs are in breach of that Convention or contrary to the objects or purposes of the Covenant. Indeed, they are consistent with the Federal political structure of Australia and with the authority given by the Covenant to make reservations and declarations. </PARA>
<PARA> For those reasons, and others which have been expressed in the second reading speeches of myself and the Attorney-General in the Senate, the Government cannot accept the proposed amendment and wishes to see this Bill passed and brought into law quickly and effectively. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to take this opportunity to dispose of a further episode in the pattern of deception in which the Government has engaged in this House in recent times. It relates to certain factual matters concerning what has happened in recent years regarding wage movements and the responsibility for those wage movements. In the House earlier today the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), in answering a question by me, was pleased to mislead the House. He stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable gentleman knows quite well that the policies that he devised when he was President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions that led to wage increases of nearly 40 per cent in one year, in 1975 . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He later went on to say that he was talking about the period of a year up to March 1975. I want to take the time of the House to put the record straight. I refer to what happened to wage movements in the whole of the year 1975. The Prime Minister purported to talk about wage movements but attempted to justify his argument by producing figures in regard to minimum weekly rates. They have nothing to do with wage movements. He took the concocted period March 1974 to March 1975 and showed that the weighted average minimum weekly wage rates moved by 37.6 per cent. On that basis he attempted to justify this exaggerated movement in wages of 40 per cent. The average figure for the whole of the year was 23.6 per cent. The figure for the period December to December was 13.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Is the logic of the Prime Minister's argument that, because wages moved by 37.6 per cent from March to March and by 13.5 per cent from December to December, my capacity to influence the movement in wage rates diminished by approximately two-thirds between March and December? That must be his logic because if I was responsible for what happened to wage movements apparently my power peaked in the March to March period but diminished by two-thirds in the period December to December. The absurdity of the proposition only has to be stated for even the braying members opposite to understand the absolute lack of logic in what the Prime Minister had to say. The period in question is not this concocted period of March 1974 to March 1975, for which the Prime Minister latched upon the level of 37.6 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister purported to talk about the movement in wages. As all economists know-I know that includes no honourable member opposite-a consideration of the movement in wages involves looking at average earnings. That is what we talk about when we refer to movements in wages, which is what the Prime Minister said he was talking about-not wage rates; he said wages. Let us look at the facts so that honourable members can consider them instead of the deliberate misrepresentations which continuously emanate from the Prime Minister and his lackey, the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr Viner), whom he sends in here. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I withdraw; of course he is not a lackey. I refer to the movements in wages-that is what the Prime Minister purported to talk about, not wage rates-in 1975. This i what happened in the quarterly figures for 1975. The figure for March to March is 26.2; for June to June, 22 per cent; for September to September, 13.4 per cent; and for December to December, 12.8 per cent. The 1975 figure for wage movements was 18.7 per cent, not the 40 per cent with which the Prime Minister and his representative, the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs, deliberately misled this House.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I read an article today in the Melbourne Herald about the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) which said that he was a very calm politician, and that he never got riled or ruffled. I think the writer should rethink the matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> About two weeks ago I had probably the misfortune to appear as a witness for a former member of this House, a very distinguished member, well known to the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman). He gave evidence at an appeal hearing. The story that he unfolded was very sad and it was one that made me realise that as young people many of us are completely unaware of some of the problems faced by those people who participated in combat in the theatre of war. The younger generation seems to have forgotten some of the things they endured. </PARA>
<PARA> Today I received a letter from Mr Nelson, the honorary secretary of the Newcastle Wartime Seamen's Association. I read the letter very carefully and I think he has a very good point. In essence the letter states:</PARA>
<PARA>We solicit your support in an attempt to have proper recognition of the part played by the merchant seamen during World War II. The gun crews of merchant ships were responsible for the destruction of many hundreds of enemy aeroplanes, a number of submarines and at least on five occasions merchant ships emulated the heroic actions of the Jervis Bay in taking on many warships of far superior gun power. </PARA>
<PARA>At the bottom of the letter, in his own handwriting, Mr Nelson said:</PARA>
<PARA>I have been told you have a deep and sincere interest in this particular issue. Your support would be most welcome. </PARA>
<PARA>The Association has my support because I believe that it has a very good case. Some people who left Australia but did not enter the war zone are nevertheless eligible for a Service pension. However some of these poor fellows in the merchant marine went through hell and high water during the war and I am afraid that they entered that service at a very young age. Many are now approaching the age of 60 or they are over 60. They must have suffered during the war. I believe that it is up to every young politician to realise that they were dreadful years. We are apt to forget the suffering of these people, as we forget many other things that occurred during that period. I believe that that Association has a good case and I believe--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take it that I am entitled to refer to what the honourable member said. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Ten AMSWU members and 18 FIA members employed on No. 2 bloom mill maintenance stopped work at 9.15 a.m. over the removal of a danger tag. Work was resumed at 7.30 a.m. on 24 February . . . Just listen to the contents of the trivial issue on which the union leaders called them out. On 24 February this year 135 FIA members and 10 AMSWU members employed on No. 2 bloom mill maintenance and production stopped work at 8 a.m. in protest at the use of apprentices during a previous stoppage. Work was resumed at 8 a.m. on 25 February. </PARA>
<PARA>I have here a letter from one of the men involved in that matter who came to see me. He was most indignant about the statement made by the honourable member for Petrie, which was not factual. The position is that on 23 February this year, the tradesman who came to see me, and his assistant, were working on a machine in the bloom mill, which is the largest rolling mill in the Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd steel-making process. They were working with a C-spanner to take off a nut. They were using a 4-foot length of 2-inch piping to give them additional leverage. They just loosened the nut, took it off, put the spanner down and the machine started to operate. This is what brought about the stoppage about which the honourable member for Petrie made remarks to which the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) took exception. </PARA>
<PARA> The position is that that machine had 10 danger tags on it which said that under no circumstances must it be started. Each danger tag has the name of the operator, the name of the department and the date on it. Yet the supervisor instructed an inexperienced young fitter to start the machine, notwithstanding the fact that there were 10 danger tags on it. The company's policy is that under no circumstances must the machine be started when it has a danger tag on it. Yet on that day there were at least 10 tags on that switch. So on this supervisor's instruction the machine was started. That is why the men went on strike. I can tell honourable members that any time that sort of thing happens in BHP or in any heavy industrial works, then we will be looking at a stoppage, a most justifiable stoppage by the men. If that fitter and his mate, hanging on that 4-foot length of 2-inch pipe had been there another minute, God knows where they would have finished up. We would probably have had to attend their funeral. But according to the honourable member for Petrie that is a trivial dispute. The men had a dispute. They endeavoured to get the foreman or the supervisor suspended, and they could not. But two days later they did succeed in getting the supervisor suspended because he had not put a danger tag on a switch that he had men working on. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Petrie says that the next day the men went on strike because apprentices did tradesmen's work. That is not correct. They went on strike on the second occasion because staff labour was used to do work normally performed by men who were on strike. It was not the apprentices who brought about the dispute. There were three days of disputes. The first day a fitter and turner and his assistant were fortunate they did not get killed because the machine was started up. </PARA>

They show that in most States except New South Wales there has been a massive increase in the Federal grants matching the contribution by the State governments. However in New South Wales there has been only a small rise because the New South Wales Government does not approach the problem of community health with the same level of seriousness as, say, the Victorian Government, which has doubled its contribution. The Federal Government's contribution to Victoria has, in fact, doubled over that time. Honourable members will see the differences between the various States.
