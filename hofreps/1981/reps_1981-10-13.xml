<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the House records its sincere regret at the death on 6 October 1981 of President Mohamed Anwar El Sadat, and expresses to the people of the Arab Republic of Egypt profound regret and tenders its deep sympathy to his widow and family in their bereavement. </PARA>
<PARA> I advise the House that the Commonwealth Heads of Government in Melbourne jointly extended their deep sympathy to Madam Sadat and to the Government and people of Egypt and expressed their horror at the act of outrage which took President Sadat's life. The Governor-General has also expressed his deep sadness and distress over the manner and fact of President Sadat's death. The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) represented Australia at the funeral. </PARA>
<PARA> Anwar Sadat was one of the architects of the movement which shaped modern Egypt and which brought it to its present level of social and economic development. On becoming President of Egypt in 1970, he led his country both as an outstanding patriot and as a man of vision in relations between nations. It reflected his great personal courage and initiative that he worked so hard to lay the groundwork for a comprehensive peace settlement in the Middle East. To embark on this process involved an acceptance of substantial risk, both domestic and international. His capacity to devote his energies single mindedly while bringing his nation with him was itself a tribute to his greatness. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1977, after 30 years of continual warfare in the Middle East, President Sadat made his historic and courageous visit to Jerusalem to address the Knesset and thus open the path to negotiation in the quest for peace. Then, in 1979, the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty was signed. I said at the time that the world hoped that work on a comprehensive Middle East settlement would proceed in the aftermath of that treaty. President Sadat sought peace to resolve the problems built up through mistrust and fear. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1978 jointly with the Prime Minister of Israel. </PARA>
<PARA> While the peace with Israel and the stability which has ensued is perhaps President Sadat's greatest monument, his other achievements are no less significant. He realised that the basic security of Egypt and the Middle East lay in distancing the region from wider global power struggles, and to this end he sought to diminish the impact of the Soviet Union by restricting its influence within Egypt and the area as a whole. His pursuit of constructive and realistic domestic and foreign policies brought both to himself and to Egypt a reputation for moderation, balance and constraint in the non-aligned movement. His death is a great loss for Egypt, the Middle East and the world, not least because of the senseless and brutal violence which brought it about.</PARA>
<PARA> To have lost a world leader of President Sadat's stature is tragic. Not everyone, as we know, agreed with what the President was doing, although everyone must surely respect him for his courage and his objectives of peace and stability, and certainly no benefits will follow from what has taken place. We can only hope and trust that President Sadat's achievements will be sustained and that his vision of a lasting and comprehensive peace settlement can be realised as a fitting tribute and memorial to him. We all mourn his death. I commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a sombre occasion. The world mourns the late Anwar Sadat. He was brutally assassinated last week at Cairo, capital of Egypt for which, as President, the late Anwar Sadat had toiled courageously and with determination. By any measure the late President Anwar Sadat must be credited as an historically significant leader of his country. I totally condemn his assassination, whatever its motivation. On behalf of the Australian Labor Party I extend my deepest sympathy to his widow and his children at this time of bitter grief.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Anwar Sadat was born on 25 December 1918 in the village of Mit Abul Kam on the Nile delta. He was the son of a poor military clerk and a Sudanese woman. As early as 1939 he joined a group dedicated to the liberation of Egypt from British occupation and from a corrupt regime which dominated the Egyptian Government. After the war he held a variety of jobs-truck driver, newspaper reporter and canal digger, until he rejoined the army in 1950. He took part in the 1952 revolution against the monarchy and was a relatively obscure figure in Egyptian politics until he inherited the presidency upon President Nasser's death in 1970. He was considered at that time as a purely interim figure. President Sadat, however, proved all the predictions false. Over the next 10 years he showed himself above all to be a man totally unafraid to pursue the course he felt was best for Egypt. </PARA>
<PARA> More than anything else President Sadat was a man who took enormous risks. He turned out the Russian advisers who totally dominated the Egyptian economy and military machine. He undertook the 1973 war against Israel and, in doing that, against all the odds. Whatever the military analysts may say was the true outcome of the conflict, he and his people saw it as the restoration of their national pride which had been destroyed in 1967. He increasingly turned towards the West and in the mid-1970s adopted an open-door economic policy towards foreign investment. The greatest risk he took, however, was in his attitudes to the Arab-Israeli conflict which had brought his country to war four times in some 30 years. It was he who initiated the opening to Israel. It was he who journeyed to Jerusalem in November 1977. It was he who was the driving force in achieving the Camp David Accords in 1978-79. He did so despite the vilification of his neighbouring Arab countries and pursued unremittingly the course which he saw as the one best for his people despite all opposition, both within and outside his own country. </PARA>
<PARA> The great tragedy for Egypt is the intractable economic problems that confront it. Its population growth has been a serious problem, stretching available resources too thinly. In 1980 its economic growth was calculated as around 10 per cent but there was an inflation rate of about 50 per cent and per capita income was about $370. Imports of wheat supplied two-thirds of Egypt's needs and petroleum reserves were running down. </PARA>
<PARA> Within this environment, constricted by all of the difficulties of a large and growing population and minimal opportunity for the generation of savings to allow investment to develop, growth to be promoted, and living standards to be improved, there were, obviously, serious bottlenecks obstructing effective income redistribution. These clearly led to expressions of discontent as they inevitably will. There were political and religious tensions to be contended with as well as the strand of Pan-Arabism which is influential in certain parts of the military, the intelligentsia and the middle class. These were very difficult ingredients to handle. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, they represented a fissionable association. On balance one concludes that the control of the potential of these various forces for explosive ignition in the wake of the cruel slaughter of Anwar Sadat is an indication of how successfully he had been striving to balance and contain them. </PARA>
<PARA> I said earlier that he was a man of great courage. It is now known that he was aware that his life was in danger. But with the true courage of a soldier he still persisted in discharging his official duties, knowing full well that he was exposing himself to the risk of violent death whenever he did so. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps I can briefly anecdotically recall from personal experience Anwar Sadat's charm, lively interest and intellectual awareness. A little over 12 months ago he generously spared more than an hour of his time at Alexandria to talk with me in detail of the problems with which he had to contend within his very difficult region, of the economic challenges confronting his country, of his determination to try to improve the lot of the ordinary people of his nation. It was not a matter of a man being carried forward by a grand and impractical vision of a better society. He acknowledged the enormous economic constraints that bore down so depressingly on his country. But he was confident in his belief that with all of those limitations there was still room for a better result to be achieved for the ordinary Egyptian people, and within this context it was his belief that peace in his region was an absolutely essential ingredient to all that. War wasted too many resources, human and material, and destroyed too many opportunities for creative endeavour within his country. In the final result it will be said that he was a warrior for peace, and it is to be hoped that the commendable objectives which he laid before himself will be pursued by his successors with diligence, intelligence and conviction. His passing is mourned throughout the world and indeed throughout this country and within this Parliament, and the sadness is shared by all members of the Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Leader of the National Country Party and Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) and the members of that party, I endorse the motion that has been moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and seconded by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The late Mohamed Anwar Sadat was born on Christmas Day, 25 December 1918. He was one of 13 children of Mohamed Sadat, a civilian clerk in a military hospital. His birthplace was a small town-a cluster of mud-brick buildings-in provincial Egypt north of Cairo. He rose from that to the highest position in the land. </PARA>
<PARA> He moved to Cairo with his family when his father was transferred there in 1925. There he lived in a small house on the outskirts of the capital not far from the palace of the Egyptian kings. Indeed, he often boasted that as a child he stole apricots from the royal orchard. From his youth he was a nationalist who had a burning desire to play an important part in his nation's development. He saw the best way of doing this as a military officer, and he graduated from the Royal Military College in 1938. He spent most of the years of World War II as a prisoner of the British. Twice he escaped from prison. On the first occasion he went straight to the palace of King Farouk, signed the visitors' book with a plea for independence, and returned to prison in a taxi cab. On the second, he lived as a fugitive and worked as a labourer. He was close to the late Colonel Nasser, a former military college classmate, and he had the task of taking over the Cairo radio in 1952 to announce Nasser's coup. He showed his religious nature by waiting 20 minutes for the completion of the daily reading from the Koran before he made the announcement. He held several important posts under President Nasser but his real stature was never fully appreciated. He was the only vice-president when Nasser died. He was sworn into office as President on 19 October 1970. </PARA>
<PARA> The late President Sadat was thought to be only an interim leader, but he survived several coups and soon began to leave his mark on Egypt. One of his first achievements was a new Egyptian constitution in which he sought to blend the best of the traditional Islamic values with Western concepts of human rights and parliamentary responsibility. He led his country to war-the Yom Kippur or Ramadan war in 1973. It was through the experience of that war that Sadat became a peacemaker, and that, of course, is how he will be long remembered. He wanted peace and he showed that he was prepared to take risks to get it. It is not without significance that the peacemaker died at a military rally. The high point in his career was probably his decision to go to Jerusalem nearly four years ago when he was received by the people, the Knesset and the Government of Israel in a way that will be remembered, as Prime Minister Begin has said, as one of the great events of our time. Equally significantly, he returned to Egypt from Jerusalem fearing that he might be met by hostile crowds, but he was greeted by his own people who demonstrated that they were exhausted by 30 years of war and sought peace in the way that he did. President Sadat's death has taken from the world one of the great statesmen of our time. The scope of his greatness is marked by the fact that nearly everyone now wonders what impact his death will have upon his country, his region and the rest of the world. We can hope that the words of his successor, President Mubarak, will prove meaningful:</PARA>
<PARA> Although we have lost the leader, we find consolation because our people, throughout the country are standing in sadness and pain to declare that we are following his path, the road of peace in full conviction that it is the way of right, justice and freedom . . . We say to the late leader that we will stand as one solid front behind all the banners he had raised. </PARA>
<PARA> The late Anwar Sadat often said that his most valuable hours were not spent in the councils of state, but walking along the Nile contemplating the great questions of his time. He was clearly a man of his people and a man of his time. To Madam Sadat and the people of Egypt, on behalf of the National Country Party, I join in extending our deepest sympathy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As spokesman for the Opposition in matters relating to foreign affairs I want to support the remarks of my leader in extending to President Sadat's family our deep and sincere sympathy in their loss. The late President Sadat will have a place in the modern history of the Middle East as a leader whose greatest campaign was for peace between his country and Israel. He will be remembered as a patriot who fought for the true independence of his country from the colonial rule of the British. He was a man of true intregrity and his assassination leaves the world a poorer and more dangerous place. That he was a man of great courage is undeniable. He demonstrated this shortly after his accession to power by moving to assert his country's independence and integrity in the face of great pressure from one of the super-powers. That he was a man of vision as well as of courage was demonstrated by his historic journey to Jerusalem in 1977.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no question that he desperately wanted to bring peace to his region. He understood, perhaps better than any other leader in that region, that accommodation and sacrifice were necessary to achieve that end. Unfortunately, his vision and courage were not always matched in equal measure. The greatest tribute to President Sadat, the most appropriate memorial to his memory, would be the achievement of a comprehensive and durable settlement in the Middle East that would allow his people, for whom he made the ultimate sacrifice, to live in peace. For them to live in peace means that all other people who live in that region need peace as well. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not my intention to cover ground already adequately covered by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden), the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) and the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair). My views on President Sadat are known. I regarded him as one of the great men of this century. He is the only Arab leader who had the foresight and understanding to acknowledge the realities of Middle Eastern politics and the courage to do something about them. He paid for that with his life.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In November 1977, when he made the historic speech to the Egyptian Parliament offering to Israel the hand of peace of the largest and most powerful Arab country in the region, he knew the risks he was taking. He knew that there were forces in the Middle East which would stop at nothing to prevent peace coming about. It is not yet clear who was responsible for his assassination but it is clear from the reaction of some of the fanatics in the region that there were many who would willingly have done such a foul deed if the opportunity had been available to them. </PARA>
<PARA> What I want to do today is refute the obscenity reiterated both in Australia and abroad in the Middle East that Anwar Sadat was somehow a traitor to the Arab cause. He can be accused of being a traitor only by those who see the only solution to the conflict in the Middle East as the obliteration of the state of Israel. During the past few days we have seen in the Australian Press statements, editorials and articles from leading journalists, academics and politicians that have argued that President Sadat paid the price for Prime Minister Begin's intransigence and belligerence and that had Israel been prepared to negotiate with the more moderate elements in the Arab world, particularly the Palestine Liberation Organisation, the problem of the Middle East could have been resolved. </PARA>
<PARA> Let those people who reiterate these absurdities remember quite clearly what President Sadat said from the beginning of his peace initiatives and what was repeated by him in his speech to the Knesset and in dozens of speeches, letters and statements from then until his death last week. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to quote from that speech. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The cause of the Palestinian people and their legitimate rights are no longer ignored or denied by anybody. It is a reality which the international community . . . has supported and recognised. The Palestinian Question is the heart and crux of the conflict, and as long as this issue remains unsolved the conflict can only continue to aggravate and to reach new dimensions. In all faith I tell you that peace cannot be achieved without the Palestinians. It would be a grave error with unpredictable consequences to ignore (their cause)-</PARA>
<PARA>One may not necessarily agree with all the sentiments expressed in those words of Anwar Sadat but I defy anyone in this House to state that these are the words of a man who has sold out the Arab cause, that these are the views of a man who is guilty of treachery to the Palestinian people. President Sadat went on to suggest a peace agreement based on the following principles:</PARA>
<PARA> First: Termination of Israel's occupation of the Arab territories occupied in 1967. Second: Achievement of the basic rights of the Palestinian people particularly their right to self-determination including the right to establish their own state. Third: The right of every state in the area to live in peace within secure borders guaranteed by mutually agreed procedures that would ensure the proper security of the international borders in addition to appropriate international guarantees. Fourth: All the states of the area should be committed to conduct their relations with one another in accordance with the aims and principles of the United Nations Charter particularly not to resort to the use of force and to resolve any differences among themselves through peaceful means. Fifth: Termination of the present state of belligerency in the area. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a mind-boggling exercise in intellectual gymnastics and self-delusion to assert that these statements made by President Sadat and repeated ad infinitum over the past four years are those of a person intent on deserting the Arab cause and the Palestinians. I ask everyone in this House to study these principles carefully and to tell me what more he could have demanded of the Israelis short of asking for total abolition of the state of Israel. We are told that Israel should deal with the more moderate factions in the Arab world. If these demands made by President Sadat were insufficient to satisfy the moderates what would have satisfied them? The honest people among us can only come up with the conclusion that President Sadat's crime was not that he did not demand enough of Israel but that he committed the unforgiveable-he accepted Israel's right to exist. That was his crime. That is why there has been dancing in the streets of Libya, Syria, Iraq and amongst the PLO in Lebanon. </PARA>
<PARA> President Sadat recognised that Egypt alone could not achieve all the principles enunciated in his speech to the Knesset and re-stated repeatedly. Egypt had the right to negotiate for only that territory that was previously Egyptian-the Sinai. This he did with such success that in April next year, if the peace process continues under President-elect Mubarak, all of the Sinai occupied by Israel in 1967 will be returned to Egyptian sovereignty. The West Bank, Gaza, the Golan and East Jerusalem had never been Egyptian territory and the Camp David Accords and the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty envisaged that other Arab countries-Syria, Jordan, The Lebanon-and the Palestinians would be involved in a step by step process in resolving these problems. No one in his right mind would ever believe that after 30 years of war and a century of bitterness and hatred these matters could be resolved in a few weeks or a few months. The legacy of distrust will take time to dissolve but this process will not even start until other Arab nations follow President Sadat and indicate to Israel their willingness to recognise her right to exist. </PARA>
<PARA> Having just returned from Israel and Egypt, I am convinced that given the same encouragement, the same recognition and an end to a state of war between Israel and its Arab neighbours, peace will occur. Prime Minister Begin, the Israeli Cabinet and the people of Israel will surprise the world with what they will be prepared to concede for permanent peace. But Israel will not-President Sadat was the only Arab leader to recognise this fact-withdraw from territory or settlements that will make it easier for those Arab nations that wish to destroy Israel. The world will mourn the passing of one of the great men of this century. We can only hope and pray that there are other men of stature in the Middle East who will have the courage and the compassion to follow the magnificent example he set. If they do not, then the Middle East may well become the starting point for the greatest conflagration in history. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I conclude, I take the opportunity to say how shocked I was to learn also that John Woods, the young Australian First Secretary in Cairo, was seriously wounded in the assassination. I arrived in Cairo on Wednesday, 2 September, and was met by John Woods. He arranged my itinerary and accompanied me for the four days I was in Egypt. I could not have been more satisfied with the treatment I received and with the excellent program and briefing arranged by John Woods and the Embassy. John Woods is a first-class example of the intelligent and dedicated young diplomats who serve Australia superbly in similar outposts around the world. We are fortunate to have such men in our service. I deeply regret the constant impression given by some of our Press that diplomats have easy lives of luxury. Nothing could be further from the truth, particularly in Cairo. I can only wish John the speediest of recoveries and hope that he will soon be back with his charming wife, Gay. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to join other members of this House in expressing my sorrow and condolences to the Egyptian people on the death of their President, Anwar Sadat. I was fortunate enough to visit Egypt in 1974, four years after Nasser died, as a guest of the now defunct Arab Socialist Union. That was six months after the October 1973 war. We were able to observe at first hand the attempts by President Anwar Sadat to effect economic, social, welfare and industrial progress in Egypt. We were particularly impressed at that time by the efforts to industrialise, particularly the steel and textile industries. We observed the growing tendency to develop at least some progress towards an independent trade union movement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One thing I observed at that time was the great burden of escalating armament acquisition on the economy of a poor and struggling nation such as Egypt. However, I must say that, if economic reports that one reads are true, the economic effect of the open-door policy of Anwar Sadat has certainly not ensured that a flow-on of economic benefits has necessarily occurred to all those millions of poor peasants whom we observed struggling for subsistence along the Nile. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no question that Sadat was a great president of Egypt. It was Sadat who in October 1973 broke the stalemate that existed because of the then Israeli occupation of the Bar-Lev line on the eastern side of the Suez Canal. He disproved for all time the myth of Israeli invincibility which led to the movements in the peace front that have occurred since. Then there was in 1977 his historic visit to the Knesset which, of course, led to the Camp David agreements. Although the Camp David agreements brought peace settlements to both Egypt and Israel, some people tend to overlook that they were supposed to lead to a broader and lasting peace settlement involving at least Palestinian autonomy on the West Bank of the Jordan River and, then, the establishment of a Palestinian state. The point about all this is that, although there had been this substantial progress on the Egypt-Israeli front, there had not really been any progress with regard to the broader and long term issue of the provision of a homeland for the Palestinian people. I suggest that it was this deficiency in the Camp David Accords that eventually led to the destruction of Anwar Sadat, horrific and reprehensible as it was. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by observing that unless the attitude of the present Begin Government of Israel changes-we have seen at least 40 settlements established, and the annexation of some 30 per cent of Arab land, on the West Bank-great problems indeed will be experienced before the Camp David Accords are brought to a successful conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem for Anwar Sadat, which eventually led to his death, was that the more successful he became in the south, the more intransigence resulted from Israeli towards Syria, the Palestinians and in attacks on Lebanon in the north; thus the less chance there was of achieving a lasting and meaningful settlement in the north. That must be taken into account if the so-called Camp David Accords are ever to have any hope of producing not just an Egyptian-Israeli settlement but a broader settlement that will bring hope to the 2,500,000 people who happen to be Palestinians but are not allowed to return to their own homeland. </PARA>
<PARA> I join in mourning the President of Egypt, Anwar Sadat, and suggest that shocking, deplorable, reprehensible and unnecessary as his death last week was, it illustrates the inescapable conclusion that there will be no lasting peace in this troubled area of the world unless the rights of the Palestinian people are recognised and they receive justice. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the motion of condolence moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) on the death of Mohamed Anwar El Sadat. In the written history of mankind few human beings have ever drawn the sword and yet been prepared to sheath it short of defeat or victory on the field of battle. The fact that Anwar Sadat was one of the very few people who did that has undoubtedly guaranteed his place in history. However, what is important to remember is that this man, who grew to become an administrator, a soldier and later a great statesman, did not always believe that the road to peace in the Middle East rested on negotiation. In fact, it is worth noting that in 1970, prior to becoming President, he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Don't ask me to make diplomatic relations with them. </PARA>
<PARA> He was referring to Israel-</PARA>
<PARA> Never. Never. Leave it to the coming generations to decide that, not me. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet, a few years later this man, appreciating the realities facing his nation, realising that the economic development, physical security and prosperity of his people could not be achieved through war, and knowing that the military establishment which was an important basis of his administration had received some satisfaction from its relative successes in the Yom Kippur war, believed that the time had come when steps could be taken towards initiating negotiations with Israel for a settlement in the Middle East. Incidentally, he was the first and only Arab statesman since 1948 to look seriously at negotiation as a way of solving the interminable problems of his nation and of the Middle East in general. He has now passed away, in tragic circumstances, and the future of the Middle East, which inevitably will involve the rest of mankind to some degree, requires quite clearly that countries such as Australia must continue to give to his successor at least the same degree of support as was given to Sadat to achieve a lasting settlement, because we do stand for peace; we do not support the concept of war as the best means for solving issues between nations. </PARA>
<PARA> For that reason, I think it appropriate that President Sadat's own words should be a fitting epitaph to what he stood for. In Washington, in 1979, at the signing of the peace accords with Israel, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> In all the steps I took I was not performing a personal mission. I was merely expressing the will of a nation. I am proud of my people and of belonging to them. </PARA>
<PARA> Today a new dawn is emerging out of the darkness of the past. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us work together until the day comes when they beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe the Middle East will have peace one day, but it will be achieved only if there are more men like President Sadat. We indeed must mourn his passing. </PARA>

<PARA> That this House expresses its deep regret at the death on 12 October of the Honourable Patrick John Kennelly, a senator for Victoria from 1953 to 1971 and Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate from 1956 to 1967; places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service; and tenders its profound sympathy to his widow and family in their bereavement. </PARA>

From 1945 to 1947 he was the Commissioner of Public Works and Minister in charge of Electrical Undertakings in the Labor Government. In 1945 he became the Federal Secretary of the Australian Labor Party, a position that he retained for eight years. In 1953 he was elected to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> During his 18 years as a senator he served on several parliamentary committees, including the Committee of Disputed Returns and Qualifications and the Joint Committee on Constitutional Review. He was also a Temporary Chairman of Committees from 1968. Senator Kennelly was Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate from 1956 to 1967. Pat Kennelly served his nation, his State, the Senate, and the Labor movement with great distinction. He was unstinting in his support for his Labor ideals and a vigorous defender of his party's policies. Mr Speaker, when I entered Parliament in 1955 Pat Kennelly had, as you will recall, already won wide respect for his political skills, both within this Parliament and within the State of Victoria-indeed, the entire Labor movement. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst Pat Kennelly served in the Senate and I in the House of Representatives, I remember him as embodying many of the qualities of the old time Labor movement which had won much respect throughout Australia. He will be remembered as one of the most influential, dedicated and colourful figures in the history of the Labor Party. He was, at the same time, a very significant figure in his own particular area of Melbourne, which he looked after and safeguarded with great zeal and with great energy over many long years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party, I express the party's sadness at the death of Senator Pat Kennelly and extend its deep sympathies to his surviving family. Pat Kennelly was a notable personality and influence in the Labor movement for over half a century. He was, at various times, State Secretary of the party, a Minister in the Victorian Parliament, and Federal Secretary of the party while Ben Chifley was Prime Minister. He was elected to the Senate in 1953 and retired from politics in 1971. To recite his official positions is to give only the barest hint of the role he played in our party, often at the centre of action and equally as often behind the scenes, but always with effect. For Pat Kennelly, the Labor Party was his life. He became very close to the late John Cain senior, the former Labor Premier in Victoria. Nothing would have given the late Pat Kennelly greater pleasure in his last days than to know that the son of the man he admired so much was soon to follow in his father's footsteps.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As Federal Secretary of the party he had an especially happy and successful relationship with Ben Chifley, whom he rightly saw as one of the greatest men Australia has produced. The confidence Chifley had in him was a major factor in the harmonious and effective relationship between the extra-parliamentary party and the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party which existed at that time. Pat Kennelly was, however, his own man and a tough, hard fighter. He fought communist influence during the 1930s and 1940s. He would have no part of the industrial movement, however, and was a major actor in the great split in the party in the 1950s. The split was a tragedy for Kennelly, for the party and for Australia and, with the benefit of hindsight in times when passions have cooled, it is a shame that it ever had to occur. </PARA>
<PARA> Kennelly, a devout Catholic who never hid his faith under a bushel, bore with courage the bitter attacks on him from those who shared his faith. His personal courage was undeniable. He bore those outrageous slings and arrows of vilification with great fortitude, as with equal stoicism and inspiration he worked for the restoration of the fortunes of the Labor Party. He is remembered as the ultimate numbers man and as a king maker in the party. Certainly he was pugnacious and direct but he saw those traits as fundamentally in the interests of the party to which he had devoted a lifetime of service. We regret his passing. I restate that we extend our deepest sympathies to his surviving family members. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of members of the National Country Party and in the absence of our leader, I support the motion moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and extend our deepest personal sympathy to Mrs Kennelly and her two children. Pat Kennelly was certainly a remarkable parliamentarian. He served his country for a very long period of more than 32 years in two parliaments. In the uncompromising world of Labor politics, he won and held a number of senior party positions. It was not just in the Parliament however, that he achieved distinction. All of us remember the work he did with respect to Albert Park in Melbourne and his service as Chairman of the Albert Park Trust for more than 30 years. I believe it was he rather than anyone else who was responsible for the draining of the swamp that is now the Albert Park Lake. He was also a trustee of the Melbourne Cricket Ground, and for many years he campaigned against increased admission fees there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Pat Kennelly's first parliamentary position was as a member of the Legislative Council for Melbourne West in the Victorian upper House. He was the Minister for Public Works in the Cain Government from 1945 to 1947. In the Australian Labor Party split of the early 1950s he lost his preselection but, less than a year later, in 1953, he won third place on the Victorian Senate ticket, beginning 18 years as a senator for Victoria. His whole life was devoted to the business of ALP politics. He will be remembered as an effective and tough debater who overcame his personal affliction, a stammer, in order to achieve considerable respect and admiration from all those who worked with him. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The death of Pat Kennelly ends an era of Australian politics and ends an era of Australian Labor Party politics. He was, essentially, the product of a radical Irish Catholic tradition which has played such an important part in the history of the Labor movement and in the development of Australian politics. The organisational and parliamentary positions that he held in the Labor Party, both in Victoria and federally, have already been placed on record. They need no elaboration from me. Many people have contemplated spending their life in politics, but few would have been prepared to enter politics as Pat Kennelly had to, with a physical handicap, a stammer, which he eventually turned into the ultimate political weapon. The stories of Pat Kennelly's use of his stammer and its effectiveness will live long in the memories of those who were the beneficiaries of it, and those who were at its receiving end. Many saw him wield it with a rich venom on many occasions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I suspect he has to be the ultimate author of that well known statement which I believe is upheld in all political institutions and party rooms. He would say, as I recall him saying to me when I was a very young man in the Labor Party: 'Brother, you can have the arguments; give me the numbers any time'. Knowing Pat, having worked with him for many years and having loved him, I think he would want me to tell that story because he was never ashamed of it. He not only believed in that principle but also worked by it for all his political life. </PARA>
<PARA> Pat Kennelly had a number of loves. His family was clearly his first love. I do not know that I can enumerate the others. His religion was a major factor in his life. His involvement with his party, the Richmond Football Club and the Albert Park Trust were other aspects of his creativity. One only had to travel in the vicinity of Albert Park on a hot summer's afternoon in Melbourne to see the Chairman of the Trust moving the hoses around. In his position as Chairman he took on the Commonwealth government, the State government and anybody else who happened to disagree with his views on the development of this important recreational area. His love for the Richmond Football Club was for him rich and rewarding. When it won it was a matter of great jubilation, and when it lost it was an occasion for the deepest and saddest Irish melancholy I have ever beheld. For those who have to live in a political situation, from time to time we seek favours, and I remember saying to newly elected secretaries of the Labor Party: 'If you ever want a favour from Pat Kennelly always ring him on the Monday after Richmond has won, never on the Monday after it has lost'. </PARA>
<PARA> He was a devout and ardent believer in his religious faith. Perhaps one of the great tragedies of his life was that occasion on which the Labor Party split in 1955, and he was one of those who was deeply involved in that. When the history of those events is written, as I hope it will be written, there must be a place recorded in the annals of our history as a nation for the moral strength and courage of people such as Pat Kennelly and Arthur Calwell who not only believed in their Catholic faith and were prepared to uphold it in the face of the views of a somewhat turbulent archbishop, but also were prepared quietly, and with an enduring sense of nobility, to maintain it in the face of what often were very difficult and incredible political and religious pressures. He gave his family the same fierce loyalty and love that he gave to every aspect of his life. It will be a long time before the Labor Party, and indeed this Parliament, produces another character such as Pat Kennelly. As I said at the beginning of my remarks, I think his passing really records a passing in the history of the development of this nation and the history of the development of my own party. I know he would want me to say that now he is dead some of the better stories about Pat Kennelly can really be told. He was a man who was larger than life. He loved politics, the parliamentary institution and his party. He served this Parliament, the Victorian Parliament, and everything else he undertook with a fierce devotion. The Australian people will be sadder at his passing. We all have lost a vigorous, great and individual Australian. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Pat Kennelly was not just a great character, he was a great organiser as well. One of the things not mentioned so far is the very important part he played as the Federal Secretary of the Australian Labor Party during the years of the Chifley Government. He had a very close relationship with Ben Chifley and saw him in almost a paternal role. Ben Chifley was the only person he never called 'brother'. He called everybody else 'brother', but with Ben Chifley it was always 'the big fellah'. Perhaps more than anyone else it was Pat Kennelly who, in those very turbulent years after the war, helped to keep the party organisation together until it fell apart in the 1950s at the time of the split. He was in the Victorian Legislative Council until he lost the preselection ballot for Melbourne West in 1952 in his own home territory. It is true that he had a lifelong interest in voting systems-that has been commented on before-but in that election he lost in his own area following a terrible bereavement within his own family. But in 1953, in the face of very fierce opposition from the then faction which controlled the Labor Party in Victoria, he won a State-wide Victorian ballot to gain preselection for the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Pat Kennelly was born in 1900. If we look in Who's Who and in the Parliamentary Handbook we will see that they always state 1903, but he actually was born in 1900. I think he may have had a prophetic insight that the Labor Party might impose age limitations for candidates in the future and he thought it sensible perhaps to have two or three years up his sleeve. I understand that precedent has been followed in some other cases. It is a great pity that he refused to write his memoirs or even to be interviewed for a biography. I know that the National Library of Australia wanted to interview him and it should have interviewed him, but he said 'No'. He would never put his experiences on tape or paper because, characteristically, he said that he did not want to say or record anything, even if it was published after his death, that would hurt the children of anybody he criticised. </PARA>
<PARA> Although he played the game pretty tough there was a very sentimental side to him. He was passionately attached to his family, as has been said before. Two children predeceased him but he was very devoted to his wife Jess and his two children, Ron and Joan. He was a great talent scout. He liked to encourage people. He was a great believer in the gospel of 'horses for courses'. In many cases the people he promoted, pushed and encouraged were people who were, temperamentally, quite unlike himself and with backgrounds quite unlike his own. He was a genuine recogniser and promoter of talent. He played a very important role, for example, in securing back in 1960 the election as Deputy Leader of the Labor Party of Gough Whitlam, a man who was very different temperamentally, but Pat Kennelly recognised his very real quality. With him an era in Australian politics ends. He was a great man, a man of his time and one whom we will always remember with great affection. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to associate myself with the remarks about the late Pat Kennelly as I am one of those fortunate to have enjoyed his friendship and assistance, to which I will refer in a few moments. As has been mentioned, he was an associate of the greats in the Australian Labor Party, including Ben Chifley; Reg Downing, a former Attorney-General in New South Wales who is still living in Goulburn; Joe Cahill; John Cain; Jack Ferguson, former Federal President of the Labor Party and State President in New South Wales, unfortunately deceased; Abie McAlpine, also Federal President of the party; and W. R. Colbourne, a former General Secretary. I could go on. I thought the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) described Pat Kennelly very aptly. We always enjoyed his humor and his impediment which made him an even greater personality than he might have been.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I can recollect receiving assistance from him when my electorate of Chifley was established in 1968. It was to be called the electorate of Grose. I would undoubtedly have been called the fat member. There would have been no doubt about that, having an electorate of that name. I made an appeal, which failed, asking that the electorate be called Chifley. In this case-this was done perfectly correctly as it should have been-Pat Kennelly approached the Minister of the time. He said: 'There are two names in this redistribution of boundaries which I want to be preserved. One is the name of Scullin and the other is the name of Chifley'. He approached the then Minister for the Interior who is now the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) and put that proposition to the Minister. As a result it was agreed that Pat would move an amendment in the Senate and that when it came back to the House of Representatives it would be accepted in the House of Representatives. That is how I became the member for Chifley and not the member for Grose. That was the sort of thing which Pat could do very effectively and utterly and completely legally without there being any question of impropriety as has been suggested in relation to some other methods which have been used in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> I say once again that I wish to be associated with the remarks about Pat Kennelly. Whenever he met me he would say: 'N-n-n-now, are you l-l-looking after that el-electorate of Chifley'. Pat was a very great man. I will always feel honoured to have known him and to have been friendly with him. For those reasons I support the motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join with other honourable members in extending condolences to the family of Pat Kennelly. Pat took a very deep interest in my role as Federal Secretary of the Australian Labor Party in the late 1960s. I did not know him very well before that time, but he felt it incumbent upon him to give me a lot of advice in the late 1960s and early 1970s. As the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) pointed out, he had one greater love than the Labor Party and that was the Richmond Football Club. On occasions when he approached me during those years I was not quite sure whether he was going to give me a bit of advice about the Labor Party or secure the clearance of some of the best footballers from South Australia. He was really a very important person in the Labor movement. It is interesting that the State of Victoria keeps producing people like Pat Kennelly, although in the future I suspect that this will be less likely.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> He loved to be at the height of the feuds which were going on. As one recalls, in the history of the Labor Party the late 1960s were not all that friendly a time. I think that if he were alive and active at the moment he would prefer to be a member of the Liberal Party in Victoria, sorting out its problems. After he retired from politics he continued to visit Canberra and to give us the advice which he thought was necessary. As far as I am concerned, the one outstanding feature of everything that Pat Kennelly did or said was that in any advice he ever gave me, in any decision he ever made, or in anything with which I knew he was associated, he always acted on the basis that he hoped it would do something positive to get Labor into power. I do not believe that he ever made a decision, a comment or a speech in which he felt he may have been doing something which would have extended the period for which Labor would be in opposition. In that respect he was a very positive person. It pained him greatly that the split in the Labor Party during the 1950s took so long to be settled. I am sure that he will be missed. On Thursday afternoon we will bear witness to the hundreds and hundreds of friends that Pat Kennelly has throughout Australia as a result of the outstanding contribution that he made in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA> That the serious youth unemployment problem is a direct result of the community's failure to create sufficient jobs.</PARA>

<PARA> 1. the financial situation of students enrolled at Australian Tertiary Institutions is already extremely difficult (as indicated in the Commonwealth Department of Education's 1979 survey of student incomes and expenditure) and any substantial increase in the financial commitments of students as foreshadowed in the proposals of the Committee of Review of Commonwealth Functions announced on 30th April 1981, would gravely worsen their financial difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. the proposed tightening of eligibility criteria for T.E.A.S. will, if implemented force many students to discontinue their studies and will deter many people from undertaking tertiary study in the future.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. the proposed loans scheme to substitute for tertiary education assistance under T.E.A.S. will, if introduced, offer no long-term relief from financial difficulties and will pressure future students into giving undue regard in selecting courses to the latters' duration and the prospects for later remuneration which these courses imply.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. the imposition of tuition fees for second and higher degrees will, if carried through, deter many persons willing and able to undertake further study from doing so, and will therefore further reduce the postgraduate and research activities of our tertiary institutions.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. those students and potential students from social groups currently under-represented and disadvantaged in the tertiary education system would be most severely affected by the proposals as outlined on 30th April 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore pray that:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) eligibility criteria for T.E.A.S. not be further restricted but be extended; and that the level of T.E.A.S. for independent allowance be increased to 120% of the Henderson Poverty Line.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) the proposed loans scheme not be introduced.</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) tuition fees not be introduced for any course of for any category of students.</PARA>
<PARA> And your petitioners as in duty bound shall ever humbly pray.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Right Honourable The Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble Petition of the undersigned concerned citizens respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That local authorities throughout Australia are appalled at the recently announced Commonwealth Government allocation of a mere $628m for roads in 1980-81.There is extreme disappointment at both the level of total Commonwealth funding for all road categories and at the specific allocation for the local roads category.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray:</PARA>

<TITLE>Defence Service Home Loans</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That the members of the Women's Services of the 1939-45 War not at present considered eligible for Defence Service Home Loans should qualify as 'Australian Soldiers' under the Defence Service Homes Act. They volunteered for service with the Naval, Military and Air Forces, serving wherever they were sent in whatever capacity they were required and yet are refused Defence Service Home Loans.</PARA>
<PARA> They took the oath to resist His Majesty's enemies which meant to fight His Majesty's enemies, and although not used in actual combat in war zones, they were available for that use and had a sufficiently grave need arisen would have been used, to serve with distinction as have women of other lands.</PARA>
<PARA> In accordance with the Acts and Regulations of the period, the women of the Military Forces had enlisted for service anywhere, some of the Naval women to sail in any waters, others with service on warships optional, while the women of the Airforce could have been sent to Papua New Guinea or other territories under the control or care of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Ex-servicemen of the Royal Australian Navy, the Australian Imperial Force and the Royal Australian Air Force who volunteered in the 1939-45 War but were not sent to War Zones are granted home loans. Not to grant eligibility to all Ex-servicewomen of 1939-45 War is unjust and unfair.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that you favourably consider amending the Defence Service Homes Act by repealing Sub-section 4 (2A) (b) (c) (d) of the Principal Act as amended by No. 137 of 1978, and grant eligibility to all members of the Women's Royal Australian Naval Service, the Australian Women's Army Service, the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force, the Australian Army Medical Women's Service, and the Voluntary Aid Detachment of 1939-45 War.</PARA>

<PARA> That the decrease in Federal Government funding for health, transfer of Commonwealth responsibility to the States, application of the 'user' pay principle to health services and encouragement of private business and profits in the health sphere will inevitably lead to a downgrading of health services and increasing health risks among people who cannot afford health insurance or private payment of doctors and hospitals.</PARA>

<PARA> 1. The majority of Pensioners in Nursing Homes are currently not receiving any significant rebate after all fees and laundry expenses are paid. This situation does not allow for a basically acceptable quality of life and undermines the dignity of people who are unable to fend for themselves.

<PARA> 2. When Residents of Nursing Homes go to stay with Friends or Relatives for short periods (e.g. weekends) they are compelled to pay the Commonwealth subsidy for the period of their absence. This expense is obviously not able to be met by the majority of Nursing Home Residents or their Friends and Relatives. The result is that people who would benefit from short periods away from the Nursing Home are restricted to its confines because they are not in the position to pay for their release. This situation causes emotional trauma on festive occasions such as Christmas and Birthdays.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is addressed to the Treasurer, concerns the balance of payments statistics for the September quarter released today, which show a dramatic deterioration with a record quarterly total deficit of $1.1 billion and a record quarterly current account deficit of $2.3 billion. I ask: In view of the fact that the Budget strategy was for a surplus on net private foreign exchange transactions to account for 45 per cent of the targeted money supply growth this year, and that so far no such surplus exists-indeed, there is a substantial deficit-does the Treasurer agree that his Budget strategy is rapidly falling apart? What action does he intend to take to rectify this situation and so ensure that the absence of money supply growth from external sources does not result in a massive credit squeeze?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome that question from the honourable member for Gellibrand as it gives me an opportunity of saying that I do not for a moment accept, as does the honourable member, that because of those developments on the external account the Budget strategy is in any way falling apart or in disarray. The Budget strategy was fundamentally to control inflation by the effective use, amongst other things, of firm monetary policy. The fact is that a smaller surplus of private sector foreign exchange transactions, so far from making that task more difficult, makes that task a little more easy to achieve. The effect of that situation is that it will not be necessary to place such severe limits on domestic credit creation that might have been the case if the volume of private sector exchange transactions was as great as the honourable gentleman suggests that the Budget assumed them to be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There has been a much larger current account deficit during the first three months of this financial year than we thought likely when the Budget was put together. The volume of private capital inflow has been about the same in the September quarter 1981 as it was in the September quarter 1980. But exports have been a lot weaker, partly due to a continuing coal strike in Queensland, the effects of a shipping dispute which has affected many of the ports around Australia, and also extremely sluggish world trade conditions. The volume of imports has continued to grow very rapidly. Because of strong domestic economic growth in Australia, as anybody with an elementary understanding of these things would know, the first thing that happens when one gets sustained economy recovery is that imports rise very sharply. That is one of the reasons why the current account deficit has been larger than we anticipated.</PARA>
<PARA> I repeat that these assumptions that are made when Budgets are put together are nothing more than the best calculations and predictions that can be made at the time. They are subject to great volatility and great change. The important thing to remember is that if private capital inflow turns out to be lower than one anticipates it means that other policy adjustments can be made which can still make it possible to achieve quite easily the money supply target we have in mind and thus achieve the Budget strategy, which is a reduction in inflation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Prime Minister to this morning's Sydney Morning Herald article by Mr Graham Williams. Is the Prime Minister aware that this article quotes calculations by Mr Eric Risstrom of the Australian Taxpayers Association pointing out that a single income family with two dependent children is paying up to 81 per cent more tax in real terms than six years ago? Is the Prime Minister also aware that this same set of calculations shows that a one-income family on average weekly earnings is paying $26 a week more in tax than it would have had the 1975 tax system been retained? Is it a fact that in 1975 the Prime Minister promised to reduce the tax burden? How does that promise compare with the reality of the vastly increased tax burden for one-income families, who will also be paying an extra $4 a week in sales taxes if the proposed increases are not abandoned? When can the Australian people expect action from this Government on real tax reform rather than the promise of a tax cut every time the Prime Minister's leadership looks shaky?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have had a very quick look at that article and, as the honourable gentleman would expect, I am having a very careful analysis made of the many calculations contained in it. I do not have all those calculations to supply to the honourable gentleman, but when I do have them I will supply them to him and to the House. However, a couple of comments can be made. Firstly, the article makes comparisons about percentage rises in tax without looking sufficiently at the after-tax income position of people at different levels of income. Obviously if real incomes are rising, as they have been, particularly over the past 12 months or 18 months, then percentages of taxation will rise. Those sorts of straight comparisons do not really give anybody a very careful indication of just where true comparisons lie.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One statistic that does stick out very much on this issue is that the total amount of money taken out of the Australian community as a percentage of the gross national product by the Commonwealth Government by way of both taxation and borrowings in 1981-82, according to the Budget, will be a lower figure than the volume so taken by the Commonwealth government out of the Australian community as a percentage of GDP in terms of both taxation and borrowings in the Budget of the Leader of the Opposition when he was Treasurer.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no doubt that there is an obligation on the Government to provide services which cannot reasonably be provided by the private sector. However, Telecom Australia and Australia Post are both major statutory authorities which have quite significant involvement in areas in which private enterprise is already involved. It is the objective of the Government to provide the best possible facilities, which are socially and geographically essential in both the postal and telecommunications areas. Whether this occurs as a result of a change in the overall structure of Telecom or otherwise will be largely a matter for consideration of recommendations by the committee now constituted under Mr Jim Davidson which is inquiring into Telecom. Until that report is received, of course, no major changes or decisions will be taken.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The consequences of the report, however, will be significantly designed not to prejudice necessary services to the Australian public.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government has been concerned about the continuing waterfront and maritime dispute that has been plaguing the waterfront in Australia for most of this year. Indeed, there has not been a day during this year in which there has not been a major dispute on the waterfront in this country. The Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for National Development and Energy, the Minister for Industrial Relations and I met with the shipowners about three weeks ago, and there have been meetings between the shipowners and the maritime unions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On 7 October the Minister for Industrial Relations, the Minister for National Development and Energy and I had a meeting with representatives of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the maritime unions to discuss the whole range of problems that have been at the root of the industrial trouble that is causing enormous losses to Australian export trade. As a result of those discussions I am reasonably confident that the maritime unions will endeavour to bring to an end the ban that has applied on the flag of convenience ships. They were reminded, of course, that the Government acted in good faith last year to set up, under the chairmanship of Sir John Crawford, a joint committee between the Australian shipowners and the maritime unions to bring a report to the Government on the revitalisation of the Australian shipping industry. We expect to receive that report by the end of October.</PARA>
<PARA> One would have thought that the maritime unions and the industry generally would have endeavoured to bring about a reasonable environment in which the Government could give consideration to any recommendations that might flow from that report. Quite obviously, the Australian community generally, apart from the industries concerned, has suffered greatly as a result of these continuing disputes. I hope that the leaders of the unions and the ACTU will act with responsibility as a result of the discussions that we have had.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the honourable member is prepared to use annual figures I am quite happy to accommodate him in that regard. He asks me to state what the present situation is on annual figures. I will proceed to do so with respect to unemployment. In the year to September 1981 there was a fall of 5,700 so far as full time unemployment was concerned. This is the lowest rate of unemployment for September for four years on a full time unemployment basis. With respect to those seeking part time employment, the number was likewise the lowest figure for four years. The honourable member may be also well aware of the fact that in relation to youth unemployment there was, again, a very substantial drop in the year-on-year figures. There was a fall of some 24 per cent in the number of 15 to 19 year olds seeking their first jobs. With respect to all teenagers seeking full time employment there was a drop of some 18 per cent. The position with respect to the overall employment situation is encouraging as it has been for the last two years. There has, in fact, been a growth of some 5 per cent in employment in Australia which is extremely healthy.</PARA></TALK.START>

The honourable member said there is no doubt that if wages do explode too quickly that can have adverse economic impacts on unemployment. He can certainly say that again.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the answer to the honourable gentleman's question, which is a fair one, is that the potential that I was referring to in the Budget Speech pays regard to the fact that there are part-year and full-year effects of the sales tax measures. This year's Budget, of course, has the part-year effect from the night of the Budget in respect of some of the sales tax measures and from only 1 January in respect of the extension of the sales tax measures to items presently not covered by wholesale sales tax. So if one looks at it in a straight mathematic sense, one must look at the full year gain to the revenue that the new sales tax measures will yield-that represents $800m to $900m-versus about $400m-do not hold me to that figure; I would like to check it-in the current year. I think the honourable member should also be reminded that this year, for the first year for, I think, 12 years, there is a full additional payday which represents an addition to our expenditures of over one per cent in real terms, about $450m. So without in any way trying to speculate about the quantum of any taxation relief that might be available in future years, when I referred to scope and potential for personal tax reductions in future years, I very much had in mind, as the Government had in mind, the fact that with the full year effect of the sales tax measures our capacity to move in other areas would be greater given the right economic circumstances. Overwhelmingly we would have, through those sales tax measures, a more appropriate taxation mix in our community.</PARA></TALK.START>

In a full year the additional cost of those changed rental subsidy arrangements is, I am reminded by the Treasurer, about $50m in that one area alone.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister for Communications to his announcement on 23 September that Mr Malcolm King would be a member of the Government's committee of inquiry into the extent to which private enterprise could be more widely involved in the provision of telecommunications services. Was Mr King employed by the Government during 1980 and 1981 as a consultant to inquire into the respective roles of Telecom Australia and the private sector in the provision of telecommunications equipment? Did his consultancy cost $17,500? Was Mr King deputy general manager of CSR Ltd and a director between 1972 and 1980? Is CSR a member of the Business Telecommunications Services Pty Ltd consortium which is seeking a share of the private sector equity in the proposed domestic communications satellite? Did the original interdepartmental committee proposal on the satellite recommend that BTS Ltd be a participant in that private sector equity? Does Mr King still hold 2,952 CSR shares? Has the Minister's attention been drawn to the statement by Mr E. E. Payne, Acting Secretary of his Department, in reply to questions at the Senate Estimates Committee hearing that he did not know whether CSR had any interests in the provision of telecommunications equipment? Under these circumstances is it a fact that CSR does have a clear interest in the provision of telecommunications equipment and services? Will the Minister, therefore, acknowledge that Mr Payne's professed ignorance of this fact is implausible? Finally, will the Minister acknowledge that Mr King's consultancy and membership of the Government committee involved him in a clear conflict between his private interests and his public duty?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5E4">Mr SINCLAIR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I deplore the habit of the Leader of the Opposition of trying to debunk individuals and besmirch their names. As far as Mr Malcolm King is concerned, the normal procedure, I understand, would have been for this question to be put on the Notice Paper. However, because it has been asked I believe it proper and appropriate that I answer it now, without notice. I have no idea what shareholding Mr King has in CSR. If the figures are as the Leader of the Opposition suggests, I believe that would have no bearing at all on the policies of CSR, given the size of its present equity holding. It is true that Mr King was formerly Deputy General Manager of CSR, but he was not an employee of CSR at any time while he was an employee of the Government. In other words, he was no longer Deputy General Manager of CSR at the time when he was acting as a consultant to the Department of Communications giving advice on the degree to which there might be some broadening of the private sector's involvement in the provision of telecommunication facilities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the course of Mr King's employment as a consultant, he has provided a series of advisings to the Department. However, it has been thought appropriate, given the nature of the inquiry now to be conducted by Mr Davidson, that Mr King's report and his recommendations should be absorbed in that wider inquiry. It is felt, given the circumstances of the inquiry and the fact that it is necessary to ensure that there be a completely dispassionate assessment of the area in which there can be a maximisation of the funding of these telecommunications services and the extent to which the private sector might be involved, that it was better for Mr King's final report to be a matter for consideration by the Davidson inquiry. Of course, Mr King is a member of that inquiring group. As far as the Government is concerned, I am not aware of any conflict of interest which Mr King suffers and which would in any way prejudice him or the advisings he has made available to the Government. I believe that the involvement of CSR in BTS or in any other company involved in communications has no continued relationship to Mr King or to his employment as a consultant by the Government.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0K4">Mr WILSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the first published report of the Advisory Committee, which was appointed in December 1978. It describes the activities undertaken by the Committee in its first full year of operation. Honourable members will recall that the Australian Biological Resources Study is a program to describe and name the Australian flora and fauna and to gather information on their taxonomy and distribution. It is co-ordinated by the Bureau of Flora and Fauna, which is now part of the Environment Division of my Department. The Government increased its support for the ABRS program last year and again this year because it is convinced of the importance and the urgency of increasing our knowledge of the flora and fauna, not only for their great scientific interest but also because the knowledge is badly needed for economic and conservation purposes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This 1980 report deals with recommendations rather than with results, but in 1981 we have begun to see a very significant output from the ABRS program. On 22 August I had the opportunity of attending the thirteenth International Botanical Congress in Sydney to launch the first major project of ABRS, the first volume of the new Flora of Australia. This work will comprise more than 50 volumes describing all Australian plant species. The first volume has been highly acclaimed by many of the distinguished overseas and Australian botanists attending the Congress. The project is proving to be a most successful exercise in Commonwealth-State co-operation. Already over 20 State government botanists are collaborating with the Bureau of Flora and Fauna in writing the flora. When one considers that we know about 20,000 different species of flowering plants in Australia-and are still discovering new ones-one will realise that such co-operation is necessary to what is in every sense a national project. It is a tremendous task, but it is essential to have all our flora and fauna properly described and named-a project that will require government support for many years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The Australian Biological Resources Study was established in 1973 by the Whitlam Labor Government to fill the pressing need to identify properly Australia's fauna and flora. As the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (Mr Wilson) has said, the Advisory Committee of the Study was appointed in December 1978 by the present Government. With the increased interest in the environment in the late 1960s and early 1970s taxonomy-that is, the naming of organisms-became an essential part of the study of the environment. The objectives of the Australian Biological Resources Study are set out in the report as follows: To co-ordinate all work aimed at collecting, describing, and classifying Australian plants and animals and determining their distributions; to maintain comprehensive information on and provide professional evaluation of national taxonomic collections; to establish priorities; to establish and maintain a national network of biotaxonomic data banks; to record and collate information on flora and fauna collected when geographical areas have been studied or surveyed in any way; and, lastly, to co-ordinate publication of a systematic series of flora and fauna handbooks and to prepare co-ordinating index volumes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Funding for this program under the previous Labor Government was progressively increased until 1975-76 when the Australian Biological Resources Study received $806,000 in 1981 values. The present Government saw no need to maintain funding, so it slashed this figure in half in the 1976-77 Budget and then continued to cut funding in real terms until this financial year. These cuts were disastrous. This is illustrated by the Advisory Committee's comment in the 1979-80 annual report, which states:</PARA>
<PARA>The task of setting preferred objectives was made difficult by the urgent need to increase knowledge of almost all components of the flora and fauna. Bearing in mind the funds available ($192 000 in 1979-80), and the resources available in the Bureau of Flora and Fauna for the processing of grant proposals, the Committee invited applications within very restricted fields. </PARA>
<PARA>The advisory committee must have had a major influence on the Government because the Government decided to treble funding in 1980-81, and this year has raised fundings back to the Whitlam levels. The Minister, in his speech a moment ago, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government . . . is convinced of the importance of the urgency of increasing our knowledge of the flora and fauna, not only for their great scientific interest but also because the knowledge is badly needed for economic and for conservation purposes. </PARA>
<PARA>It is obvious that with increasing stresses on the environment from resource development, urbanisation, primary industry and so on, the knowledge produced by the Australian Biological Resources Study will be ever more important. The Australian Labor Party firmly supports this essential program and we call upon the Government to continue present levels of funding in real terms. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the field of high technology Australia is strictly an occupied territory. Australia is reverting to the colonial model of technology transfer which we adopted in the nineteenth century. In 1835 the inhabitants of Melbourne traded a primary resource-their land and water-in exchange for beads, mirrors and tomahawks offered by John Batman, and 146 years later things have not changed very much. Australians are still selling our natural resources-things dug up out of the ground-in return for manufactured goods and increasingly sophisticated services which we are increasingly unable or unwilling to provide for ourselves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whilst we are not satisfied now with beads, tomahawks and mirrors-we have more sophisticated technology than that-we still seem to be unwilling and unable to provide the necessary intellectual investment that ensures that we are producing these goods ourselves. Unlike the Swedes, the Japanese or the Americans we have pulled back from ownership, control or even, in many cases, participation in high technology industries. Only Canada, of all technologically advanced nations, and New Zealand, of nations somewhat technologically less advanced, have as bad a record as Australia in respect of the foreign control of high technology industries. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Bureau of Statistics report Foreign Ownership and Control in Manufacturing Industry 1972-73, published in October 1976, is unfortunately the most recent analysis available of foreign ownership. It is overwhelmingly probable that the situation has deteriorated since then. Given the policies of the Fraser Government there is no way in which Australia could have increased its control of its own economy. We are still continuing to sell out the farm. The figures indicate how far the Government has gone in permitting the selling out of the national interest. The figures in the report relate to value added, that is the total value of all goods and services added as part of the production process. The tables give both the percentage of foreign ownership, that is the paid up value of the market shares and, even more important, the degree of foreign control. Even an equity control of only 25 per cent of shares in a single pair of foreign hands can ensure control. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer honourable members to the table. This is the order in which the Australian Standard Industrial Classification appears: Plastics material, synthetic resins and rubbers, $69m value added, foreign ownership 79.5 per cent, effective foreign control 94.3 per cent; organic industrial chemicals n.e.c.-not elsewhere classified-$46.3m value added, 71.1 per cent foreign ownership, foreign control 75.2 per cent; total basic chemicals $292.7m value added, 58 per cent foreign ownership, 78 per cent foreign control; pharmaceutical and veterinary products $140.8m value added, 76.3 per cent foreign ownership, foreign control 77.8 per cent; pesticides and agricultural chemicals $18.7m value added, 72.5 per cent foreign ownership, 85.7 per cent foreign control; cosmetic and toilet preparations $61.6 value added, 89.1 per cent foreign ownership, 91 per cent foreign control; petroleum refining, foreign ownership 90.8 per cent, and the degree of foreign control is not given in this table but one might assume it to be 100 per cent; rolling, drawing and extruding of aluminium 91.2 per cent foreign control; motor vehicles, perhaps the most significant figure of all, $424.6m value added, foreign ownership 98.8 per cent-the 1.2 per cent outstanding presumably being the Australian equity holding in Australian Motor Industries Ltd-foreign control 99.8 per cent; photographic goods, optical instruments and film processing 57.8 per cent foreign control; television, radios and electronic equipment, 69.3 per cent foreign control; construction and earth moving equipment-something we would think that within Australia we ought to have control of ourselves-59.9 per cent foreign control; and so it goes on. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1972-73 document does not give the figure for foreign control of the computing industry. I have asked specifically in a question on notice that we be given that figure because we do not know the precise amount of value added in computers in Australia but we do know of the industry within Australia that 92.7 per cent of purchases are from foreign sources. I draw the attention of honourable members to the remarks of the Governor-General in his introduction to the booklet Technological Change-Impact of Information Technology 1981. He wrote:</PARA>
<PARA> The 1960s and 1970s in Australia saw advanced technology, in the form of information processing equipment, become a major import. This type of import, it is said, could well become Australia's largest in the decade of the 1980s unless concrete steps are taken very soon. Information technology giving facts, and often more than that, 'interpretation' and 'analyses', has become a major tool in the further development and even the maintenance of an industrial capacity in western societies. Australia is rapidly becoming totally dependent on imports for the supply of its information technology. Increasingly it is said, the technology being imported requires specialised overseas training for its maintenance and even the supply of spare parts from overseas. The situation is said to exist where it is either economically or technically essential for some sub-assemblies to be repaired overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> This raises questions of policy; I point only to the problems which this generates for a society dependent in many vital and sensitive areas on operating computers. What if sources of supply are threatened in an international crisis? This directs attention to the vulnerability of a computerised society, about which the Chairman of the Australian Law Reform Commission, Mr Justice Kirby, has recently spoken. He has referred to a Swedish government report which I have seen and which examines some aspects of vulnerability. There is the threat of acts of war-capture the computer centres, says the report, and you capture the society which depends on them; there is the vulnerability to acts of terrorism to which such installations are susceptible and which have occurred in parts of Europe. There are the risks from disasters and accidents. The dislocation of sensitive systems can have adverse effects on production and operating systems and the Swedish report points to the need to devise strategies to prevent excessive functional and geographic concentration of sensitive and vulnerable data bases. As a society becomes increasingly dependent in its public and private operations on computers, these concerns assume increasing importance. </PARA>
<PARA>It is extraordinary and shaming to recollect that Australia was one of the earliest nations into the computer industry and then we abandoned any decisive role in it. Australia produced one of the earliest first-generation computers, originally called CSIRO Mark I Automatic Computer, later renamed CSIRAC. It was probably the fourth or fifth stored-program computer in the world. CSIRAC was designed in 1947 by Maston Beard and Trevor Pearcey, who both worked for CSIRO's Division of Radio Physics in Sydney, had its first test run in 1949 and was fully operational by early 1951. At that stage only the United States of America and Great Britain were running their own computers. CSIRAC was used by the CSIRO until 1956, when it was transferred to the University of Melbourne and remained in use until 1964, when it was handed over to the Science Museum of Victoria, which hid it away in a store. </PARA>
<PARA> A conscious political decision was made not to develop Australia's potential for designing and manufacturing mainframe computers and a decision was made to buy that equipment off the shelf. The CSIRO preferred to put its funds into radio astronomy and rain making experiments. If a choice had to be made, that choice had a rational basis. The tragedy was that short-sightedness by the Menzies Government in starving research and development forced a choice to be made and Australia lost an opportunity to take a leading role in the development of the computer industry. Even worse, Australia has been forced into total dependence on overseas computer suppliers, mostly from the United States and Japan. For every $1 spent in Australia on computer equipment, $14 is spent on imports. No other technologically advanced nation has such an unfavourable ratio of imports to local supplies. </PARA>
<PARA> There is some local manufacture of components by AWA and Philips and several firms have designed and assembled their own small mainframe computers for specialised use: For example, Hartley Computer Applications Pty Ltd of Brisbane and Computer Manufacture and Design Pty Ltd of Melbourne. Electronics Research Australia Pty Ltd is now moving from Canberra to Brisbane. There is also D. D. Webster Electronics Pty Ltd of Melbourne. Fairchild and National Semiconductor, two of the Silicon Valley giants, both set up small facilities in Victoria for making components in the 1960s. Both were closed after the 25 per cent tariff cuts of 1973. In 1981 National Semiconductor-Natsemi-was offered by the Fraser Government a $19m inducement to carry out a feasibility study into setting up a silicon wafer fabrication plant, not a chip plant, in Canberra. Trevor Pearcey, the father of computing in Australia, has called that 'a tragic mistake'. </PARA>
<PARA> This is exactly the same story as we had with General Motors-Holden's Ltd. We once had, believe it or not, something called 'Australia's own car'. But by the 1980s Australian motor manufacture was essentially derivative, even parasitic, with engines designed in Europe and bodies designed in Japan. Sir Laurence Harnett's book Big Wheels and Little Wheels has described how the indigenous Australian motor industry was absorbed into the global industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is being deindustrialised by the Fraser Government, which has undermined much of our technological capacity by a quisling-like approach which asserts that Australia's best interests are served by taking a subordinate role in a global economy. If this policy were taken to extremes, as seems likely, Australia would be confined to the supply of raw materials. Small nations would be converted into completely sterile and derivative societies marked by the downgrading of intellectual capacity and competence. The work force would become progressively deskilled and dominated by the performance of routine service jobs by a servile army of wood and water joeys.</PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members will be relieved to hear that I do not intend inflicting my excruciating French on the House, but President Mitterrand stated recently:</PARA>
<PARA>France's future lies in the exploration of unsuspected layers of our intelligence. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a very profound remark. I do not think the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Thomson) would be prepared to make such a remark here. In Australia we have the persistent, deliberate, the quisling-like winding down of our national intellectual capacity. This is the Government which has cut back in real terms on research and development. In a world context Australia is already in an extraordinarily vulnerable position in high technology areas where the commanding heights-computers, plastics, pharmaceuticals, petrol and petrochemicals, electronics, motor manufacturing-are completely in foreign hands. The fact that we are merely standing still in the areas of science and technology where other nations-the United States of America, Japan, USSR, West Germany, France, Italy and even Great Britain-are spending increasing amounts of their annual budgets represents an effective decline for us. We are standing still on a descending escalator. </PARA>
<PARA> In the recent Budget only 0.9 per cent of the total government outlays are on research and development, a figure which is admittedly higher than it was at its nadir in 1977-78, when it was 0.7 per cent. But in terms of world competition we are not doing well. I think that largely reflects the bullying attitude which the Treasury takes towards the Department of Science and Technology. Science and Technology is inevitably an interventionist department. It has to be. The only basis for its existence is its view that its activities cannot rely on market forces alone. It was said that the Minister's moderate success, on which I congratulate him, in making sure that the Budget was not an utter disaster for research and development was a victory like Dunkirk. It was not a victory like Stalingrad or El Alamein; at least Science and Technology survived and may survive to fight again. Under a Labor government this Department will be fighting very vigorously. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to recognise that the most important element in the economies of the nations with the highest living standards is education. We cannot allow our educational base to wind down and expect that we can develop and expand at the same time. A country cannot contract in this area and expand its output simultaneously. I hope that the Government will recognise the extreme importance of Australia rejecting its overwhelming dependence on foreign controlled technology and that it will try to follow the advice of Sir John McEwen and buy back the farm. </PARA>

<PARA> The main aim of the Government has been to improve the economy of Australia. In that we are succeeding magnificently. We have now undone the damage which was caused by the Labor Government's policies between 1972 and 1975. Only by having a strong economic base will we improve our high technology industries. Of course, a great deal has to be done. Of course we have weaknesses in the structure. But that is because of history as much as anything else. It was interesting to hear the honourable member's comments on the car industry in Australia. A Labor government under Chifley invited the General Motors Corporation to take over Australia's indigenous car industry. He stated also that two firms from Silicon Valley had set up in Victoria and they had shut down after the Labor Government's disastrous 25 per cent across the board tariff cuts-</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZS7">Mr THOMSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Leaving nothing behind. That was because of the short-sighted policies of the Labor Government. This Government has a strong commitment to the development of greater Australian investment in high technology industries. There are several reasons for this. Firstly, many of our industries are directly competing with overseas countries and we must match production facilities in Australia. Secondly, all the projections indicate that on a world basis a number of high technology industrial areas are likely to experience very strong growth. Biotechnology, which I know is of great interest to the honourable member for Lalor, is one of those. I will mention that later. Thirdly, many high technology Australian companies can sell on a world market rather than a local one. I will mention some cases of that. Fourthly-this is important-history shows that technological advances generally lead to improved standards of living, better working conditions and more jobs. That is what the Government's policies are aiming for at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As one of the smaller industrialised countries we are naturally a net importer of technology. It is interesting that Japan and Germany are often quoted as successful, industrial technological countries. One of the factors contributing to their success has been their readiness to go out and import technology, and to buy patents and licences from other countries. They have spent six times more money taking in patents and licences than they have actually sold. They have succeeded. We have to do the same thing. As the honourable member knows, an inquiry into the whole patent system which will decide what is best for Australia is continuing at the moment. That is the aim of that inquiry. We cannot view high technology industries just as an internal matter. It is a world-wide situation. Where there is ready access to patents and licences and freedom to exchange ideas we will prosper. We have to look outwards, and import technology where it is necessary. We cannot always restrict our industries to Australian inventions. It would be very nice if we could. We must concentrate on the things in which we have an economic advantage. There are many of those. Reprocessing of our raw materials is just one of them. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's economic policy is aimed at establishing an environment which is favourable for business. That is a very different policy from that which was pursued by the Labor Government. It must be favourable to business prosperity to improve our international competitiveness; those are two very important things. In this environment, many Australian firms have been able to succeed on world markets with products and processes which are innovative and technically sophisticated. The importance of overall economic activity in the promotion of high technology industries can be seen in some overseas figures. In the United States of America in 1969 200 technology-based companies went public. When the United States economy faced a downturn in 1974, only four high technology companies went public. That vindicates the Government's emphasis on improving economic conditions as a whole. A strong Australian economy certainly will assure that high technology industries will be created and will thrive in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention two industries which I visited in the last week or so. One of them was in Sydney-the Nucleus group of companies-a most interesting Australian group of companies, which specialises in the manufacture and distribution of high technology products, advanced medical products, diagnostic ultra-sound equipment and heart stimulators, most of them very complex, micro-electronic products. It employs about 800 people world wide and it has annual sales of about $50m. It is interesting to see where its sales are. Thirty per cent of its sales are in the United States of America, 33 per cent in Europe, 23 per cent in Australia and 8 per cent in Asia. Most of its sales in Asia are to Japan. We are exporting high technology, electronic medical devices to Japan. That is what can be done when an Australian company goes out without protection and tariff barriers. This year the Nucleus group of companies spent about $3m on research and development. A good deal of that has come from the industrial research and development grants administered by my Department. It is one of the greatest success stories of those grants. </PARA>
<PARA> The second company I visited was F. H. Faulding and Co. Ltd in Adelaide. It has just signed agreements with two major overseas companies to export $50m worth of an antibiotic drug which it makes called erithomycin. It has perfected a process which overcame a problem which had prevented the general use of this drug. I repeat that its sales in this drug in the next year will be $50m. It is interesting to note that that company told me that the company in the United States, to whom it had given a licence to sell its product, has 800 highly qualified salesmen all, I believe, with academic degrees going round the States to sell its products in the next couple of weeks. That just shows what two companies can do-one in a high technology micro-electronic world and the other in the medical world-by innovativeness, research and development and by get up and go. This has been made possible by the Government's policies to encourage such activities, to encourage industrial research and development, to encourage industries which are efficient and innovative, internationally competitive and export oriented. Of course, not every company in Australia is as good as that but there are examples which the rest of Australia could well follow. </PARA>
<PARA> Our manufacturing industry will certainly expand as will our mineral and energy-based industries. The manufacturing industry needs to embrace new technologies if it is to improve its productivity and create new products. We must have policies and programs designed to give Australian industries the capability to evaluate foreign technology to ensure that we are in a position to use the technology which best suits our requirements. Against this background, Australia's foreign investment policy has a positive effect on new technology. The policy does this in two ways: These are by facilitating the introduction of advanced overseas technology and by providing the stimulus for Australian industry to compete technologically with overseas firms. In considering foreign investment proposals, the Government expects significant economic benefits and/or significant equity before approvals are granted. I believe the Foreign Investment Review Board is doing a good job in this field.</PARA>
<PARA> As the honourable member for Lalor knows, takeovers of existing Australian businesses come within the scope of the Foreign Takeovers Act. Where local technology is an important asset of the target business, the proposed takeover is examined very carefully indeed. The Government must ensure that the potential benefits to Australia of this technology transfer are maximised. In proposals to establish new high technology firms, the Government will ensure Ausralian participation and a share of the benefits from the use of that technology. This is a fairly slow process. It is speeding up now and there are very encouraging signs. Foreign investment policies recognise that national economies are interdependent and that there needs to be a transfer of technology across national boundaries. We cannot afford to re-invent the wheel. The honourable member for Lalor well knows that the Government's policy is one of 50 per cent Australian ownership where this is possible. </PARA>

We have spent $50m this year. We are trying to persuade private industry to spend much more money on industrial research and development.

I would very much welcome the support of the honourable member for Lalor and the Opposition in this area. I am sure I will have it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are other ways in which we are helping to support high technology industries. The special public interest projects administered by my Department under the Industrial Research and Development Grants Act are one way. The bionic ear, which has possibilities for a large export market, is one of the most exciting of these ways. It must be realised that all the considerations which surround the import and transfer of technology are very complex. They are not ones that a government can handle. They have to be handled by private enterprise selecting the technology most suitable for its needs and then proceeding to negotiate the terms and conditions. The major justification for government intervention is when restrictions are placed on the use of technology which adversely affect other government policies. </PARA>
<PARA> If I had time, I would speak about venture capital, which is a very important part of the whole problem. The Government's policies will ensure an environment which is conducive to the development of high technology industries. We must use all our resources, including our most important resource, the Australian people. We have a highly educated work force. We must put people to work as much as possible in high technology industries. The Government has created policies and programs to ensure that Australia is in a position to develop and use new technologies. We have an economic environment which will lead to the establishment of new high technology industries. I mentioned two, the Nucleus group of companies and F. H. Faulding and Co. Ltd. There is no doubt that the result will be an improvement in the overall strength of industry, particularly its economic capacity. This will enable industry to control its own destiny and to take advantage of research developments which best suit Australia. </PARA>

This Government lacks any concept of what constitutes the long term national interest in the area of science and technology. It has failed to promote the establishment of Australian based and Australian owned high technology industries and to change Australia's adverse position on technology transfer. We have a long tradition of avoiding the challenge of developing our own indigenous technology and we have relied upon technology transfer. The sell-out to foreign investment by post-war conservative governments has cost us dearly. The distribution of wealth and income in our community is becoming more lopsided every day. On the other hand, we could follow the path of many European countries, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia and develop our own corporations with minimal dependence on foreign equity. We could use our strength as a major supplier of raw material to strike a better bargain from foreign investment proposals. We have failed to do so. We could insist on the transfer of technology to Australian control as the price for exploitation of our resources. We could insist on more processing, research and development being done in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What is happening to research and development in this country? The figures speak for themselves. Between 1973-74 and 1976-77 gross expenditure on research and development in Australia as a percentage of gross domestic product fell from 1.29 per cent to 0.97 per cent, a reduction of 25 per cent. The government sector increased in importance as a source of funds, providing 77 per cent of the total in 1976-77, compared with 63 per cent in 1973-74. The business enterprise sector's contribution dropped dramatically from providing 35 per cent of total expenditure in 1973-74 to only 19 per cent in 1976-77. Manpower employed in research and development by private enterprise fell by 40 per cent in 1976-77 when compared with 1973-74. Australia, the poor little rich country, has fallen almost to the bottom of the list of technologically advanced nations in expenditure on research and development with a mere 0.9 per cent of Budget outlays this year. The private sector has made an absurdly small contribution. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of patents taken out each year per million people, which is the standard international test, or per $US1 billion of gross domestic product Australia ranks eighteeenth and twenty-first respectively out of 25 advanced nations. It is a disgrace. R. B. McKern in an article entitled 'Foreign Investment and Technology Transfer in the Australian Mining Industry'-the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Thomson) ought to have dwelt on this a little more than he did-points out:</PARA>
<PARA> It is significant that Australia's largest mining company, BHP, well equipped with its own research and technical facilities, found it essential to form a partnership with an overseas source of technology and experience (Esso). </PARA>
<PARA>That related to the exploitation of the Bass Strait oil and gas fields. In another case, he considered that Amax Exploration (Australia) Inc. could not find local partners to take up even the proposed 25 per cent Australian equity for its bauxite project in the Kimberleys because 'The problem was not so much a shortage of Australian capital, but rather a shortage of suitable investment vehicles: enterprises equipped with the financial, technical, marketing and entrepreneurial skills to undertake direct investment'. The substantial government supported scientific and technical resources in Australia are not geared to assist the generation of such locally owned investment vehicles. Again, this contrasts strongly with the policies of many other developing and developed nations where government funds are often spent in paying for duplication of foreign technology which could have been bought through a direct foreign investment bargain simply to avoid the constraints associated with the importation of that technology in a foreign investment package. It is a pity the Minister did not dwell on that aspect. He might point that out when he talks to the Foreign Investment Review Board. We are so far behind the rest of the world that we are getting lonely. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to market access, McKern considered that the serious delays which the two major bauxite and alumina projects planned by Australian companies encountered could be largely attributed to the inability to secure long term contracts without the equity participation of one of the alumina majors. Whilst government supported marketing agencies such as the Australian Wheat Board and the International Wool Secretariat have been established in the agricultural products field, no similar organisation has been established in the minerals area, even though Australia has enjoyed world dominance in minerals such as rutile, tantalite, zircon and monazite. </PARA>
<PARA> Technology transfer is a vital but ignored consideration in the evaluation of foreign investment. Norwegian involvement in deep sea oil exploration provides a good example of how foreign investment can be used to nurture a new domestic industry. I say briefly to the Minister that at least the Norwegian Government through statutory oil corporation, invited American oil companies to take out tenement leases in its sector of the North Sea, but one of the conditions which it laid down was that it had to transfer its technology. The first rig drilling in Russian waters was a Norwegian rig with a Norwegian crew. It is about time we did a little bit better than we are doing. </PARA>
<PARA> The aluminium industry provides a classic example in Australia, particularly after the First World War. Proposals to produce aluminium in Australia had to be shelved because of the ease with which international aluminium cartels could destroy the new local industry. Even when World War II and a world-wide shortage of aluminium forced Commonwealth involvement in aluminium production, the design and construction of a plant was delayed by the refusal of Alcoa of Australia Ltd to provide or transfer its technology. It was left, in fact, to the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, with British help, to develop an Australian designed Bayer-Hall process. An aluminium commission was formed in 1944 and extensive surveys of bauxite reserves were undertaken. A plant was finally commissioned in 1955 after five years of construction at Bell Bay. The plant was operated jointly by the Commonwealth and Tasmanian governments for several years before it was sold to two transnational corporations. Why did we feel obliged to transfer our technology when ultimately this country has been held at ransom ever since 1955? It is a national scandal. It is a national disgrace. It is a shocking indictment of Australia's foreign investment policies. </PARA>
<PARA> The same sorry story could be told about the mineral sands industry where wartime development could have provided the basis of an industry producing titanium dioxide pigment. The nature of other recent foreign investment proposals ought to concern this Government. Almost every day large, transnational oil companies are swallowing up our mineral and energy resources, whether the alternatives be coal or oil shale. Oil shale technology and oil from coal technology are obviously areas where Australia could develop a key industry if the Government were, in fact, to lead the way. What makes the situation worse is that the Federal Government seems unconcerned about the long term implications of foreign dominance of high technology and industrial research development in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Recent examples of the lack of interest of the Minister for Science and Environment and particularly the Government in promoting high technology are the Starlab project and the Interscan project. In the case of Starlab the Government has allowed a French company to provide a small sum of money needed for the feasibility study rather than provide the funds itself. It is interesting to note that Matra S.L. is one of the French companies that the Mitterrand Government is proposing to nationalise. We therefore have a situation where the French Government would be paying for the feasibility study on behalf of the Australian Government. The sell out of technology, in particular, and foreign investment has reached appalling proportions in this country. It is time that this Government put its act together. The potential in Australia of technology, science and research is enormous. What the country really needs in a depressed economic market is more government initiatives. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The spokesmen for the Australian Labor Party this afternoon completely failed in their attempts to establish a case of a threat to Australia's independence by foreign control of high technology industries-the subject of their matter of public importance. To establish that case, the spokesmen should establish three points: Firstly, that there is excessive foreign control of high technology industries; secondly, that that foreign control is a threat to Australia's independence; and, of course, thirdly and implicitly, that the Government is in some way to blame for this. Labor Party spokesmen have failed this afternoon in all three aspects. They have, of course, indicated a measure of foreign ownership of high technology industry, but in so doing they have--</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KH4">Mr Barry Jones</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A measure? There is 99.8 per cent in the motor industry. A measure?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FF4">Mr CHAPMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member refers to the motor industry and the levels of ownership of that industry. Well, certainly, a degree of high technology is involved in that industry, but a large sector of that industry does not involve high technology. It is quite false to raise that industry as a high technology industry per se and cite it as indicating something like 98 per cent or 99 per cent of high technology industry being foreign owned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the remarks of the Labor Party spokesmen, of course, they have ignored the interdependence of national economies and particularly the interdependence of the development of high technology. They have also ignored that in Australia in particular it is difficult to establish high technology industries for several reasons. Firstly, we have a small population and, therefore, a small domestic market which is geographically scattered and therefore lacks the opportunity for economies of scale to be applied. The Australian economy is also a great distance from foreign markets and that militates against our capacity to develop export markets. We have also high wages relative to those of our near neighbours. Those wages are less than offset by productivity advantages. We have also a large low cost mineral base which sustains a high exchange rate to the possible disadvantage of manufactured exports. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, a very important aspect is the negative attitude of the trade union movement. We have on the one hand the excessive wage demands of the trade union movement combined with its disastrous record of industrial unrest which encourages the introduction of labour saving technology because such technology does not go on strike. On the other hand the trade union movement has revealed militant opposition to the introduction of new technology, despite its action in hastening its introduction. This militates against its development here in Australia. This attitude was most recently evident in the proposal put to the Australian Council of Trade Unions congress whereby unions would refuse to co-operate with regard to the introduction of technological change unless unrealistic benefits were provided for their members. On the one hand we find their militant attitude to industrial matters quickens technological change whilst on the other hand their militancy prevents its development in Australia. But employers need to introduce technological change quickly because of that militant attitude so far as industrial relations are concerned. To satisfy that need quickly they will purchase the technology overseas rather than take the longer term approach, which a better industrial relations climate would allow, and develop it here in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, this fear of technology, which is evident among the trade unions, is not justified. The Bureau of Industry Economics report on the long run impact of technology on Australian industry, a report which the Bureau recently released, predicts a growth in the demand for labour in 38 occupational categories which are affected by technology, despite technological change. Indeed, that report concluded that technical change at the anticipated rate would result in more rapid economic growth, in higher per capita consumption and wage levels and in enhanced living standards for all Australians. So, the encouragement of high technology is of benefit to all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> If foreign investment is to be undertaken in high technology industry that has extensive foreign ownership and control already, the Government's foreign investment rules require significant economic benefits and/or significant Australian equity participation before approval will be granted. In cases involving foreign takeovers of Australian firms which have developed special technology, the Government seeks to ensure that some level of Australian ownership be retained or that the benefits be demonstrated sufficiently to outweigh the loss of Australian control of the technology. Takeovers of existing Australian businesses come within the scope of the Foreign Takeovers Act. Where indigenous technology is an important asset of the target business the Government will ensure that the technology is applied and developed in Australia and that the potential benefits to Australia of that technology will be maximised. In the area concerning the proposals for establishing new businesses involving the use of high technology, the Government seeks to ensure that opportunities are provided for Australian participation and that Australians share in the benefits derived from the use of that technology. High technology is important to economic growth. Therefore, the issue really to be considered is access to and application of that technology as much as its ownership and control. </PARA>
<PARA> The policy which has been consistently pursued by the Government with regard to foreign investment in this area successfully prevents excessive foreign control through those investment rules. This excessive foreign control has been prevented also by Government direct programs, programs which promote high technology industries such as the Industrial Research and Development Incentives Scheme, the support of CSIRO and other laboratories, energy research, the pilot enterprise development program and technology transfer programs. The total appropriation for science and technology under the recent Budget for this financial year is about $427m. This represents an increase of 15.6 per cent over last year-a real increase after allowing for the effects of inflation. Similarly, under the industrial research and development scheme there is a provision of $50m which, in real terms, is the same amount as last year. But the levels of support for industrial research and development programs within individual companies will rise considerably because of the large increase in ceiling payments. For example, the projects grant limit was raised to $750,000 per year, which is an increase of a quarter of a million dollars. This scheme has also been extended for a further five years. It now covers computer software, where relevant to the objects of the Act. So, the Government provides direct support in that way. It is continuing to support major industrial research projects considered to be in the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA> An amount of $700,000 will be spent on pilot programs of technology transfer and the commercial development of Australian inventions. A major component of this scheme is the technical referral network, a three-year pilot program in the metals industry. Then, of course, we come to the Government's commitment to CSIRO. Its allocation has been increased by $48.3m this year to $226.9m, an increase of 27 per cent and a real increase of great magnitude. In the direct assistance to manufacturing industry development there has been an increase of 22 per cent. So, we see this Government's commitment demonstrated by the provision of funds. </PARA>
<PARA> It is only now that the results of this positive approach by the Fraser Government are being demonstrated in the field, if one likes, by increasing Australian ownership of high technology industry. It is worth providing a few examples of these, some of which are in my own State of South Australia. Recently there has been the development of a new solar heater power project which provides a solar heating panel of over 50 per cent greater efficiency than that produced so far anywhere in the world. World patents on that project have been taken out. This panel works at an optimum of 45 degrees angle to the sun rather than 180 degrees as did previous panels. So a wall panel or a roof panel can be used which does not have to point directly at the sun. This will sell well in international markets at current prices. </PARA>
<PARA> Other examples in South Australia and of particular relevance to my electorate of Kingston are the development of an automatic grape picker and, also, an hydraulic pruner to assist the development of the grape producing and wine producing industries there. There is also the CSIRO program of very large-scale integration which aims to put 100,000 circuits on one computer chip. This is another project which has been developed in Adelaide with the direct support of the Federal Government. Then, of course, there are examples which abound from existing firms such as Sola International Pty Ltd, the lens manufacturing firm, which is, once again, located in my electorate of Kingston. This firm has succeeded in developing technology and products which have sold successfully on international markets. So, once again, we see Australian technology to the fore. The Sola company was recently bought out by Pilkington ACI Operations Pty Ltd, but by that does not lose control of its own technology. It further enhances its capacity for additional technological development. Indeed, the management of the firm and the policies of the firm and its independence have been specifically maintained under this arrangement.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Bills now before the House are reasonably non-controversial, with one exception and that is the Income Tax (Individuals) Bill. This Bill is a machinery measure to formally impose the rates of personal income tax for 1981-82 at rates declared in the Income Tax (Rates) Act. The other two Bills are the Income Tax (Companies, Corporate Unit Trusts and Superannuation Funds) Bill 1981 and the Income Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3). The first of those two Bills is also a machinery Bill to formally impose tax for 1981-82 on the 1980-81 incomes of companies, superannuation funds and some unit trusts at 46c in the dollar. The Income Tax Laws Amendment Bill contains a number of measures which, in summary, are: It expands tax deductibility to the Victorian Arts Centre Trust and funds established to observe the International Year of Disabled Persons; it revises the form of assessing tax on friendly society dispensaries; it sets the basis for calculation of provisional tax for 1981-82; it reduces the rate at which mining companies can write off their capital expenditure, other than plant and machinery, incurred in developing a mine or an oil field; and it eliminates the use of public unit trusts by companies as a means of avoiding company tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition's attitude to these Bills is that we do not oppose the Income Tax Laws Amendment Bill or the Income Tax (Companies, Corporate Unit Trusts and Superannuation Funds) Bill. We do, however, oppose the Income Tax (Individuals) Bill. We oppose that Bill because it imposes an income tax burden which, for the great majority of taxpayers, is the heaviest such burden ever in our history. Total income tax to be paid by pay-as-you-earn taxpayers in 1981-82 is, as the Budget Papers show, to increase by 22 per cent on the assumption of an increase in employment of 2 per cent and an increase in average weekly earnings of 13 1/2 per cent. So, with pay up 13 1/2 per cent and employment up 2 per cent, that is a 15 1/2 per cent increase in total incomes by wage and salary earners, but total tax paid by wage and salary earners is to go up by 22 per cent. It is quite clear from that simple arithmetic that the burden of income tax which is imposed by the Bill now before the House is to increase considerably in the course of this year. That, of course, is absolutely nothing new. It has happened in almost every year in which the Fraser Government has been in office. There has been a quite considerable increase in the income tax burden, particularly for those on lower and middle incomes, in the course of this Government's period of office. In almost every year in which it has been in office such an increase has occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> The way in which it occurs this year is by the Government's decision to apply only half tax indexation. Tax indexation was introduced by the Fraser Government with an enormous flourish in its early years of office. Tax indexation is that process by which the tax scales are adjusted in line with inflation so that people whose incomes are keeping up with inflation do not, simply by that process of having their incomes increased with inflation, move into higher tax brackets as would be the case in a progressive income tax system if no adjustments occurred. In no year of the Fraser Government has there, in fact, been full tax indexation although, supposedly, full tax indexation applied initially. Various discountings have been made over the years, but now we have reached the stage where, this year, there is to be half tax indexation and, next year, no tax indexation whatever. The relevant point for the House at the very present time is that the tax rates which are to be imposed on individuals this year by this legislation are rates and a schedule which result from the application of only half tax indexation. In fact, it is less than half tax indexation if one takes account of the discounting factor involved. </PARA>
<PARA> Previously this year there has been a long discussion on this subject. I do not intend to delay the House by going, in great detail, into the subject of tax indexation again, except to make the point, as I have already done, that the application of less than half tax indexation inevitably means that unless there is some other discretionary change in the tax schedule, those whose incomes are simply increasing in line with inflation, or are greater or less than inflation-as long as they are increasing-will pay a higher proportion of their incomes in income tax with a progressive tax schedule. The impact of that is shown by the tremendous increase in the income tax burden which clearly occurs this year with the 22 per cent increase for pay-as-you-earn taxpayers as against a 15 1/2 per cent increase in their income and also if one looks at what has happened over the course of the Fraser Government's period of office. In fact, if we go back and have a look at the past six years we see that the income tax burden for 97 per cent of all taxpayers is higher now than it was in 1975-76. Single taxpayers, all those people whose incomes have risen at the rate of average weekly earnings and who now earn less than $31,000 per annum, to take a round figure, will pay more of their income in income tax this year than in 1975-76. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course the $31,000 cut-off point is extraordinarily important because clearly the vast majority of taxpayers earn less than $31,000. Undoubtedly all taxpayers below that level, those whose incomes are doing no more than keeping pace with average weekly earnings, move into higher tax brackets and pay more of their incomes in tax. Quite obviously, the vast majority of taxpayers are in that situation. On our calculations, 97 per cent of taxpayers earn less than $31,000 a year; so they will pay a higher proportion of their incomes in income tax this year than they paid in 1975-76. Of course, as we go down the line from $31,000 the increase in the tax burden becomes greater. It is not some even application which suddenly cuts out at $31,000. Lower income earners pay the greatest increase in the income tax burden. A taxpayer who was on a very high income-say, $50,000 in 1975-76-and whose income increased in line with average weekly earnings, this year would earn $94,000. But his tax would be reduced by about $43 a week compared with what it would have been had he paid the same proportion of his income in income tax as he paid in 1975-76. So there are large tax concessions for very high income earners, assuming of course that people at that level pay their taxes and do not indulge in tax avoidance as do a substantial number of people on that high level of income. Leaving aside tax avoidance and looking simply at very high income earners who pay tax according to the tax schedule, they have been given large tax concessions by this Government at a time when the vast majority of taxpayers are paying a much higher proportion of their income in income tax. </PARA>
<PARA> The figures I have given relate to single taxpayers. A similar situation exists for a taxpayer with a dependent spouse and two children. In that situation the cut-off point is $33,000 and that takes account of the fact that there was a change in 1976 from the previous system of child endowment plus tax deductions for children to a straight-out system of family allowances. But we still find that families in that situation, who earn up to $33,000 a year, are paying more of their income in net tax. Furthermore, if we take into account another factor related to income tax, that is, the increase in the cost of health insurance which in 1975-76 was provided without cost under Medibank Mark I-Medibank as was originally introduced by the Labor Government-we find that the increase in net tax payable by taxpayers who are on anything but very high incomes is very great indeed. At this stage I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard two tables which show the effect of the Fraser Government's tax policies. One table relates to a single taxpayer and the other to a taxpayer with a dependent spouse and two children. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. The tables which I have incorporated in Hansard show the situation between 1975-76 and the current income year for income earners at four levels: 85 per cent of average weekly earnings; average weekly earnings; 1 1/2 times average weekly earnings and twice average weekly earnings. Assuming that the Budget calculations of the increase in average weekly earnings are correct, there will be an 88 per cent increase in average weekly earnings between 1975-76 and 1981-82. But whilst income has increased by 88 per cent, we find there has been a much greater increase in what I describe as net tax. This table looks at the increased tax payable and also takes account of the fact that people now have to pay for health insurance which they did not have to pay for in 1975-76. It also takes account of the fact that this year, although people will have to pay for it, there will be a tax rebate for health insurance. Taking all those factors into account, we find that the net tax situation is one in which people at all of those income levels that I have mentioned are paying a higher proportion of their income in net tax. That is taking into account health insurance as well as income tax, for the reason I have mentioned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A person on 85 per cent of average weekly earnings finds that although his income has increased by 88 per cent, his net tax has increased by 124 per cent. A person on average weekly earnings finds his net tax is up by 111 per cent compared with his income increase of 88 per cent. For a person earning 1 1/2 times average weekly earnings, the net tax rise is 103 per cent, and for a person earning twice average weekly earnings the net tax increase is 91 per cent. This gets closer to the increase in income but it is still above it; so there is still some slight increase in the burden of taxation borne by that taxpayer. People who this year earn twice average weekly earnings will earn $33,216. Again we are talking about people who are on quite high incomes compared with the incomes of most people in the community. Even so, at that level there is still some slight increase in the burden of the net tax in the way that I have described. The figures that I have given relate to a single taxpayer. For a taxpayer with a dependent spouse and two children, the situation is similar, except that the increases are much greater at lower income levels. </PARA>
<PARA> Thus the taxpayer on 85 per cent of average weekly earnings, whose income has increased 88 per cent, finds that his net tax has increased by 241 per cent and that his net tax as a proportion of income has increased from 8.9 per cent to 16.1 per cent. Those are very large increases. It is almost double the tax burden. The proportion of income paid in income tax and health insurance, in net terms, has almost doubled for a person who earns 85 per cent of average weekly earnings. This is from a government which said in 1975 that it would reduce the tax burden. It made enormous play of that issue. Ever since it has talked about the need to reduce income tax. The Government made enormous play of the fact that income taxes were too high and what it must do is reduce them. The gap between the rhetoric and the performance is absolutely mind-blowing, especially for people at lower income levels. People on average weekly earnings-the families I have described-have had an increase in their tax burden of 172 per cent compared with an income growth of 88 per cent; so the proportion of income paid in net tax increases from 12.8 per cent to 18.5 per cent and to lesser degrees for the other two incomes levels that I have mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA> What flows quite clearly and incontrovertibly from these tables is that during the course of the Fraser Government's period of office, for the overwhelming majority of taxpayers-all but the top 3 per cent or so-there has been a very considerable increase in the tax burden and that increase in the tax burden has been the greatest for taxpayers at the bottom end of the scale. Consequently, there has been a great reduction in the equity of the tax system as well as a great increase in the burden of the income tax system. Those are developments which are deplored by the Opposition. For those reasons we oppose the measures which are contained in the legislation before us today, which impose for this year the highest level of income tax in our history. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, it is interesting to note that at the same time as this legislation comes before the House we find a great deal of public discussion occurring outside about the possibility of reduced income tax. Just a few days ago the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) said that we are getting close to the point where income tax cuts can be introduced. One might ask, 'Isn't it about time?', because for the last six years the Prime Minister has introduced almost continuing increases of a very large scale in income taxes for the great majority of wage and salary earners and taxpayers in general. At the same time as that has been happening there has also been an increase in indirect taxation. The burden of indirect taxation-that is, sales taxes, customs and excise, crude oil levies and so on-in total has increased as a proportion of total taxation. That is, indirect taxation has increased faster than income tax and therefore there has been, along with this large and growing income tax burden, a large and growing burden of indirect taxation. So there has been no compensatiof on the indirect tax side. As we know now from the sales tax issue, which is very much before this Parliament and presumably will be before the House directly in the next day or so, the Government is still trying to increase indirect taxes rapidly. </PARA>
<PARA> Prior to the sales tax increases brought in by the last Budget, the way in which indirect taxes were increased was through the crude oil levy, which has increased to an astonishing degree from $250m in 1975-76 to approximately $3,500m in this year's Budget-an extraordinary increase in such a short time. That has been the major way in which indirect taxation has been increased. But now that the sting is running out of that, with world oil prices stabilising, the Government has shifted to sales tax to keep the drive in indirect tax increases going. So taxpayers have been getting it all ways-on their incomes and indirectly. The only ones who have been able to escape this large burden of increased taxation have been high income earners who have been paying their taxes according to the schedule-which means quite high income earners-and those who have been avoiding tax. As everyone in this Parliament and in the nation is aware, there has been an enormous increase in tax avoidance in this Government's period of office, as shown by the one simple fact that the number of tax avoiders identified in the Taxation Commissioner's report last year was 20 times higher than in 1975. So there is no doubt that there has been an enormous change in the equity of the tax system. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not go into the aspects of equity related to indirect taxation at this stage, but on the income tax side, as I have shown quite clearly, the burden of tax has fallen increasingly on lower income earners. The overall burden of income tax has increased considerably and that has occurred at the same time as a growing burden of indirect taxation. This Government has an enormously long way to go before it can stand before the nation and say that it is a low tax party. If it thinks it can say to the people in the next few months or by the next Budget: 'Here is a little cut in income tax; are we not marvellous?', it has a long way to go before it gets the people of Australia to accept that as evidence that it is a low tax party. The fact is that it is anything but a low tax party. It is a very high tax party, the highest tax party in our history, particularly for people who can least afford to pay more taxes-the people on lower and middle incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bills before the House, as I mentioned, relate to other measures which we do not oppose. I would like to refer briefly to a couple of those. The Income Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3), relating to the taxation of public unit trusts, is an important development which we thoroughly support. On 16 July 1980, the Treasurer (Mr Howard) announced a crackdown on unit trusts formed by the reorganisation of the businesses of public companies in order to avoid tax. A unit trust is a trust where the beneficial ownership of the trust property is divided into units which are allocated to unit holders. According to the Master Tax Guide, which is published by the publishing firm of CCH Australia Ltd, during the late 1970s the unit trust flourished as a vehicle for tax planning directed at reducing the double liability to tax imposed upon profits derived by companies in the form of primary company income and taxed upon the dividend subsequently distributed. In other words, the point of using the trust was that companies would be able to avoid company tax and that company income, therefore, would be taxed only once, that is, in the hands of the shareholder. </PARA>
<PARA> Basically these schemes involve the public company entering into a scheme of arrangement to divide the company into a new holding company and a unit trust. Income producing assets were transferred to the unit trust and income from those assets taxed only in the hands of the unit holders. Of course, previously the income was taxed at the company level and again at the shareholder level. The Australian Financial Review reports that a number of public companies were in the process of setting up such schemes when this legislation was announced, whilst others already had such trusts set up and operating. Those companies which were apparently already using this form of operation included Westfield Ltd, Paynter and Dixon, Nock and Kirby Ltd and Perth Arcade. Those in the process of thinking of using it were the Swan Brewery Co. Ltd, Stockland, Myer, Tooth and Co. Ltd, Hookers, Repco, Woolworths and Carlton and United Breweries. That is as reported in the Australian Financial Review. All those are large companies. Quite obviously if this process had gone on very far, if all major companies were using this form of unit trust to avoid company tax, company tax would have become a thing of the past. </PARA>
<PARA> The Swan Brewery was the most publicised of those which were seeking to use this tax avoidance device. It did not get to use it although it had, it said, obtained a written clearance from the Australian Taxation Office on 13 December 1979. I must say that I find it quite extraordinary that the Taxation Office could have given a written clearance to a company to indulge in a process which was patently one of tax avoidance. Whether the company is misrepresenting what it received from the Taxation Office I am not in a position to say, but I think it would be interesting if the Treasurer, or whoever is representing him in this debate, could tell us in the course of this debate what the Taxation Office did do in relation to the Swan Brewery because, if the Taxation Office was giving the nod to tax avoidance, that would be a disturbing development. I frankly do not think that would have been the case, but the Swan Brewery claimed that it had this clearance from the Taxation Office and that, therefore, it was thoroughly within its rights in going ahead in the way it was. It was very indignant that the Government moved to block off this tax avoidance device before it could finally get the company reorganised onto a unit trust basis. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a couple of interesting points in relation to this legislation. The first is: Why has it taken so long for the Government to bring it in? It was announced in July 1980. We are in October 1981 and here is the legislation which was announced a year and a quarter ago. It seems an extraordinarily long delay. Also, the measures taken in the legislation to prevent the operation of this tax avoidance scheme-that is, by taxing the unit trust at 46c in the dollar and, therefore, taking away all the tax advantages of moving into that process-do not apply to companies which had already established such a scheme prior to the legislation being announced. We cannot for the life of us see why the Government would want to give three years grace to those companies which had been able to introduce such a tax avoidance scheme prior to July 1980. The Government is saying by this legislation that those companies will not have to face up to this tax on their unit trusts until income year 1983-84. Last year, this year and next year, they are all to be tax free in that respect. This seems a quite extraordinary development, thoroughly unexplained in the second reading speech by the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Moore) and totally unsatisfactory as far as we are concerned. I think the Government has some explaining to do in the course of this debate as to why it is allowing companies which have undertaken this sheer tax avoidance device to get away with it for three years. We think it is an extraordinary activity. Although the total revenue losses may not be all that enormous, I am sure they are extraordinarily beneficial to the companies involved. We believe the morality of it is such that they should not be allowed to get away with it. </PARA>
<PARA> We are also concerned that, as we read this legislation, it is possible for companies still to avoid tax in the future by means of a unit trust which does not involve the reorganisation of the company but which is established for any new business and into which the company puts the new income producing assets. As we read the legislation, it would seem that in that situation, where there is no company reorganisation involved but simply a unit trust established for new business, company tax could be avoided. If that is the case, we would certainly be very disturbed. I would like some reassurance in that respect in the course of this debate. If the reassurance cannot be given, I would like some change made to the legislation to ensure that such an obvious loophole is not allowed to remain. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make a quick comment on the change in the rate of write-off of capital spending by mining companies. Such capital expenditure does not include plant and machinery which is depreciable in the ordinary way, but it does enable companies to write-off the very considerable capital expenditures they have in developing a mine or an oil field, which is expenditure not normally able to be written off by other businesses. The position before this legislation was that the deduction was calculated by reference to the lesser of the life of the mine or to six years, which meant a rate of 16 2/3 per cent per annum was adopted using a six-year basis and that became the basis for a diminishing balance form of calculation. Rather than a straight out 16 2/3 per cent per annum, it is a diminishing balance process. So it takes much longer than six years to write-off the capital expenditure. This legislation extends that six-year period to 10 years. So it is 10 per cent per annum on a diminishing basis, which means that it takes much more than 10 years to write-off the total amount of the capital. In fact, on our calculations, it would take over 30 years for the capital to be totally written off on the 10 per cent basis, unless the life of the mine expired before that time, in which case whatever is remaining could be written off at the end of the mine's life.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has received a considerable amount of criticism from the mining industry for this change in the legislation which was announced as part of the Budget. In our view, that criticism is not justified. We believe that the concession which is there remains a very significant one indeed. It is expenditure which is peculiar to mining companies. Other companies are not allowed to write-off depreciation on buildings, for instance, whereas mining companies can do so in this way. We believe that the change from six years to 10 years is not unreasonable. </PARA>
<PARA> One other query I have in relation to this legislation relates to the granting of tax deductibility to gifts to the Victorian Arts Centre Trust. We in no way oppose that amendment to the tax law, but we would ask the Government to state what has happened to the action which the Government is supposed to be taking in respect of the Victorian Arts Centre. Earlier last year a tax avoidance scheme was discovered relating to gifts of art works to the National Gallery of Victoria. At that time a quite notable tax avoidance scheme was brought to light by myself. The Government said at that time that the Taxation Office would look at ways of stopping such a tax avoidance scheme continuing in the future. No such action has been announced by the Treasurer since that time. Since we are talking about tax deductibility for the Victorian Arts Centre Trust, it would not hurt for the Government to say, during the debate, what it intends to do to prevent further tax avoidance schemes through deductions for gifts of art works. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the most concerning elements of the discussion on tax at the moment has been the unbelievable volume of nonsense being spoken about the impact of indirect tax on Australians, particularly those in lower income groups. The honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) mentioned the allegation that lower income groups have suffered more under the present Government than in fact is the case. It seems to me to be unfortunate that the honourable member for Gellibrand conveniently omits from these discussions reference to the enormous number of lower income people in Australia who are now totally exempted from tax as a result of the Government's continuing policies involved in lifting, as it will do once again this year, the cut-off level at which tax is paid in the first place. In fact, one of these Bills increases the cut-off level, as a result of half indexation, below which tax need not be paid. As a result of these policies, there are many hundreds of thousands of Australians who are not paying tax and who would have paid tax had the system that was used when the Labor Government was in power still been employed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that it is very important indeed to examine the false allegations that sales tax rises will have an unfair and unreasonable impact on lower income groups in Australia. This seems to me to be one of the basically dishonest elements of the discussion of tax in Australia at the moment. What I will put to the House is very simple. I am certain that members of the Opposition will be able to follow it. I direct their attention to it. I hope that honourable members opposite-the few who are here-listen with great diligence because it is a very important point. I am putting the simple proposition that sales tax is not unfair to lower income people, particularly pensioners, not only because, obviously, richer people buy more expensive items, when they buy items that have sales tax, than poorer people generally do, although I admit that a lot of the objections to sales tax has been on the basis that it applies equally to rich and poor when they buy an item. If a relatively poor person buys a frock for, say, $20 she pays a lot less sales tax than a rich person who buys a frock for $200. That is self evident. That is not the main objection to the nonsense being spoken about sales tax. Nor is it only because the Commonwealth Statistician's surveys have proved that poorer people spend a far smaller proportion -about 25 per cent-of their expenditure on items that will be taxable under the new sales tax arrangements than do richer people. Well over half of their expenditures ends up on items that are taxable. That is not the main issue either. That is simply another example of how dishonest the campaign is. The basic burden--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, with your indulgence I would like to point out that a discussion has been allowed in this place of the basis and the balance of taxes in Australia. The honourable member for Gellibrand made the point that there was an unfair distribution of sales taxes, indirect taxes. I am replying specifically to the point raised by the honourable member for Gellibrand, who complained about the distribution of sales tax to direct taxes in his speech. I believe I have a right to respond to those points. It is not simply because sales tax gathers revenue from the tax avoiders either. That is another part of the great lie. The honourable member for Gellibrand insists on talking about tax avoiders all the time. They are still able to get away with not paying some of the direct taxes they are supposed to pay by using certain devices, despite the enormous volume of anti-avoidance legislation that has been introduced in this Parliament. Some of the recent legislation is yet to be tested in the courts. I hope that it will prove successful against them. An incidence of sales tax on items means that people who avoid direct taxes cannot avoid sales tax. The wife of someone who avoids income tax is, in fact, contributing to the revenues of the Government and, therefore, to its capacity to provide finance for welfare, health and other benefits for the Australian people when she buys a $200 frock. It is a fact that indirect taxes, such as sales tax, hit the rich equally. They are at last brought into the tax net if they have been avoiding it. There are many other reasons why indirect taxes can be much fairer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One has to recognise that Australia is totally out of step with the rest of the developed world, which relies much more heavily on indirect taxes than Australia. One of the reasons that Australians have the false impression that Australia is a highly taxed country is that direct taxes make up a relatively high proportion of their total tax cake. In fact Australia is the fifth lowest of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries in terms of the total tax people are required to contribute. That is self-evident. It is demonstrated by the statistics that are readily available.</PARA>
<PARA> The major reason sales taxes will not be unfair to most poorer people is that pensioners make up the great bulk of poorer people. They are the largest element in Australia's lower income group and they will be totally protected by increased pensions that will result directly because of the sales tax rises and other higher prices. Pensioners in fact will get roughly double protection against the sales tax rises, though as usual there will be some delay before it takes place. That is an essential point to recognise. The pensioners in Australia who receive full adjustments of their pensions as a result of automatic indexation introduced by this Government will receive double cover-double protection-over the increased cost that will follow as a result of sales tax rises. So people who come into this House or who are outside with bleeding hearts talking about the terrible impact on pensioners of sales tax rises are talking arrant nonsense. The figures-I will demonstrate the figures for the benefit of those people-are simply these: The Statistician's survey indicates that because there will be no sales tax rise whatsoever on food and rent--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I intend to do that, Mr Deputy Speaker, because I wish to demonstrate that the argument about the proportional impact raised by the honourable member for Gellibrand is arrant nonsense. I take your point. I will complete the point I am now making and then refer to the more general aspects of the Bill, which I must say the honourable member for Gellibrand mentioned in passing. As I said, because food and rent is excluded only about $18 of pensioners' spending will be on items that suffer from sales tax. A single pensioner's cost will rise by an average of 50c a week as a result of sales tax increases, but because these sales tax rises will have a far bigger impact on the cost of living index than on pensioners' costs as they spread across a lot of other items which most pensioners do not buy, the Budget estimates there will be a three-quarter per cent increase in the cost of living index as a result of these sales tax rises. A three-quarter per cent increase will have the impact of a 53c rise per week in pensioners' incomes as a result of automatic indexation. Added to that is a similar rise as a result of the health charges because the index does not take into account the fact that people will be better off when they get their tax rebate. But when we add the three-quarter per cent increase also from the increase in the cost of living resulting from the health charge rises of which pensioners do not have to pay one cent, there is a benefit to pensioners of $1.05 a week, but an increased cost of only 50c as a result of sales tax rises. Yet people, both inside and outside this House talk this kind of nonsense.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to stress that the same sort of nonsense as I have outlined in relation to sales tax applies to the argument about taxation in general and the Government's approach to taxation. I remind the House that in fact the increases in direct taxes over recent years bear no sort of relation to the enormous increases that took place under the previous Government. When we hear members of the Opposition complaining about huge tax rises under this Government, it seems extraordinary that they have such a short memory and cannot remember that under Mr Whitlam's three Budgets there was an average increase of $867m a year in constant dollar terms compared with the rise in the present Government's six Budgets of only $750m per year. We have to recognise that there is a lower rate of increase in taxes in real terms-that is total tax collections-under the present Government than there was under the previous Government.

I thank him, in spite of that, for giving leave. The Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, held in Melbourne and Canberra between 30 September and 7 October, was a success for Australia and the Commonwealth and it can be expected to have an influence on world discussions. The Meeting confounded the critics who had predicted that differences of view would lead to division and that irrelevant issues would distract attention from the fundamental themes. In fact, a spirit of compromise and practicality enabled 41 very disparate countries, most with strongly held views of their own, to reach agreement on a range of issues, and indeed, to agree to act on many of them. The Commonwealth is a remarkable international organisation not only because its meetings are for heads of government rather than for officials or foreign ministers; not only because the meetings themselves occupy a period of time which allows for thorough as well as wide-ranging deliberations; not only because the membership of the Commonwealth cuts across some of the most significant lines of division in the world; and not only because the Commonwealth countries themselves comprise above one quarter of the world's population.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition has said that the sole common link between the members of the Commonwealth is that they are all former British colonies. But in addition to the fact that we all also speak a common language, in addition to the fact that we all, as President Kaunda of Zambia put it, gained our independence from the British using their language, there is the further bond, again remarked on by President Kaunda, of a similar legal and administrative background among Commonwealth countries. I would add that in a world which is still unfortunately marred by racialism, it is a truly satisfying experience to be in and of a gathering which repudiates racialism not only in words but also by its nature. In the Commonwealth, brown, black, and white meet as equals and friends, and as President Kaunda put it: 'If God had made people green I am sure they would be represented in the Commonwealth as well'. </PARA>
<PARA> So far as Australia itself is concerned the success of the Conference must be measured not only in the fact that the issues we had identified beforehand as central indeed turned out to be so, and not merely in the fact that our contributions to the discussions on these central issues were successful in advancing several initiatives regarding them. I believe that we have emerged from the meeting with an enhanced reputation as an active and concerned member of the Commonwealth and as an enlightened and responsible middle power. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier this year, the Leader of the Opposition, in discussing the Australian Labor Party's foreign policy beliefs, said: Australia and Australians can achieve anything on their own. Such words are not mere grandstanding; they are fanciful and ill-considered, especially when he has no practical proposals to help create more wealth or to improve the living standards of people in developing countries, or indeed to advance the causes of peace and stability on any other significant issues. The Government's approach to its role in world affairs is vastly different for we recognise the contribution we can make and the role we can play. We accept the responsibilities of that role, and are prepared to take such steps as we can towards helping to make the world a better and more secure place for our children. </PARA>
<PARA> From the purely Australian point of view a further gain and success from the Commonwealth Meeting has been that our visitors were impressed by Australia as a friendly and vital country with a great future. </PARA>
<PARA> I pay tribute to those people, for the most part ordinary Australians, from right around the country but especially from Melbourne and Canberra, who conveyed to all the visitors the friendliness and confidence that the world now regards as characteristic of this country and who helped to make our visitors ambassadors for Australia. The tributes to Australia from the visitors will surely be pleasing to all members of the House and, indeed, to all Australians. Pierre Trudeau went so far as to say that the twentieth century can be said to belong to Australia. President Kaunda said that in the last few years his view of Australia has changed from one of 'a country where there was indifference to suffering people of the rest of the world' to one of 'decent human beings, an Australia with which we are very proud to be associated'. Sir Dennis Hamilton, of the Commonwealth Press Union, which was meeting at the same time went out of his way to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The sense of self-confidence of people (in Australia) at every level . . . that they can tackle any problems . . . is a bit of a refresher and encouragement for some of us who have come from some of the old countries. </PARA>
<PARA> I could instance many other tributes of a similar kind, but these are representative and give the House the flavour of our visitors' impressions. They show that the view of the Leader of the Opposition of the Meeting, at least before it was held, as 'an extravagant indulgence' reflected a quite distorted idea of the impact which the Meeting would have on the way in which Australia is regarded in other parts of the world. I add that, as Mrs Gandhi has said, when the expenditure on armaments in so many countries is so high, an amount of $10m, $15m or $20m spent on the pursuit of peace is small compared with the vast billions of dollars that are spent on armaments. If that sum spent in the pursuit of peace can help to make the world a safer place, surely it is worth spending. </PARA>
<PARA> From the Commonwealth point of view, the success of the Melbourne Meeting can be measured in several ways. The vitality of the Commonwealth was evident in the fact that three new members were present. Let me add that not a single member of the Meeting, in welcoming Zimbabwe, would have found anything 'quaint' or 'ironical', to use the words of the Leader of the Opposition, in the fact that Australia played a role in the establishment by the Commonwealth at the Lusaka Meeting of the conditions in which Zimbabwe was able to achieve independence. </PARA>
<PARA> The nature of the discussions between the Commonwealth leaders in Melbourne and Canberra-the meeting of minds that occurred, the understanding and friendships which were created-was a further confirmation of the relevance of the Commonwealth in a world in which divisions can too easily become entrenched and in which a needless lack of understanding so often prevents the achievement of real solutions. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the success of the Meeting for the Commonwealth will also turn out to be a success so far as the international community is concerned. The Commonwealth is obviously not an organisation with the power to settle major world issues, but between the extremes of either achieving a dramatic, conclusive impact which will turn everything around or of having no effect at all there is room for the kind of influence which the Commonwealth can have and which can be so important in achieving the right outcome rather than the wrong one. The Commonwealth role is to a considerable extent a matter of helping, in an incremental fashion, to shape opinion one way rather than the other; to change the balance of considerations operating on those who have to make larger decisions; to ensure that there are no miscalculations because strongly held views have not been clearly heard. </PARA>
<PARA> The Melbourne Meeting sent out a number of signals which, because of their timing and because they represent the views of a significant group of leaders, will register with other governments. Indeed, they are already registering and having an impact. Strongly supportive comments about the value of the Melbourne Declaration and the Communique, such as that the Declaration appears to be a 'very significant document which would no doubt be widely discussed' and that both the Declaration and the Communique would be helpful in 'setting the scene' for Cancun, the meeting to be held in Mexico, have been received at many of our missions abroad. </PARA>
<PARA> The Melbourne Declaration and the Communique from the Meeting are complementary documents. The Melbourne Declaration is a statement of resolve by 41 Heads of Government designed to demand urgent action to alleviate the plight of hundreds of millions of people living in absolute poverty. It is designed also to point out the despair which these conditions engender and the insecurity which can so easily be encouraged when such conditions prevail. Its purpose is to achieve a wider recognition that there is a massive problem in terms of the way in which hundreds of millions of people live out their lives on this earth and the need for nations to do more about that than they have done up to this point in time. </PARA>
<PARA> When the House ponders the Melbourne Declaration it might bear in mind the words of Pierre Trudeau at the Meeting, that 'history will judge this year as a watershed in North-South relations'. I known quite well that it was Pierre Trudeau's view that one of his principal tasks at the Ottawa Summit, at which the seven major economies were represented, was to achieve a recognition of the fact that progress must be made in North-South discussions, that global negotiations on economic relations between the rich and the poor must be got under way. It is my understanding that he believes that the Ottaw Summit, which Canada was responsible for chairing and organising, the Melbourne Meeting and Cancun are three steps along a similar path. It was Mrs Gandhi's hope that the voices of the countries of the Commonwealth would reach out to Cancun, as she very clearly expressed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Communique addresses virtually every major issue facing the world today and it reaches conclusions and makes recommendations concerning many of them. Despite the need for compromise to achieve maximum consensus, it says some very pointed things indeed. On the economic side, it addresses all the main topics encompassed by the North-South dialogue. It expresses strong support for an early resumption of global negotiations and seeks ways of improving the negotiating process. It is worth noting that this is the first time that there has been a suggestion that the rigidities in the negotiating process itself might be one of the contributing factors towards lack of progress in that area. It is the Commonwealth that has suggested that the actual negotiating process involving the different blocs and groups in the world should be examined to see whether there are not within it impediments that can be overcome. I think it also was widely recognised that there was a need for the global negotiations to be resumed so that all nations-large, small and very small-can feel that they are participating in the process. So often in the affairs of men it is the small nations that believe they are acted upon by events and that they have no power to influence events or in a real way to shape their own future. That is one of the real reasons so many people believe that global negotiations are important: To enable all nations to feel that they are part of the process and can contribute towards modifications to arrangements in the world which are designed and are able to advance the cause of their peoples, to be part of the act rather than to be merely acted upon.</PARA>
<PARA> The Communique also strongly reaffirms opposition to protectionism and establishes an expert study group to examine the impact of protectionism on developing countries in particular. Studies undertaken by our own officials and based on United Nations Conference on Trade and Development studies indicate that the impact of agricultural protectionism on a range of products, not the kinds of products that we expect, but those which are of concern to developing countries, reduces financial flows to developing countries by over $30 billion a year. If that extra $30 billion were in the hands of the developing countries, how much more would they be able to do for themselves, how much less would they need to ask for aid, how much greater would be their capacity to help themselves? I believe that those studies are important. I pointed out in the debate in Melbourne that for some people it could be uncomfortable if that course were to be followed. It could be uncomfortable in part for Australia, but if it were uncomfortable, so be it. We would need to examine it and work on it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Communique supports also the early establishment of an energy affiliate of the World Bank and a number of other practical measures relating to energy to be taken by the Commonwealth itself. It expands the Commonwealth's capacity to assist the food needs of developing Commonwealth members. It supports increased food aid, improved food security arrangements and increased assistance for agricultural developments. It reaffirms support for the Common Fund and outlines practical measures to be taken with the Commonwealth to assist commodity exporters. It makes a number of recommendations for an expansion of the capacity of international financial institutions to help developing countries. But it also noted the changes and modifications that those international financial institutions have in fact made over recent years. </PARA>
<PARA> I should add that, in addition to what is in the Communique, Australia has taken a number of initiatives of its own which will support and supplement the Communique's contents and general thrust. Among these are an increase in overseas development assistance for 1981-82 by $100m or 18 per cent which, of course, was announced during the Budget, the details of which were announced by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street). That increases for the first time in a number of years the ratio of official development assistance from 0.43 per cent to an estimated 0.45 per cent of gross domestic product. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's food aid program and assistance for agricultural development has been substantially expanded. Food aid has been increased by 15 per cent to $100m allowing about 445,000 tonnes of grain to be given, up from 400,000 tonnes in 1980-81 and 225,000 tonnes only a very few years ago. Australia is more than satisfying its obligations under world food program targets. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has increased its contribution to the International Emergency Food Reserve from 30,000 tonnes to 45,000 tonnes. We are paying the freight on an increasing proportion of our food aid, including on 80,000 tonnes to Africa. Australia is establishing a centre for international agricultural research to mobilise Australian agricultural expertise which is very considerable indeed to address problems of importance to developing countries. We are delighted that Sir John Crawford has agreed to be the initial chairman of this body. In addition, we are continuing to give priority within our regular aid program to agricultural development. </PARA>
<PARA> On energy, Australia has pledged an additional $1m in Nairobi for assistance for new and renewable energy sources. Australia has offered also to make available to all Commonwealth countries, information and experience through the Commonwealth Regional Renewable Energy Resource Information System run by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and also to make available to Commonwealth countries an exhibition of new and renewable energy technology which is being perpared as part of the work of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Regional Meeting energy group. It is worth noting that those are initiatives taken out of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Regional Meetings which have flowed over to the main Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. </PARA>
<PARA> On commodity trade, Australia has signed the instrument for ratification of the Common Fund and is making a voluntary ontribution of $5.5m to its second account for the promotion of development, marketing and production. </PARA>
<PARA> On trade, Australia has recently extended and liberalised preferences of significant interest to developing countries to the whole textiles, clothing and footwear area. Imports in 1977-78 account for about 40 per cent of the Australian market for textiles, 20 per cent for clothing and 28 per cent for footwear. Those percentages stand reasonably well by the access that is available for other advanced countries. In addition, a wide variety of products now receives special preferences in the South Pacific trading region. Australia's continuing examination of protection and the Industries Assistance Commission general reference were noted and appreciated by Heads of Government. </PARA>
<PARA> On the political side, there is in the Communique a reaffirmation of the Gleneagles Declaration; a strong statement on Namibia with agreement between the contact group, front line and other members on the need for intensified efforts to seek settlement on the basis of United Nations resolution 435; on Poland: Agreement that the people of Poland should be left to determine their own destiny free from foreign or outside interference; on Afghanistan and Kampuchea: Strong agreement on the need for the withdrawal of foreign troops; on Africa: The view that African states should be able to pursue their own affairs without outside interference from any source; on the law of the sea: Affirmation of the need for a convention to be concluded speedily; on the South Pacific: Support for the call by the countries of the region for an immediate end to nuclear testing, and a welcoming of the decision by the South Pacific Forum to send a mission to France to discuss the future of French territories in the Pacific. There was also informal discussion among some leaders on the general question of readmission to the Commonwealth. This is a new question which the Commonwealth has not had to consider before, and government leaders will be keeping in touch on the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, at the opening of the conference two weeks ago I spoke of the intractable nature of the problems on our agenda and of the need, therefore, to think in terms of improvements and progress rather than of total solutions. I spoke of the need to define success in realistic terms. In those terms-which are the only ones which can seriously be countenanced-this conference speaks for itself. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make one comment about the security arrangements for the conference because they have attracted a good deal of interest and attention and the Leader of the Opposition actually described them as 'somewhat ridiculous and, frankly, frightening'. The frightening thing is not the arrangements that we made, but the fact that we live in a world in which such arrangements are necessary. But the inconveniences were minimised and I am sure that I speak for the vast majority of Australians when I say, especially thinking of the assassinations and attempted assassinations of world leaders which have taken place this year, that I am glad we took the precautions we did; I am glad that so many leaders commented so favourably on the arrangements we had made; and I am glad that the meeting passed without any incidents occurring. I must say that this was a great credit to both the Commonwealth and Victorian Police. I think many honourable gentlemen will not know that the Victorian Police had their leave cancelled. They had many hours of overtime so that their normal responsibilities could still be undertaken without any diminution right across the State. I believe that they did a really wonderful job and that everyone in this country has every right to be proud of what they did. </PARA>
<PARA> Three years ago, and again seven months ago, the Leader of the Opposition said that the Commonwealth is an 'anachronistic institution, a talk shop of dubious value for Australia'. I hope that the success of the Melbourne Meeting has changed his view as it has undoubtedly convinced countless Australians of the value of the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth is an instrument which enables the leaders of many countries, from many continents, to come together as colleagues and friends to make a contribution to the continuing process of resolving the world's problems. That is what the Meeting at Melbourne was all about. I table the Declaration and a copy of the Communique. </PARA>

<PARA>DECLARATION</PARA>
<PARA>We, the Heads of Government here assembled, drawn from Five Continents representing a quarter of the World's entire population:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Affirm our strong and unanimous conviction that all men and women have the right to live in ways that sustain and nourish human dignity. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) Believe that this right imposes obligations on all states, large and small, not only in respect to their own people but in their dealings with all other nations. </PARA>
<PARA> (3) Assert that the gross inequality of wealth and opportunity currently existing in the world, and the unbroken circle of poverty in which the lives of millions in developing countries are confined, are fundamental sources of tension and instability in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> (4) As a consequence, assert our unanimous conviction that there must be determined and dedicated action at national and international levels to reduce that inequality and to break that circle. </PARA>
<PARA> (5) Believe that for all these reasons it is imperative to revitalise the dialogue between developed and developing countries. </PARA>
<PARA> (6) Declare that this will require a political commitment, clear vision and intellectual realism which have thus far escaped mankind and to all of which the Commonwealth can greatly contribute. </PARA>
<PARA> (7) Believe that the dialogue must be conducted with a genuine willingness to accept real and significant changes commensurate with the urgency of the problems we now face. </PARA>
<PARA> (8) Firmly believe that the choice is not between change and no change but between timely, adequate, managed change and disruptive, involuntary change imposed by breakdown and conflict. </PARA>
<PARA> (9) Maintain that success will only be achieved as states recognise and give due weight to the essential inter-dependence of peoples and of states. </PARA>
<PARA>(10) Declare that, while the most urgent humanitarian considerations demand action, self-interest itself warrants a constructive and positive approach to these great human problems by all governments. </PARA>
<PARA>(11) Recognise that in the process of negotiations, nations must cast aside inhibitions and habits which have thwarted progress in the past and find new ways of talking constructively to one another so as to reach agreement on effective joint action. </PARA>
<PARA>(12) Note that, as well as technical economic considerations, it is imperative that states keep in the forefront of their attention the larger moral, political and strategic dimensions of what is at stake. </PARA>
<PARA>(13) Maintain that while the problems are formidable, they are not of such a weight that they will defeat our purpose, given political will and an understanding of the needs of different countries and groups. </PARA>
<PARA>(14) Assert that what is at stake-in terms of how hundreds of millions will live or die; of the prospects for cooperation or conflict; and of the prospects for economic advance or stagnation-is of such vital importance in human terms that it would be an indictment of this generation if that political will and the readiness to find a creative compromise were not found.</PARA>
<PARA>(15) Firmly believe that the issues are so important that they require the personal commitment and involvement of political leaders who, representing the will of their peoples, have the greatest power to advance the common cause of mankind. </PARA>
<PARA>(16) Attaching the highest importance to the principles and objectives of this document, recognising the mutual interests and interdependence of all nations, declare our common resolve: To end the present impasse; to advance the dialogue between developed and developing countries; to infuse an increased sense of urgency and direction into the resolution of these common problems of mankind; and solemnly call on all leaders of all countries to join us in a commitment to taking prompt, practical and effective action to that end. </PARA>

<PARA>COMMUNIQUE</PARA>
<PARA>Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting Melbourne</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>30 September-7 October 1981</PARA>
<PARA>FINAL COMMUNIQUE</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Commonwealth Heads of Government met in Melbourne from 30 September to 7 October 1981. Of the 41 countries which attended the Meeting, 30 were represented by their Presidents or Prime Ministers. The Prime Minister of Australia Mr Malcolm Fraser was in the Chair. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. Heads of Government sent a message of felicitation to Her Majesty the Queen as Head of the Commonwealth. They welcomed with great pleasure the opportunity of meeting in Melbourne, and expressed their appreciation of the excellent arrangements made for the Meeting and the warm and generous hospitality of their Australian hosts. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. Heads of Government warmly welcomed their colleagues from Zimbabwe, Vanuatu and Belize which had become members of the association since their last Meeting, and extended similar greetings to St Vincent and the Grenadines which had become a special member. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. Heads of Government expressed their deep grief at the death of President Ziaur Rahman of Bangladesh, President Sir Seretse Khama of Botswana, President Benjamin Henry Sheares of Singapore and Prime Minister Eric Williams of Trinidad and Tobago and recalled their deep commitment and significant contributions to the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> 5. Heads of Government recalled with particular satisfaction the Commonwealth's role in helping to bring Zimbabwe to independence under majority rule following their Meeting in Lusaka. They were encouraged by this demonstration of the contribution their Meetings could make to the resolution of long-standing international problems. </PARA>
<PARA>World and Commonwealth Trends</PARA>
<PARA> 6. Heads of Government were conscious that they were meeting at a time when there was a growing sense of insecurity among the people of the world; they expressed grave disquiet at the marked deterioration that had taken place in international relations since their last Meeting. Central to their concern were the slide from detente to confrontation, mounting tension between the Super Powers and the build up of nuclear arms threatening the very survival of mankind. Heads of Government contrasted the increasingly large resources devoted to the manufacture of ever more destructive weapons with the growing inadequacy of the resources available for international economic co-operation and continued inability of the international community to agree on ways and means of alleviating world poverty. They were disturbed that in this situation, which called for new and enlightened policies, there was evidence of a weakening of the spirit of internationalism. They believed their association could help to reverse this trend and contribute to a safer and saner world. </PARA>
<PARA> 7. Heads of Government asserted the right of all peoples freely to determine their destiny and noted with concern that this right was being denied in widely different circumstances in many parts of the world. They recognised an obligation to work for conditions more conducive to respect for sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and the right to self-determination. </PARA>
<PARA> 8. Heads of Government emphasised that as an association of aligned and non-aligned states, the Commonwealth was uniquely well placed to make a substantial contribution to defusing international tensions in a divided world. Believing that it was in the highest interest of the international community that the non-aligned countries should be able to continue to play their constructive role and pursue the policies and principles of non-alignment free of outside pressures, they especially endorsed the role of the non-aligned members of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA>Southern Africa</PARA>
<PARA> 9. Heads of Government reviewed developments in Southern Africa since their Lusaka Meeting which established the basis for Zimbabwe's independence under majority rule. They affirmed that the Lancaster House Conference and the negotiations which preceded it, demonstrated in a decisive and compelling manner the ability of Commonwealth members to work together to achieve consensus and to make a positive contribution to the resolution of major problems. In this respect they paid tribute to the central role of Britain in facilitating the process which enabled Zimbabwe to take its place as a sovereign independent country in the international community and the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> 10. Heads of Government congratulated the Government of Zimbabwe which had earned the respect of the world community and fully justified the trust placed in it by the Commonwealth. Deep concern was expressed that, despite the significant achievement of Zimbabwe's independence, grave problems remained to be resolved in Southern Africa. Heads of Government acknowledged that, in fact, the situation had deteriorated. They recognised the urgent need to find solutions to these unresolved problems and renewed their total commitment to this objective. </PARA>
<PARA> 11. Heads of Government stressed that at the core of these problems is the apartheid system which the white minority regime in South Africa continues to sustain and strengthen in a variety of ways, including the brutal internal repression of the African majority, the persistent refusal to implement the relevant Security Council resolutions providing for Namibia's long-delayed independence, the pursuit of policies of destabilisation against neighbouring states, the repeated threats to and violations of their territorial integrity and the expansion of South Africa's military capability. They considered that these developments not only threatened the stability of the region but also gravely endangered international peace and security. They therefore called on the international community to strengthen its collective resolve to eradicate apartheid. </PARA>
<PARA> 12. Recalling their Declaration on Racism and Racial Prejudice proclaimed at Lusaka in 1979, Heads of Government reaffirmed their total and unequivocal condemnation of apartheid as a crime against humanity and their total rejection of all policies designed to perpetuate this inhuman system. They accepted that it was the solemn and urgent duty of each of their Governments vigorously to combat the evil of apartheid by the adoption of effective measures against it and to assist those struggling to rid themselves of it. </PARA>
<PARA> 13. Heads of Government reaffirmed their Gleneagles Agreement of 1977 and reiterated their commitment to fulfilling effectively their obligations under it. </PARA>
<PARA> 14. Heads of Government took special account of the efforts of the United Nations to reach universally accepted approaches to the question of sporting contacts within the framework of the international campaign against apartheid. They agreed to redouble their own efforts to secure such international agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> 15. Heads of Government expressed deep concern that there had been no progress towards the achievement of independence for Namibia. They registered their grave disappointment that the Pre-Implementation meeting in Geneva in January 1981 had been aborted by the refusal of the South African Government to agree to a date for the implementation of Security Council Resolution 435. Heads of Government reaffirmed their determination to ensure that the people of Namibia should be allowed without further delay to exercise their right to self-determination and independence. Mindful of the role being played by the Western Contact Group, which included two of their members, they urged the Group, as a matter of particular urgency, to intensify efforts to secure the implementation of Resolution 435 without modification or dilution as early as possible in 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> 16. Heads of Government noted that, notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 418 (1977), imposing a mandatory arms embargo against South Africa, the apartheid regime's expenditure on military expansion and nuclear development had increased alarmingly. They therefore called for a full and effective implementation of the arms embargo, including its efficient monitoring, and urged all governments to desist forthwith from any collaboration with South Africa which undermined the implementation of the arms embargo. </PARA>
<PARA> 17. Heads of Government condemned the South African regime's repeated threats to and violations of the territorial integrity of the States of Southern Africa, in particular its recent invasion and occupation of Angolan territory. They called for an immediate withdrawal of all South African troops from Angola and an end to all such violations. They also condemned any attempt from any quarter to subvert the legitimate government of Angola through interference in the internal affairs of the country. In this connection, they expressed strong solidarity with the Front-Line States. They also expressed the view that African States should be able to pursue their own affairs without interference from any source. </PARA>
<PARA> 18. In endorsing the report of the Commonwealth Committee on Southern Africa, Heads of Government expressed appreciation for the effective and constructive manner in which the Committee had discharged its responsibilities in the past two years. They authorised the Committee to continue its work and to pay particular attention to developments in Namibia. They noted with approval the important role played by the Commonwealth, both bilaterally and multilaterally, in enhancing the supply of trained manpower for both Zimbabwe and Namibia, and commended the Secretariat for its efficient administration of Commonwealth humanitarian assistance prorammes in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> 19. Heads of Government noted that the increasing number of young refugees from South Africa in neighbouring countries was imposing severe burdens on those countries. They therefore approved in principle the recommendations of the Committee for the establishment of a Commonwealth education and training programme for the benefit of these refugees as a concrete manifestation of their concern and reinforcement of their political commitment against apartheid and their support for majority rule in South Africa. They requested the Secretary-General to prepare detailed proposals for establishing such a programme for consideration by Commonwealth governments through the Committee. Heads of Government also welcomed the recent UN/OAU/UNHCR conference on refugees in Africa and expressed appreciation to the participating countries and institutions and urged them to fulfil their pledges made at the conference to help alleviate this grave humanitarian problem. </PARA>
<PARA> 20. Heads of Government recalled that at their Lusaka Meeting in 1979, they had acknowledged that the persistent problems of Southern Africa were damaging the development efforts of the States of the region which were in great need of further international assistance on a substantial scale. They therefore specially welcomed the establishment of and the progress made by the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference (SADCC) aimed particularly at strengthening co-operation among the majority-ruled States in the region and reducing their economic dependence on South Africa. While noting that significant bilateral and multilateral assistance is already being provided to SADCC to which Commonwealth countries are contributing, Heads of Government draw attention to the need for even greater international assistance to meet the emergent needs of SADCC countries. </PARA>
<PARA>Afghanistan</PARA>
<PARA> 21. Heads of Government expressed grave concern at the situation in and around Afghanistan and its implications both for the region's peace and stability and for international security. Although there were differing perceptions about the developments leading to the present situation, Heads of Government were united in calling urgently for a political settlement on the basis of the withdrawal of foreign troops and full respect for the independence, sovereignty, and non-aligned status of Afghanistan and strict observance of the principles of non-intervention and non-interference. They affirmed the right of Afghan refugees to return to their homes in safety and honour. They urged all concerned to work towards a negotiated settlement which would leave the Afghan people free to determine their own future. </PARA>
<PARA>South East Asia</PARA>
<PARA> 22. Heads of Government were gravely concerned by the continuing tension in South East Asia arising especially from the armed conflict in Kampuchea which affected the peace and security of the whole region and if left unchecked would result in the active intervention by major powers in the affairs of the region. They reaffirmed their support for the principles of non-interference in the internal affairs of sovereign states and the inadmissability of the use of force in international relations. They agreed on the urgent need for a comprehensive political settlement which would ensure the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of all states in the region, including Kampuchea. They reaffirmed the right of the people of the region to determine their future free of outside interference, subversion or coercion, and called for the speedy withdrawal of all foreign forces from Kampuchea. Heads of Government endorsed the conclusions of the New Delhi Conference of Foreign Ministers of Non-aligned Countries in this regard. They noted various proposals, decisions and efforts of the various parties concerned directed towards finding an early political settlement of the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> 23. Urging all states in South East Asia to develop peaceful and friendly relations, Heads of Government noted with approval the efforts being made for the early establishment of a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality in the region, and called on all states to fully support these efforts. </PARA>
<PARA>Refugees</PARA>
<PARA> 24. Heads of Government also noted with concern the problem of Indo-Chinese refugees/illegal immigrants caused by the continuing instability in Indo-China. They expressed their appreciation to countries of first transit burdened with this problem and to the resettlement countries for accepting these refugees/illegal immigrants. They were convinced that the root cause of this problem could be eliminated through a political solution to the conflict in Indo-China. They urged the countries which have the primary responsibility to tackle the problem of illegal departures at source by fostering the establishment of circumstances in which all the people concerned can live in peace and harmony and by co-operating with the UNHCR and resettlement countries to implement the Programme of Orderly Departures. </PARA>
<PARA>Cyprus</PARA>
<PARA> 25. Heads of Government, reaffirming their Lusaka Communique and their decision regarding the Commonwealth Committee on Cyprus, reiterated their support for the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, unity and non-alignment of the Republic of Cyprus and their solidarity with its Government and people. They stressed the importance of respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all Cypriots and called for an end to all foreign intervention and interference in the Republic of Cyprus. While welcoming the resumption of inter-communal talks under the auspices of the United Nations Secretary-General, they expressed their concern that these talks have not yet produced a solution and stressed the need to achieve early progress towards a just and lasting solution, based on the implementation of the relevant United Nations resolutions and the High-level Agreements. They noted that the President of the Republic of Cyprus had once again drawn to their attention his proposal for the total demilitarisation and disarmament of his country, put forward as a significant contribution to the search for a solution to the problem of Cyprus, a member of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA>Zones of Peace</PARA>
<PARA> 26. Heads of Government noted the trend inherent in the call by the states of various regions represented in the Commonwealth for the creation of zones of peace in their respective regions. They saw this trend as a reflection of the concern of the peoples of those regions to safeguard their political independence and territorial integrity free from interference by extra-regional forces. They undertook to give consideration to requests for support for the establishment and consolidation of new zones of peace. </PARA>
<PARA>Latin America and the Caribbean</PARA>
<PARA> 27. Heads of Government reviewed recent developments in Latin America and the Caribbean and noted that the region had not escaped the vicissitudes and the dangers which beset the international community elsewhere. They upheld the sovereign right of each state to continue to pursue its own political, economic and social development free from all forms of external interference, coercion, intimidation or pressure. Most Heads of Government further called upon the international community to respect and support the wishes of the people of the Caribbean for the Caribbean area to be recognised as a zone of peace. </PARA>
<PARA>Belize</PARA>
<PARA> 28. Heads of Government reviewed developments leading to the independence of Belize. They expressed satisfaction with the role played by the British Government and welcomed its commitment to make adequate provision for the security of Belize. They commended the Commonwealth Ministerial Committee on Belize for the effective manner in which it had discharged its mandate. Noting the continuing threat to the security of Belize in the absence of a final settlement with Guatemala, Heads of Government reaffirmed their full support for the efforts of the Government of Belize to maintain Belize's territorial integrity and to achieve a final resolution of the outstanding issues on the basis of the Heads of Agreement signed in London on 11 March, 1981. They requested the Secretary-General to convene the Committee, whenever necessary, to assist the Government of Belize in finding a lasting settlement in accordance with the Heads of Agreement. They noted the helpful attitude of the United States Government as reflected in its affirmative vote for the Belize resolution in the United Nations General Assembly in 1980 and expressed confidence that this attitude would be maintained. </PARA>
<PARA>Guyana</PARA>
<PARA> 29. Heads of Government expressed their deep concern at the threat to the territorial integrity of Guyana arising from the resuscitation by Venezuela of a claim to more than two-thirds of the territory of Guyana and the steps taken by Venezuela in pursuit of the claim. Noting that the existing boundary was laid down by an international arbitral award in 1899 and accepted by all concerned as a final settlement, they expressed support for Guyana and called for the peaceful settlement of the controversy in accordance with established procedures and with full respect for the sanctity of treaties. </PARA>
<PARA>Middle East</PARA>
<PARA> 30. Heads of Government expressed grave concern that the unresolved problems of the Middle East, especially the central question of Palestine, remained a serious threat to peace and security in the region and throughout the world. They recognised that a just and lasting settlement should be on the basis of the relevant United Nations resolution and recognition of the rights of the Palestinian people, including their inalienable right to a homeland, as well as the right of all States in the region to live in peace within secure borders. Stressing the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, most Heads of Government affirmed that the Palestinian Liberation Organisation, recognised by a substantial majority of them as the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, must be involved in negotiations for a settlement. </PARA>
<PARA>Mediterranean</PARA>
<PARA> 31. Heads of Government reiterated their conviction, expressed in the Lusaka Communique of 1979, that the implementation of the Mediterranean Chapter of the Helsinki Final Act would enhance the security of the Mediterranean, Europe and the Middle East and urged its full implementation. They noted the declaration by the Government of the Republic of Malta proclaiming Malta as a neutral State adhering to a policy of non-alignment as an effective contribution to detente, peace and security in the Mediterranean region. </PARA>
<PARA>Indian Ocean</PARA>
<PARA> 32. Heads of Government noted with disappointment that despite the expressed wishes of the littoral and hinterland states there had been a further increase in the military presence of outside powers in the Indian Ocean and a deterioration of peace and security in the area. The concept of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace enshrined in the 1971 United Nations Declaration had been gravely undermined by increased military activity on the part of outside powers. They called upon the governments concerned with the pursuit of the objectives of the Declaration to co-operate in steps to remove sources of tension in the area and to make progress towards the creation of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace. In the belief that the proposed United Nations Conference on the Indian Ocean could contribute positively to the implementation of the Declaration, they expressed the hope that agreement would be reached to convene the Conference at an early date. </PARA>
<PARA>South Asia</PARA>
<PARA> 33. Heads of Government noted with satisfaction that the countries of South Asia had initiated constructive steps with a view to increasing regional co-operation among themselves, thus contributing further to the climate of peace, stability and economic progress in the area. </PARA>
<PARA>Poland</PARA>
<PARA> 34. Heads of Government discussed the situation in Poland. They were concerned that it could have serious implications for the international community as a whole. They considered that the people of Poland should be left to determine their own destiny free from foreign interference. </PARA>
<PARA>South Pacific</PARA>
<PARA> 35. Heads of Government expressed their satisfaction at the resolution of the difficulties which had attended Vanuatu's accession to independence. They agreed that it was vital for the peace and stability of the region that all people of the South Pacific should be given the opportunity to exercise their right to self-determination as laid down in the United Nations Charter. In this regard, they welcomed the decision by the South Pacific Forum to send a mission to France to discuss the future of the French territory of New Caledonia. </PARA>
<PARA> 36. Heads of Government shared the concern of member governments in the South Pacific over continued nuclear testing in the region. The South Pacific countries were strongly supported in their call for an immediate end to such tests. </PARA>
<PARA> 37. Heads of Government noted the opposition in the South Pacific region to the proposals for dumping and storage of nuclear waste in the Pacific ocean and the deep concern at the serious ecological and environmental dangers to which member countries could be exposed. In this regard the resolution adopted at the recent meeting of the South Pacific Forum was strongly supported. </PARA>
<PARA>Disarmament and Arms Control</PARA>
<PARA> 38. Heads of Government were profoundly disturbed by the lack of progress in implementing measures of disarmament and arms limitation contained in the Final Document of the UN Special Session on Disarmament held in 1978. They saw this as a particularly serious matter in a situation in which there was mounting tension and lack of confidence amongst states. They agreed that practical measures directed towards nuclear disarmament and the avoidance of all armed conflict, particularly nuclear conflict, must have the highest priority on the international agenda. </PARA>
<PARA> 39. On that basis they welcomed the decision of the United States and the Soviet Union to reopen theatre nuclear force negotiations and urged the reopening of talks on strategic arms limitation at the earliest possible date. These initiatives pursued in a genuinely constructive spirit would bring renewed hope to the rest of the international community. They would also inspire all concerned to bring a new sense of purpose to their negotiations on specific measures of disarmament and arms control. </PARA>
<PARA> 40. Heads of Government emphasised the importance of an early conclusion of a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty as a crucial first step towards the cessation of nuclear weapons tests by all states in all environments. </PARA>
<PARA> 41. Reaffirming their support for the objective of the Second Disarmament Decade proclaimed by the United Nations General Assembly in 1980, Heads of Government considered that the Second Special Session on Disarmament scheduled for 1982 would provide a significant impetus for a process of genuine disarmament particularly in the nuclear field. They expressed their determination to contribute effectively to the success of the Special Session.</PARA>
<PARA>Drug Abuse</PARA>
<PARA> 42. Heads of Government expressed concern at the problem of drug abuse which affects humanity. They recognised its grave danger to national security, stability and resilience. They agreed that this was not only a social problem but that there was also a clear link between drug trafficking and other types of organised crime, including illegal traffic in firearms, which could pose a serious security problem in some countries. They recognised that this menace had the potential to destabilise societies and nations. Heads of Government stressed the need to foster closer co-operation within the framework of international and regional agencies to combat this menace. </PARA>
<PARA>Law of the Sea</PARA>
<PARA> 43. Heads of Government stressed the importance they attached to securing at an early date a comprehensive and widely accepted Convention on the Law of the Sea. </PARA>
<PARA> 44. They observed that such a Convention would enhance the prospects for peace and security in the world. It would define, inter alia, the rights of coastal states and other users of the sea; assist the rational exploitation and management of the living and non-living resources of the oceans; provide increased protection for the marine environment; give practical effect to the principle that the resources of the seabed beyond national jurisdiction are the common heritage of mankind, and permit all States to participate in the exploitation of those resources, either directly through national operators or indirectly through the Enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA> 45. Heads of Government noted with satisfaction that negotiations at the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea had reached a very advanced stage, but recorded their disquiet at developments which over the last two sessions, have prevented the Conference from concluding a Convention in 1981. They expressed the hope that the Conference would complete its work in 1982 in accordance with the decision taken at its Tenth Session. </PARA>
<PARA>The Melbourne Declaration</PARA>
<PARA> 46. Recalling their Melbourne Declaration, agreed and issued during their weekend retreat, and recognising the importance of carrying forward the political commitments reflected in it into areas of practical action, Heads of Government approached their consideration of the world economic situation with a deep sense of urgency and practicality. They were determined to help the international community to usher in a new era of constructive economic relations between developed and developing countries, based on interdependence, mutual respect and a shared interest in change. </PARA>
<PARA>The World Economy</PARA>
<PARA> 47. Heads of Government reviewed developments in the world economy and the deterioration in it since they met in Lusaka in 1979. They recognised that they were meeting at a time of economic crisis. Recession was persisting and was accompanied by stubbornly high inflation and rising levels of unemployment and under-employment. Prospects for many developing countries were particularly grim; they were experiencing serious balance-of-payments and debt service problems, further erosion of their terms of trade, acute poverty, hunger and malnutrition. Heads of Government stressed the global character of the problems facing the contemporary world and expressed their firm belief that domestic policies to counter these problems needed to be supplemented by collective action and a global approach. They noted that the growing interdependence of the world economy rendered it imperative that urgent action be taken to deal with the economic problems of both developed and developing countries, with special attention being paid to the needs of the Least Developed Countries which were engaged in a desperate struggle for survival. </PARA>
<PARA> 48. Heads of Government reaffirmed their conviction that the persistence of widespread poverty underlined the importance of promoting rapid economic growth and development and of pursuing necessary structural and institutional changes in international economic relations, in order to create a more equitable economic order. In approaching the critical issues, they took account of the analysis and recommendations made by the Reports of the Brandt Commission and the Commonwealth Group of Experts. They noted with satisfaction the international recognition accorded to the report of the Commonwealth Group of Experts which they had commissioned at their Lusaka Meeting. </PARA>
<PARA> 49. Heads of Government were conscious of the significance of their Meeting for the outcome of the Cancun Summit. They believed that the issues to be considered had major implications for the recovery of the world economy as well as for relations between developed and developing countries. They expressed the hope that Cancun would make a bold start by putting international economic co-operation on a new and constructive course; and that it would unequivocally reaffirm the commitment to Global Negotiations, thus giving a much needed political impetus to those negotiations. They resolved to make every effort to remove obstacles to an early start to the Global Negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA> 50. Heads of Government noted that the Global Round of Negotiations would cover wide fields and could be a time-consuming process. At the same time, they recognised the need for immediate and effective action in such critical areas as trade, energy, food and money and finance, and called on leaders of all countries, without prejudice to the Global Round of Negotiations, to join them in commitment to such action. </PARA>
<PARA> 51. Heads of Government noted the conclusions on North/South issues at the Ottawa Summit of industrialised countries, and expressed the hope that the attention given to those issues at Ottawa would be advanced at Cancun. They requested participating colleagues to provide to other Commonwealth governments, through the Secretary-General, their assessment of the Cancun meeting. </PARA>
<PARA> 52. Heads of Government noted that co-operation among developing countries was a growing and welcome element in international relations. They urged that this process should be appropriately facilitated and supported so that it might make its due contribution to the resolution of the problems affecting the global economy. </PARA>
<PARA> 53. Heads of Government noted that lack of progress in negotiations between developed and developing countries resulted in part from obstacles in the negotiating process itself. They requested the Secretary-General to convene a high level group to study and report on the issues involved. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Issues</PARA>
<PARA> 54. Heads of Government attached high priority to the resolution of current problems in the financial and monetary fields, and stressed the urgent need to restore world economic growth and curb inflation. They noted that financial markets were unsettled; interest rates had reached unprecedented levels; exchange rates were subject to severe, and often disruptive, fluctuations; and there were pervasive and persistent imbalances in international payments. In an interdependent world, the resolution of these problems required greater co-ordination and co-operation on economic policy. They called upon all governments, particularly the major economic powers, to show greater concern for the repercussions of their policies on other countries; and, in the context of promoting economic recovery, to give urgent consideration to measures to bring stability to the financial and exchange markets and reduce upward pressure on interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> 55. In the light of the critical economic situation facing many developing countries, Heads of Government emphasised the need to increase official development assistance, particularly to the least developed and other disadvantaged countries. They welcomed the decision of some countries to increase levels of official development assistance and called upon all industrialised countries which have not already done so, to reach the internationally agreed targets as soon as possible. They also called upon the developed centrally planned countries to substantially increase their development assistance. They noted the decision at the recent UN Conference on Least Developed Countries in Paris to make additional resources available to these countries. The prospects for flows of concessional assistance to these and other low-income countries had been adversely affected by delay and uncertainty regarding IDA VI. They expressed the firm hope that the funding of IDA VII would be placed on a sounder footing. They attached importance to program lending, including support for structural adjustment, and agreed that there was a case for a significant increase in such lending. They noted the prevalence of tied aid, which can distort the priorities of recipient countries, and urged all donor countries to give aid as far as possible in untied forms. </PARA>
<PARA> 56. Heads of Government recognised the substantial contribution that multilateral institutions had made to economic development, and emphasised the major role they should play in expanding the flow of resources to developing countries. They agreed to make special efforts to ensure that progress in strengthening the resources of these institutions would not falter at this critical time. They stressed the need for these institutions to avoid political and ideological considerations in determining their operational policies. </PARA>
<PARA> 57. Heads of Government recognised the role of private non-concessional flows, including direct investment, in facilitating development and stressed the continuing need for adequate financial mechanisms for the recycling of surplus funds. They noted that the commercial banking system had performed well in recycling funds; however, in their view, it might not be able to do so in future at levels and on conditions that would not impose intolerable debt service burdens. They agreed that international financial institutions should play an expanding role in the recycling process. In this connection they drew attention to the proposal of the Commonwealth Group of Experts for the establishment of appropriate guarantee facilities which would enable surplus funds to be channelled to developing countries on appropriate terms, including longer maturities. The present financial difficulties of developing countries were such that they required innovative approaches. Among other measures, Heads of Government called for consideration to be given to increased use of mechanisms such as export credit insurance and the exchange of commodities on a barter basis. </PARA>
<PARA>Trade and Protectionism</PARA>
<PARA> 58. Heads of Government expressed their anxiety over the trend towards increased protectionism. Aware of the importance of expansion of world trade to economic recovery and growth, they agreed that governments should make further efforts to reduce tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade and to achieve international agreement on effective rules covering resort to emergency safeguards. They noted that little progress had been made in eliminating quantitative restrictions against certain categories of manufactured exports of particular importance to developing countries. They noted also that the process of reducing barriers to trade in agricultural products had scarcely begun. The export of processed commodities continued to be constrained by trade barriers which escalate with the degree of processing. They welcomed the proposal for a Ministerial Meeting of the GATT and urged the Contracting Parties of the GATT to take a positive decision to convene the Ministerial Meeting in 1982 to consider these and other problems of trade faced by all countries. </PARA>
<PARA> 59. In view of their strong interest in the issues involved and in order to assist the deliberations, Heads of Government requested the Secretary-General to commission a group of independent high-level Commonwealth experts to investigate the impact of protection on developing country trade and report in time to assist governments in their preparations for the proposed GATT Ministerial Meeting. They agreed the group would examine the effects of protection on developing countries, including the impact of tariff and non-tariff barriers on industrial and agricultural products. In this respect the group should consider, inter alia, the question of emergency safeguards, and non-conventional measures which, among other things, include such matters as voluntary export restraints and orderly marketing arrangements; structural adjustment; the escalation of tariffs and trade barriers that constrain the expansion of trade in processed commodities; and the adequacy of existing arrangements for the settlement of disputes. </PARA>
<PARA>Commodities</PARA>
<PARA> 60. Heads of Government noted that unstable prices and declining terms of trade were having an adverse effect on commodity-exporting developing countries, especially at a time of recession. They welcomed the agreement to establish the Common Fund and noted that progress made to secure its implementation had been slow. They urged all governments which had not done so to take urgent action to sign and ratify the Agreement to enable the Fund to become operational as early as possible and to contribute to its Second Account. They took note of the limited progress made in establishing effective international commodity agreements and urged governments to intensify their efforts to establish such agreements. They asked the Secretariat to give priority to identifying ways and means to expand processing in developing countries and to measures to maintain and improve commodity export earnings, and also to study the need for the adoption of a global scheme for the stabilisation of commodity export earnings. </PARA>
<PARA>Energy</PARA>
<PARA> 61. Heads of Government re-affirmed their conviction that the energy situation required short, medium and long-term measures to be undertaken within the framework of wider international economic co-operation. Such a policy must ensure adequate returns to exporters of oil and secure supplies to consumers. Oil prices should be set in such a way as to avoid sudden major increases, and at levels which would encourage production and conservation. Within this framework, immediate consideration should be given to devising special arrangements to meet the energy needs of low-income countries facing difficult balance of payments problems. They welcomed the concessional arrangements for the purchase of oil introduced by several oil exporting countries including Commonwealth members, Nigeria and Trinidad and Tobago, for designated groups of developing countries and urged that consideration be given to their wider application. </PARA>
<PARA> 62. Heads of Government emphasised the urgent need to devote sufficient resources for the development of conventional and new and renewable energy sources. They recognised that some progress had been made at the UN Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy held in Nairobi, and that some governments had offereed to provide increased assistance for energy development. They noted in this connection, however, that there was no agreement on an appropriate multilateral financing mechanism. Mindful of the large increase in investment required for energy development in developing countries, they called for substantial additional multilateral provision of resources supported by both the industrialised and oil-exporting developing countries for the development of conventional and non-conventional energy sources. In this regard they supported the proposal for the establishment of an energy affiliate within the World Bank. </PARA>
<PARA> 63. Heads of Government underlined the importance of meeting the technical assistance requirements of Commonwealth developing countries in energy development, particularly in respect of programs to disseminate technology and to provide the necessary training facilities. In this context they noted the proposal under examination for a Centre for Research and Development on new and renewable sources of energy within the United Nations system. They believed that the Commonwealth could play an expanded role in providing technical assistance for the development of conventional and non-conventional energy in Commonwealth countries. They asked the Secretary-General to examine the possibility of strengthening Commonwealth efforts in this field. </PARA>
<PARA> 64. They noted with interest the work that was being done through the Commonwealth Regional Renewable Energy Resources Information System (CRRERIS). This system, which was established as a result of a decision of the New Delhi Commonwealth Heads of Government Regional Meeting, made available information on renewable energy technology. In this context they welcomed the Australian Government's offer to make available to all Commonwealth countries, information and experience through the CRRERIS. </PARA>
<PARA>Food Problem</PARA>
<PARA> 65. Heads of Government were disturbed by the continuing precarious state of world food security and the persistent food shortages in many developing countries. An urgent need was a dependable system of world food security. They agreed to make greater efforts to secure the early establishment of an international grains arrangement with effective economic provisions which would safeguard the interests of both exporting and importing countries while recognising the special needs of developing countries, to reach agreed food aid targets and to provide adequate food reserves, including emergency reserves. They also emphasised the importance of replenishing the resources of the International Fund for Agricultural Development and the World Food Program to levels necessary to enable them to discharge their functions effectively. </PARA>
<PARA> 66. Heads of Government recognised that the ultimate solution to the world food problem lay in greater food self-sufficiency in developing countries. They stressed the importance of measures to provide essential agricultural inputs on reasonable terms. They emphasised further the special importance of appropriate domestic policies and strategies including the pricing and marketing of agricultural products. </PARA>
<PARA> 67. Heads of Government endorsed the recommendations of the Commonwealth Ministerial Meeting on Food Production and Rural Development held in February 1981 in Dacca. They recognised that the Commonwealth should mobilise its resources and experience to assist its developing members, and act as a catalyst for effective use of wider international assistance. They agreed that there was need for an enlarged Commonwealth role in agricultural project identification, preparation and management, the management of fisheries resources, the preparation of food strategies, training, improvements in food storage, the reduction of post-harvest losses, and ensuring the increased participation of women in food production. They requested the Secretary-General to give priority to work in these areas through technical assistance activities in response to requests from member governments, and welcomed offers of additional financial and institutional assistance from Commonwealth Governments. </PARA>
<PARA> 68. Heads of Government welcomed the decision of the Australian Government to establish the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research and the decisions of the Canadian Government to establish an International Centre for Ocean Development and a training program for agricultural extension workers which would reflect the important role of women in agricultural production. They recognised that these initiatives would contribute to the effectiveness of an enlarged Commonwealth food production program. </PARA>
<PARA>Regionalism</PARA>
<PARA> 69. Heads of Government recognised the dynamic character of regionalism of which the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference (SADCC) was the most recent manifestation. They noted with satisfaction the support provided by Commonwealth countries and the Secretariat for regional efforts and agreed that they should continue to assist regional and interregional co-operation. </PARA>
<PARA> 70. Heads of Government noted in particular the useful contribution made to Commonwealth co-operation by the Meetings in Sydney in 1978 and in New Delhi in 1980 of Commonwealth Heads of Government in the Asia/Pacific region. They noted that the Meetings had significantly contributed to co-operation and had become established as useful and regular forums for exchanges between Commonwealth countries of the region. They further noted the important areas in which practical co-operation between members had commenced-namely trade, energy, industry, and combating terrorism and the traffic in illicit drugs. </PARA>
<PARA>Island Developing and Other Specially Disadvantaged Countries</PARA>
<PARA> 71. Heads of Government discussed the special problems faced by developing and other specially disadvantaged member countries. They noted with concern the particularly difficult economic and trading situation which currently faced small, poor states because of their limited human and natural resource endowment, small size and specific transport and energy problems. It was agreed that these countries needed special measures of support. </PARA>
<PARA> 72. The importance of measures to assist island states in developing their resources within their Exclusive Economic Zones was recognised as being of crucial importance to their development efforts. </PARA>
<PARA> 73. Heads of Government noted that the Special Action Programme approved in Lusaka had been of some benefit to these countries but that much more needed to be done within the Commonwealth and on a bilateral basis to help alleviate the problems of these states. Heads of Government noted the offer by the Government of Australia to fund appropriate facilities in New York to enable Pacific island states not presently represented to maintain representation at the United Nations. They also noted the initiative within the Pacific to establish a regional advisory service. The Governments concerned agreed to consult to formulate more detailed proposals. </PARA>
<PARA> 74. Heads of Government requested the Secretariat in consultation with member countries to strengthen further Commonwealth assistance to small island and other disadvantaged member countries. </PARA>
<PARA>Women and Development</PARA>
<PARA> 75. Heads of Government noted with satisfaction the establishment of a unit on Women and Development in accordance with the decision reached at their Lusaka Meeting. The unit was already doing valuable work, especially in the smaller states and in helping to upgrade the status and broaden the experience of those working in women's bureaux. Recalling that this unit was established to advance the interests of women in the Commonwealth through exchanges of experience, training programmes and other activities, they expressed the hope that its services should be used increasingly by government agencies as well as by non-governmental organisations which are concerned with matters of interest to women. It was recognised that if women are to benefit from Secretariat activities, governments wil need both to ensure their inclusion as participants in conferences and workshops and actively to search out suitable candidates for scholarships and training programmes. </PARA>
<PARA>International Year of Shelter for the Homeless</PARA>
<PARA> 76. Heads of Government noted with satisfaction the proposal made by the United Nations Commission on Human Settlements at the meeting held in Manila in April 1981 for an International Year of Shelter for the Homeless, and the recommendation made by the Economic and Social Council at its meeting in July 1981 to declare 1987 as the International Year. Heads of Government expressed their support for this recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA>International Year of Disabled Persons</PARA>
<PARA> 77. Heads of Government acknowledged that their Meeting was taking place in the International Year of Disabled Persons, and noted the related activities being conducted by the Commonwealth Secretariat and by member governments. </PARA>
<PARA>CFTC</PARA>
<PARA> 78. Heads of Government, reaffirming that the Commonwealth Fund for Technical Co-operation should be assured of the resources required to exploit the many comparative advantages of Commonwealth functional co-operation, welcomed the arrangements for the Fund's restoration, replenishment and governance, made by its Board of Representatives. In particular, they agree that the level of activities carried out by the CFTC should be restored by 1983-84 to the level attained in 1978-79 as a basis for future growth, and expressed their satisfaction that indications from major and minor contributors suggested that the necessary resources would be made available over this three-year period. </PARA>
<PARA> 79. In order to foster wider awareness of the Commonwealth among its peoples and as a contribution towards the financial stability of the CFTC, Heads of Government agreed in principle to the proposal for a special Commonwealth stamp issue every five years. Stressing the necessity of every Commonwealth country participating, they authorised the Secretary-General to prepare, for consideration by governments, detailed plans for the first issue which would commemorate Commonwealth Day in 1983. </PARA>
<PARA>Commonwealth Youth Programme</PARA>
<PARA> 80. Heads of Government noted with pleasure that the Commonwealth Youth Programme had continued to make a valuable contribution to the development of national youth policies and programmes and expressed satisfaction with the results of the restructuring of the Programme requested by them at Lusaka in 1979. They stressed the importance of ensuring that the Programme's resources should not be allowed to fall below their present level if the current planned level of activities is to be sustained. To this end, Heads of Government agreed to endeavour to maintain the value of their contributions in real terms. </PARA>
<PARA>Commonwealth Foundation</PARA>
<PARA> 81. Heads of Government expressed satisfaction with the valuable work of the Commonwealth Foundation and approved the recommendation of its Board of Trustees that the Foundation be accorded the status of an international organisation by the host government. Noting with appreciation that the budgetary target approved in Lusaka in 1979 had almost been reached, they agreed that governments should endeavour to maintain this level of funding for the present. </PARA>
<PARA> 82. Heads of Government expressed their warm appreciation to the retiring Chairman, Sir Adetokunbo Ademola of Nigeria, for his services to the Foundation over the last four years. They appointed Dr Muhammad Abdur Rashid of Bangladesh as the new Chairman. </PARA>
<PARA>Human Rights</PARA>
<PARA> 83. Heads of Government considered the Report of the Commonwealth Working Party on Human Rights and reaffirmed the importance which all Commonwealth governments attached to the observance of human rights. They urged those governments which have not yet done so to accede to relevant global and regional instruments on human rights. They endorsed in principle the recommendations of the Working Party concerning the establishment of a special unit in the Secretariat for the promotion of human rights within the Commonwealth, subject to agreement being reached on the appropriate method of financing the unit. They requested the Secretary-General to consult further with member governments on an agreed definition of human rights within the Commonwealth context as well as of the unit's functions. They took note of the Working Party's proposals for an Advisory Committee for the protection and maintenance of human rights and asked that these should be further considered by the next meeting of Commonwealth Law Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA>Student Mobility</PARA>
<PARA> 84. Heads of Government reaffirmed that student mobility and educational interchange within the Commonwealth were important to the national development efforts of Commonwealth countries and to maintaining Commonwealth links. While noting the factors contributing to the situation, they recognised that there was widespread and serious concern that the recent very substantial increases in overseas student fees in some countries were creating impediments to the movement of students and teachers between member countries. They expressed their appreciation of the Report of the Consultative Group on Student Mobility within the Commonwealth and urged that early and sympathetic consideration be given to the implementation of its recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA>Communication and the Media</PARA>
<PARA> 85. Heads of Government welcomed the Report of the Commonwealth Committee on Communication and the Media. They expressed satisfaction with the operation of the Commonwealth Media Exchange Fund and noted the Secretariat's proposals to broaden the scope of its application. They noted with appreciation the contributions by the Governments of Australia and Britain to the Fund and welcomed offers of additional support from other governments. </PARA>
<PARA>Culture</PARA>
<PARA> 86. Heads of Government expressed appreciation of the work of the Commonwealth Institute and commended it to all member countries. </PARA>
<PARA>Commonwealth Employment/Labour Ministers Meeting</PARA>
<PARA> 87. Heads of Government noted a proposal by the Commonwealth Trade Union Council for a meeting of Commonwealth Employment/Labour Relations Ministers at the time of the International Labour Conference, and requested the Secretary-General to make arrangements for such a meeting in 1982. </PARA>
<PARA>Report of the Secretary-General</PARA>
<PARA> 88. Heads of Government commended the Eighth Report of the Secretary-General and noted with appreciation the progress made in various areas of Commonwealth activity since their last Meeting. </PARA>
<PARA>Next Meeting</PARA>
<PARA> 89. Heads of Government, recognising the growing contribution which the Commonwealth is capable of making to the solution of world problems, reaffirmed the importance which they attach to their biennial meetings and the opportunity which such meetings provide for consultations aimed at forging a consensus on some of the major issues facing the world. </PARA>
<PARA> 90. Heads of Government accepted with pleasure the invitation of the Government of India to hold their next Meeting in India. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, the eight-day $20m Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting has concluded in Melbourne. I have stated on record many times in this House and outside my views about the Commonwealth. I do not propose to go over them again. I remind honourable members, however, that there has been, unreservedly, commendation of the role of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in relation to the settlement in Zimbabwe. That commendation stands in spite of the querulous comments made by some other members of the Commonwealth in the course of the past couple of weeks which found their way into the media.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What has happened is that probably the most significant spectacle to occur in this country in the post-war period has been completed. There is no disputing the conscientious nature of the declarations which were constructed by members of that conference and one does not in any way quibble about the hope, as distinct from the optimism, which rests behind those declarations. I stress the difference between 'hope' and 'optimism'. I suspect that, for the developing countries of the world, optimism is a quality that has long run out of any momentum. It is now more a matter of hope. Even hope recedes in the face of events internationally. The United States of America, the most powerful economy in the world, has declared that there will be tougher responses by it, through pressures applied to international institutions like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in relation to the provision of aid for developing countries. That is scarcely an encouraging prospect. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition endorses the tough statements opposing racism, commercial imperialism, unequalled trade and development relations and interference in the domestic affairs of developing countries. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, there has never been any dispute about these matters on the part of the Opposition. However, there has in the past been conflict between members of the conservative coalition parties, in government and the opposition, and the Labor Party on these issues. We commend the Prime Minister on this recent conversion. Late as it is, it is just as welcome. We defend his declarations, in spite of the open hostility of a large number of back bench members of the Government towards the views he puts. We agree in relation to Namibia and Poland, the need for the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan and Kampuchea, and the right of African nations to exercise their sovereign independence and be free from outside interference. </PARA>
<PARA> We endorse the need for urgent action on the law of the sea and the views of the South Pacific countries, endorsed by the communique from Melbourne, that nuclear testing ought to be ended in that area of the world. It is a pity that the Prime Minister did not evidence as much enthusiasm on this matter when the Deputy Leader of the Opposition raised it in this Parliament. It is not now a case of easing back into the big comfortable chair in the corner, suffused with the warm inner glow of having achieved something. Now is the time for action. Over the decades in the post-war period there have been too many instances of major international conferences carrying quite moving and impressive motions of intent and commitment after which there has been no real action. If rhetoric were gold there would be an avalanche of riches tumbling on all the Third World countries today from the preceding fortnight in Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall illustrate the point about hope and optimism. I came to the Parliament in 1961. We were then in the full flush of enthusiasm about the decade of development. It was said that within 10 years one per cent of the world's gross domestic product from the developed countries of the world would be transported through a redistributional process to the developing countries. The formulations were exciting. The prospects were ecstatic. Within a decade the developing countries of the world would be very largely at the take-off stage, some well beyond that. The problem of world poverty would be receding. This has never happened. In spite of so many instances of declarations of intent in the succeeding years and the formulation of grand and exciting international policies for the amelioration of the difficulties of developing countries in the world the progress has been dismally, disappointingly slow. </PARA>
<PARA> There can be no quibbling about the Australian Labor Party as a democratic socialist party being firmly committed to mechanisms which will lead sensibly and practically to the redistribution of wealth and opportunity in the world from the well-off nations to the less well-off nations. Having said that, I repeat that there must be action to follow up what has been transacted in rhetoric at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Melbourne. One approaches this matter with some reservation as to just what may happen when one reads in the media criticisms expressed by leaders of Commonwealth countries as to what will be achieved. The Prime Minister of Vanuatu, Father Lini, expressed reservations, according to the Sydney Morning Herald of 6 October, about the way in which the Melbourne Declaration had been drafted for the Commonwealth meeting. He said that he would agree slightly with the New Zealand Prime Minister that the announcement of the Declaration had perhaps been premature. In fact he was saying more than that. Mr Seaga of Jamaica said that he thought that the Declaration was, quite frankly, a waste of time. Mr Mahathir, the new Prime Minister of Malaysia, in the Far Eastern Economic Review of 25 September, said:</PARA>
<PARA> I feel that we can achieve more here in the country than at such meetings which are just talk and very little progress. </PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister of Fiji, Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, said CHOGM had been full of good philosophies and good intentions, but very little action. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> What is glaring, however, is that we have done very little to find effective solutions. </PARA>
<PARA>They are only a small selection of the reservations which are being expressed by leaders of Commonwealth countries who participated. In the circumstances, it is not unreasonable for people such as myself to express concern that this may be a duplicated exercise similar to so many exercises internationally in the past when grant declarations were carried and the resulting follow-up, at best, limited. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two key thrusts by which Australia will be judged as to whether its credentials are genuine-aid and trade. Whilst there is no dispute between this side of the House and the Government in relation to the condemnation which the Prime Minister properly and persistently expresses on racism in Southern Africa-he persists with that condemnation in spite of the efforts of some of his colleagues on the back bench to undermine him-there are vast differences between the Government, the conservatives, and the democratic socialist Labor Party on the issues of aid and trade. Australia will be seen to stand or fall on these two issues. It will be seen either as a bellows, constantly gushing out windy platitudes, or, if substantial practical action follows that conference, a forge for reshaping world attitudes, policies and commitments to the lesser developed countries. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at aid under this 'progressive reform Government inspired by the Prime Minister'. I put all that in inverted commas to show the appropriately clumsy irony which covers it. Let us look at Australia's performance. In 1975 the then Labor Government expended 0.65 per cent of gross domestic product on official development aid. We were on the threshold of fulfilling our commitment to be one of the few countries in the world providing 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product as official development aid. What has the average been since? It has been 0.45 per cent of gross domestic product. Let me put that into measurable terms, quantifiable dimensions. If the Fraser Government had maintained the level of spending on official development aid that the Labor Government had established by 1975, even if it had forgone the objective we set ourselves of reaching the United Nations declared target of 0.7 per cent and had just stuck to the point we had reached, it would have spent $1,720m more in its five Budgets than it actually spent. This year, to buy off a little pressure and to use lucre to try to get a bit of respectability back and when moralising on this issue the Prime Minister said: 'We will provide an extra $100m for official development aid.' He did not do it last year, the year before, the year before that or the two years before that, but he proposed it this year as the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting was to be held in Australia. The public and international observers are justified in being cynical about the motivation. Let me amplify that. Even by providing the extra $100m, he still falls more than $300m below the level that would have been provided if 0.65 per cent of gross domestic product had been the commitment of the Government consistently throughout its term of office since 1975. There is no commitment by the Prime Minister in terms of a concrete timetable that within a specified period we will provide, according to our commitment to the United Nations objective, 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product in official development aid. A Labor government would do so and it would do so within one term of Parliament. We would firmly commit ourselves to the second step of official development aid-that is, one per cent of gross domestic product-by, at the latest, 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> How good is the Government's record? How genuine can it be regarded in relation to the North-South dialogue which, I point out to honourable members, is a softer proposition than the new international economic order? The new international economic order proposes a series of hard international reforms. Some of them would have practical difficulties but overall they would make a valuable contribution to alleviating the difficulties of developing countries. I refer to an article by Neil Dias Karunaratne entitled 'Australia and the Challenge of the New International Economic Order.' He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Australia, after much vacillation in 1978, gave its support to the Common Fund (CF) for establishing buffer stocks after the United States gave its assent to the CF in principle. </PARA>
<PARA>That is, we had to wait for the Americans to send us a letter by air mail telling us that it was appropriate to support the Common Fund. The Fraser Government could not make an independent determination on the matter. Mr Karunaratne went on:</PARA>
<PARA> Australia's financial commitment to the CF as a trade-weighted GNP ratio would be only US$25 million or 0.4 per cent of the initial US$6 billion required to set up the CF. </PARA>
<PARA>We were not exactly busting ourselves. Therefore, it is difficult to comprehend why there was such opposition initially to giving support to the proposition and then subsequently such reluctance to moving with celerity towards a conclusion to this. I tell the House why we ought to move with celerity-because there are advantages for Australia as a primary producer. I quote again from the article, which states:</PARA>
<PARA> Australia, which is a primary producer par excellence, receives nearly 70 per cent-</PARA>
<PARA>Nearly 70 per cent, mark this-</PARA>
<PARA>of her export earnings through primary commodities. The benefits that would accrue to Australia by implementing commodity stabilisation schemes are enormous. </PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that on our record we do not stand too well in relation to this sort of matter. What it boils down to is the fundamental philosophical difference between conservatives in the coalition parties and radicals in a democratic socialist party like ours. We believe in government intervention because we do not believe that the market forces, certainly not internationally, work in a fair and regular way. We have transnational corporations dominating more than a third of the world trade, and something like another third of the world trade being regulated by international cartels. Market forces certainly do not operate internationally when the rate of real price increases for the products of industrialised countries far outstrips the rate of price increase for the produce of developing countries. That means those countries have to work harder. They have to produce greater volumes of their commodities to buy the tractor they need or to buy the pump they require for water redistribution. The Government is opposed to that sort of intervention. Is there a quibble about it? I quote the remarks of the Treasurer (Mr Howard) on 29 November 1979 when he was giving an assessment of the new international economic order and extolling the virtues of the Treasury's view. The Treasurer's Press release states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Treasury paper suggests that to approach the subject in these terms-</PARA>
<PARA>That is, endorsing it-</PARA>
<PARA>is to misunderstand the fundamentals of economic development and the economic interests of developing countries themselves, including the benefits to be obtained from an interdependent international economic system. The thrust of the paper's argument is that the proposals for an NIEO, and the thinking on which they are based, generally represent-</PARA>
<PARA>Mark this-</PARA>
<PARA>an inappropriate and misconceived approach to the problem of raising standards of living in developing countries . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer went on to condemn the new international economic order proposals for emphasising government intervention rather than the operation of market forces. I do not have enough time to quote fully this significant extract from a document by the Treasurer. It explains the hypocritical, sanctimonious posturing of certain members of the Government. On their record they have been seen to be abysmal and on their statements they have shown a flat opposition to the sorts of things that the Prime Minister is now trying to moralise upon. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the actions of the Prime Minister on things like debt relief. The disasters in the past two decades have been caused, firstly, by the way in which the Johnson Administration in America sought to pay for the ill-conceived Vietnam commitment by printing bank notes, which flooded the world with liquidity, which forced up inflation, which undermined the economies of, indeed, all countries of the world but particularly the non-oil producing developing ones. That resulted in prices in the member nations of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries going up to offset inflation. It was not because the Arabs were scoundrels, albeit commercial scoundrels. They had to face the fact that in real terms American economic policies were disastrous for them. </PARA>
<PARA> Now in the wake of all this we have the highest real interest rates in the world. The burden of interest rate repayments is more crippling for developing countries than any other single economic pressure contemporaneously or in the recent past. Why does the Government not talk about that? Why does it not commit itself to a mandatory code on the conduct of transnational corporations, on a common fund, and push ahead with it in a determined fashion? It received the okay in 1977. It has not proceeded much farther since. We have not heard about the allocation of special drawing rights, two-thirds of which go to the developed and the oil producing countries and the least of which go to the developing countries which have the greatest need. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard no discussion about the nonsense of the 'trickle down' effect in developing countries' economies, the idea that strong economic development in developed countries, especially by major capital investment programs, will automatically lead to a vast improvement in the economies of those countries and then the benefits will trickle down. The only countries in the developing part of the world where this has happened have been countries where there has been direct intervention-Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong and South Korea, to mention the four of them. For the rest of the world the evidence is, in fact, that real per capita income for people has gone back. </PARA>
<PARA> There is posturing on the issue of trade. Let me remind honourable members? On 9 May 1979 at the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in Manila the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> What we must do now is to look beyond the MTN towards the reduction of barriers of all sorts to the freer flow of goods. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on with this ringing declaration of virtue. Only a few weeks later on 16 July in this Parliament, we had a statement from the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch), a report of which stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Industry and Commerce, Mr Phillip Lynch, and the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, Mr Wal Fife, announced today that the Government had decided to extend by one year the current three-year program of assistance for the textiles, clothing and footwear industries. </PARA>
<PARA>There is a fundamental conflict in what he was talking about. Only a few weeks after that initial UNCTAD declaration, honourable members will recall, the Treasurer came into this House with a packet of interim economic measures, one of which was to impose Customs duties on all imports to this country where Customs duties did not apply already. The CHOGM paper which was circulated by the Government states that there had been a 40 per cent reduction in nominal assistance to manufacturing industry between 1968-69 and 1978-79 and that there had been a 12 per cent reduction since 1973-74. A 70 per cent effective reduction in protection between 1968-69 and 1973-74 took place in 1973-74 due to a 25 per cent tariff cut, for which the then Labor Government was responsible. The movement in protection subsequently has been appallingly small-no more than a couple of percentage points. The significance of that is that the Prime Minister said in opposing this:</PARA>
<PARA> For every additional car, every additional washing machine and every additional television set that comes into Australia, Australians are being put out of work. </PARA>
<PARA>I accept that there has to be a restructuring in manufacturing industry but it has to be done sensibly. But the crude broad axing of tariffs is not the solution. We will be better off if we have more export oriented industries. But the Prime Minister is the man whom I am seeking to nail on this for his double standards, inconsistency and, frankly, for the sanctimonious nonsense and hypocrisy we have seen on an unparalleled scale in this Parliament. On his record he cannot be believed as having a genuine commitment to the aid and trade needs of the developing countries of this world. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner I was reminding the House that one of the functions of these Bills is to provide for half indexation of personal tax rates for the current financial year-in other words, to provide a reduction in the rate of tax which would have applied had there been, of course, no tax indexation. There is no doubt that in the following year there will be a need for reductions in the rates of income tax if, in fact, a similar or even better concession is to be introduced next year. The important thing we must realise is that the activities of the Government in recent times has, in fact, enabled such significant concessions to be allowed in the following year without disrupting the economy after a very difficult six years because there is no doubt that reductions in income taxes can flow only from either cuts in government spending or a switching to other taxes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The present Bills include, as I said, provision for a reduction in the rates of income tax for the current year as a result of the part indexation of tax. But, of course, much more is needed and, I trust, will take place next year. There is now an early prospect of achieving these further reductions, but only because of the achievements which we have managed in the last few years. When people complain about the rate of tax, I think I have demonstrated that, in effect, their complaints are fairly unrealistic in relation to the rest of the world in particular. I think we have to realise that the total government tax revenue in the current fnancial year as a result of the Bills that we are now discussing will rise only by about 5.3 per cent in real terms after we take inflation into account. That is the lowest rise for three years. Certainly, of course, it is far lower than the rises in real terms that took place in two of the Australian Labor Party's three Budgets. The same situation, of course, goes for the indirect taxes which I mentioned earlier where, in fact, the increase of 3.7 per cent in real terms in the current Budget is far lower than the 5.1 per cent of the previous year. The 3.7 per cent rise, even after taking increased sales tax into account, is the lowest rise in indirect taxes for four years. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems extraordinary that we have had this massive campaign alleging huge and disruptive increases in indirect taxes, particularly through the sales tax, when, in fact, this year's rise is to be the lowest, in real terms, in four years for indirect taxes, and for total tax revenue is to be the lowest real rise for three years. So, it does put in a real perspective the absolute rubbish being talked in the tax debate in this country about what has really happened to taxes under the present Government. I should stress also, of course, that the latest rise in indirect taxes of only 3.7 per cent in real terms, compares to, say, an 8 per cent rise in real indirect taxes in Mr Hayden's last Budget as Treasurer in 1975. In other words, the rate of rises in indirect taxes in the current year is less than half what it was under the Labor Party's last Budget. Yet, honourable members opposite come into this place and cry crocodile tears about the impact of indirect taxes. What a load of bunkum. </PARA>
<PARA> The other prospect that we have of reducing taxes is if we can, in fact, hold down government spending. There is no doubt that rises in government spending have been held down dramatically, having been cut under the present Government by 84 per cent from Labor's average rise in its three years in office. I think people do not realise, when they talk about this Government being a big government, that really what they are talking about is not any increases in spending by this Government but really increases in revenue to make up the enormous gap between revenue and expenditure that developed during the Labor years. While the Fraser Government's spending has gone up only by a total of $1.5 billion in six years in constant terms-that is, in 1974 dollars-its revenue has had to rise by three times as much in order to close the gap when Labor increased its spending by a massive $2.1 billion more than the revenue it raised, so opening up a deficit that caused inflationary chaos in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that our tax revenues have risen under the present Government. They had to in order to pay the Whitlam bill, to close the gap that, at last, closed in the current Budget after six year. But only one-third of this revenue rise of $4.5 billion in 1974 terms-that is, constant dollars-over the six years of the Fraser Government's Budgets has gone to finance $1.5 billion of the Government's own spending. The remaining two-thirds-that is the rest of all this revenue-of the enormous revenue rise has had to go to pay the Whitlam bill. So, the present Government, in tax terms, has had all the pain of collecting the money that should have been collected along with the enormous rises in spending of the previous government and has had very little of the pleasure involved in handing the money out to the people and in financing its own undertakings or its own projects for the people of Australia. Only one-third of its total revenue rises has gone to finance its own capacity to provide money to the people. Two-thirds has had to pay the bill that the Whitlam Government refused to pay when it brought its favours without paying the bill. </PARA>
<PARA> It is extraordinary that many people, including, for example, some at the Sydney Morning Herald, have accused the Government of being a big spending government when, in fact, on the basis of the enormous revenue it has had to collect, that revenue has gone to pay other people's bills. The significant thing is that these bills are now paid. Next year we will have the capacity to introduce cuts in income taxes, provided, of course, a fair degree of our revenue is fed through indirect taxes. As I pointed out before the suspension of the sitting for dinner, there is nothing immoral, indecent, obscene or unfair about indirect taxes. Pensioners, as I said, will be totally protected-in fact, doubly protected-against sales tax rises because of automatic indexation to rises in the cost of living which we, in fact, introduced for pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA> I will concede, however, that there are some problems in the tax situation. On these I think I am inclined to disagree with the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) in his reasoned speech. He said that he did not agree with the mining industry which is most concerned about some sections of the changes in the mining taxation. I make the point that there have been continual changes in the situation affecting the mining industry in the rates of depreciation. It seems to be most unfortunate to impose on an industry this kind of continual change and particularly on an industry which is required to plan many years in advance when it undertakes a major mining project. On a similar basis I am concerned about the retrospective impact of some of the sales tax changes in the anomalies list. I am not referring to sales taxes that will affect things like clothing, footwear and so on which, I have demonstrated, are not unfair to lower income groups at all and certainly are not unfair to pensioners who will be totally protected from them because of their cost of living adjustments. I am concerned, however, about retrospectivity in the sense that many items had been ordered and largely paid for but not delivered within some of the anomaly sales tax corrections. There are, in fact, people who will face enormous additional costs because of, I think, an unintentional impact of the sales tax rates. I commend the Bills to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume) who preceded me in this debate used this trilogy of Bills to provide himself with a platform from which he could again expound the discredited opinions that he has expressed tonight and on previous occasions in relation to sales tax. The honourable member for Macarthur has claimed that lower income earners within the community pay a smaller proportion of their income in the form of sales tax because, as he put it, the wives of workers buy $20 dresses but the wives of the affluent buy $200 gowns. It is remarkable that the honourable member for Macarthur should find himself one out as far as these questions are concerned, because no reputable opinion in Australia would agree with the position which he has adopted. I will have an opportunity later during this debate, when I turn to one of these three Bills, to refer to some of the figures that he mentioned in relation to taxation. At this stage I will comment briefly about two of the Bills. As the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) has indicated, the Opposition will not oppose two of these three Bills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first Bill-the Income Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3)-is designed to give effect to proposals that were announced in detail on 16 July last year. It deals with the threat to company tax revenues that is posed by the growing practice of public company groups organising their affairs to eliminate company tax on some of their income. The practice involves the transfer of profitable assets, particularly investments in property, to unit trusts. In addition, of course, this Bill also seeks to achieve other purposes. The particular purpose involved here is to reduce the effectiveness with which public companies can pursue tax avoidance. In this connection the Bill proposes to treat unit trusts, which have been formed for this purpose, as if they were companies and the income earned by these public trusts will be taxed at 46c in the dollar-the same as public companies. Also, the distribution of income and profits from these unit trusts to the units holders will be taxed as if they were dividends being paid by public companies to their shareholders. </PARA>
<PARA> The chief reason the Opposition does not oppose this Bill is that we support any action, and we will support any action which this Government takes in any attempt to reduce tax avoidance in Australia. I will give some figures which indicate the possible extent to which tax avoidance practices are being undertaken by the corporate sector in Australia. Between 1965-66 and 1981-82 the proportion of total tax which was paid by the corporate sector fell from 19.3 per cent to 13.7 per cent. It is significant to note that if, in this financial year-1981-82-companies paid the same proportion of total tax which they paid in 1965-66, they would pay $7,289m. In fact, the corporate sector, by way of company taxation, will pay only $5,170m. The shortfall in this contribution from the corporate sector to Commonwealth revenues of $2,119m must be made up. It is made up. It is being made up by that section of taxpayers in Australia who do not have the opportunity to pursue forms of tax avoidance that are being pursued by other income earners, including the corporate sector. I refer, of course, to wage and salary earners-the pay-as-you-earn taxpayers, the people whose contributions to total individual tax during that same period increased from 67 per cent to 82.7 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> There are certain aspects of this Bill which do cause me concern. The Bill will extend the existing gift provisions of the income tax laws which confer deductions for gifts of the value of $2 or more to specified funds or institutions. One of two extensions in this provision will authorise deductions for gifts made after 30 June 1981 to the Victorian Arts Centre. Again, the Opposition does not oppose this provision. In fact, tax deductions of this kind which encourage institutions such as the Victorian Arts Centre are supported by the Opposition and variations of that type of provision would be pursued by us. But there have been too many cases of tax avoidance by artificially inflating the value of gifts made to institutions of this kind. There have been examples of works of art of various kinds being hawked from one person to another. The documents of sale show a continuing increased appreciation in the value of those particular items. So without any real expense being incurred by the so-called donors of these works of art to various institutions, by the time they are donated their inflated value results in considerable tax savings for those people who are hardly acting in any socially responsible way. I am concerned about this matter and I would appreciate it if we could be given advice during the course of this debate or subsequently about a recent case which concerned the Victorian National Gallery. Of course that case is very well known to honourable members and to members of the community generally. For example, as a result of manipulations of this kind, pre-Columbian art acquired in Mexico was inflated from an original purchase value of $1m to $2.7m. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The tax relief provided by the particular items which were donated provided $2.7m to those people who were acting in what they would like the public to think to be a responsible way. Of course it was nothing of the kind. I would like some indication to be given as to what progress, if any, has been made by the Australian Taxation Office in attempting to close those loopholes. When that incident concerning the Victorian National Gallery was being considered, the Treasurer (Mr Howard) indicated that the Taxation Office would look at these types of actions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One other aspect of this Bill to which I will refer is that it, probably more than any other measure in recent times, indicates the Government's absolute and complete confusion and lack of consistency in tax matters. This concerns particularly the provisions for capital expenditure on the development of a mine or an oil field. Prior to 1974 there was a 100 per cent deductibility for investment expenditure in this area in the first year. In that year the Labor Government applied the write-off to a period of 25 years. These are the changes which have occurred during the last six years of the current Government. In 1976 the period of write-off was reduced to five years. In 1981-this year-as a result of the decisions made following the razor gang's inquiries the period of write-off was increased from five years to six years. In the same year, 1981, as a result of the provisions of the present Budget, the period of write-off will again be increased to 10 years, unless, of course, it is qualified by the estimated life of the mine being less than 10 years. So any mine which started in 1974 would have been subjected during the intervening period to four separate write-off periods. Also the legislation refers to deductibility over 10 years. But that is not exactly what it appears to be because rather than having 10 per cent of the original capital expenditure written-off each year so that the total is written-off over 10 years, in fact it is applied by allowing 10 per cent of the diminishing value to be written-off each year. The result is that it will take over 30 years to write-off the full 95 per cent. If the mine ceases to operate within the period, then the remaining amount can be written-off. But it is not in fact a provision for the write-off over a 10 year period, as the legislation may suggest. </PARA>
<PARA> During the inquiry into the mining industry by the Industries Assistance Commission, the Australian Mining Industry Council recommended 10 years to 12 years for this purpose. The Western Mining Corporation Ltd and Conzinc Riotinto of Australia Ltd recommended 7 years to 10 years to the inquiry and the IAC settled finally for 15 years. Of course, that became the recommendation to the Government. In the face of that recommendation, the Government now has applied a write-off period of 10 years. I know that the mining industry has expressed some concern about that but, in light of its own recommendation to the IAC that the period be 10 years to 12 years, I cannot find a great deal of substance in the concern which the mining industry is expressing at present. </PARA>
<PARA> The second Bill, the Income Tax (Companies, Corporate Unit Trusts and Superannuation Funds) Bill, is also supported by the Opposition. This is simply a machinery Bill to impose tax formally for 1981-82 on the 1980-81 incomes of companies, superannuation funds and some unit trusts which are subject to the provisions of the Bill to which I have just made reference at the rate of 46 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The third Bill of this trilogy is the Bill which the Opposition opposes. It will continue to oppose provisions of this kind. This Bill is certainly essential to the Budget, but the Opposition has expressed its concern on previous occasions and will continue to make public its concern about the way in which continuing decisions by this Government have been responsible for the burden of the total taxation being increasingly applied to the shoulders of those sections within the community who are least able to bear the burden. The Opposition is becoming increasingly intolerant, as is the Australian community, as it becomes better informed and more aware of exactly what is involved. We oppose this Bill and we are proud of the position that we have adopted in relation to it. We do not need to explain our position but this Government has a damned great deal to explain as far as its position is concerned. We cannot and will not give any support to proposals which contribute to the constant shift of the tax burden on to the shoulders of pay-as-you-earn taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, since 1965-66 the proportion of total individual income tax paid by pay-as-you-earn taxpayers has grown, as I indicated earlier, from 67 per cent to 82.7 per cent during the current financial year. If PAYE taxpayers this year were to pay the same proportion of total individual tax as they paid in 1965-66, they would be paying less than $14,000m. In fact pay-as-you-earn taxpayers will be paying this year in excess of $17,000m. That $3,000m extra which has been dragged out of the pockets and the pay envelopes of PAYE taxpayers is made necessary because of all the corporate tax dodgers and individual tax dodgers who are ripping off the Treasury and the Australian people to an increasing extent as every year progresses. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to that, a sales tax extension is provided for in legislation accompanying the Budget. This year it will rip off another $900m from the Australian people. Despite claims to the contrary by the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume), these contributions will be made mainly by pay-as-you-earn taxpayers. Since 1960-61, the percentage of total tax revenue provided by personal income tax has grown from 36.4 per cent to 55.2 per cent. Since 1965-66, net paid taxation as a proportion of all wages and salaries has increased from 11 per cent to 20 per cent. Let me repeat that point: The proportion of total wages and salaries in 1965-66 which was taken from those wage and salary earners by way of income tax was 11 per cent. It is now 20 per cent. So the burden continues to increase. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer has claimed that in the current year the Government is applying half tax indexation. That is not correct. The claims in relation to tax indexation that have been made by this Government and by successive Treasurers since this Government came into office in 1975 have not been correct either. For example, in 1976-77 full tax indexation was supposed to apply. After all the discounting for items like indirect taxes, adjustment in health schemes and revaluation, the percentage indexation which was applied was 93 per cent. In 1977-78, it was supposed to be full indexation again. In fact the index which was applied was only 80 per cent. In 1978-79, half in- dexation was to apply. To normal people, half indexation means 50 per cent indexation. In fact after all the discounting had been applied it was 35 per cent. In 1979-80, indexation was abandoned altogether. In 1980-81, half indexation was supposed to apply again. Again, to reasonable people, that means 50 per cent. In fact that year 39 per cent was applied. The same type of thing is going to occur this year, the last year of indexation, that system of taxation which according to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Treasurer (Mr Howard) was supposed to keep the Government honest with the taxpayers money. During this year half indexation will mean considerably less than 50 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> If we start just from 1977-78, when the number of steps in the progressive tax scale was reduced to three-I will not go back to the year when the Government originally claimed it was going to apply tax indexation-had 100 per cent full in- dexation been applied in every year since then, in the current year the tax-free threshold would be about $5,400 a year. That means that any taxpayer in Australia earning less than $5,400 of taxable income would pay no tax this year, had full taxation income been applied in the last three years. But, as a result of the failure of this Government to apply full tax indexation, the tax-free threshold will be $4,195, which means that all those people who earn between $4,195 and about $5,400 this year will pay tax which they should never have had to pay had full tax indexation been applied. Of course, this will bring into the basket of taxpayers thousands of low income earners all over Australia. Of course, they include pensioners. Pensioners who earn up to the allowable income level will now find themselves in this tax paying group. They are people who should never be taxed. They are being savagely ripped off by this Government. They are becoming increasingly aware of it. I have indicated that the Australian community is becoming increasingly aware of the justice, equity and simple fair play which apparently escape this Government. The Australian people know it. A couple of weeks ago in New South Wales there was a massive and record victory for the Australian Labor Party. That victory will be repeated in Victoria in 1982, and in 1983 it will be repeated federally because the people of Australia will not continue to tolerate the sort of injustice and inequity which is being perpetuated and persisted in by this Government. Members opposite might as well come over here now and feel the comfort of the Opposition seats, because in 1983 this Government will go down the national gurgle hole. </PARA>

I represent a lot of Aborigines in Maranoa and I think this matter is important to us. A lot has been said of late about this group of people within our society. Lang Hancock has had a bit to say. I do not necessarily agree with everything he has said. I believe we are incurring more than adequate special expenditure. The Commonwealth's contribution now totals $234m. It is quite ridiculous. I believe that unfortunately it is mitigating against some of the things we are trying to do for those people. In fact we are putting them in a position in which racial tension is building up against the fact that we are giving them too much as a special group.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a shame that the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Ian Cameron) cannot have an extension of time. I am sure it would ensure that the Australian Labor Party would win that seat. The 1981-82 Budget, the sixth Budget of the Fraser Government, promises many things to Australia: A rise in inflation, increased interest rates, higher taxes, reduced services, a reduction in living standards and no reduction in unemployment. Honourable members should look at the effect of government policies on ordinary family living standards. For the family purchasing their own home, government decisions in the short space of one month this year have cost each family at least $35 per week in increased costs. This is made up of $15 per week for increased payments to meet interest rate rises on home mortgages, $10 per week for health and hospital coverage for the family and now approximately $4 per week as a result of the imposition of sales tax on the necessities of life. The total increase in costs is at least $29 per week. To earn an after-tax increase income of $29 a wage and salary earner would have to receive a $40 per week rise. Thus under this Government in one month alone the ordinary family has had its standard of living reduced by between $35 and $40. What compensation has it received for this reduction in buying power? Will services to the community be increased? No. In fact health, education, urban affairs, social welfare and many other services have been drastically reduced. Will the tax burden be eased? No. In fact the Government is collecting 22 per cent more in revenue from pay-as-you-earn taxpayers this year. In total the Government will collect another $5,300m in taxes from the Australian people in the next 12 months. For the person on the average wage this means that this year an extra $11.10 in tax will be extracted from the weekly pay packet. Today I warn the Government that it cannot continue to get away with this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Honourable members opposite should listen because in two years time they will find that my words are true because ordinary Australians are at last waking up to this gross deception and neglect by the Government. Already in several cities there have been spontaneous rallies and marches, mainly by women, because of these Government imposts. My office, for example-it would do honourable members opposite well to listen to their constituents-has been inundated with letters and calls, mainly from women, I must say, expressing their total opposition to these savage cuts in their living standards. I will tell honourable members why I receive complaints from women. It is women who are feeling the effect of this Budget because in the great majority of cases it is they who balance the family budget and who notice that the housekeeping money does not buy as much any more. It is they who have to explain to their children why they cannot have the same food, the same clothes and goods as they had last year. I wish to read extracts from a few of those letters from my constituents. This one is dated 9 September 1981 and it most clearly expresses my point about the Budget. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Mrs Kelly,</PARA>
<PARA> Although I am a working single parent and average $230 per week, my net take-home wage is $170 (i.e. after tax and superannuation.). As I have two mortgages plus a number of other commitments associated with living and bringing up two children and running a car to be able to get myself to work in time and yet not qualifying for the increased child endowment, I am finding it impossible to manage with the extra burden of health insurance and increased prescription charges. Until now my doctor kindly classified me as disadvantaged and with a minimum of visits to him we were able to manage. A few weeks ago we thought we were lucky in that we were granted a long awaited pay award of 4 per cent, which made an approximate difference of $12 per fortnight take-home pay. However, as the Government has seen fit to take it away through health insurance, and to hell with the increase in the price of food, electricity, rates, petrol, etc., how can they justify themselves by saying that the Budget was reasonable since we all had a national pay award recently. They may be able to fool some of the people some of the time but definitely not all of the people all of the time. </PARA>
<PARA>Another example is a letter from a woman, sent to me before the Budget was announced. She said:</PARA>
<PARA>At present I earn $161.00 (gross) per week in a casual part-time job . . . which allows me to see the children off to school each morning and be home when they return in the afternoons. I also receive a part widows pension of $29.00 per week and family benefit of $8.00 per week. </PARA>
<PARA>She went on to list for me her average expenditure on items such as food, mortgage repayments and car running costs. All that expenditure amounts to $185. She said:</PARA>
<PARA>Thus, out of a gross income of $198 per week $185 is already committed, leaving $13 for clothing, toys, household maintenance, entertainment, babysitters for night outings . . . and any other needs we might have. The prospect of paying some $600 per year . . . for medical care equal to that we have at present fills me with horror as we will then be left with only $5.00 per week uncommitted income. </PARA>
<PARA>That is an example of a person earning $161 a week, but what of those who earn less than that, who fall below the Henderson poverty line-the pensioners, the lone parents, the invalids? How can they possibly cope? The short answer is that they cannot cope. They go without adequate food, accommodation and medical care. How will families such as the one which sent me the letter which I have just read make ends meet after the latest Federal Budget attack on family living standards? I think the difficulty of their situation was highlighted today in an article which appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald, which demonstrated that a single income family with two dependent children is paying up to 81 per cent more tax in real terms than it was paying six years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> What about indirect taxes? The imposition of sales tax on a wide range of ordinary necessities of life has been universally condemned by consumers, manufacturers and retailers. The Australian Labor Party unequivocally opposes sales tax because it is an inequitable form of taxation. Sales taxes have the greatest effect on low income earners and constitute a regressive form of taxation. They do not apply equally to all people. Those on fixed and low incomes are hardest hit by such consumer taxes. Those taxes are not incurred by choice; they apply to a wide range of common goods required by all of us. People have to buy basic necessities such as shoes, clothing, gloves, hats and towels. The thrifty person who wishes to avoid purchasing ready made clothes and soft furnishings will find that this Government has also taxed yarns for knitting and sewing; it has even taxed knitting books. </PARA>
<PARA> Home buyers are faced with an average price rise of $500 on the cost of building materials because sales tax has been extended to apply to most building materials. When the home buyer has managed to pay for the building, he or she finds that taxes have been increased on the cost of fitting out the house with the ordinary requirements for daily living, such as cooking stoves, electrical fittings, baths, showers, et cetera. The thrifty householder prepared to forgo modern amenities and to look for a cheaper lifestyle has been thwarted as the Government has increased taxes on fireplaces and grates, household washing coppers and all related accessories. Even if a person could avoid purchasing all those items, no one could avoid paying higher prices for food. That is due to the increased sales tax on packaging. Waxed and greaseproof paper, paper bags, aluminium foil, string, rubber bands, even sticky tape now have been subjected to increased sales tax. What next! People who seek to escape all this and seek solace in literature and magazines find that they also are to be taxed. I believe that that is a pernicious tax as it strikes at the heart of civilised society by taxing the dissemination of knowledge. </PARA>
<PARA> All those sales taxes place a totally unjustified burden on the consumer. The Budget Papers show that in a full year sales tax increases will raise $892m, equivalent to $60 a person. For a four person family that represents $240 a year or $4.60 a week. That may not seem to be a great deal to honourable members opposite or to those who can avoid and evade taxes, but for all wage and salary earners who cannot deduct the cost of the long lunch or the car from their taxes, $4.50 a week added to the increase in interest rates and health costs, plus the increased tax burden, all add up. Wage and salary earners are making a record high contribution to the taxation coffers-an increase of a staggering 22 per cent. To put that in context, the average tax that will be paid next year by each member of the labour force will be close to $3,100. That means that next year each member of the labour force will pay a massive $500 more in tax. At the same time as the Government collects more and more revenue, it provides less service to the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> In particular, the Budget is bad for women. In the areas of health, housing, education, training, employment, taxation and social welfare services, women are seriously disadvantaged. Despite the fact that we are all paying more and more taxes, those services for women have been reduced. The Government has employed a strategy of withdrawing from providing services, leaving private individuals and organisations to step in, thus creating extra burdens for women. It is women who care for the aged and the sick, who do the hard work in fund raising for charities and parents and citizens bodies and other voluntary work. Increasingly, as this Government abrogates its responsibilities in the provision of services, it is women without income who continue those services.</PARA>
<PARA> The Budget fails to provide adequate funding for women's refuges, rape crisis centres and other services. The Federal Government, by abrogating its responsibilities in those areas, has ensured that many of those services will collapse altogether. By handing over to the States responsibility for those services while at the same time reducing the allocation for State health programs, this Government is fully to blame for any loss of those facilities and the women of Australia will hold this Federal Government accountable. In the area of health, women will be most seriously disadvantaged by the increased cost of health care as they are much more likely to be clients of health services than men are. Women with children and aged women are the greatest users of health services, but at the same time they are the lowest income earners in society. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to employment, the Budget contains no program or strategy aimed at reducing the extremely high unemployment levels for girls. In education and later in training and employment schemes, women are disadvantaged. The draft scheme which encourages employers to take on apprentices does not specifically encourage female apprenticeship. Currently, over 90 per cent of apprentices are male and it is patently obvious that the current arrangements discriminate against women. The Government should take immediate steps to guarantee equal access for women to apprenticeships and other training schemes and to all areas of employment. Employment opportunities determine incomes. Without access to the higher paid employment areas, women will continue to comprise a disproportionate percentage of those on low incomes and social security benefits. Budget figures on the taxable incomes of males and females show that, whilst 90 per cent of men earn less than $30,000 per annum, about 90 per cent of women earn less than $15,000 per annum. About two-thirds of those who rely on social security benefits for the major proportion of their income are women. Thus women are over-represented among the low income and social security recipient groups. </PARA>
<PARA> The Fraser Government's magnanimous gift to the Australian family has been to increase the family allowance for those with three children or more. I congratulate it on that move but it applies only to a small percentage of Australian families. Seventy-four per cent of Australian families miss out. Seventy-four per cent of families receive no extra benefits. This Budget continues the trend of the last five years, whereby the real value of the family allowance has fallen dramatically. If the family allowance had been indexed it would now be 75 per cent higher than in 1976, making the family allowance for two children $14 a week instead of $8 a week. </PARA>
<PARA> The family allowance is of great importance to women since it is the women who largely have the responsibility for rearing children. Meredith Edwards of the Canberra College of Advanced Education has recently completed a major study on the financial arrangements within families which highlights the importance of the family allowance to women. Edwards found that the family allowance helped an overwhelming majority of women as managers of family finances in making ends meet, or in providing them with a measure of economic independence. The decline in the real value of family allowances over the past five years has hit women the hardest as they struggle to cope with family budgets and rising prices for the necessities of life. </PARA>
<PARA> For the majority of women the family allowance is their only independent source of disposable income to buy goods and services for themselves and their children. But this Budget continues this trend of the last five years by allowing the erosion of the real value of family allowances. The value of this cash transfer which is so important to women has been reduced by 75 per cent during that time. But in the same period the real value of the dependent spouse rebate, a tax benefit mainly for males, has increased by 23 per cent. Family allowances and the dependent spouse rebate each cost the Government about the same amount-approximately $1 billion. But the emphasis should be on the provision of benefits to families and children. After all, the period of greatest financial burden to families occurs when they are raising children. Thus it is the family allowance which I believe should be increased. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a new form of poverty in Australia today. Even people on so-called comfortable incomes are feeling the pinch. The average family budget cannot absorb the massive increases forced on it by this Government in the form of high interest rates, expensive health insurance, increased pay-as-you-earn taxation and sales tax on the ordinary necessities of life. On top of this, the wage indexation system has been dismantled causing further deterioration in the financial status of wage and salary earners. This Government has demonstrated that the promise of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in 1975 to reduce the tax burden is a massive deception. The reality of the situation today is that the Fraser Government is the highest taxing government in Australia's history. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a contribution to this Budget debate by saying something about the Office of the Auditor-General. The position of Auditor-General has been part of the system in Australia since 1901; one of the early Bills passed after Federation established that position. I think it is generally accepted that the Auditor-General has a role to play as the Government auditor. That was probably the principal role that was envisaged for the Auditor-General when the Bill was passed in 1901. But since that time there has been a significant change in the emphasis on the work carried out by the Auditor-General, such that as we look at that Office in the 1980s we see that he is fairly heavily involved in the role of assisting in the accountability of the bureaucracy to Parliament. It is that second role that interests me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the interesting facts that emerges when one looks at the Auditor-General, his office and his role, is that there is no input from the Parliament as to what the Auditor-General will look at and the sorts of things that he will examine. The only involvement in the Parliament is after the event when the Joint Committee of Public Accounts looks at the report that he tables in the Parliament. The Public Accounts Committee and the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure look at efficiency audit reports. </PARA>
<PARA> The relationship between the Auditor-General and the Parliament, I believe, should be the subject of much greater analysis and discussion. Many of the aspects of the relationship I think ought to be considered. One of these would be the fact that the Auditor-General is a public servant. The members of his staff are public servants. There is a transfer into and out of the Audit Office of public servants from other Commonwealth departments. The Auditor-General is subject to the Public Service Board and to policies such as staff ceilings. The Auditor-General is subject also to the budgetary processes in the same way that other departments are. Without being in any way unkind about it, it is true to say that the Auditor-General is a part of the bureaucratic establishment. I just wonder whether that limits in any way the role that some of us who are in parliament may see as being the sort of role the Auditor-General can or should play in relation to that second function, which I indicated in my opening remarks, in assisting the Parliament in playing a part in improving the accountability of departments and authorities to the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that it is not the case in all similar countries that their auditor-generals are in the same situation as that of the Auditor-General in Australia. I would like to develop this point a little. I probably will not get as far as I would like to tonight but I would like to give some extracts from a seminar which was sponsored by the Public Accounts Committee entitled 'Government Expenditure and Accountability' and which was held in Canberra last year. The following are some quotes from the then Auditor-General, Mr Steele Craik. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . although I have been described from time to time as an officer of the Parliament, I regard myself as an officer of the Crown. My situation is summarised neatly in a recent Green Paper on the role of the United Kingdom Comptroller and Auditor-General where it said:</PARA>
<PARA>'The Comptroller and Auditor-General is an officer holder under the Crown, subject to removal only on an address from the two Houses of Parliament. Like members of the judiciary, he is not subject to control either by Parliament or by the Executive in the exercise of his functions. His main duty is under the Exchequer and Audit Acts undertaken 'on behalf of the House of Commons'. He is not however a servant of the House although he has been frequently referred to in those terms'. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Steele Craik went on to say that his Office assisted the processes of accountability to the Parliament by the Executive and the public service. He said that his special independence gives the Auditor-General a unique role in the processes of parliamentary scrutiny of the financial and administrative efficiency of the Executive. He further said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Parliament exercises its influence over the Executive in a number of ways . . . especially when the annual and additional estimates are being considered and through scrutiny of monies expended against the appropriations approved by the Parliament. The latter is where the Auditor-General comes in. His reports provide a source of independent and impartial information for use by the Parliament in its review function. </PARA>
<PARA>He said also:</PARA>
<PARA>I stress the pursuit of improvements in the quality of public administration as the aim of my office. </PARA>
<PARA>There are some differences and at least one significant difference-between the Australian and United Kingdom positions, that is, that the Comptroller and Auditor-General of the United Kingdom does not make recommendations. This is done by the Public Accounts Committee after consideration of his report. Constitutionally, public audit is seen as an independent function through the Comptroller and Auditor-General as a servant of parliament. Although the Comptroller and Auditor-General is independent of Executive control in most issues, the numbers, pay and conditions of service of his staff are subject to the approval of the Civil Service Department and the Treasury, as is the case in Australia. However, in the event of disagreement he may report to the parliament and have the situation considered by the Public Accounts Committee.</PARA>
<PARA> The Canadian Auditor-General reports to the House of Commons and, unlike either his British or Australian counterpart, has express statutory authority for the personal management of his office, including the determination of terms and conditions of employment and the responsibility for employer and employee relations. The Commonwealth Auditor-General, by virtue of section 25 (4) of the Public Service Act 1922, has the powers of a permanent head of a department in relation to the staff under his control. Thus, apart from the control exercised by the Public Service Board over the appointments and staffing levels and the scrutiny of his financial estimates and expenditures pursuant to section 48 (K) of the Audit Act, it may be said that the Auditor-General is independent of Executive control. </PARA>
<PARA> The Auditor-General cannot be said to be answerable to Parliament in the sense that a departmental permanent head is answerable to his Minister. Rather, the Auditor-General is answerable to Parliament in a broad sense in that he is under a statutory obligation to report annually and in special circumstances provided by the Act. He can be removed from office only on address from both Houses of Parliament to the Governor-General. In 1980 the British Government produced a Green Paper on the role of the Comptroller and Auditor-General. This Green Paper represented the first stage of the Government's review of the Exchequer and Audit Department Acts. One of the three main questions discussed in the Green Paper was what should be the Comptroller and Auditor-General's status in relation to Parliament and the Executive. At paragraph 56 the Green Paper stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Comptroller and Auditor-General is an officeholder under the Crown subject to removal only on address from the two Houses of Parliament. Like members of the judiciary he is not subject to control either by Parliament or by the Executive in the exercise of his functions. His main duties under the Exchequer and Audit Department Acts are undertaken 'on behalf of the House of Commons'. He is not, however, a servant of the House although he has been frequently referred to in those terms. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable members will recall that that is the same quote as the one that the former Auditor-General in Australia used in relation to his own position. At paragraph 58 the Green Paper said that the Exchequer and Audit Department Acts give the Civil Service Department control over Exchequer and Audit Department staff numbers and gradings. The parliamentary committees of expenditure and procedure considered this an unacceptable degree of Executive influence over the Comptroller and Auditor-General's work. Those committees recommended that the staff should become or be regarded as servants of the House with the Department's costs borne on the vote of the House and that the House of Commons Commission should assume responsibility for the numbers and gradings. The Government rejected the view expressed by the two parliamentary committees and said, in effect, that the present situation should remain and that if matters were not being handled appropriately the Comptroller and Auditor-General, being independent, could report to Parliament. It is interesting that the Green Paper was a Government document. It obviously expressed the views that the Government would like to have expressed on the relationship that the Comptroller and Auditor-General in the United Kingdom should have with the Executive and the Parliament. The committees of the Parliament took a different view which, obviously, did not succeed with the Government. At paragraph 60 the Green Paper stated:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . as for the Comptroller and Auditor-General himself, the Government considers that independence in the exercise of his responsibilities and in deciding on the disposition of his staff resources and on audit priorities is of fundamental importance to a national auditor. The nature and balance of his work under the statutes should not be subject to direction from any quarter. </PARA>
<PARA>I would not want to argue with that. I think, as I made clear at the beginning of my speech, that the role of the Auditor-General as a national auditor is completely apart from the role he has in relation to the Parliament and his accountability. At paragraph 61 the Green Paper stated:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the Government believe that the Comptroller and Auditor-General's independence would best be safeguarded if he remains an officeholder under the Crown and is not and does not become regarded as a servant of the House. </PARA>
<PARA>The Green Paper notes at paragraph 62 that the expenditure and procedure committees suggested that the Comptroller and Auditor-General should undertake inquiries if requested to do so by the House of Commons or any of its select committees. That is the situation in the United States of America. Any such power to direct the Comptroller and Auditor-General, the British Government said, would entail an undesirable limitation of his independence. Among its conclusions the Green Paper contained the following:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the role of the Comptroller and Auditor-General should be:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) to provide a basic financial and regularity audit of departmental accounts;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) to undertake an examination of the economy and efficiency with which public funds are spent and</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) in appropriate cases to investigate the effectiveness of programs and projects in meeting established policy goals . . . </PARA>
<PARA> (g) the independence of the Comptroller and Auditor-General of both the Executive and the Parliament should be reaffirmed and there should be no change in his status as an officeholder under the Crown. </PARA>
<PARA>I will now make a few remarks about the General Accounting Office in the United States of America. The Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 established the United States General Accounting Office. The Act provided for the appointment by the President of the Comptroller-General of the US, such appointments to be made with the advice and consent of the Senate. It also provided that the GAO should be under the control and direction of the Comptroller-General and independent of the Executive departments. By providing that the GAO was to be independent of the Executive departments, the Act transferred power from the Executive of the legislative branch and gave Congress new means to guard against lax or improper spending of government funds. The Comptroller-General was given virtually unqualified power in the internal management of the GAO. Such a broad grant of power to the head of a government agency has few precedents in American history. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1966 Elmer B. Statts was appointed Comptroller-General for a period of 15 years. It was during his term of office that the GAO developed its current role and its emphasis in auditing activities swung gradually to program evaluation. I now refer to the current function of the GAO. The GAO comprehensive audit manual includes, as part of the accounts function of GAO audits, the following:</PARA>
<PARA> (b) to assist the Congress and federal agency officials in carrying out their responsibilities by providing them with objective and primary information on the conduct of government operations together with the conclusions and recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA>Some GAO activities, such as financial audits of government corporations, are required by law. Others are responses to requests by chairmen of committees and sub-committees of Congress. Some are requested by individual members of Congress. The majority of reports-about two-thirds of them-are initiated within the GAO on the independent authority of the Comptroller-General. About one-third are initiated by Congress. </PARA>
<PARA> It is difficult to equate the role of the GAO to any one organisation of other parliaments. It would appear that its tasks amount to an amalgamation of some of the functions carried out in Australia by the Auditor-General's Office and parliamentary committees, such as the Public Accounts Committee, the Public Works Committee and the various Senate Estimates committees. However, in terms of staffing, management, accountability to the legislature and relationship to the Executive, the only approximate analogy would appear to be that of a super ombudsman whose concern is the nation's welfare as a whole, rather than individual rights. There has also been a reasonably recent report in Canada. The Wilson report on the role of the Auditor-General in 1975 took the view that it would be a great mistake for the Auditor-General to attempt to conduct efficiency and effectiveness studies. It took the view that the danger was that because of the lack of consensus about data and methodologies for the Auditor-General to carry out those studies he would inevitably embroil himself in political controversy so intense as to threaten eventually the office itself. On another occasion I would like to develop some more thoughts about the Canadian situation. </PARA>
<PARA> In the time left to me I will make some remarks on the Australian situation, particularly following the report of the Coombs Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration. There is a lot of material in that Royal Commission about the Auditor-General. Following the Commission's report there was an interesting article written by Professor Gordon Reid in the Australian Journal of Public Administration, volume 35, No. 4, December 1976. Professor Reid dealt with two directives to the Royal Commission which were not part of the terms of reference of the Royal Commission but were specifically mentioned in the supplementary schedule of subject matters as matters to which the five Commissioners were to give particular attention. They were:</PARA>
<PARA> (c) parliamentary scrutiny and control of administration;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) responsibility and accountability of public servants, and their participation in forming policy and making decisions;</PARA>
<PARA>Speaking of parliamentary scrutiny and control of administration, Professor Reid said:</PARA>
<PARA> It was highly questionable whether a Royal Commission should be charged to inquire into the functions of an elected Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>Instead of having a joint committee of the parliament to inquire into the Public Service, parliamentarians were faced with a royal commission charged with the responsibility to inquire, amongst other things, into the Parliament. Neither House of Parliament nor any official of the Parliament made a submission to the Royal Commission or was examined as a witness. The Royal Commission in chapter 5 'The Administration and Parliament' does not come to grips with the essence of the subject. Professor Reid says that there is no inquiry into what parliamentary scrutiny may mean in modern government, what it could achieve or the several meanings that could be given to parliamentary control. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no discussion of the implications of parliamentary financial control for modern budget formulation or what would be an appropriate range of parliamentary committees to facilitate the Public Service's management needs. Reid says that by and large the Commission ignored the implications of this reference in recognition that it had much more to say on the next one, that is, responsibility and accountability of public servants. After dealing with this question of responsibility and accountability of public servants, Reid finishes up by saying that the crucial question remains: What will be the procedures for accountability by which officials may be called upon to report and justify their performance and be rewarded or penalised? Also, who is to be the final judge?</PARA>
<PARA> Professor Emy and the Royal Commission agreed that the Auditor-General should be empowered to conduct efficiency audits throughout the Commonwealth Government administration, extending to all agencies which he audits in respect of financial regularity. The Commission recommended that such efficiency audits incorporate some of the provisions currently listed in section 17 of the Public Service Act as applying to the Public Service Board. Reid says that the allocation of authority to conduct the continuing efficiency audit is one thing, but more important is the question of whether that statutory officer-the Auditor-General-will command the authority or status necessary to enable him to bestow awards or to impose penalties and to achieve intended effects. </PARA>
<PARA> It is curious that, notwithstanding the alleged dissatisfaction with ministerial responsibility, it is expected that the Auditor-General will use the authority of Parliament to impose his judgments. For example, it is recommended that the outcome of the audits of efficiency should be presented to Parliament and that there should be a specially designed parliamentary committee on administrative and executive efficiency, having a special relationship with the Auditor-General, and that, whilst this committee should have its own parliamentary secretariat, it should be advised on professional matters by the Auditor-General and his staff. Reid argues that, notwithstanding the apparent radicalism of the concept of accountable management, the alleged dissatisfaction with ministerial responsibility and the elevation of the Office of Auditor-General to provide tests of efficiency, the everyday sequence of vesting responsibilities, measuring performance and demanding accountability in government still rests finally upon the authority of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> It is obviously not possible for me to continue these remarks at this stage. Time is against me. I would like to open up that debate. I hope that we might be able to carry it further at some later time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I commend the thoughtful contribution of the honourable member for Hume (Mr Lusher). I would like to respond to some of the points which were brought up repeatedly in this House by the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume) throughout the sittings of this Parliament and the last Parliament and the issues that are before us tonight in this debate. He frequently defended the disastrous economic policies of his Government. I thought of describing this as navel contemplation-I think the medical term for it is omphaloskepsis. That is the sort of attitude he conveys to me when he goes rambling on about what wonderful economic policies the Government has given us. For example, this evening he advised us that the $2 1/2 billion deficit of the Hayden Budget in 1975 meant that we were living beyond our means. That has been well refuted over and over in this place and in other parliaments around the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member said that it has taken the present Government six years to pay the Whitlam bills or, to quote other words that he used, to combat the inflationary chaos. He mourned the fact that the Government had been forced to do this unpopular thing without having the luxury or the kudos of being able to return much of its record revenues to those to whom he referred as the people. There are many comfortable fallacies in this argument. It is a fallacy that a Budget deficit means living beyond our means. Any responsible home buyer, farmer or small businessman, unless he is very fortunate and falls into money by receiving a legacy or winning a lottery, or the like, has never succeeded in achieving that independent status without taking some sort of an overdraft or borrowing some money. The Whitlam Government very responsibly undertook in this country development works which are responsibly undertaken by governments at all levels-local governments; state governments, federal governments and, indeed, at times by the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund or whatever-on borrowed money which is paid back over a period by those persons who have the benefit of the facilities that are bought with that capital. </PARA>
<PARA> The present Government has pushed two million Australians-a record number in terms of what today's poverty line is -below the poverty line. It has reduced the borrowing capacity of 70 per cent of income earners in Australia over the period that it has been in office. Despite modest gains in productivity, 70 per cent of income earners, after paying tax and after paying health insurance and all the other things that have been required of them by this Goverment's policies, are now worse off in terms of buying power. Of course, they are the people on lower incomes. It is the 30 per cent of people on higher incomes who by and large are better off. The honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly) tonight gave us some vivid examples from her own constituents of the problems this has created for housewives and others in balancing, in particular, the family budget. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has held up its hands in horror at the prospect of undertaking public works such as those contemplated by the Whitlam Government. It has abandoned any profitable investment to the private sector. I refer to undertakings such as the Pipeline Authority, the most imaginative construction of any government since the Snowy Mountains scheme, which in the opening stages was boycotted by Sir Robert Menzies and other conservatives as a horrible example of socialism. The Government has abandoned any kind of extension of the public sector which could be profitable for the taxpayers of Australia and, indeed, has sold it out to private enterprise, to its friends in the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Minister for Health I initiated the buying of the Fawnmac group of companies, which was a highly successful Australian family business with a very broad capacity for producing a wide range of pharmaceuticals, tablets, ampoules and the like and which supplied contracts for multinational drug firms in this country as well as for the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories. The purchase gave us a window into the drug industry, a means of talking rationally to those drug firms which negotiated the pricing of pharmaceutical benefits with the Department of Health. It allowed us to talk back to them in their own terms about what their costs were when they refused to disclose their cost structures around the world. It gave CSL a greater security in producing vaccines and biological products. Yet this Government sold it out for less than we paid for it while it was still profitable. That is the sort of back-to-front economics that this so-called, business-aware, responsible, economic management government goes on with. It disposes of its profitable enterprises to private industry. If anything is going broke in the private industry then the Government is more likely to look at socialising it as, for instance, Mr Bjelke-Petersen did with some firms in Queensland. His Government bought out shares so that the firms would not go to foreigners. </PARA>

Now we have the shortsighted razor gang capers such as confining Telecom Australia to a 10 per cent growth in capital borrowing. Telecom is one of the growth industries. It is one of the most successful industries already profitable under the Australian Telecommunications Commission which the Australian Labor Party set up. Its prices, as the Minister has told us repeatedly in this House, are set by Telecom because he requires it to make the user pay and to make it pay. He gives Telecom independence and says that he will not interfere but he interferes, of course, when it suits him, to make Telecom appear to be inefficient by putting ceilings on its staff, on its borrowings and on its spending, so creating great backlogs in the connection of services, particularly in growth areas like Gladstone where one has to wait for over a year for a telephone for a business, and this is a businessman's government.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No businessmen. Well, of course, he should look to the sort of government that there is in the State from which he comes. Perhaps that has something to do with the lack of business in Maranoa. So, Telecom is limited to a 10 per cent growth in its borrowing for the year but it is forced to pay more overtime because of the staff ceilings. what a back-to-front sort of economy that is. This happens in other areas where staff have extra work loads such as in the area of the servicing of unemployment benefits in the Department of Social Security. That Department was forced to lift staff ceilings eventually because of the overtime costs. The shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis), has frequently cited figures which show that there is now consistent correlation between deficit funding, inflation rates, tax levels, economic growth, productivity and employment. For example, the honourable member for Macarthur totally ignored the fact, in his praise of the balanced Budget, that it is purely a domestic balance. It is useless to balance the domestic Budget if the overseas trade budget ends up out of balance to an extent that it has eaten up all the gains that he has claimed are making up what he calls the Whitlam debts. We have just heard that there is a record overseas trade balance for the September quarter and we are $2,000m or $3,000m behind the predictions in the Budget. We thought, of course, that the inflow of foreign capital would be at the same rate as last year. It is down to about half.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the items of the popular mythology espoused by the honourable member for Macarthur was that the world-wide inflation, stagnation and unemployment of the early 1970s was because of the chaos of Whitlamism. The great achievement, it seems, of the Labor Government was to induce this world-wide recession. The right honourable member for Lowe (Sir William McMahon) who is, perhaps, still the most able financial brain on the Government side-I think he was, at least in 1976-in a television interview in 1976 said that half the inflation of the early 1970s had come from capital inflow. Indeed, this was obvious if one looks at the figures for 1972 before the Labor Party came to office. He should know because he was on the Treasury benches and was in charge of that sort of calculation. Then, after the Labor Government came to office, there was an inflow of $4,000m of hot money chasing safe investments following the slump in the Vietnam War boom. Australian real estate and profitable firms that were quite efficient and competent and which were competing without protection on the world market were bought up. Our key resources and industries were bought up often at exorbitant and inflationary prices. Of course, the profits now flow overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Macarthur said that his Government could not hand back revenue to the people. The fact is that it has handed back extra sums in new ways that the Whitlam Government had discontinued or did not introduce to the extent of $10,000m mainly to big business in tax concessions, investment incentives, subsidies, by cuts in the resource taxes, by gratuitous hikes in the Bass Strait oil prices and so on. Not only are Australians required to pay world prices for the new oil finds which was a policy brought in by the Whitlam Government but also the Government is giving Esso-BHP something like a five-fold increase in the prices from their previously known reserves which are still providing most of our petroleum. There has been a massive shift in the wealth of Australians so that 2,000 of the richest own as much as 2 1/2 million of the poorest Australians. That figure is increasing. It proves that the Government is creating two nations, a nation of the haves and a nation of the have-nots and that disparity is increasing. It was, of course, alleged that there would be a trickle down of the riches from the rich to the poor. But, I have already pointed out that after tax, health insurance and the like, 70 per cent of Australians are worse off under this Government despite increasing productivity and there are increasing amounts flowing overseas. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Ian Cameron" NAMEID="BF4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Maranoa appears to be under the impression that Australians eat motor cars. He says they work less hours to buy a motor car than they did years ago. They also work less hours to fly to England than they did years ago. But 70 per cent of Australians nevertheless have less take-home pay after tax and after paying health insurance than they had in the Whitlam years because of the increasing taxes and because of the decreasing services. As capital inflow slows with the resources recession, hopefully only temporary, increasing profits are going overseas so the overseas balance will get worse. Next to Canada we are the most foreign-owned of all affluent countries. Canada has moved to reverse the trend, not to encourage it as this Government is still doing. This Government knocked back less than 2 per cent of applications for the sell-out of the farm to foreign interests. I refute also the ridiculous claim of the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Ian Cameron) in this debate this evening.

They want only to be able to determine the pace and style of growth from their old and complex culture which respects the environment in its ancient, mysterious and respected relationship with them in unforced voluntary interaction with the alien, European conqueror's culture imposed on them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unfortunately I do not have very long to speak in this debate. As the last speaker for the Government at the second reading stage of the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1981-82, I will attempt to tidy up one or two matters. I have listened to the previous speaker, the honourable member for Capricornia (Dr Everingham) and to a great range of speakers on this subject. Naturally enough, there has been a fair division of opinion. The Opposition keeps calling for what amounts to a pulling down of people who are successful and who are interested in incentives in order to, in some strange form, build up the country. My view has always been that Australians perform better if they are given incentives, if they are allowed as much as possible to act as individuals and if the competitive environment in which they work can be guaranteed by governments. That is the sort of policy that I have been advocating with this Government and it is the policy that is very strongly emerging in this Budget. It is in stark contradistinction to the socialist policy of the Opposition which believes that somehow there is some incredible wisdom in it and in public servants that is superior to the wisdom of hundreds of thousands of ordinary working Australians. That is a topic in itself. I hope that by the time of the next federal election, the Australian people will get very clearly in their minds the sort of choice they will make.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When we talk about Budgets we are talking about the biggest accounting entities in our country in a single year. We are talking about incredibly large amounts of money, in this case some $40,000m in a country where total production is some $130,000m. As a proportion of the total production of Australia it is a very large amount and just standing on its own it is a very large amount. When governments frame budgets the first thing they have to decide on is how much can people afford. They also have to decide whether it is better to have a relatively large government or a relatively small one. Again that question devolves around whether we want as much freedom as possible for individuals or regulation and large government. This year we have come up with a solution which seems fairly reasonable. I have never been one for increasing taxation but I have recognised that if there are public needs that cannot be met by the private sector, if people require transfer payments from relatively well-off people-I am talking about people who require them, not just want them-and if those needs have to be met then an affluent society such as ours ought to be able to afford to spend 25 per cent to 30 per cent of gross national product on them. I am talking about transfer payments and public needs. </PARA>
<PARA> This year we are talking about some 28 per cent of gross domestic product going in the form of taxation. Thankfully this year that is the end of the bill. We do not have to raise any more money. We are roughly balancing the books. Again, whether or not we ought to balance the books is another subject that has been covered by many speakers. I support that philosophy and in all discussions that I have had with any Government member prior to the Budget I certainly urged that. Of course, there is no shortage of programs that the Australian people want in every sphere whether it be health, education, roads, what the States want or what the people want by way of pensions the arts and sport. it does not matter what region we look at; people want more programs and more money. But when people sit down and think they usually understand that we cannot have all of those things. We have to raise the tax somewhere but we do not like paying it. </PARA>
<PARA> Just look at the reaction to this Budget which in terms of taxation policy is in my view very moderate. Nobody seems to like any of the sales tax increases but everybody wants different tax scales for personal income tax. People want higher tax-free zones and greater eligibility for pensioner benefit cards. They want higher deductions for superannuation and greater incentives to invest in companies. Thankfully, that is something that is being examined. So at every turn nobody wants to pay higher tax. What I am saying is that at the moment the tax take of around 28 per cent of GDP is probably about right. It is certainly high enough and I think as a matter of judgment it is something above which we should not go in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> I referred to the size of government. This matter is dear to my heart. I conclude my remarks on the Budget on this point. Too often governments of all persuasions worry too much about companies, groups and unions and do not worry enough about people. That might sound trite or almost self-righteous, but I think this is something that we as Australians ought to think more about. We worry whether a particular company will survive. We do not seem to worry enough whether the consumers who buy the products of that company will benefit from one decision or another. We worry too much about providing monopolistic situations for unions and companies involved in scarce resources. We do not worry about providing guarantees of competition so that people can act as individuals in a freer society. Those are lofty subjects. Those are subjects which unfortunately we have lost track of to some extent in our affluent society. </PARA>
<PARA> We have lived through a thankfully relatively short period in our history when we drifted very badly down the road to socialism. When we talk about socialism we are not talking of democratic socialism because there is no such thing. Socialism cannot be democratic. It can be democratic on the day when it is set up. It is not long after that when the sort of people who sit opposite start to tell everybody in the country, through regulation and high taxation, what they ought or ought not to do. When those opposite think about it a little more they will realise that this democratic socialism that we hear so much about is utter rubbish. The two words cannot sit together. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1981 Budget puts the country a little more on track. It does not solve all our problems. Not all the problems can be solved at Government level. I believe that what the Government has tried to do this year in total is just about the best solution it could have found. I am looking forward to next year when we cut down a few more of our regulations, when we get out of a few more areas where we are not required and when we can genuinely cut taxes to individual Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have spoken already about the problems experienced by small business people in Canberra in their relations with the Lend Lease organisation. The Lend Lease organisation controls all the major shopping centres throughout Canberra with the single exception of the Belconnen Mall, which is now, unfortunately, to be sold to the private sector as a result of the razor gang's decisions. Lend Lease also controls many other buildings and office complexes, as well as the retail centres. This means that Lend Lease has a stranglehold on small traders in Canberra. The smaller retailer has no option but to rent space in a Lend Lease development.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On 25 August, Lend Lease announced that it was planning a major redevelopment for the Monaro Mall. The announcement was made in Sydney. It is very disappointing that a company which controls nearly all of Canberra's retail centres should make this announcement anywhere but in Canberra. It is indicative of Land Lease's whole attitude to Canberra that it did not see fit to present these plans in Canberra. The redevelopment project to update the Monaro Mall is very welcome. The project, worth between $5m and $10m, will assist the local construction industry and will help rejuvenate the Civic area. I am also very pleased with the most recent proposals of Lend Lease to redevelop the Jolimont site. However, the point that I want to make today is really confined specifically to the future of the Monaro Mall. </PARA>
<PARA> In the course of making the announcement in Sydney, no guarantee was given that all present tenants would be assured of a place in the new Mall. This is most unfair. Many of these tenants have put their savings and life's work into their businesses. Many have built up excellent reputations over more than 15 years of operation of the Monaro Mall. These tenants should be given a place in the new development. They should also be given reasonable leases for at least two to three years so that they can continue to plan and develop their businesses on a rational basis. Many of these tenants have been told by Lend Lease that they can have only one-month leases. This is an impossible situation for a business to be in. Lend Lease apparently has no concern for these local people who have paid rent for years and years. What these local people really want to know is what the plans are for the Monaro Mall so that they can work out where their businesses fit in and what they are planning for. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that it is not good enough just to continue with the situation of not giving them a guarantee of where they are going or outlining the plans for future development, especially at a time when Lend Lease has just released its plans for the Jolimont site. I believe that it is necessary to look at the whole of Civic as a totality in an attempt to regenerate the whole area, but what we need to do is give some guarantee to the small retail traders that they will have some sort of security in the new Monaro Mall development. There is no doubt that the Monaro Mall needs updating and revamping in order to help to re-establish Civic as the retail centre of Canberra. The way in which Lend Lease has introduced its proposals has led to a serious loss of confidence amongst small traders. Many are uncertain about their future. They are, understandably, unwilling to invest in larger stock inventories whilst they have no security of tenure. Lend Lease should immediately consult with all tenants on this project and give them the first option on a place in the new Monaro Mall. This will ensure that all existing tenants are treated fairly and will enable them to make sound investment decisions. Monaro Mall should be the focus of the central Canberra retail district and should be planned in conjunction with the local people. Lend Lease has a very special responsibility in Canberra, because of its monopolistic market position, to ensure that all small business people are treated fairly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I wish to voice my and my electors' concern about the Government's introduction of sales tax on a wide range of items-in particular, the sales tax on books. I am not alone in my opposition to the introduction and extension of such an iniquitous tax as sales tax. Nor are all who oppose sales tax on this side of the House. The extent of this opposition prevented the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) from attending President Sadat's funeral, as his presence here was required to quell the discontent of his back bench. He was defending the imposition of sales tax with hints of future tax cuts. He was explaining to his party that the underlying significance of the new sales tax is in its future over-riding importance. In other words, he was giving a clumsy hint of promise to his unhappy followers of future personal income tax cuts, a promise given by him repeatedly since 1975 but never kept. The Prime Minister's credibility on this issue is so low that one has to be a card-carrying member of the Liberal Party of Australia or a fool to believe him. Whilst he may have extinguished some burning cinders on his own back bench, the Prime Minister certainly did not allay the fears of people connected with retailing of books. Small booksellers in my electorate expressed to me their dismay at the introduction of a sales tax on books.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have a natural abhorrence of the Government's idea to tax books and publications; that is, to tax the basic medium for the flow of information. Besides the argument that the tax is a tax on information, there are many objections to such a tax on other grounds also. The pricing structure of books is such that the introduction of sales tax will result in increases of up to 12 1/2 per cent, not 2 1/2 per cent. The public will bear the brunt of the publishers' manipulation of the new scheme. Already publishers are talking about the possibility of increasing the price of some titles by $1, where the product is very attractive, and not adding any sales tax to other selected titles. The prices of books imported into Australia are converted at rates of between three and five times the imported prices. The public already objects to some dubious practices in this area and it does arouse confusion and suspicion of the retailer. With the sales tax mathematics added, breaches of conversion will be extremely hard to detect, especially for the public. Publishers will be able more easily to pull the wool over the eyes of the book buying public. </PARA>
<PARA> Books are sold to retail outlets on a sale or return basis; that is, books not sold by retailers are returnable to publishers for full credit. Later it is common for them to be resold at greatly reduced prices, a practice known in the trade as 'remaindering'. So the occasion might arise when a second amount of sales tax may have to be paid on the same books. Whether the retailer pays twice or not, the public's confidence as to whether the prices charged are justified will be undermined. </PARA>
<PARA> Small booksellers or suburban bookshops may lose their school and library accounts, often a large proportion of their turnover. Library suppliers will be exempt and will therefore be able to undercut small retailers. This situation is a grave threat to individual retail booksellers. The retail book trade is already in a crisis situation owing to the high prices charged by importers and the public's resistance to paying such high prices. Moreover, this tax will completely eliminate small bookshops. Taxing books means taxing knowledge and information. Therefore, I would argue that the proposed tax is not only impractical but also unjust and dangerous. To tax knowledge and information is to strike at the basic principles of democracy. I urge the Government to withdraw the tax. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At this stage-the first opportunity available to me in the Parliament-I want to make a few comments on the long awaited but welcome statement by the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) in announcing the composition of the soon to be established Independent Air Fares Committee. Last Friday, 9 October, the Minister issued a Press release naming Mr Kenneth F. Wraith of Melbourne as chairman of the Committee, the two other members of the Committee to be Dr Dolph Zink from Perth and the Hon. Kevin Cairns from Brisbane. Mr Wraith recently retired as senior executive of Australian Paper Manufacturers Ltd. He has held directorships in a number of companies and has extensive financial and management experience in Australian business. Dr Zink was deputy chairman of the Western Australian Post Secondary Education Commission and holds a number of company directorships. He also was Dean of the School of Business and Administration at the Western Australian Institute of Technology in my electorate for a number of years. I think his appointment is particularly pleasing in the fact that Dr Zink is a Western Australian and he certainly will be well placed to be mindful of the air fare disadvantages long suffered by long haul domestic passengers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The third member of the committee is Mr Cairns who was the Federal member for Lilley and a former Minister for Housing. He is president of the Queensland Branch of the Economic Society of Australia and New Zealand and has undertaken economic consultancy tasks for various organisations. I welcome the appointment of these three individuals to the Committee. As mentioned by the Minister, the Government decided upon their appointments on the basis of their individual qualifications and ability to carry out the tasks in an impartial and professional manner. I express my appreciation of their acceptance of what in my view will be an extremely difficult job. </PARA>
<PARA> Members and other people outside this place who are interested in domestic aviation matters will recall that the Independent Air Fares Committee which is soon to be set up in accordance with the Independent Air Fares Committee Act will be responsible for undertaking various tasks, including updating the domestic fare setting formula, adjudicating on fare increase applications by the airlines and conducting periodic cost allocation reviews which in turn are the basis for the air fare formula. My position on this matter, I think, is fairly clear in that I belong to the school of opinion that believes that proper fare setting can take place only within a true competitive environment. With the extension of the two-airline policy for at least the next five to eight years I do not believe we have such an environment, but we must be content with a regulated system and a regulatory authority which will attempt to determine fares on the basis of cost, thereby ensuring the viability of the airlines and, I hope, and in my view more importantly, in the public interest. I could not help but pass a wry smile at the headline in the Australian Financial Review of today. When reporting on this matter it stated:</PARA>
<PARA> A new bite at Holcroft cherry. </PARA>
<PARA>In fact Dr Zink was quoted in that article as saying that he expected the Committee's first task would be to determine a formula for setting air fares. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Holcroft Report got a fair way down the track but the whistle was blown on them a little early in the game . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In fact we have had two bites at the cherry. Holcroft in fact put forward an air fare setting formula and air fare adjustments were made partially on the basis of that forumla, and of course Price Waterhouse in turn reported. The question I wish to ask the Committee, on the basis of those two air fare formulas, is: What is the right formula? I put forward to the Air Fares Committee, in its initial deliberations, that there is no right formula. When we have a nationally consistent formula based on a flag fall and distance component it is obvious in the cost allocation procedure that as we weight the flag fall we favour long haul routes. Secondly, if we weight the distance component we favour the short haul routes. The Committee will have to come to grips with this insoluble problem. The second problem as, Price Waterhouse pointed out, is that the fares are set to keep the least efficient operator viable. In this case the least efficient operator happens to be Trans Australia Airlines, and in setting fares on this basis, Ansett Airlines of Australia makes a profit. I think it will be pointed out that the system is rotten and should be thrown out. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to draw attention tonight to the Government's policies of care for the elderly which simply are policies of encouraging institutionalisation, policies which are against all trends in modern research which clearly support the view that, wherever possible, people in need of care, support and general nursing, as distinct from acute medical cases, benefit far more from community care and continuing to live in their own homes. In my own electorate this Government's attitude means that many elderly residents are forced at this time in their lives to leave the beautiful environment where they have lived all their lives and move into nursing homes far from the Dandenongs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Earlier this year a report written by Ms Jan Carter, the first Australian analysis of Federal and State government policies of care of old people, was published. This report stated that thousands of Australia's elderly people are unnecessarily being kept in institutions because of powerful medical interests and government disregard. Such people could be cared for more cheaply in the community if doctors and the Government were prepared to take some initiatives. Another recent study of private nursing homes in Brisbane found that half the patients were capable of living outside a nursing home. A large body of recent research in fact has shown conclusively that between 20 per cent and 30 per cent of people in nursing homes should not be in them and that home help services, community care and rehabilitation or local hostels would be cheaper and more desirable for the elderly. I have heard of cases of people who have no alternative but to place their elderly relatives in private nursing homes and institutions. In a majority of cases these people do not need acute medical care or institutionalisation. They simply need consistent care and on tap nursing services. Once placed in these institutions, often far from their own communities, friends and relations, these people often decline in motivation and in health. As has been documented by research, those who are not sick can be placed with acutely sick and disabled people and, lacking company, lose their own independence and spirit. The only benefit the Government effectively makes available for a person requiring care in his or her own home is the domiciliary care benefit of $3 per day payable to a relative or eligible person caring for someone full time. It is infinitely cheaper for most elderly people to stay in hospital than to return home and use home nursing services. District nursing services offer home visits on a limited basis. This service operates from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. only, and works on a priority basis. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's new federalism policies, which are starving local municipalities of funds for community services such as Meals on Wheels, welfare and social work, are strained to the limit and are unable to extend any care for the elderly. Priority in service must be given to the sick or those recently home from hospital. The elderly have no guarantee of a regular secure service from their community, no matter how well meaning and overworked council employees are. In my electorate there are no community health centres or services to help out. Home care schemes are not readily available. There are relatively few special services, such as day care or temporary care, to prevent elderly people being permanently institutionalised. Lack of government support for families generally means that they have little choice but to pass off such care to hospitals and nursing homes. The situation is made much worse in Victoria where care in many nursing homes is inadequate due to overworked staff. The ratio of patient/nurse in Victoria is 10 to one, a figure which has not changed since 1939, when nursing authorities state that it ought to be no higher than six to one in this field. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that quite clearly many thousands of our elderly citizens could cope with their growing age and dependency in the secure and familiar surroundings of their own homes if they could have the security of community back-up systems and could afford the cost of having a nurse call on them, even on an hourly basis if necessary. Home nursing will never take the place of a hospital for a person requiring specialised nursing care, but it could shorten a person's stay in hospital following surgery or an acute illness. For many more, it could prevent their institutionalisation altogether. the Gvernment is ever ready to talk of individual rights and freedoms. I contend that in fact our elderly people, with the exception of the wealthy minority, are treated as second class citizens. For them life is not as normal or as full as it could be simply because of government organisation of the community. By ignoring community health and rehabilitation schemes, by cutting back funds for those organisations within the community which would be responsible for community care and by directing the vast majority of funds to institutional care only, the Government is forcing thousands of our elderly citizens to live out their final years in unnecessary isolation from their friends and neighbours. </PARA>
<PARA> Extension of grants to the States for the provision of domiciliary services to local government and voluntary organisations could lead to an extensive development of services. At present, for example, neither home help nor Meals on Wheels is available seven days a week throughout the year. Such bodies as the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Motor Accident Board have realised the benefit of taking the nurse to the patient and not the patient to the nurse. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to bring to the House's attention the case of a child care project which urgently needs and is not receiving Commonwealth assistance if it is to carry on providing very necessary services to parents and children in my electorate, in the Waverley municipality. The McNeill Child Care Centre, the problems of which have received Press publicity-most recently on the front page of the Sydney Morning Herald-is in Bondi Junction and was opened in 1978 by the then Minister for Social Security. The Centre, which is sponsored by the Uniting Church in Australia, aims to provide day care for the children of local working parents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I should add that Waverley is the most densely populated municipality in Australia, with over 71 persons to the hectare. That population includes over 2,000 children in need of day care. In that area there are over 1,000 children from single parent families and upwards of 700 single parents dependent on the supporting parents benefit. However, in the whole municipality of Waverley there is only one place for each 23 children needing day care. </PARA>
<PARA> Up to now the McNeill Child Care Centre has provided day care for 41 children for up to 50 hours a week, providing each child with lunch as well as morning and afternoon tea. The ages of the children range from 2 1/2 to five years. The McNeill Child Care Committee, which in close consultation with the parents concerned conducts the Centre, is concerned to meet the special needs of many of the children receiving day care for stimulating companionship and educative play, as well as providing kindergarten facilities; so it has employed at the centre two trained teachers and three mothercraft nurses, also fully trained. The Committee has sought also to meet the needs of very young children of single parents. There are about 200 such children in the area who often have special needs for companionship and creative play and the Committee wished also to give priority to the needs of low income single parent families. </PARA>
<PARA> With those aims in mind, a neighbouring property to the Centre, itself a former Presbyterian church renovated largely by voluntary effort, has been purchased and named McNeill House. McNeill House will cater for 12 children under the age of four years from single parent families, with priority going to low income families. Once again, the object is not just to provide child care but also to give the children stimulating companionship and play, something which the children may well be deprived of. To carry out those aims, the McNeill Child Care Committee hoped to employ at McNeill House two specially trained staff to help the children attending the Centre at this essential phase of their development. </PARA>
<PARA> I strongly maintain that that most necessary project deserves Commonwealth support, yet I find that it has not received any. The original Centre, the McNeill Child Care Centre, since 1977 has received over $64,000 in recurrent capital grants and in 1980-81 recurrent funding was over $51,000. However, the Committee, after several applications, has been informed that no Commonwealth assistance will be provided for the new McNeill House. The reason for that refusal is that the 1981-82 allocations for the Children's Services Program will be largely absorbed in maintaining existing projects and that such funds that remain for extensions to existing services, such as McNeill House, will go to projects having a higher priority than McNeill House. The result of that decision is that McNeill House is unable to commence operations, especially as it cannot hope to cater for low income families without Commonwealth assistance. I am advised, moreover, that the McNeill Centre itself has had to lay off staff, despite the continuation of some Commonwealth assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> I urge strongly that the priorities be reassessed. I put it to the House and to those concerned that McNeill House is a priority project that will fulfil several urgent needs. I remind the House that more than the bare provision of child care services is at stake here, for the aim of McNeill House is to provide essential help to children to help them overcome very possible deprivation in their personal development at a most formative time in their lives, perhaps the most formative time in their lives. Nor can we afford to overlook the very real burdens borne by low income single parents seeking to do their best for their children. Nor can we afford to close our eyes to the situation of well trained staff who will lost their present and prospective employment due to the lack of Commonwealth assistance to the McNeill project. </PARA>
<PARA> I can only repeat my very strong concern that this highly necessary project catering to vital needs in a densely populated area should receive its just due. Surely we can afford the investment for the future that we must put into providing the best nurture for our children. </PARA>

<PARA> Both Turkish and Greek Cypriots have shown in the past the ability to live together in peace. The present dislocation of the lives of nearly  1/4 million Cypriots (200,000 Greeks and 40,000 Turks) is due to the initial interference of the Greek Junta in the affairs of Cyprus and subsequent reaction of the Turkish Government to that interference. </PARA>

I would be pleased to be advised what action that committee has taken since 1975 to achieve the withdrawal of Turkish troops occupying Cyprus and whether Australia is still a member of that committee. </PARA>
<PARA> As Vice-President of the Justice for Cyprus Co-ordinating Committee of New South Wales and on behalf of the 21,630 Cyprus-born people living in Australia I would ask you, on behalf of Australia, to raise this matter at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Conference in Melbourne this year and support the United Nations' resolution on Cyprus if it is raised in the General Assembly this year rather than abstain as Australia did in 1979. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In Cyprus there are approximately a quarter of a million refugees-approximately 200,000 Greeks and 40,000 Turks. For some years now they have been separated from the area in which they lived and the area in which many of them had lived for generations. I think it was unfortunate on all counts that the problems of Cyprus were caused in the past by the interference of larger regional powers. The Cypriot people had been able to live in relative harmony for a considerable period without any of the great intercommunal strife that has occurred since 1974. In Australia at present there are over 21,000 people who have come to this country from Cyprus and who take a keen interest in what has occurred in their recent homeland. Of those 21,000 people many are Turkish Cypriots as well as Greek Cypriots. I think they all would join with me in asking the Australian Parliament and the Australian Government to play a more active role in endeavouring to resolve the Cyprus problem in international forums.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When I was in Cyprus I had discussions with people from both communities and the communities seemed to share a fair amount of agreement on a number of issues. They both seemed to feel that there was a need for some of the larger regional powers-indeed, some of the super-powers-to involve themselves in finding a solution to the problem. I was struck particularly by the unanimity among the political parties in Cyprus concerning a resolution of the problem. I think that the offer by the Greek community, if there should be reunification of the island, to disarm both the National Guard and the Cyprus Army is quite a significant offer to the Turkish community, which obviously was quite worried between 1972 and 1974 about the activities of the mainly Greek officered Cyprus National Guard. I think that a demilitarised island of Cyprus would be a great tourist attraction and would assist the economy of Cyprus. It would also be a great example to other areas in that part of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the Australian Government will start to play a larger role in the resolution of that island's problem. In recent weeks we have seen activities by the Australian Government in an attempt to defuse problems in other parts of the world. I would think that, with 21,000 people in Australia with a particular interest in their recent homeland, our Government should turn its eye towards doing something about the problem in Cyprus.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I will not detain the House. I give the usual assurance that I give to all honourable members who speak on the adjournment debate when I am the Minister on duty in the chamber. I will draw to the attention of the appropriate Ministers the Hansard extracts, when they come to hand, of the matters raised by each honourable member. All of the speakers bar one spoke on matters outside my portfolio responsibilities. I wish to comment very briefly only on the remarks of the honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly). I have heard what she said. I simply say in response that I encourage the honourable member and colleagues opposite to adopt a more enthusiastic and, if I might say so, encouraging approach to the future of Canberra. We cannot tolerate any longer the negativeness which is so clearly demonstrated in doctrinaire socialism. I ask the Opposition to join with the Minister and the Government in making the city of Canberra the finest national capital in the world.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr Howard</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Stock Exchange data provide information on shareholdings by bank and other nominee companies. These data are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Proportion of shares</PARA>
<PARA>held by nominees*</PARA>
<PARA> Company</PARA>
<PARA>As at Per cent</PARA>
<PARA>BHP  4.8.1980 17.0 Peko-Wallsend  31.8.1980 *24.1 Western Mining Corporation 29.9.1980 28.9 North Broken Hill  27.8.1980 20.6 Pancontinental Mining 26.9.1980 62.1 CSR  23.5.1980 16.7 MIM Holdings  5.9.1980 *7.3</PARA>
<PARA> * These data represent the proportions of total issued capital of the companies that are held by the nominees included amongst the 20 largest shareholdings in each company. (Data on other nominee shareholders are not available.) As such, these figures may under-estimate the actual proportions of shares held by nominees. The extent of the under-estimate may not, however, be significant as the 20 largest shareholders in these companies account for large proportions (in most cases, around half) of the companies' equities.</PARA>
<PARA> * Based on issued capital (excluding preference shares) as at 13.10.80.</PARA>
<PARA> * Based on issued capital as at 28.10.80.</PARA>
<PARA> It has been estimated that in 1979, 21 per cent of shares in BHP were held by nominee companies (P. H. Davies, 'Equity Finance and the Ownership of Shares', Australian Financial System Inquiry, Technical Paper No. 22, 1981).</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Without requiring nominee companies to disclose whether their shareholdings are beneficially owned by Australian or foreign residents, the extent of foreign ownership of nominee shareholdings cannot be determined. In those cases where the size of shareholdings of nominee companies is of potential significance for the purposes of the consideration of a foreign investment proposal against the requirements of the Government's foreign investment policy, it is the practice to seek from the participants in the proposal information as to the ownership of the nominee shareholdings, indicating whether they are beneficially owned by Australian or by foreign interests. The Paper referred to in (1) estimated that the level of non-resident shareholdings in BHP in 1979 was 21.8 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Studies cited in the Davies paper indicate that the extent of nominee holdings in Australian companies has increased in recent years.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Government and the Foreign Investment Review Board will continue to monitor carefully nominee holdings in Australian companies where these are of significance for purposes of consideration of a foreign investment proposal.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) to (7) Under section 36 of the Foreign Takeovers Act 1975, the Treasurer may require information where 'he has reason to believe that a person is capable of giving information or producing documents relating to matters that are relevant to the exercise by the Treasurer of his powers under this Act'. This power may be used in relation to foreign investment proposals that are subject to the Foreign Takeovers Act. In other cases, there is reliance upon the co-operation of the parties to the proposal in seeking any required information. As noted in the answer to (2), information as to the beneficial ownership of nominee shareholdings is sought in those cases where such information is required for consideration of a foreign investment proposal.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) The Government's foreign investment policy places particular emphasis on Australian equity participation in the ownership and control of the country's natural resources and industries. The Australian equity participation guidelines in the policy provide encouragement to Australian ownership and control of natural resource projects and the naturalisation provisions provide an incentive for companies that are predominantly foreign-owned to introduce higher Australian ownership and Australian control. The available data would appear to indicate that the level of foreign ownership in the economy has been relatively stable for several years, with the proportion of company income, after payment of tax, that is payable abroad, being around one-third. It should also be noted that the Australian equity participation guidelines are applied on a project rather than a company basis. As such, the guidelines are not primarily concerned with levels of Australian equity in particular companies, but are directed towards ensuring that appropriate levels of Australian ownership and control of natural resource projects are achieved.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) Stock Exchange data and the annual reports of the companies, indicate that the proportions of shares in each of the banks listed below that are held by each bank's nominee companies are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Proportion of shares held</PARA>
<PARA>by bank's nominees*</PARA>
<PARA> Company</PARA>
<PARA>As at Per cent</PARA>
<PARA>ANZ Bank  14.11.80 7.4 Bank of NSW  23.11.80 5.8 National Bank  19.11.80 4.1 CBC Bank  22.8.80 3.4</PARA>
<PARA> * Based on the top 20 shareholders in each bank.</PARA>
<PARA> (10) The rank, in terms of the number of shares held, that each nominee has in its parent bank is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Company</PARA>
<PARA>Nominee company</PARA>
<PARA>As at Ranking</PARA>
<PARA>ANZ Bank</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr Howard</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) (a) The Australian Electoral Office and the Australian Bureau of Statistics have provided the following answer.</PARA>
<PARA> Under the Representation Act 1905, the Chief Australian Electoral Officer is required, in the twelfth month of the life of every Parliament, to make a determination of the number of Members of the House of Representatives to be elected from each State. The determination is based on the latest official population statistics of the Commonwealth and the States supplied at the time by the Australian Statistician.</PARA>
<PARA> As the 32nd Parliament was opened on 25 November 1980, the Chief Australian Electoral Officer must make his next determination in the month ending 24 November 1981. This will be made on the official population statistics provided by the Australian Statistician.</PARA>
<PARA> Following the June 1981 Census the official population statistics will be based on the 'usual residence' information derived from that census. However, as the 1981 Census figures will not be available in time for the Chief Australian Electoral Officer to make his determination, the population statistics on which this determination is made will be those based on the 1976 Census 'place of enumeration' data. The present projections of the future populations of the States prepared on this basis do not indicate any change in the present representational entitlement of any State in November 1981. It is difficult to foresee what effect population statistics prepared on the basis of residence would have on the representation entitlement of different States.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The size of population is one factor determining the distribution between States of the tax sharing grants payable under the States (Tax Sharing and Health Grants) Act 1981. Under Section 10 of that Act the Australian Statistician determines the estimated population at 31 December each year for purposes of calculating the tax sharing grants and, from 1981-82, the population figures to be used in making that determination will be based on 'usual residence' figures derived from the June 1981 Census. This is a change from previous practice under which estimates have been based on the 1976 Census 'place of enumeration' information.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) (a) and (b) See 3 (a) above.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) (c) and (5) Preliminary projections of population figures for December 1981 based on 'usual residence' have indicated that some States will receive in 1981-82 a lower growth in their tax sharing grants than if previous arrangements had continued. In the light of the relatively large effect on the estimated tax sharing grant payable to Queensland in 1981-82 the Commonwealth agreed, at the 20 June 1981 Premiers Conference, to supplement the tax sharing grant otherwise payable to that State in 1981-82 by $9m. In addition, in accordance with an undertaking given to the Northern Territory that the Territory's grant for 1981-82 should reflect the population element contained in the Memorandum of Understanding, the Commonwealth has agreed that the Northern Territory's tax sharing entitlement in 1981-82 not be determined by reference to 'usual residence' population figures for December 1981 but will be a fixed amount of $315.1m.</PARA>

<PARA> Section 23F of the Income Tax Assessment Act does not refer specifically to commercial rates of interest or to the distinction between investment and trading.</PARA>
<PARA> It is necessary, however, for the Commissioner to pay attention to these factors in administering section 23F which exempts from tax the income of a superannuation fund which, amongst other things, is established and maintained by an employer solely for the purpose of providing superannuation benefits for employees and their dependants.</PARA>
<PARA> The High Court has suggested that when moneys placed in a fund are returned to the employer by way of loan the proper conclusion may be that the fund is not entitled to exemption under section 23F because it is not established and maintained solely for the purpose of providing superannuation benefits for employees and their dependants. This would be particularly so where the moneys are lent free of interest or at non-commercial rates. Where the trustees of a fund use the trust moneys to engage in trading activities instead of investing them appropriately, a similar conclusion may be drawn.</PARA>

<PARA> The Quarterly Average Weekly Earnings series are currently derived from information on payroll rax returns, direct returns from some government bodies and estimates of wages and salaries for employees not covered by these sources.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Acting Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) There are no provisions in the sales tax law which specifically exempt sporting equipment for use by particular organisations or individuals. However, organisations that are eligible for exemption in respect of goods for their own use, and not for sale, may obtain sporting equipment free of tax. Examples are government departments, non-profit schools and universities, bodies that promote the interests of such schools and universities or promote competitive sport among their students and public benevolent institutions. These exemptions have existed for many years. There are no equivalent exemptions for individuals.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The criteria for exemption for each kind of body varies. As a general statement the exemption from sales tax is granted to these bodies in recognition of their activities in the fields of government, education, help to the underprivileged, et cetera.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) This matter was one of the many that were examined in the course of the recent Budget deliberations. Because of the need to reduce the overall Budget deficit by almost $1,000m as part of the Budget strategy to contain and reduce inflation, all sales tax rates were increased by 2.5 per cent. In this climate it was not considered appropriate to grant a general exemption for sporting equipment.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Yes.

This forecast easing in the rate of employment growth, together with an assumed labour force participation rate similar to that evident in 1980-81, implies some rise in the level of unemployment over the course of 1981-82, although the average level for the year as a whole would be much the same as in 1980-81.</PARA>

<PARA> More recently, and in response to changing economic and social conditions, the Commonwealth has taken several initiatives to increase the opportunities for young people to train as apprentices and to gain other practical training and work experience to help them to gain employment. These latter programs pay particular attention to those who have been out of work and away from education for a long period. Total expenditure on programs designed to expand the supply of skilled labour sought by industry and to assist young people in their search for employment is estimated to increase by 22 per cent in 1981-82, to $203m.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The means test on pensions was converted to a test on income alone in 1976. In broad terms, the income test provides for the maximum rate of pension to be reduced by one-half of the amount by which non-pension income exceeds prescribed limits-$20 a week in the case of a single person and $17.25 a week for a married person. A married person is regarded for income test purposes as having one-half of the combined income of the couple. These limits or ''free areas'' are equivalent to the maximum amounts of means as assessed which a pensioner could have under the former means test while retaining entitlement to the maximum rate of pension.</PARA>
<PARA> Legislation authorising these limits came into operation on 27 September 1972.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am aware that a resolution was put to the Queensland State Liberal Party's conference concerning the amount of non pension income pensioners may have before loss of pension entitlement.</PARA>
<PARA> In general, under current arrangements, the first $20 of non pension income in the case of a single pensioner and $17.50 for a married pensioner, is disregarded in assessing pension entitlement. Above these 'free areas', maximum pension entitlement is reduced by fifty cents for each one dollar of non pension income. In providing and withdrawing assistance on this basis, the Government is concerned to achieve a balance between concentrating assistance on those in greatest need and providing reasonable rewards for self-help and thrift.</PARA>
<PARA> While the Government recognises that there is a case for increasing the pension 'free areas' to encourage self-provision, it must also recognise that such action would provide no benefit for pensioners who are entirely, or substantially, dependent on their pension, while all part rate pensioners, including those with quite high incomes, would gain.</PARA>
<PARA> The cost of increasing the 'free areas' to $30 a week for single pensioners, with a corresponding increase for married couples would be significant-$80m in a full year. Such expenditure must be considered in the context of other social welfare priorities which compete for the limited resources available to the Government. One such important, and costly, priority is the twice yearly automatic indexation of pensions. For example, for estimated cost of the November 1981 and May 1982 pension and benefit increase that will arise from the indexation provisions of the Social Services Act is some $280m in 1981-82 and some $715m in a full year.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government keeps the appropriateness of the pensioner income test under constant review and will continue to have regard to the views of the community as part of this process.</PARA>
<PARA> Any changes in this area will be considered in the total Budget context.</PARA>

This frequency band, however, also accommodates television channels 3, 4 and 5. Consequently, it is not possible to establish an FM service either within or adjacent to those areas which receive television coverage from channels 3, 4 and 5, until such time as particular television services can be reallocated to alternative channels. As the Port Lincoln television services utilise channels 3 and 5, Port Pirie, which uses channel 4, is one of those areas where the introduction of FM services is dependent upon reallocation of an existing television service.</PARA>
<PARA> Although guidelines for the reallocation of television services which occupy channels 3, 4 or 5 are currently being developed, it is not possible at this stage to indicate when they will be introduced. You may be assured, however, that when a suitable frequency does become available, establishment of a national (ABC) FM broadcasting service in the area will certainly be considered.</PARA>

<PARA> (2) (f) Protests were not lodged with the Soviet authorities. Experience suggests that the Soviet authorities are most unlikely to be responsive to such action. Moreover, in the absence of a direct Australian interest such as a consular interest, in people brought before Soviet courts in human rights trials, the formal grounds for protest are not strong. The fact of our joining with other Western Embassy representatives in making a conspicuous attempt to attend such trials is in itself a significant expression of Australia's concern.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (g) Yes. It is not Soviet practice to give advance warning of such trials, nor is there any domestic press coverage. Apart from the problems of advance warning, the difficulty about attending trials outside the Moscow area is that Embassy officers need to obtain official approval to travel and must do so 24 hours in advance. In practice this generally means that the trial is likely to have finished before an officer can get to the city in which it is being held. Despite these very real practical difficulties, the Embassy has not relaxed its efforts to learn about trials in time to seek admission. The Embassy is making and will continue to make every effort to have officers attend trials.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Government has no recent information on the health of Dr Orlov or Mr Shcharansky other than that made available by organisations such as Amnesty International. The Government has supported, and will continue to support international initiatives aimed at securing the release of both men whenever appropriate opportunities arise.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Government's view of Recommendation No. 65 of the Report of the JCFAD on Human Rights in the Soviet Union remains the same as those outlined to the House of Representatives by my predecessor on 18 September 1980. Our attitude is not a function of the incidence of violations, however distressing these may be, but stems from important general questions concerning the conduct of our foreign policy.</PARA>

<PARA> (1)-(3) The most recent figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics indicate that in 1979 there were 397 deaths as a result of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. This incidence rate, and the uneven geographic distribution of cases, is obviously of concern to the community.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government places great importance on the continued funding of high quality medical research in Australia into the causes and prevention of disease. For this reason the appropriation to the National Health and Medical Research Council (NH &amp; MRC) has been steadily increased each year by the Government.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5E4">Mr Sinclair</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I am advised by Telecom that no specific records of the number of complaints relating to congestion are kept. Congestion in a telephone system can occur at various points, for example, within an exchange or in gaining access to a particular route consequently it is difficult to identify from customer trouble reports precisely where any congestion may have occurred. In general, however, complaints of congestion are relatively few compared to the level of traffic being handled. Nevertheless, Telecom recognises from overall measurements of its major trunk switching centres that levels of congestion are higher than desirable on a number of routes particularly during peak traffic periods and measures are in hand to alleviate the problem.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) There are a number of broadband systems which connect Brisbane to Sydney and Sydney to Canberra. Currently, 57 direct circuits are provided over these systems (27 Brisbane to Canberra and 30 Canberra to Brisbane). The circuits provided over the last three years were:</PARA>
<PARA> 1977-78-54;</PARA>
<PARA> 1978-79-34*;</PARA>
<PARA> 1979-80-54.</PARA>
<PARA> * temporary reduction in direct circuits compensated by adequate provision of alternative routing facilities.</PARA>
<PARA> When telephone traffic is greater than can be handled over the direct circuits the calls are automatically routed over alternative circuits. In 1979-80, 142 alternative circuits were available to traffic between Canberra and Brisbane. In 1980-81 the number of alternative circuits available was increased to 182.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) There is no record of any complaints relating to congestion between Brisbane and Canberra on 28 April although between 26 April and 28 April 1981 a co-axial cable at Grafton was damaged which would have affected telecommunications traffic between Brisbane and Canberra.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Acting Minister for Health has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) While Australia voted in support of the International Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes, the code-which was adopted by the World Health Assembly as a recommendation only-includes the statement that 'there should be no advertising or other form of promotion to the general public of products within the scope of the code'.</PARA>
<PARA> The code does not recommend that information about breastmilk substitutes, i.e. infant formulas, be unavailable to health care providers who may need this information for situations where breast feeding is not possible.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No. Exportation of products incorrectly labelled as breastmilk substitutes is, however, prohibited under export controls.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) INFACT, along with many other organisations concerned with the health of infants in less developed countries, has correctly claimed that polluted water supplies have contributed to gastro-intestinal disease among infants fed formulas requiring the addition of water.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I am advised by Telecom that although its costing system is not geared to provide data in the form sought by the honourable member, the latest results of its studies show that the average investment necessary to add each new telephone service to the network in 1979-80 was:</PARA>
<PARA> Metropolitan-$2,151;</PARA>

<PARA> (2) The standard charges for the provision of a non-business (domestic) telephone service in both metropolitan and country areas are:</PARA>
<PARA> Service Connection Fee-$150;</PARA>
<PARA> Yearly Rental-$95.</PARA>
<PARA> The standard charges are applied where an applicant resides within 16km of an automatic exchange.
