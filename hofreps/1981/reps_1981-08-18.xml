<PARA> That many Australians will be financially disadvantaged by the health changes proposed by the Federal Government, especially the withdrawal of Commonwealth medical benefits for the uninsured and the introduction of a means test for free public hospital care;</PARA>
<PARA> That the health insurance changes promote inequity, inefficiency and lack of universal coverage;</PARA>

<TITLE>Tertiary Education</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in the Parliament assembled. This petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The proposal to introduce fees for higher and second degrees will mean that access to post-graduate and recurrent education will be limited to the rich; Australian research and ability to cope with technological change will suffer; this proposal must be seen as a step in the direction of the introduction of fees for all tertiary students.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. The proposed introduction of a loans scheme for students will mean graduating with a heavy debt or being denied a tertiary education if loans are refused because a student is seen as a ''poor risk'' (particularly affecting women and those doing non-vocational courses); only the rich will be able to get a tertiary education without course restrictions and the burden of indebtedness.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. In regard to the proposal to restrict eligibility for TEAS and the foreshadowing of reviewing TEAS levels only in the light of the availability of loans, it should be noted that any further downgrading of TEAS, which is already inadequate, can only further limit access to education.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. The proposed restriction of Adult Secondary Assistance to those needing qualifications for employment will severely restrict access to a full high school education and necessary bridging education to tertiary education for those who left school early.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. The proposal not to fund 30 Colleges of Advanced Education if they are not rationalised is an attack on teacher education. This attack will create teacher shortages in the mid 1980s, restrict access to education now and endanger the future quality of teaching available to Australian children.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore pray that:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) post-secondary tuition fees not be introduced for any courses or for any category of students;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) that the TEAS scheme be extended so as to more fully meet the real financial needs of students.</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) that a comprehensive loans scheme not be introduced.</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) that there be no restriction of Adult Secondary Assistance.</PARA>
<PARA> (v) that the proposal not to fund 30 CAEs unless they are rationalised be rescinded.</PARA>

<TITLE>Tertiary Education</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in the Parliament Assembled. This Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the financial situation of students enrolled at Australian post-secondary institutions is already extremely difficult (as indicated in the Commonwealth Department of Education's 1979 survey of student incomes and expenditure) and any substantial increase in the financial commitments of students would gravely worsen their financial difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) the imposition of post-secondary tuition fees of comparable levels to those imposed prior to 1971 would force many currently enrolled students to discontinue their studies and deter many persons willing and able at present to undertake post-secondary study from doing so.</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) those students and potential students from social groups currently under-represented and disadvantaged in the post-secondary education system would be most severely affected by the reintroduction of fees for post-secondary education.</PARA>

<TITLE>Excise on Beer</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The hotel industry in Australia is long-established and a valuable part of the community of this nation, providing places where the people may partake of the three basic needs of life; a place to eat, a place to drink, a place to sleep.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. The hotel industry is accepted throughout the nation as occupying an important place in the social and economic activities of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. The hotel industry is almost entirely within the private sector and makes a large contribution to the government in taxes of various kinds.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. The hotel industry has a need to sustain an appropriate level of turnover and growth, to make profit, and to sustain and improve the level of employment.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. The hotel industry of Australia is gravely concerned at published reports that the Government intends to increase excise charges on beer in the forthcoming Budget.</PARA>
<PARA> 6. Sales of beer constitute the major source of income of most of the industry's 5,811 hotels in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> 7. The very steep rises in beer excise in 1975 and 1978 severely retarded the growth of the Australian hotel industry.</PARA>
<PARA> 8. Any further increases in excise on beer in the 1981 Budget would further retard the industry at a time when growth is essential to maintaining economic viability and the ability to serve the constantly growing needs of the community.</PARA>
<PARA> 9. Such is its significance as a community requirement, beer occupies a place on the Consumer Price Index, and any alteration to its cost to the community would have an inflationary effect.</PARA>
<PARA> 10. Any increase in excise would result in and force the hotel industry to pass on such increases to the consumer by way of higher prices for beer.</PARA>
<PARA> 11. Higher excise would be only the starting point for an upward spiral in beer prices because of the presence of other factors, such as State Licence Fee taxes, which are directly linked to excise rates.</PARA>
<PARA> 12. The hotel industry of Australia already is gravely handicapped by heavy excise and other tax imposts, its growth is at a standstill; and, inevitably must decline if beer excise is increased.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that Honourable Members of the House of Representatives:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Recognise the importance and place of the Australian Hotel industry in the social and economic life of the nation.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Accept that the viability of the hotel industry is essential to the maintenance of employment opportunities and stability of the industry is essential to enable it to continue to provide for the hotel needs of the nation in this period of growing population and increasing tourism.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Tampons, sanitary napkins, vaginal deodorants and similar sanitary products to be re-classified under Therapeutic Agents (not under ''Cosmetics'' as at present), in order to bring them under the scrutiny of the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee.

<PARA> (2) After re-classification, we urge an immediate government-funded inquiry into all aspects of manufacture and content of these products. This must lead to: (i) contents of products and instructions for correct usage to be shown on packaging; (ii) removal of synthetic fibres, chemicals or ingredients that are potentially or actually harmful to users.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Allocation of extra funding for ongoing research by the National Health and Medical Research Council into these products, results of this research to be made public to ensure all health workers and potential users are fully informed.

<PARA>To The Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble Petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The club industry in Australia is long-established and a valuable part of the community of this nation, providing places where the people may partake of the three basic needs of life: a place to eat, a place to drink, a place to sleep.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. The club industry is accepted thoughout the nation as occupying an important place in the social and economic activities of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. The club industry is entirely within the private sector and makes a contribution to the government in taxes of various kinds.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. The club industry has a need to sustain an appropriate level of turnover and growth, to make profit, and to sustain and improve the level of employment.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. The club industry of Australia is gravely concerned at published reports that the Government intends to increase excise charges on beer in the forthcoming Budget.</PARA>
<PARA> 6. Sales of beer constitute the major source of income of most of the industry.</PARA>
<PARA> 7. The very steep rises in beer excise in 1975 and 1978 severely retarded the growth of the Australian club industry.</PARA>
<PARA> 8. Any further increases in excise on beer in the 1981 Budget would further retard the industry at a time when growth is essential to maintaining economic viability and the ability to serve the constantly growing needs of the community.</PARA>
<PARA> 9. Such is its significance as a community requirement, beer occupies a place on the Consumer Price Index, and any alteration to its cost to the community would have an inflationary effect.</PARA>
<PARA> 10. Any increase in excise would result in and force the club industry to pass on such increases to the consumer by way of higher prices for beer.</PARA>
<PARA> 11. Higher excise would be only the starting point for an upward spiral in beer prices because of the presence of other factors, such as State Licence Fee taxes, which are directly linked to excise rates.</PARA>
<PARA> 12. The club industry of Australia already is gravely handicapped by heavy excise and other tax imposts, its growth is at a standstill; and, inevitably must decline if beer excise is increased.</PARA>
<PARA> Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that Honourable Members of the House of Representatives:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Recognise the importance and place of the Australian club industry in the social and economic life of the nation.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Accept that the viability of the club industry is essential to the maintenance of employment opportunities and stability of the industry is essential to enable it to continue to provide for the club needs of the nation in this period of growing population and increasing tourism.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Treasurer to the extraordinary level of volatile portfolio investment or so called hot money, exceeding some $2,000m which flowed into Australia last year and which was largely directed towards speculation in real estate, shares and the takeover of Australian industry. Does the Treasurer recognise the disruptive effects of these short term capital movements which aggravate inflation and force up interest rates? Rather than penalising Australian homebuyers, consumers and manufacturing and farm industries with the cost of more inflation and crippling interest rates, will the Treasurer immediately impose controls on short term foreign capital inflows?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="19" SPEAKER="Howard The Hon J.W." NAMEID="ZD4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="BENNELONG" MINISTERIAL="TREASURER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is naturally watching developments on Australia's external account very closely. It is necessary, in responding to the present situation, to adopt an appropriate mixture of policies and not to rely overheavily on one particular response. The examination that I have had carried out and the up-to-date advice which is available to me does not indicate that speculation in real estate constitutes an undue element of the volume of private capital inflow that has come into this country in recent months. The honourable gentleman knows as well as other honourable members that it has been an objective of this Government-the objective has attracted a degree of bipartisan support on occasions around Australia-to establish a state of affairs in which this country is seen as a reliable and attractive country in which to invest, and is able to maximise the benefits of overseas investment whilst at the same time ensuring that the appropriate opportunities are provided for Australians to share in the resource development of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The responses to large private capital inflow are a number. It is currently not the intention of the Government to introduce the capital controls of the type mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition. It would, of course, be a very foolish person who totally ruled out particular responses in this area. I say to the honourable gentleman, as I have said on a number of occasions in the past, that earlier when these controls were introduced they were arbitrary and inefficient and were subject to very significant and legitimate criticism by Australian business. The Government has something of a preference in the present situation for relying on more general policy responses including, of course, the size of Government demands on our loan markets.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also desire to put a question to the Treasurer. I refer him to last week's announcement that the Shell Company of Australia Limited has been asked to offer 25 per cent of its equity to Australian interests. Will the Treasurer tell the House whether naturalising status was discussed with Shell, in terms of a 25 per cent equity sale, or whether it is the intention of the Government to accord naturalising status to Shell once it realises a 25 per cent qualifying level of Australian equity? Will the Government grant naturalising status to Shell, or any other foreign company, without specific and irrevocable commitments to wind down the foreign equity to a maximum 49 per cent? Finally, does the Treasurer realise that, without such commitments, Shell with naturalising status would be in a position to take up 100 per cent equity in Australian projects where now it is limited to 50 per cent and naturally without diminishing the control structure one iota?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the first part of the honourable gentleman's question is no. I simply repeat that an invitation has been extended to the Shell company to discuss the possible introduction of up to 25 per cent Australian equity in that company. It has not been made a condition of the two foreign investment approvals that I announced last week. So far as the naturalising rules are concerned, Shell is affected by those rules in precisely the same way as any other company. If it complies with the naturalising rules in every respect and wants naturalising status, it can have it. If it does not, it will not.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FS7">Mr STREET</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen the article to which the honourable gentleman referred concerning the formation of the new Israeli Government and the likely policy of that Government towards the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The guidelines, which I understand have been issued by the new Israeli Government for the future of the West Bank and Gaza, include a declaration that the Government will work for the renewal of negotiations for full autonomy. This declaration is followed by statements along the lines that the autonomy agreed upon at Camp David means neither sovereignty nor self-determination. There is also a reference that, at the end of the five year transition period set down in the Camp David agreements, Israel will raise its claim and realise its act of sovereignty over Judea and Samaria, they being the historical names for the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is Australia's hope that the autonomy negotiations will recommence in the near future. We support the view that the outcome of these negotiations should make proper provision for the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. As far as we can judge, the guidelines issued by the new Israeli Government appear to indicate a change in its approach to the negotiations and it seems as though this change will make it more difficult to make any progress in the negotiations.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QS4">Mr MALCOLM FRASER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would not surprise the honourable gentleman by indicating that I do not agree with the substance of his question or the conclusions contained in it. The threat to world peace has come from a Soviet Union that for decades has been spending 12 per cent to 14 per cent of its total income on defence and defence preparations. When United States expenditure on defence has gone down, Soviet Union expenditure on defence has gone up. Throughout the period of detente-a period when people, whatever illusions they were under, genuinely believed that the world was entering into a safer phase-the expenditure of the Soviet Union on arms went up. It spent 12 per cent to 14 per cent of its national income on defence and offensive weapons year after year. That has not altered. The honourable gentleman would need only to look at the buildup of Soviet arms in the Warsaw Pact countries-the number of tanks, aircraft and divisions-to know quite well that any hope of Western European security can be achieved only by having tactical nuclear weapons of one kind or another because, on the basis of conventional arms, there would be no hope in the world of any valid defence of Western Europe. If the honourable gentleman wants to take the position that Western Europe should be naked to the arms of the Soviet Union and the other Warsaw Pact countries, with their tanks and guns outnumbering those of the West manifold, let the honourable gentleman argue that in France, Germany or other countries in Europe.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is worth noting that the new socialist President of France has taken a much tougher stand against Soviet militarism than was the case with his predecessor. Having in mind his socialist philosophy, I think we should give weight to what he and his Foreign Minister have indicated and said about the nature of France's policy in relation to those matters. Neutron technology is not possessed only by the United States. I understand that that technology is also within the possession of the Soviet Union. Tactical nuclear missiles are stationed throughout Europe. If there is available new weaponry which can be more direct in its impact with less fall-out in relation to people who otherwise would be in a sense innocents in a struggle than would be the case with the present tactical nuclear weapons, I think the honourable gentleman would be bold indeed if he tried to advance the argument that the Western powers-the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation powers and the United States-should leave the massive superiority in arms-conventional and, many would argue, nuclear as well-in the hands of the Soviet Union and its imperial empire. That is not the view of this Government. It would not be the view of the majority of the Australian people.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="014">Mr MacKELLAR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I noted that a major registered health insurance fund in Victoria announced its rates this morning. I am very pleased that some of the dire predictions of the Jeremiahs, particularly in the Opposition, have proved to be ill-founded. In fact, when one takes into account the 32c in the $1 rebate available for people taking out health insurance with registered health insurance funds, the cost to the family will be less than the cost during the last financial year. I am very pleased to see that, in fact, this particular fund has come up with rates which are attractive and which, in fact, give the lie to some of those rather exaggerated statements which allege that the cost to the individual and the family would be excessive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe there is a very urgent need for the funds to announce their rates as soon as possible. I would like to make it clear that the announcement of the rates must come from the funds themselves. Whilst I and the Department approve the rates we do not approve the timing of the announcement of those rates. The majority of the funds throughout Australia have lodged their applications for the approval of their rates. Those applications are being processed as quickly as possible by my Department. A number of major funds have had their rates approved and have not yet announced them. I would hope that they would announce those rates rather than try to secure some imaginary advantage by withholding the announcement. I hope they will announce them as soon as possible. I would hope that the funds that have not yet supplied my Department with their rates would do so as quickly as possible so that the public can have the opportunity to shop around. I might say in conclusion that the public have the opportunity to make a choice between competing funds. That element of choice is a very significant factor in the development of the new health scheme. That element, of course, would not be available under the Australian Labor Party's schemes.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think that the right honourable member for Wannon will need to go camping after tonight. However, he might well want to go to the Birdsville races for other reasons. There are about 44,000 Australians living in remote and isolated areas of Australia who virtually have no telephone services at the moment. There are significant difficulties in trying to provide telephones for some of those people. About 66 per cent of them, I gather, are Aboriginals, some of whom live a semi-nomadic lifestyle. Obviously it would be somewhat difficult to provide subscriber trunk dialling telephone services for them. Telecom has ideas of installing about two and a half thousand more automatic telephone exchanges. It hopes to have them equipped throughout Australia by about 1990.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Two new developments in this field will certainly help Birdsville and other remote areas. One of these is called the digital radio concentrator system, for which three trial equipment programs are now in hand. This system apparently provides a significantly improved access to radio in remote areas. Apparently the range of and the sound recorded on this digital radio concentrator system are considerably better than are now available on the high frequency service in operation. Telecom has high hopes that it will improve the services in the outback. In addition, in the first generation satellite there will also be some lines that will, I hope, extend the services in areas where the cost of land lines is now so high. I can assure the honourable member that, whatever the intention of the right honourable member for Wannon is in relation to camping or other matters, telecommunication services for his constituents and those at Birdsville and elsewhere shortly will be at least significantly better.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I draw the Prime Minister's attention to the front page of today's Age which refers to the Zarb family, living in my electorate, with which I am acquainted and which lives in dire poverty. Since this family is typical of over two million Australians living below the poverty line set by Professor Henderson, I ask: Does the Government care at all about the poor in this country?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My colleague the Minister for Social Security will be making a statement in the Senate concerning a report prepared by the Social Welfare Policy Secretariat which is relevant to some of the allegations made in the honourable gentleman's question. I think there are a number of points that can and ought to be made. In introducing the system of family allowances, we redirected assistance in this country from the wealthy to the poorer sections of the Australian community. All honourable gentlemen will know quite well that the earlier system of tax rebates assisted better-off families in the middle to higher tax paying brackets and that there were many families not paying sufficient tax to benefit from the rebates then offering. A number of families which were not in the tax-paying arena benefited very significantly as a result of that social change.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In addition, the budgetary provisions of this Government in the areas of the disadvantaged and the disabled have provided significantly greater funds as each year has passed. This Government introduced indexation of pensions and made that a matter of law to protect pensioners and those in need of help from this Parliament from erosion of their living standards. It is this Government which has assisted many organisations in the community to build record numbers of homes for elderly citizens so that they can live their old age in dignity and decency and with self-esteem. I know the thing in all this which hurts the Australian Labor Party is that many of these initiatives in the area of social welfare represent initiatives of an imaginative kind which the Australian Labor Party never even thought of.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the moment there are many countries around the world in very real economic difficulties. It is worth noting, I think, that whatever the political systems presently operating, government-run enterprises are the ones in greatest difficulty in nearly any country one could name. In many countries around the world, government-run enterprises in motor industries, in iron and steel industries and in coal industries are the ones absorbing vast sums of taxpayers' funds because of the inefficiency of the enterprise, because of the inadequacy of government management and because governments have felt that since they own the operation it is fair enough to pour taxpayers' dollars, billions upon billions of them, into supporting enterprises that were failing and unprofitable and which obviously should have undergone very substantial management changes and restructuring.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, if one wants to go to the socialist countries where everything is run by government, one can see a situation whereby the living standard of people is much less than that which is provided through the free market private enterprise system. Let me say only that this Government has no intention of introducing reforms of the kind contained in the honourable gentleman's question, reforms which I know the honourable gentleman was not advocating, and reforms which are very much part of the philosophy of the Australian Labor Party and which would have the direct result of lowering the living standard of every Australian family from one end of this country to the other.</PARA>

Therefore, there was an obligation on the parties which were then in opposition to do what they did. If the Australian Labor Party takes certain actions, those actions will be on its own head.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable gentleman's question carried some implications which are not correct. One of the things that he may regret is that this Government has established, under Mr Dolan's presidency of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, a capacity to have discussions with the ACTU and its officers in a way which contributes to a resolution of difficulties and in which nobody leaves meetings seeking to grandstand or score points against one party or the other. The capacity to talk in that way in a matter of confidence is essential if there are to be constructive discussions from time to time between the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Government. I must say that on a number of occasions in the last four to five months such discussions have taken place, and I have no intention of revealing here or anywhere else what took place in those discussions because they were between the ACTU and the Government. The same matters were relevant to the discussions that were held with the Confederation of Australian Industry by the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Quite plainly the Transport Workers Union dispute was one of the matters discussed on a number of occasions. But it seemed to me that all parties to this matter believed that it ought to go before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and that the Commission, which had made earlier judgments in these matters, ought to be the body that would make any future determination affecting the fortunes of the Transport Workers Union. The Government, I believe, has been able to establish with the Australian Council of Trade Unions a relationship which I regret it was not possible to establish during the presidency of the honourable member for Wills.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because of the drought over the last couple of years there has been a marked reduction in the number of cattle in Australia. That number, having reached some 33 million head a couple of years ago, is now down to some 24 million head. This has caused a shortage of supply for some of the abattoirs operating, particularly in New South Wales but also in other States. I have been drawing attention to the prospective difficulties faced by the abattoir industry for some months. Indeed, when I opened the National Agricultural Outlook Conference in January, I specifically referred to the problem that would occur following the downturn in cattle numbers and the restocking that would follow the breaking of the drought. So the abattoir industry is in difficulty, a similar sort of difficulty to that which a number of primary industries faced in earlier days. I have said consistently that there are far too many abattoirs in the country and that there will have to be a rationalisation of those abattoirs. This has been occurring. Some 25, I think, have now closed their doors. Some have closed permanently and some will open again. Further rationalisation will occur.</PARA></TALK.START>

Mr Speaker, the Parliament House Construction Authority and its design and construction consultants have completed a major examination, refinement and development of the competition winner's design. This is the culmination of a year's work and represents the completion of a major design phase, known as the schematic design. The schematic design establishes the main design parameters and determines the overall layout of the building. Whilst there will still be some limited scope for minor detailed changes, these must and will be closely monitored to minimise or eliminate any cost implications. The schematic design retains the outstanding symbolic and architectural concepts which so distinguished the competition submission. The functional aspects of the design have been subjected to a rigorous examination by all building users and confirm the inherent efficiency of the competition submission. It is my hope that this report and a separate report by the Joint Standing Committee on the New Parliament House will result in Parliament's agreeing to proceed with the construction of this exciting and much needed building. The design has been acclaimed as a building for the 21st century and beyond and will be the focal point for world attention when it is completed. It will be a measure of Australia's standing not only in architecture but also as a developed nation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In July last Mr Frederick Walter Temperly, Administrative Officer of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff, retired from parliamentary service. Fred Temperly served in Hansard for 26 years and as Administrative Officer for the last 13 years. His Public Service career began in 1937 when he joined the Attorney-General's Department. For a few months in 1939 he served in the Joint House Department of the Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> He enlisted in the Australian Infantry Forces in 1942 and served in New Guinea. Upon discharge from the AIF, he returned to the Public Service and joined Hansard in 1955. Any honourable member who made regular visits to the Hansard office would have had frequent contact with Fred Temperly and could not fail to be impressed by his courtesy and efficiency. The worth of his service to Hansard cannot be overstated. Most reporters would have sought his advice daily on procedural matters. The Parliament and Hansard in particular, wish Fred and Mrs Temperly a long and rewarding retirement.</PARA>

There is no doubt that many people about this place are quite critical to the effective functioning of Parliament. Mr Temperly was one such person, working in Hansard, who did not have the opportunity of speaking in this place; yet without his services it would have been impossible for those of us who do speak to have our messages recorded and perhaps rewritten in a form that was far more legible than the words we used.

I particularly mention the close association with Mr Temperly of the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi) and myself. All honourable members on this side of the House have a great respect for Fred Temperly. We regret his early retirement. I think it is sad that this Parliament has lost the services of Fred Temperly so early when that loss was not necessary. As honourable members know, Fred Temperly is a stubborn man and a very proud man. He felt that a proposed promotion that was to be given to him in Hansard was not accepted generally by certain Hansard staff. For that reason, he took a very principled stand. We hope that in the future this Parliament will again have the services of Mr Temperly, perhaps in a consultative position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All honourable members on this side of the House acknowledge how we appreciated his great tolerance and patience with us. I think the Hansard writers will miss his great wisdom in procedural matters because nobody in this Parliament understood the forms and procedures as Fred did.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last Thursday evening the Treasurer (Mr Howard) announced that interest rates controlled by the Government-that is, rates on bank mortgages, overdrafts of less than $100,000, government bond rates and semi-government authority rates-were to be increased by one per cent or by slightly more in some cases. This came as a shattering blow to millions of families in Australia. Already interest rates are at the highest level in our history-highest both in nominal and in real terms after taking into account the rate of inflation. Now they have been increased even further, making the fourth general rise in controlled interest rates in the last 16 months. During that period the bank mortgage rate increased by 3 per cent from 9 1/2 per cent to 12 1/2 per cent. The small overdraft rate-that is, on overdrafts of less than $100,000-increased by 4 per cent from 9 1/2 per cent to 13 1/2 per cent. Along with these rises we have seen similar rises by non-bank institutions, especially building societies and finance companies, which have meant that all home buyers and consumers relying on hire purchase to obtain household goods, cars and the like have been faced with mounting repayments. The Opposition utterly deplores these increases. They have a completely retrograde impact on people, on the income distribution in this country, on the rate of economic growth and on the level of employment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at these matters in more detail. In regard to the impact on people, a rise in the repayments of home buyers and purchasers of household goods has the effect of reducing their living standard; that is, they have less disposable income after meeting higher interest repayments. For instance, for a typical household loan of $30,000 over a term of 25 years, a 3 per cent rise in interest over the last 16 months has added $65 a month to repayments; that is, over $15 a week. This is a crushing additional burden to bear. For those who can pay it, it means they have less income to spend on other items and therefore experience a decline in their living standards. For those who cannot pay it, it means selling their homes. Already we are seeing newspaper reports of families having to sell their homes because of their inability to maintain payments of these higher interest rates. For such people the decline in living standards is quite horrendous. It also means that many people who would have purchased a home at lower interest rates no longer can do so because the repayments required are too high in relation to their income. </PARA>
<PARA> Lending institutions generally will not lend if repayments amount to over 25 per cent of the gross income of the breadwinner. To borrow a typical housing loan of $30,000 over a period of 25 years one needs an income of $15,700 a year-that is, $302 a week. If one does not have that income one cannot meet the repayment requirements of the institution and therefore cannot get a loan. However, average weekly earnings at present are less than $300 a week-they are $284. We have a situation in which approximately 80 per cent of the income earners in this country are below the level required to meet the repayments required for a typical housing loan. We can say that four out of five income earners in this country are excluded from obtaining such a loan and therefore are excluded from the home buying market. </PARA>
<PARA> Apparently the Treasurer will not front up to this debate, but if he were here I would challenge him to deny that statement. He has denied it outside the House, but he clearly is absolutely incorrect. There is nothing that anyone on the Government side can say in reply which will refute the correctness of what I have said; that is, that the vast majority of the population are now excluded from the home buying market because they have to overcome not only a deposit gap but also a quite substantial repayments gap. This is an appalling situation. These clearly damaging effects on the Australian people show that the Government is totally out of touch with the needs of the people. It is so blinded by its monetarist ideology that it cannot see or does not care about the immense damage it is doing to the people. </PARA>
<PARA> The impact on income distribution also is important. It is important because savage rises in interest rates make the distribution of income in this country much more unequal. That is because the poor pay those higher interest rates while the rich benefit from them. People with only little savings or assets inevitably are borrowers if they want to make substantial purchases, such as a home, a car or a washing machine, and so they are greatly affected by rising interest rates. With rising interest rates and the rising cost of building accommodation, it is undoubted that rents also will rise, so they will be affected in that way. </PARA>
<PARA> People with little savings get little benefit from rising interest rates for deposits because they have little in the way of savings to attract that higher interest rate. People with substantial assets, however, gain from this process. Their savings will attract the higher interest rates on deposits and so their incomes will increase with rising interest rates. Because they have large savings or convertible assets they do not need to finance the purchase of a home, car or whatever by the means that have to be used by other people; that is, to borrow money. They are not adversely affected by the higher interest rates. In fact, they are better off. Rising interest rates redistribute income and wealth in a quite regressive fashion. They impinge savagely on the poor but benefit the rich. The Opposition is very disturbed about that aspect of rising interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> The impact on the economy is also very severe. A large rise in interest rates quite clearly will restrict the rate of economic growth because of the impact on both investment and consumption. The overdraft rate has increased by 4 per cent. The prime rate for overdrafts of over $100,000 has increased even more. This must mean that investment is made more expensive because of the increasing cost of finance. Therefore, investment is less likely to occur and we are less likely to have the high rate of economic growth we previously had. With the higher cost of financing consumer expenditures it undoubtedly will be the case that fewer consumer goods will be sold than otherwise would have been the case and therefore there will be less economic growth in real terms from increasing personal consumption. In respect of investment and consumption, which have been the engines behind economic growth in the last year, we can see that there would be a downward impact on the rate of economic growth. Because of that reduction in the rate of economic growth it follows that there will be a reduction in the level of employment-at least the level that otherwise would have obtained. Because of less economic growth, fewer job opportunities will be created and therefore more unemployment will result. </PARA>
<PARA> The impact on the population of savage rises in interest rates is quite disastrous. Interest rises reduce living standards, force people out of their homes, force people out of the home buying market, worsen the income and wealth distribution, reduce economic growth and increase unemployment. In the light of all that it is amazing that the Treasurer seems to insist that it is proper and desirable that interest rate increases should occur. He says that if the Government is to be able to fulfil its borrowing program and to ensure that funds are available for housing we must have these increases in interest rates. He says that without them there will be no funds at all for housing. Let me make two points in regard to that matter. Firstly, it entirely sidesteps the fact that the policies pursued by the Fraser Government have brought about this situation of rapidly rising interest rates in the uncontrolled area and are creating pressures for continuing rises in controlled interest rates. Secondly, the rapid rise in bank and building society interest rates may make more funds available for housing than otherwise would have been the case, but who can afford it? Not the ordinary wage earner because he has this enormous repayments gap which I have already referred to. He is excluded from the market even if the money is available. Perhaps finance is being made available for housing, but only for high income earners, not for the vast majority of the population. I believe that these examples show that the Treasurer is totally out of touch. His wife said on television the other night that he knew nothing about the food and grocery bills of families. It is quite obvious that he knows little about family finances in general. If he did know something about them he would not make the absurd statements he has made about the need for increasing interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> There are five key reasons why interest rates have risen. The first one is that the Government's continuing failure to achieve its money supply targets, while at the same time stressing the importance of their attainment, creates an expectation of increased interest rates being necessary. The Government, consistently over the last few years, has announced money supply targets and has mostly failed to meet them. Last financial year the money supply target rate of growth of M3 was 9 per cent to 11 per cent but the actual growth was 12.7 per cent, according to the Reserve Bank of Australia. Furthermore, if we use the broader measure, as the Reserve Bank shows in its annual report which is to be produced by the Government soon of M3 plus non-bank financial institutions, we find that the rate of growth of the money supply in this broader definition increased by 16 per cent in 1980-81. </PARA>
<PARA> Money supply growth has been way above target. The realisation of that in the market creates the expectation that eventually the Government will have to rein it in. Higher interest rates will be necessary to obtain that. Once that happens lenders will be reluctant to buy Government bonds or to lend to institutions with controlled interest rates, such as banks. So, the Government eventually is forced to raise bond rates and the bank rates. Although an increase in the money supply above the target rate may seem to reduce the likelihood of interest rate rises because it reduces the scarcity of money it can have the opposite effect through expectations of further interest rate rises being necessary to reduce money supply growth. Of course, that is especially the case where the Government announces money supply targets which are grossly exceeded. </PARA>
<PARA> The second reason for the increase is that the source of the increase in the money supply was also conducive to rising interest rates-45 per cent of the growth in the money supply in the last financial year came from the private external transactions, that is, the balance of private capital inflow over the balance of payments current account deficit. This large rise in the money supply from this external source, which is far in excess of its normal proportion, required increasing pressure on domestic credit sources to keep money supply growth down. That concerned bank lending in particular. It created further pressure for rises of interest rates and credit from these sources was made scarcer. So, rising interest rates were in part the result of a virtually uncontrolled capital inflow. </PARA>
<PARA> A third reason for the increase in interest rates was the greatly increased competition for funds as the resources boom developed. Business investment rose by almost 20 per cent. In this uncontrolled scramble for funds it was inevitable that pressures for and expectations of higher interest rates would develop. Fourthly, there was the deregulation of bank deposit rates which occurred last December and which sparked off a competitive scramble between banks and building societies for funds leading both of them to raise considerably their bank deposit rates and therefore provide pressure for higher lending rates. Of course, in respect of the banks that has now occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> Fifthly, there was the expectation of increased inflation despite the slight fall in inflation in 1980-81. There is a general expectation of higher inflation now. So we see that creating the basis for a further rise in interest rates. There were various reasons for interest rate rises. They all relate to the action or inaction of the Government. It is nonsense to pretend that it is just the operation of the market of which the Government is a helpless victim. What happens in the market is greatly affected by Government action and inaction. The severe rise in interest rates that has occurred in the past 16 months can be attributed to the Government because of its failure to control capital inflow, its failure to control the resources boom, its expected failure to keep inflation down, its deregulation of the bank deposit rate and its monetarist posturing that creates an expectation of higher interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has taken some action which it says is aimed at reducing the pressure on interest rates. This has taken three forms: Firstly, a reduction in the deficit or an increase in the domestic surplus. In the financial year which has just ended the domestic deficit was abolished and a domestic surplus of some $428m was recorded-a turn-around of $1,000m. Whilst that was happening we have had interest rates soaring. So, this is a really positive and dynamic way to control interest rates. Whilst we have had a dramatic turn-around in the domestic deficit we have had at the same time spiralling interest rates. So, this is a thoroughly ineffective way of controlling the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, we have had reductions in the real level of the semi-government borrowing program. This is said to be to reduce government competition with the private sector for funds but the increase in demand for funds has occurred much more in the private sector than in the Government sector. The fact is that the public sector borrowing requirement for State and local government is exactly the same percentage of gross domestic product over the last four years. Total public sector borrowing requirements is well below the level of a few years ago as a percentage of the GDP. The real level of government investment is no higher now than it was five years ago. It has been constant all of that time. Government investment clearly is not the source of increased competition for funds. The source is the private sector but the Government is doing nothing about that. The Government regards Government investment as something which is to be determined as a marginal addition to private investment with consequent damaging reduction in expenditure on the social infrastructure when private investment increases. There has been a failure to reduce interest rate pressure from that source. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; There is no doubt that this is a matter of public importance. It is a matter which is being discussed by families, by businesses, by people who do not borrow or lend, right across Australia at the present time because it is one of the great problems of this nation especially in the minds of people who are already locked into a borrowing which requires repayment. The first thing I want to do is to acknowledge that the present high levels of interest rates in Australia are a great imposition especially on those young couples and home buyers who are locked into a loan program, who have fixed commitments and who now find that because interest rates are higher than they expected they have repayments which in many cases they are finding very difficult to afford. I acknowledge that. What we are talking about in the matter of public importance is what is alleged to be the failure of the Government's economic policy as evidenced by the recent rise in interest rates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think we ought to remember that even though thousands of Australians are experiencing this very severe and unexpected imposition conditions in this country-through the Government's recognising them with increases in interest rates in areas where governments have control-have been brought about by a number of factors, some of which have been outside the control of the Government and some of which, in fact, indicate paradoxically the success of the Government's economic policy. If it were not for the success of the Government's economic policy there would not be a record level of investment in this country. There would not be a very high level of confidence in this country which has led people to want to invest, to want to borrow money and, therefore in a market situation, to force up the price of money. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member Willis) acknowledged that the private sector wanted funds. He acknowledges that there is a very big demand for money. He acknowledges that the money supply is a factor which, if it is relatively small, will mean that interest rates on a supply and demand basis will go up. The honourable member acknowledges that public borrowing is still going ahead at the same high level as five years ago. All of this is academic to the home buyers who are competing in the market and for governments which are continuing to borrow at that same high level of five years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> The failure of the Government's economic policy is not what we ought to be talking about. We ought to be talking about the success of the Government's economic policy which has led to the high interest rates at the present time. If governments have failed in this area it is because, as I said, they are intervening in the market place constantly, wanting to borrow money, crowding out those people who ought to be getting the money, that is, individuals and people in the private sector. Governments have borrowed too much. This Government has been saying that for quite some time now at Premiers Conferences and publicly. </PARA>
<PARA> I must say that it took quite a number of years before governments of Australia understood what interest rates were all about, understood what causes an increase or a decrease in interest rates. It seems strange to me that even the public at large is now foolishly listening to people such as the Leader of the Australian Democrats in the Senate (Senator Chipp) who is saying that somehow we can miraculously control interest rates in the context of a controlled money supply. We live in a situation where, like the market for tomatoes, if there are a lot of tomatoes on the market the price drops; if there is a scarcity of tomatoes the price rises. Money is very similar to tomatoes, potatoes or other scarce commodities in the way it behaves in the market place. If there is a lot of money about-more than people require for their investments-lenders will not be able to demand as high an interest rate as they would if the other situation were to obtain, namely, confidence and a high level of demand for investment. Of course, there is some nexus between the level of interest rates and inflation. If inflation is running at a high level, lenders will want to recoup at least the cost of inflation on the investment of cash that they make and there will be an underpinning force in the money market for lenders to want a higher relative interest rate than they would otherwise want in order to recoup the real value of their money. </PARA>
<PARA> But leaving that aside, money involves a supply-demand price situation just as is the case in regard to so many other commodities. It has been acknowledged not only by this Government lately but also in many other areas of the economy that what I am saying is accurate. If the Opposition wants to refute that, it ought to refer to announcements made in New South Wales in the past few days. The Premier of New South Wales, Mr Wran, has said that if we do not increase the price of money coming from building societies in New South Wales there will not be enough money for the people who want to borrow it to build houses. That is exactly what we are saying when we say to the trading banks: 'We will allow you to raise your rates of interest for loans up to $100,000 because otherwise there will not be enough money for those people who want to borrow it'. In the context of the banking situation, I emphasise that the Commonwealth's announcement applies only to loans of less than $100,000 and that is the area in which small businesses operate. Those people want money and are prepared, apparently, to pay that interest rate, otherwise they would not approach banks for new borrowings. I re-emphasise that it is that smaller area of loans under $100,000 and loans to the housing sector in respect of which the Commonwealth has made its pronouncements. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, Mr Wran has acknowledged the logic of the argument about interest rates by saying: 'Yes, we will have to put up the price of money to people borrowing for housing through the building society movement'. It seems quite fraudulent to me for the Premier to say that we can artificially mess around with interest rates. He is showing by his own actions that he does not really think that is true. I hope that in the lead-up to the coming election in New South Wales, Mr Wran will not try to pull the wool over the people's eyes by telling them that there is no logic in the money supply-demand situation. Mr R. B. Cameron, Director of the Australian Bankers' Association, in a bulletin issued yesterday, said:</PARA>
<PARA> Savings bank deposits showed little growth, in real terms, during 1980-81. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Low deposit growth means a low level of lending for housing. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what we are talking about. If one is prepared to pay the price for money one will get it. Mr Cameron continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Savings banks will be able to provide a strong flow of housing finance only if they are able to set rates of interest in line with those applying in the marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA> Savings banks still do not have sufficient competitive freedom. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, due to official controls, savings bank housing loan interest rates have risen over the past three years by much less than have other interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> Taking into account the latest increases in officially controlled interest rates announced by the Treasurer last week, savings banks housing loan rates have increased, since December 1978, by 3 percentage points compared with larger increases on the following marketable securities:</PARA>
<PARA>He spoke about interest rates on government securities, et cetera, which have gone up much higher. Mr Cameron is saying that housing loan interest rates have not gone up as rapidly as other interest rates. At the same time, he is pointing out that there is less money available for housing than there ought to be. He confirms what I am saying, that is, that if we do not recognise the supply-demand situation we cannot hope to act in the market place to see that those people who need money in specific areas will have it. It is as simple as that. </PARA>
<PARA> So we cannot lower interest rates artificially. Of course, if there were some mechanism by which we could do that and, at the same time, tell the truth to the people that it is possible to lower interest rates in the long term, heaven knows, any government in this country would want to do it. No government wants high interest rates, but we cannot go against the fact that a lot of people want money at the present time. As the honourable member for Gellibrand said, Australia is turning out to be a wonderful place for people to invest. Of course, the old furphy of money coming in from overseas has to be raised. It is an emotional issue of selling off the farm, speculating in Australian land or whatever the Australian Labor Party uses to try to get people's emotions going. The fact is that money is coming into this country because Australians want to use it to invest in this country or other countries want to use it to invest in this country. There is a great revival going on in our industries that, hopefully, will not be cut short by many of the problems that we are facing, simply because people know that this is a very good country in which to invest. Not the least of these are the people of Australia who live and work here. That revival is the means, surely, of creating the jobs that we are looking for. </PARA>
<PARA> Hopefully, when interest rates find a level where people will say: 'Look, I do not want to invest', they will stop borrowing. That is the supply-demand situation. When interest rates get to a level of 15 per cent or 18 per cent, or whatever percentage it is, and people decide that it would be better not to borrow to invest but to leave the investment alone, then interest rates will even out. At some later stage, interest rates will drop when people decide that investments at the level at which they are being made at the present time perhaps are not as important as consumption or some other use of money. All those things will remain to be seen. In the present situation, however, I have to agree with Mr Cameron. If money is to be available for those people who want to invest, we must live in a society that reflects the market. At last we are beginning to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> In November last year the Government began to recognise the supply-demand situation by relaxing, to some extent, the interest rate regime for trading banks. We are also realising it by trying to keep pressure on the States and on ourselves to lower the amount of public sector borrowing. That only helps to crowd out those people who otherwise want to invest and therefore reduces the supply of money to those people. </PARA>
<PARA> All of that is academic to the home buyer, the person who has already bought a home, the person in the squeeze. What I do hope is that in our country rather than listen to gobbledegook from people who think that we can artificially keep interest rates down, the Australian people understand that we are all in this together. We should ask ourselves: Should the houses that we have built in the last 10 or 15 years have been a little smaller than they are or should they be a little smaller in the future? Are we making the decision in Australia at the present time that we would prefer to invest in resources or manufacturing capacity and not to invest so much in houses? These are the things that people will make decisions about if they are given a market place in which to make those decisions. Another question that the Australian people are beginning to ask themselves about in regard to interest rates is: Can we support the level of government crowding out of the private sector that we are experiencing at the present time? The weight of Australians should get behind our Government in limiting government and keeping it small. The people should also get behind us in trying to lower inflation which is the other big factor in the increase in interest rates through their actions in the market place-the wages market place, in the profits market place and in the places where people push up prices to their own detriment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The issue which we are debating today is one of crucial importance to millions of Australian families. The steep rises in interest rates on home loans which have occurred in the last few months including the rise of a further one per cent announced last week have had and will continue to have a severe impact not only on those families but also on the Australian economy as a whole. Indeed, the interest rate rises will further intensify the economic crisis of this nation, increasing dramatically the tensions between capital and labour, increasing the gap between the rich and the poor and increasing the level of unemployment. The very fact that the Government proceeded with such a destructive policy notwithstanding the opposition from substantial sections of business as well as the whole of the labour movement shows that it is completely trapped in the fantasyland of its own economic policies which, to quote the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), do not take into account the human consequences of their implementation. It is these human consequences that I want to focus on before talking about the broader economic consequences.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the Age put it on Saturday, 15 August: 'Living standards to be hit by rise in home interest'. This is because the average Australian family will be struggling to find an extra $65 a month on home repayments. Everyone will be paying about a third more on repayments than they were 15 months ago. A family with a $30,000 loan will have to repay $98,000 as distinct from $79,000, an increase of $19,000. As the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) pointed out recently, a $30,000 loan is now out of reach of four out of every five wage earners. This is because the proportion of what is required to pay for a home loan has risen from 26 per cent to 34 per cent of after-tax income. Many families who already had trouble meeting previous payments will be forced with the new increases to sell their homes and attempt to find rental accommodation. </PARA>
<PARA> To illustrate the plight of many Australians, I will read this letter:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Sir, In my name and in the name of my family I am coming to you for help. Three years ago my wife and I had a healthy life, and decided to purchase a house, like all other people. Just after purchasing the house I got very sick and am now a pensioner. House repayments were $260 p.m. and we could manage that amount. Now my wife is sick and the payments on the house have risen to $360 p.m. This situation has caused us to come to you for help. </PARA>
<PARA> We are pleading to you to make our house repayments less. If we lose our house we lose everything. We have two children aged thirteen and ten years and are all in a very sad situation. </PARA>
<PARA> We wish to tell you about our other bills like gas, electricity, insurance, telephone, registration which we have to manage also. We are left with $20 per week for food for four people. </PARA>
<PARA> Our children live in hope that a better day will come tomorrow, but tomorrow never comes. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I shall send a copy of this letter to the relevant Minister. What all this adds up to is that the Government has now clearly abandoned the millions of ordinary Australians whose dream it has been to purchase a home and to pay for it at a reasonable rate. </PARA>
<PARA> All the propaganda of the Liberal Party including its pretence to represent the middle class Australians who have invested their life savings in their homes is now exposed for what it is-a lie. I say this to all fellow Australians: This Government has sold out 95 per cent of us to the interests of the foreign corporations. The interest rate rises and their consequences show that this Government cares nothing for the welfare of the people it is supposed to represent. This Government claims that the rise in interest rates is necessary because there is insufficient money available for government and semi-government borrowings. Yet this situation has come about at a time when a record $6,500m of foreign capital came into this country in the last year. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be clear that it is not the lack of funds as such which has led the Government to its decision. There is a lot of money available. Rather, it is the way in which the Government has handled its monetary policies which has resulted in the present situation. On the one hand the Government has a totally open door policy on foreign investment. Foreign capital can come into Australia and be used for any purpose whatsoever. As a result, of the $6.5 billion that came into Australia, less than 25 per cent went to new resource development. Most of it went into real estate speculation, into buying Australian land and property and into take-overs of Australian firms. This is documented. Much of it is simply an attempt to make fast profits by gambling on a further evaluation of the Australian dollar. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has persisted with the myth that the destination of the capital inflow was towards resource development. To sustain this mythology, the Government, together with State governments, has borrowed millions of dollars to build infrastructures such as roads and power stations to support this resource boom. This has brought about substantial pressure for interest rate increases; yet it ignores the simple principle that most of these infrastructure developments should be financed by the companies themselves if they are serious about resource development. It is interesting that honourable members opposite talk about free enterprise doing everything and yet we have all this infrastructure support by State and Federal government. The basic point is that the way in which resource development has been handled by this Government has resulted in a reduction rather than an improvement in the standards of living of ordinary Australians, and the trend will continue unless the Government changes course. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a further cause for the rise in interest rates. While the Government refuses to intervene in any way to control the level and direction of foreign investment, it has strongly intervened to attempt to limit the growth in the money supply. As a result of this heavy intervention, the availability of money for housing and government programs has been reduced. The ideological incoherence of the Government is added to by a further factor. It has ended intervention in the regulation of bank borrowing rates, which as the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) has pointed out, has made the interest rate problem much worse. What we have here is a pattern of non-intervention in areas where there should be substantial regulation and heavy intervention is an area where there should be more flexibility, that is, in the money supply. The government is thus pursuing the complete opposite of rational policies to limit the interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> No doubt the Treasurer (Mr Howard) will tell us tonight that he proposes to reduce government expenditure in real terms and achieve a domestic Budget surplus. He will try to tell us that this is the way to control interest rates. We believe that not only is this not the case but also that this further attack on government services and the refusal to provide increases in social security payments will substantially reduce living standards and increase poverty. In other words, the people will suffer not only through the increased interest rates but also through the Government's attempts to control them. The Government has put the people in a totally unwinnable situation with its policies. </PARA>
<PARA> What are the consequences of this policy on the economy? Because of the cutbacks in spending, unemployment will increase. Furthermore, because the disposable income of families is dramatically reduced consumption will fall. People will not be able to buy as many goods and services. This will result in losses in production and further unemployment. What are the consequences for industrial relations? As the media has noted, a crisis is developing in this area as unions push for increases to cover the increased costs of interest rates to their members. Mr Dolan of the Australian Council of Trade Unions has made it clear that this is a legitimate demand by workers. The tensions which will be created in this country as a result will certainly increase, and the Government is to blame. Where is the Government going in future with interest rates? The Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System has recommended the complete deregulation of interest rates. If the Government does this-and it is consistent with its absurd philosophy-interest rates will go through the roof. We warn the Government against this course. It has no mandate for this policy and no democratic right to impose these further burdens on the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> What should a rational government be doing about interest rates? It should attack the causes of this phenomenon-namely, an excess of money going into speculation and useless, unproductive actions which do not create employment while insufficient money is going into establishing new enterprises, new projects and worthwhile social needs. There needs to be a direction to the banks and lending institutions to provide a proportion of their funds for home loans at adequate interest levels. Since the banks and lending institutions are given special licences and are protected by law--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no doubt-I am sure that no one on this side of the House will deny it-that the present high level of interest rates is causing extreme difficulties for those people who are purchasing homes and who have low equities and high mortgages. However, the debate is not helped by the confusion of cause and effect, circular argument or the advocacy within one speech of policies that contradict each other. The contributions to the debate of the honourable member for Burke (Dr Theophanous) and the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) did those things. They were longer on emotion than on a rational assessment of the position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The interest rate is but the price of money. I do not think that the honourable member for Gellibrand would quarrel with that statement. The price of money, like anything else, is affected by supply and demand. It is not possible to avoid that problem by trying to put a strait-jacket on what is defined as money or to put a strait-jacket on its price, that is, to say by fiat that interest rates will reach only a certain level. The British tried this and what happened was exactly what one would expect to happen. Various substitutes for money arose outside the market and other liquid assets took the place of money. The British did not in fact manage to reduce the effective interest rate for those people who were most in need. They were the very people who were forced to use other sources of borrowing. We should look at the supply of money and the demand for it. In doing so, I think it helps if we make a distinction between real and nominal interest rates. The real interest rate is the difference between inflation and the quoted price for money in the market. If the real interest rate is negative, people will not accept financial assets. It is not possible to raise money. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. I will come to that. That is quite correct, but if we increase the supply of money we will increase the inflation rate quite quickly. The inflation rate is part of the nominal interest rate. I agree that we will temporarily reduce the real interest rate. However, because we have increased the inflation rate we will substantially increase the nominal interest rate and the amount of money that the home buyer has to find. So increasing the supply of money is not a solution. The honourable member for Gellibrand accepted that in the latter part of his speech when he criticised the Government for its approach to money supply targets and its failure to meet them. That was the one part of his speech with which I agreed. Therefore, the Government-any government-is left with the alternative of reducing the demand for money. Currently the demand for money is very high and that is reflected in high real interest rates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Interest rates are high primarily because Australian investment is seeking to raise capital on the Australian money markets to invest for our future. That is our future wealth. The rate of economic growth is higher now than it has been for six or seven years. For the first time in a long while substantial capital is being invested in Australia's future. That is a good thing. It is reflected in rising rates of employment. Employment has risen by 2.3 per cent in each of the last two years. They are facts which cannot be denied. Unemployment has fallen in the last 12 months. The important thing is that employment has risen. Not only has the stated unemployment rate fallen but also a higher proportion of Australians have entered the work force. Yet it is this investment, this increased economic activity, which above all else is putting pressure on the Australian capital market. What can a government do about that?</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9W4">Mr HYDE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A government could stop it. The surest way of stopping it would be to depress the present buoyant state of Australian investment by reducing confidence in the economy so that Australian investors would no longer want a stake in Australia's future. That would stop it, but it would also increase unemployment rates and leave a much poorer Australia. One thing that the Government can and should sensibly do is take its own borrowing requirements out of the market. At least it should reduce its own demand for borrowings. It can do this by either raising taxes or reducing its own expenditure. There are no other alternatives. Opposition members cannot have their cake and eat it. They have to come down on one side or the other. If they want higher government expenditure and lower interest rates, there is one course left to advocate; that is, higher taxes. If that is what Opposition members want they should be honest and spell it out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I now want to say something about living standards. For every borrower there is a lender. Are Opposition members asserting that borrowers are poorer than lenders? The statistics do not support this. I ask honourable members to think about their own families. I think they will conclude that their kids are likely to be net lenders while they are net borrowers. Honourable members should look around at their own electorates and think about what the people do. The net borrowers tend to be the more wealthy people and the net lenders tend to be those who have small fixed interest accounts. They are very often old people or young people. I am not suggesting that rapid changes in the price of money-the interest rate-do not cause a problem. They do; but the problem is not regressive. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Gellibrand made a fair criticism of the Government when he said that it had not met its money targets. That is true. Because of that the interest rate was forced to move further at a later time than it otherwise would have had to. To that limited extent, I accept the honourable member's criticism. He had quite a lot to say about capital inflow. To the extent that capital inflow is not matched by goods coming into the country-I have not noticed the Australian Labor Party advocating a vast increase in imports, although I would recommend the removal of some of the barriers to imports-it increases the money supply and reduces the price of money. That is the first effect. That effect can be neutralised by further government borrowings. At one stage the honourable member for Gellibrand seemed to be advocating the monetarist approach and at another stage he seemed to be denying it. He should make up his mind about which camp he is in. The initial effect of capital inflow is to reduce interest rates, but if the Government is to meet money supply targets the effect is neutralised. </PARA>
<PARA> The Whitlam Labor Government did not have any money supply targets and the money supply blew out by 26 per cent. The inflation rate rose to around 17 per cent and, of course, interest rates screamed up after it. The option available to the Government is to reduce its own pressure on the money markets, to stop competing with the householders and the small businessmen. That option is being pursued by this Government. </PARA>

<PARA> Customs Tariff Proposals Nos 8 to 12 (1981). </PARA>
<PARA>The Customs Tariff Proposals I have just tabled relate to proposed alterations to the Customs Tariff Act 1966. Proposals Nos 8, 9 and 10 formally place before Parliament, as required by law, tariff changes made by Gazette notice during the last recess. The changes contained in Proposals Nos 11 and 12 are new and arise from the Government's decisions in relation to developing countries preference quota levels for 1981-82 and the Industries Assistance Commission's report on Miscellaneous Transport Equipment. </PARA>
<PARA> Proposals No. 8, which operates from 1 January 1982, contains changes resulting from the Government's decision on recommendations made by the IAC in its report on Textiles Clothing and Footwear. In this case, the Government decided not to accept the recommendations of the IAC because of the loss of employment that would result. A new program of assistance for these industries will apply for a period of seven years from 1 January 1982. This will supersede interim arrangements which have applied to some goods since 1 September 1980. The new tariff structure was notified by Gazette on 24 June 1981 to facilitate preparation by importers for new tender quota schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> The changes in Proposals No. 9, which operates from 8 July 1981, implement the Government's decision in relation to the report by the IAC on Lamps and Lighting Fittings (Developing Country Preference). The decision reduces the developing countries preference margin to 10 percentage points for lamps and lighting fittings from the province of Taiwan. Other developing countries will retain current preference margins. </PARA>
<PARA> Proposals No. 10, which operates from 15 July 1981, is an administrative change in relation to certain disposable shopping bags of artificial plastic material. These goods have been reclassified from tariff item 39.07 to tariff item 42.02 following a decision by the Customs Co-operation Council. The rates now provided in tariff item 42.02 restore the levels of protection that existed prior to the re-classification. </PARA>
<PARA> The changes in Proposals No. 11 are operative from 1 July 1981 and follow the Government's review of the developing countries preference quota levels for 1981-82. The effect of these changes is, in the main, the removal of developing country preference quotas on a number of products. </PARA>
<PARA> Proposals No. 12 contains changes arising from the Government's decision to accept recommendations made by the IAC in its report on Miscellaneous Transport Equipment and is operative from tomorrow. The decision means:</PARA>
<PARA> Phased reductions in duty to a long term rate of 20 per cent for bicycles and certain bicycle frames, to 25 per cent for hand-propelled vehicles and certain wheeled toys designed to be ridden by children, and to minimum rates for many bicycle components;</PARA>
<PARA> minimum rates for motor cycles and most motor cycle parts; and</PARA>
<PARA> a duty of 25 per cent on animal drawn vehicles, on parts for hand-propelled or animal drawn vehicles and on parts or accessories for toy bicycles, tricycles, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA>Proposals No. 12 also contains a number of administrative changes which do not alter rates of duty. A comprehensive summary setting out the nature of all changes has been prepared and is being circulated to honourable members. I commend the Proposals to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to highlight the stupidity of the way in which we deal with Customs Tariff Proposals in this House. For the most part they have been brought in here in a sudden death sort of way. As the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Moore) has just explained, there are five Proposals before us-Nos 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12. On this occasion at the opening of a new session of Parliament it is possible to make an informed guess as to the nature of some of the Proposals-Nos 8, 9 and 10. As we have seen, those Proposals were gazetted whilst we were in recess and, of course, under the rules they had to be brought to the Parliament within four or five days of the commencement of the session.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no need to go over the Minister's speech in detail, but Proposals No. 8 applies to the Industries Assistance Commission's recommendations on textiles, clothing and footwear; Proposals No. 9 implements a decision in relation to the report of the IAC on lamps and light fittings as they relate to developing country preference; and Proposals No. 10, which was gazetted on 15 July, relates to an administrative change in relation to certain disposable shopping bags of artificial plastic material. Copies of the IAC reports have been available since the days when those decisions were gazetted. It was possible for those who take an intelligent interest in this subject to do a little homework in those cases; there has been some time to think. But the first the House heard of the other two Proposals, Nos 11 and 12, was in the Minister's speech today and there has been no time to give them consideration.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I say with a certain amount of annoyance that the Minister sought to interject on me. Of course, the adjournment of the debate is what normally happens in these circumstances. But when is there an opportunity to debate these matters? The processes of this House have gone from bad to worse. In fact the only opportunities to debate these matters are in Customs Tariff Validation Bill debates when all of these proposals are brought back and legislated for. In the past we at least have had those Customs Tariff Validation Bill debates twice a year. We have had them at the end of this session-say, early December-and then at the end of the autumn session-say, late May or early June. But the horse has bolted by the time we come to debate the Customs Validation Bill. All the things that have been gazetted or brought to this House in the way or proposals are then a fait accompli. The matters have rested for all those months in the meantime. Let us face facts-those Customs Tariff Validation Bill debates are nothing more than farces and opportunities for one or two to ride a hobbyhorse in relation to Customs matters; and nobody takes any notice of them. I might say that on each of those occasions I have sought to persuade the Government to change the procedures by which these matters are dealt with in the Parliament. I have moved amendments. Let me read one of them:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA> Whilst not opposing the Bill-</PARA>
<PARA>The Customs Tariff Validation Bill-</PARA>
<PARA>The House is of the opinion that a Parliamentary Standing Committee on Tariffs and Excise should be established to examine each change in tariffs and excise following the gazettal of proposals or their being introduced into the Parliament on the one hand and before related Bills are introduced into the House on the other hand. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, that is what ought to take place if we are serious about the people's representatives having a say in the government of this country and if such matters are not to be determined by executive action. That is what is being done in this case-it is being done by executive action and the Parliament is being allowed only a certain tokenism when it comes to discussing these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> However, on this occasion I got up on the spur of the moment not only to say these things but also to say something about the particular Proposals. In terms of the first three, about which I have had time to do some study, I can say that the IAC found that no lasting harm was being occasioned, for instance, by the developing country preference. The Government accepted that advice and, in the absence of any submissions from those affected being made to me or to other members of the Opposition, who have not passed any submissions on to me, so do we on this side of the House accept those Proposals. But, I repeat, they are the exception. It is only at the beginning of each session that we have had any time to look at these Proposals as they have been gazetted a little earlier. Most often, the items are introduced in a sudden death way, as Proposals 11 and 12 have been introduced on this occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> I had to make a decision as the Minister spoke as to what I should do on this occasion. Frankly, from what he has said, I am unable to say one way or the other whether the Opposition accepts or rejects the particular matters put forward. On this occasion, if my ears served me correctly and I heard what the Minister had to say a few moments ago, the Government has not accepted the recommendation of those who have looked at this matter in depth. The Government may indeed be correct. I am glad that it has exercised its separate judgment on the case, but I cannot exercise a separate judgment. I have not even had the time or the opportunity to look at the IAC report on the subject, because I did not get it until a short time ago when the reports were presented in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> What an absurd way to do business. As I have said, the procedures have gone from bad to worse. I am not sure that I explained fully earlier that previously at least we had these Customs Tariff Validation Bills before us twice a year, but now the Government has changed this procedure and we are going to have Customs Tariff Validation Bills before us only once a year. Probably in this case the Parliament will next be able to debate and make known any individual opinions on Proposals 11 and 12, which it has only just heard about, in about next May or June which is probably when the validation Bill will be introduced. I am not sure about that-perhaps the Government will introduce it once a year in December-but I suspect that it will be in next May or June when we see these miscellaneous transport, equipment and other proposals that have been brought to the House today. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat that previous Ministers for Business and Consumer Affairs promised me that they would view very sympathetically the idea of improving procedures. I regret that as much as I enjoy the company and appreciate the person of the present Minister, on a professional basis I have to say that he has gone from bad to worse in this matter and that he is not improving things. I think he was the one responsible for the Customs Tariff Validation Bills now coming in only once a year rather than twice a year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am helped by another interjection from the Minister. Unfortunately, others will not have heard it; so I will repeat it. He said that I have said that the debate is useless. I have said that the debate is useless in these circumstances because we have had no time to hear the Proposals. We know that in every other case relating to matters which come before this Parliament, a week's notice is given for the Opposition to receive representations from the people, to apply its own judgment and then to bring its views to this Parliament a week later. I think the Minister must be joking. I must admonish him for this because I believe that this is a very serious matter. The point is that the proper time for debate to take place is a week after such matters have been introduced. Six months later, the Proposals having been law for that time, is not the correct time for such a matter to be debated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, in our view each one of the Government's decisions arising from each report of the Industries Assistance Commission should be the subject of all-party scrutiny. That is why we have suggested time and again the establishment of a parliamentary standing committee on customs and excise tariffs. I draw to the attention of the House the fact that we all have conceded on some occasion the benefits of all-party committee work on these sorts of subjects. We forget the point scoring when we are in a committee situation. We do not forget our ideology but we allow ourselves to be influenced by facts rather than just emotions when we are out of this chamber doing committee work. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts, amongst its other functions, looks in depth at the reports of the Auditor-General. It looks also at departmental estimating. Similarly, a parliamentary standing committee of this sort should be looking in depth at the work of the IAC. I would accept, with a great deal of interest, any submission that was put to me that the scope of this standing committee could be widened beyond just looking at proposals in relation to customs and excise tariffs. Perhaps it would be the body that looked not only at the work of the IAC in depth but also at the work of the Trade Practices Commission and the various reports it brought down. We might give the body a separate name if it did that, but it may well be the correct standing committee of the Parliament to look at that sort of work. </PARA>
<PARA> It is tremendously important to the government of this country that greater interest be taken by parliamentarians in the work of statutory bodies such as the IAC. As soon as the Australian Labor Party takes over the national government of this country after the very next election, we will be re-establishing the Prices Justification Tribunal. I would once again listen very carefully and with interest to submissions that such a committee should look at the detailed work and reports of the Prices Justification Tribunal as well. Mr Deputy Speaker, an occasion such as this-one of those rare occasions when tariff proposals are debated immediately-raises the whole subject of tariffs and protection in this country. I will not labour the point but will spend just a couple more minutes to draw to your attention and to the attention of the House the considerable confusion that exists as to what is happening on the tariff front at present. I am indebted to some work by Mr Rob Chalmers in a weekly newsletter that he puts out entitled Inside Canberra. He states that many of the officials in government believe that the events which led to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) stating that there was to be a general inquiry into the levels of tariffs in this country were:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . not exactly handled in the best traditions of the Westminster system. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Chalmers went on:</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, some officials who should have been consulted were not. It is assumed that there will be some sort of inter-departmental committee formed to draw up the reference to the Industries Assistance Commission for the six months inquiry into lower protection mentioned by Mr Fraser on Wednesday night. </PARA>
<PARA>I think it was Wednesday, 5 August. Mr Chalmers may have been the first to draw attention to these facts, but just what is going on in this matter of the general inquiry of the IAC into tariffs is now the subject of a great deal of speculation in the Press and informed circles in this country generally. I say on behalf of the community that I hope the Government took a decision at its Cabinet meeting today. I see the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner) sitting in the House. He can give me some information by saying whether or not a Government announcement on this subject is coming forward today. Can he nod his head and say yes?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall certainly speak through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and say that there is a tragedy for this country at present in the enormous uncertainty that exists in industry relating to the Government's policy on matters of protection. There is a hiatus in the motor vehicle industry and in industry generally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While these general inquiries are about and while there is uncertainty in the Government-it cannot make up its mind on the general terms of reference-investment decisions are put off. While investment decisions are postponed new jobs are not created. All of this is happening at a time when the hidden unemployed are taken into consideration, as they should be. Half a million people are unemployed in this country. There is an expectation that things are getting worse, not better. Inflation and unemployment are on the rise and interest rates, as we have just heard from a previous debate-as if we did not know it already-are at unprecedented levels. I ask for some certainty in these areas and some decisions and announcements from the Government on these tariff matters. </PARA>
<PARA> I was quoting earlier from Mr Chalmers newsletter of 10 days ago. In the last two or three days he has brought out another one. There has been even more in this morning's Australian Financial Review relating to this uncertainty. We learn that industry awaits with great interest just what will emerge from Mr Fraser's statement that the Industries Assistance Commission will be asked to take into account 'recent Government decisions'. In this general inquiry which is to take six months we do not know whether the motor vehicle industry will be back in the melting pot or whether it will be excluded because of the decisions which are due to be taken now on the work that the Industries Assistance Commission is doing into the motor vehicle industry. What about textiles, clothing and footwear? Did we not have announcements at the end of last year relating to policy decisions which were supposed to last seven years? What sort of uncertainty now is created in those particular industries? Will they be included? Another factor in the uncertainty is that we just do not know. I repeat that while this 'do not know' era continues, investment decisions are postponed. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, I ask the Government to improve its standards in many respects, but in relation to these matters there are two particular aspects for consideration. First of all, will the Government get off its tail and make sure that we have better procedures in this Parliament for dealing with the particular tariff proposals it brings before us? Secondly, will it get off its tail and announce to this country what it has in mind in relation to the protection of industry and to the inquiry that has been announced? Will the inquiry last six months? Will we have another six months of uncertainty while investment decisions are postponed? What are the particular terms of reference? I rest my case there. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Freedom of Information Bill represents a major initiative by the Government in its program of administrative law reform. It is, in many respects, a unique initiative. Although a number of countries have freedom of information legislation, Australia was the first country in which a Westminster-style government brought forward such a measure. We have now been joined by Canada and New Zealand. This Bill will establish for members of the public legally enforceable rights of access to information in documentary form held by Ministers and government agencies except where an overriding interest may require confidentiality to be maintained. </PARA>
<PARA> The basic principles of the Freedom of Information Bill are simple. Firstly, government departments and authorities should make their structures and functions known to the public and publish the rules and guidelines they apply in making decisions affecting members of the public. Secondly, members of the public are entitled to access to documents held by government departments and authorities unless there are special reasons for not making those documents public. These principles are emphasised in clause 3 of the Bill which sets out the object of the legislation. That clause also contains an expression of parliamentary intention as to the manner in which the legislation should be interpreted. The discretions conferred by the Bill are to be exercised 'as far as possible to facilitate and promote, promptly and at the lowest reasonable cost, the disclosure of information'. Such a right of access cannot, of course, be absolute. Complete openness of government is not possible. For some purposes, confidentiality is essential. It is widely recognised that governments, like individuals, families and business organisations, cannot operate effectively without a certain amount of privacy. The crucial element in drafting the Freedom of Information Bill has been to strike the appropriate balance between openness and confidentiality. </PARA>
<PARA> The Freedom of Information Bill has been the subject of an extensive public and parliamentary debate. The Bill is based upon the report of an inter-departmental committee, which was tabled in the Parliament in November 1976. The first Bill was introduced into the Senate by the Attorney-General on 9 June 1978. It was referred by the Senate to the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. After an extensive inquiry, that Committee presented its report to the Senate in November 1979. The Committee recommended a number of substantial changes to the Bill. The Government's response to the Senate Committee's report was tabled in the Senate by the Attorney-General in September 1980. A further Bill was introduced into the Senate in the autumn sittings this year. That Bill comes to this House after a number of significant amendments were made during the proceedings in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> Much of debate about the Bill has focused on two matters. These are, first, the appropriate balance between openness and confidentiality and, secondly, the extent to which the right of access to information given by the Bill should require the commitment of resources in departments and authorities at a time when the Government is seeking to contain the size of the public sector. Whilst the Government believes that the Bill as it now stands goes as far as practicable at present, the Government has expressed the view that it would be appropriate for the legislation to be reviewed after it has been in force for about three years. Furthermore, the Government has undertaken to review, after 12 months' operation, the question whether additional rights of access might be given to documents already in the possession of agencies at the date on which the Bill comes into operation, the so-called prior documents. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill establishes the general principle of openness. At the same time, it identifies and defines those circumstances in which confidentiality should be maintained. Thus the Bill contains provisions to protect personal privacy and confidential commercial information, vital national interests such as security and defence and the conduct of government activities for which confidentiality is essential. But even in these cases the Bill does not prohibit information being made available. The Bill emphasises that Ministers and agencies are free to make information available or to give access to documents in any case where this may properly be done. The policy of the Government is to make as much information as possible available to the public. This was set out in a statement on access to official information made on behalf of the Government in the Senate by the Attorney-General on 9 June 1978. </PARA>
<PARA> The Westminster system of government, as we know it, is distinguished by a particular relationship between the Executive government and the Parliament. The Executive Government of the day bears a responsibility to the Parliament and, through the Parliament, to the people, for the proper discharge of the government of the country. Care must therefore be taken in adapting to the Australian system of government legal concepts derived from countries having different systems of government. The proposals in each country must be considered in the context in which they are intended to operate. Thus, the present Bill must be viewed in the context of the systems of administrative review which have already been established by this Parliament, namely, the Commonwealth Ombudsman, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, and the Federal Court of Australia operating under the powers conferred on it by the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act. In addition, there are differences in the nature of the parliamentary institutions in each country which affect the relationships between ministers and the Parliament. The Bill thus contains provisions necessary to recognise the particular features of Cabinet government and to give proper weight both to the function of Ministers to make decisions relating to fundamental issues of government for which they have ultimate responsibility and to the special relationship between Ministers and their senior officials. </PARA>
<PARA> In this regard it is significant that Ministers are subject to questioning in Parliament on matters within their ministerial responsibility both without notice and upon notice by members of the Parliament. By second reading speeches on Bills, by their participation in debates, and by the making of ministerial statements Ministers also give much information about government activity directly to the Parliament. In addition, papers and reports are tabled in the Parliament and much informative material is published by the Australian Government Publishing Service. In addition, material is made available by departments and authorities, including the participation by departmental officers in seminars and conferences and the publication of annual reports. The Government has encouraged Ministers and departments to make as much information available to the public as possible, consistent with the requirements of necessary confidentiality. </PARA>
<PARA> Existing laws under which information is required to be made available will not be affected by the Bill. These include the tabling in Parliament of reports by statutory authorities, the requirements to produce, subject to public interest privilege, documents before courts and other tribunals, and the giving of evidence before parliamentary committees. In addition, the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 entitles persons adversely affected by decisions of Ministers, officials and authorities to reasons for those decisions over a wide range of subject matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The Freedom of Information Bill operates on a wider scope than any of the existing means of obtaining access to information. Access to information under the Bill will not depend on the person seeking access having to show a special interest in obtaining the information. Lack of a special interest will not be a ground on which information can be withheld. The Bill provides for a legally enforceable right of access to documented information. This represents a radical change of approach. The Bill will require Ministers or departments seeking to withhold information to justify their decisions to deny access to information by reference to the criteria specified in the Bill. The Freedom of Information Bill, together with other recent reforms in administrative law, thus emphasises the administrative accountability of Ministers and their departments. In common with that legislation it remains within the concept of a 'Westminster-based' system of government, but forms part of an improved system of judicial and public scrutiny of decison-making processes within the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> So far I have referred to those aspects of the Bill which preserve a proper balance of interest in providing for mandatory access to information. There is, however, another aspect of the concept of open government embodied in the Bill. The Bill imposes a positive obligation on departments and authorities to make public their organisations and structure, and the functions they perform. They are also obliged to make available to their 'clients' the criteria employed in the exercise of decision-making functions, by making available for inspection and purchase copies of manuals, guidelines, instuctions and the like. Some of this material is now available, but not in a co-ordinated form, nor is it easy for a member of the public to find it out. The Administrative Arrangements Order specifies the functions of departments in broad terms and some details of oganisation and structure are given in the Commonwealth Government Directory. Some departments have published manuals and the like for the information of those interested, but others have not. The relevant provisions are contained in Part II of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Parts III, IV and VI of the Bill are concerned with the right of a person to obtain access to a document in the possession of a Minister, a department or authority. They are based on the principle, as set out in clause 11, that every person has a legally enforceable right to obtain access in accordance with the Act to such documents unless the document concerned is an exempt document. These Parts of the Bill do not, however, provide for access to documents which will be available under archives legislation, to documents open to public access in accordance with other statutory provisions, to documents published for sale to the public or, with certain exceptions, to existing documents already in the possession of agencies when the legislation comes into force. </PARA>
<PARA> Two of these exclusions require some explanation. The archives Bill, which is before the Senate, will regulate the archival collections of the Commonwealth and will deal in that context with rights of access to documents more than 30 years old. Different principles apply to documents that do not directly concern current events and where the requirements of confidentiality are not the same. The other point concerns prior documents. To give a general right to access to all existing documents, as well as to those brought into existence in the future, would substantially increase the administrative burden and cost of implementing the legislation at a time when the Government is seeking to contain the resources devoted to the Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA> There are, however, two exceptions to the general exclusion of prior documents. The first, and most significant, concerns the case where a person seeks access to a document which contains information relating to his personal affairs. In that case, his right of access under the Bill extends to documents which came into the possession of an agency up to five years prior to the commencement of Part III of the Bill. The second exception deals with the case where access to a prior document is reasonably necessary to a proper understanding of a document to which the applicant has lawfully had access, whether under the freedom of information legislation or otherwise. The right of access given by the Bill extends to such a prior document. Moreover, of course, in keeping with the general principle that the Bill does not constitute a complete code of access, prior documents may be made available where this can lawfully be done. </PARA>
<PARA> The grounds of exemption on which access to a document may be refused are set out in Part IV of the Bill. I shall explain the principles which have been adopted in drafting these exemptions. As I have said, the Bill provides a balance between the public interest served by access to information against the public interest in maintaining the confidentiality necessary for the operation of government and the protection of the commercial confidences and the privacy of those who have dealings with government or about whom information is collected by government. The clauses of the Bill defining the exempt categories of documents are drafted for the most part in terms of the interest, whether the public interest or the interest of individuals or private sector bodies, which may be damaged by disclosure of the documents in question. Only in some cases are the exempt documents defined by reference to the nature of the document itself, such as Cabinet and Executive Council documents. It is of the essence of Cabinet government that the deliberations of Cabinet and of the Executive Council should be protected from mandatory disclosure. Of course, the tenor of many Cabinet decisions, as well as various Executive Council decisions are published. The documents which make these decisions public are not, of course, exempt documents under the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Except in those cases where a document is in an exempt category by reason of its nature, the Bill requires a decision to refuse access to a document to be made on the basis of an assessment whether harm would result from the document being made public. Thus, for example, a document is not exempt because it relates to Commonwealth-State matters; it is exempt only if its disclosure under the Act could reasonably be expected to cause damage to Commonwealth-State relations. A document is not exempt merely because it relates to the internal working of a department; to justify refusal, disclosure must cause some detriment to a specified public interest, such as prejudice to the public interest in maintaining the full and frank discussion of issues between officers or the preservations of confidential relations between Ministers and officials. </PARA>
<PARA> By drafting the Bill in this way, it is intended to emphasise the need to justify any denial of access by reference to an interest that should, in the particular case, be preferred to the public interest in access to the information in the document. Moreover, where only part of the matter contained in a document is such as to justify a denial of access, the Bill would impose a positive obligation to make a copy of the remainder of the document available if it is practicable to segregate the exempt matter and the segregation does not result in a misleading document. </PARA>
<PARA> In enacting freedom of information legislation within a Westminster-based system of government, the matter of the final authority to decide whether the giving of access would be contrary to the public interest is clearly of fundamental importance. It would be inconsistent with the responsibility of Ministers to the Parliament for the proper conduct of government that final decisions on the public release of documents damaging to vital public interests should be in the hands of tribunals not accountable to the Parliament. Whilst the Bill provides for an independent review of all decisions to refuse access to the document, there are certain cases in which a decision by the reviewing tribunal that a document is not an exempt document and therefore access should be given does not take effect without the concurrence of the responsible Minister. These cases concern matters relating to defence, national security, international relations and Commonwealth-State relations, the protection of Cabinet and Executive Council confidentiality and the relations between Ministers and their official advisers where disclosure would be contrary to the public interest. In these cases, the Bill provides for a system of conclusive certificates. Such a certificate establishes that a document in respect of which it is given is an exempt document. In the case of Cabinet and Executive Council documents, such a certificate may be given by the Secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet or the Secretary to the Federal Executive Council, as the case may be. In other cases, the certificate may be given by the responsible Minister or the principal officer of the agency concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill establishes a special judicial tribunal, the Document Review Tribunal, for the purposes of reviewing a case in which such a certificate is given. The function of the Document Review Tribunal is to consider whether there are reasonable grounds for the claim that the document concerned is exempt, and to recommend accordingly. If the Tribunal considers that there are no reasonable grounds for claiming exemption in respect of a particular document, the conclusive certificate nevertheless still operates unless the responsible Minister decides to revoke it. In all other cases, the question whether a document is in an exempt category and therefore access may be refused may be reviewed by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, which is empowered to make a final decision on the matter subject only to appeal to the Federal Court of Australia on questions of law. </PARA>
<PARA> The class of documents that have come to be described as internal working documents is a particularly important class of documents. These are defined in clause 36 of the Bill. They are the documents that are concerned with the deliberative and policy-forming processes of government. It is well recognised that it would be prejudicial to the free and frank exchange of opinion for many documents of this kind, particularly those at the more senior levels of government, to become publicly available as a matter of course. The neutrality of Public Service advisers, and the ability of governments of differing political complexions to have confidence in the impartiality of advice given by their Public Service advisers, would be damaged if officials became identified with particular advice whether or not that advice was accepted by the Ministers to whom it was given. </PARA>
<PARA> The class of documents specified in clause 36 is, however, a wide class, necessarily so in order to cover many diverse situations, and it is apparent that the disclosure of many documents falling within that class might not be prejudicial to the public interest. Clause 36 therefore provides that an internal working document may not be withheld unless its release would be contrary to the public interest on a particular ground to be specified by the agency when refusing access. </PARA>
<PARA> The protection of business confidentiality has been a matter of particular concern in the drafting of the legislation. Government agencies come into the possession of a great deal of information of a confidential commercial character, much of it supplied on a voluntary basis. A number of private sector organisations have expressed concern at the possibility of disclosure to competitors of information supplied by commercial enterprises. Ministers have given assurances that confidential information of a commercial character supplied by private sector organisations would not be subject to disclosure under freedom of information legislation. Clause 43 of the Bill therefore exempts from mandatory disclosure information of a confidential commercial character. The Bill also requires an agency to consult with the supplier of information of this kind and to take into account any submissions the supplier makes before deciding to release a document containing the information. Furthermore, the supplier is given the right to appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal against the release of such a document on the ground that the information in it would be exempt under clause 43. </PARA>
<PARA> Matters of personal privacy are protected by clause 41 of the Bill, which provides that access to a document may be refused, other than to the person involved, if disclosure of it would be an unreasonable disclosure of the personal affairs of any person. Clause 41 is to be regarded as an interim solution to this matter, pending consideration of the report on privacy to be made by the Australian Law Reform Commission. When that report is available, the Government will review the provisions of clause 41. Most of the remaining exemptions in Part IV are concerned with the protection of the national economy, of particular operation and interests of agencies and of law enforcement and public safety. Special provision is made for the protection of documents relating to the administration of State company and securities law under the Co-operative Companies and Securities Scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 38 of the Bill is intended to have the effect of preserving the operation of special secrecy provisions in other legislation. The Government has, however, given an undertaking that all existing secrecy provisions will be reviewed within three years of the freedom of information legislation coming into force. Where only part of a document contains exempt matter, there is an obligation to make available a copy of the document with the exempt matter deleted, if it is practicable to do so and the deletions would not produce a misleading result. This is provided by clause 22 of the Bill. Moreover, in those cases where the Bill provides for a certificate to be conclusive of the fact that a document is an exempt document and only a part of the document contains exempt matter, the certificate must identify that part. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the agencies to which the Bill applies. Broadly speaking, it applies to all Commonwealth departments, to Commonwealth statutory authorities and the holders of statutory offices, and to the registries of courts and tribunals. Provision is made for non-statutory bodies established by the Commonwealth, incorporated companies or associations under the control of the Commonwealth and the holders of non-statutory appointments to be brought within the scope of the Bill by regulations. The Bill does not apply to the parliamentary departments or to the agencies specified in Part I of the second Schedule to the Bill. A number of agencies are exempt in respect of specified functions. These are set out in Part II of the second Schedule. </PARA>
<PARA> The procedures for obtaining access under the Bill involve a minimum of formality. The Bill requires that a decision on a request for access be given as soon as practicable and in any event not more than 60 days after the request is received. The time limit applies to a request that is identified as being made under the Freedom of Information Act and that is sent to the agency concerned at an address of the agency specified in the regulations. If such a request is not dealth with within the 60-day period, the applicant will be entitled to appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal as if his requests has been denied. The period of 60 days may be reduced by regulation if experience shows that agencies are able to deal with requests within a shorter time without undue strain on resources. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not propose to describe in detail the procedural provisions in Part III of the Bill. I refer only to two important aspects. Firstly, there is a statutory duty on agencies to assist applicants to make requests in a form which will enable them to be dealt with under the Bill. This is a significant feature of the Bill. Secondly, a number of the provisions have regard to the resource implications of requests, particularly requests which would involve searching for and collating a large number of documents, by empowering an agency to refuse a request if the work involved would substantially interfere with its other operations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for extensive rights of review of decisions refusing access. Where the initial decision is made at a level below ministerial or principal officer level, the first step in the review is for an application to be made to the agency concerned to have the decision reviewed. Alternatively, a complaint might be made to the Ombudsman, who has his ordinary powers of investigation. In addition, the Bill provides that the Ombudsman is not precluded from investi- gating a matter on the ground that the Bill provides for an alternative means of review. If the applicant is dissatisfied with the decision of the agency on internal review, there is a right of appeal in all cases to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. However, as already noted, there are certain decisions affecting the more sensitive classes of documents which may not be reviewed by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The Bill provides that these decisions may be reviewed by a new tribunal, constituted under Part VII of the Bill, to be known as the Document Review Tribunal. The decisions of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal have binding force. Those of the Document Review Tribunal are, as already noted, of a recommendatory nature only but, being given in public, will necessarily carry a great deal of weight. </PARA>
<PARA> Part V of the Bill provides for amendment of personal records. A person who obtains access under the Bill to a document containing information relating to his personal affairs may, if he believes that information to be incomplete, inaccurate, misleading or out of date, apply to the agency concerned to have the necessary corrections or alterations made. There is a right of appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal if the agency concerned refuses to make the requested correction or alteration. This right of correction of personal records applies only to Australian citizens and persons having permanent resident status in Australia. The provisions of Part V are regarded as interim pending the report of the Law Reform Commission on privacy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government believes that the Bill represents a major step forward in removing unnecessary secrecy from the administrative processes of government. Together with the legislation already on the statute book, the Bill will advance the Government's intention to make Commonwealth administration more responsive to the public need. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter we are debating-it is very significant; we have an immediate debate-is the Freedom of Information Bill 1981. Of course, it should not cause any surprise that we are to debate the matter immediately. It has been before the Senate for some years. It follows, as I understood the Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair) said, that it would be expected that we would have some knowledge of that matter. We have. I say on behalf of the Opposition that we are not opposing the second reading of the Bill. As the Bill has been before a Senate committee we will be moving amendments in the committee stage which will be in accordance with the recommendations of that committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Freedom of Information Bill comes to this House after being in the Senate for some considerable period. It seems to have come with a rush into this House. It would appear that the Senate felt obliged finally to conclude its debate on this Bill before the Government lost control of the Senate. I do not know what the sudden urgency is now because obviously there was no urgency in the Senate where the Bill has been for some years until the concluding stages of the last session as I said. It has become very apparent that we ought to be debating this legislation. In fact, as I understand it, that is all we will be debating this week because the Government regards it as having such a high priority. We say at the outset that amendments have been accepted in the Senate. They have been of some value. Some of them have been actually accepted by the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) in a fashion, if I may say so, that would indicate that he has accepted them in the spirit of improving the Bill though I think possibly against the wishes of his Government. To that extent one must congratulate the Attorney- General. </PARA>
<PARA> But we do not want to overstate the case. There is much that can be done and should have been done and, in fact, should have been accepted by the Senate in the light of the recommendations of its committee. As I say, there has been improvement but there still remains much to be done. The original Bill was aptly described as a Bill that was concerned with freedom from information. There was no chance at all to say that we could have obtained any information under the original legislation. As a result of the issue going to a Senate committee the Bill has been marginally improved. If we look at the Bill from the point of view of assessing its merits, in any marking it would get about five out of 10-barely a pass. The Bill is not as good as it could have been or should have been. However, it is not as obnoxious as it was in its initial stages. I place on record again that Senator Durack has faced considerable difficulties. I am convinced that had he had his own way the Bill would have been much better in its final form than it is now. However, the Attorney-General was overriden by a very dominant Cabinet with a most dominant Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) who appears to be obsessed with secrecy. We will deal with these matters as we go through some of the amendments later in the week. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen the Government somewhat obsessed with secrecy. The most ludicrous example was the attempt to suppress the publication of the Munster and Walsh publication in what were called the Australian defence papers between 1969 and 1975. It was well known that these papers were known to many other agencies. In fact, some of them had already been circulated. The Government took the extraordinary provision of going to the High Court of Australia to say that those matters should not be published. We should bear in mind, of course, that the book had already been published. Mr Justice Mason in the High Court accurately pinpointed the fallacies in this unjustified attitude to secrecy. But the same attitude underlies this Bill. There is this extraordinary belief that information is a gift given only to a government, that the Government owns the information and that the public should be grateful if it gets any information at all. </PARA>
<PARA> We on the Opposition side believe that freedom of information is a basic democratic right and it lies at the very heart of the democratic system. If people are to make informed choices about a particular matter or a policy or about who is to govern this country, then the widest possible information should be made available in order that the choices can be made in an informed manner. Withholding of information should be kept to the barest minimum. In order to protect the public interest we must always guarantee that there will be an impartial body, such as the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, that can certainly guarantee that protection. The withholding of information goes beyond simply leaving the public in the dark; it can be used positively to mislead the public, as occurred with circumstances surrounding our entry and our commitment to the Vietnam war. subsequent publications have been able to illustrate clearly that there was a complete deception of the Australian nation. </PARA>
<PARA> The withholding of information has another effect. It makes Government information a valuable commodity. It makes insiders to the processes of government, that is people with special information, able to use that information to their advantage or, indeed, leak it or sell it at a profit. We have, for example, had debates in this Parliament on the difficulties in the tendering for computer facilities. Not the least of which we can hark back to is the IBM Australia Ltd and Facom Australia Ltd disaster and the advantages which can be gained from having the ear of government or, in that case, of the Prime Minister. It was very well known that IBM was given some assistance to get some reconsideration of a decision that was against it. But this was not known to anyone else at the time. Yet the Parliament and the Australian public were not able to obtain that same information. </PARA>
<PARA> In many of the answers to questions in this place, whether they be questions on notice or questions without notice, it is clear that Ministers are not aware of the principles of freedom of information or, if they are, they are not prepared to bring into effect, by way of their answers, the tenor of those principles. There is a view that all of the faults of the Freedom of Information Bill have been caused by the bureaucrats fighting to get their way. To some extent that could be true. But we have to look at it in the total concept of what has happened and what we are aware of. All blame does not lie with the bureaucrats. We are aware that bureaucrats believe it is highly dangerous to inform the public of what is occurring in government. It is even more dangerous at times, they say, to allow Ministers actually to administer their departments. But, of course, because of our ability in this place, we are able to guarantee at times that Ministers come and go, but as people know, bureaucrats have a tendency to live on. </PARA>
<PARA> The bureaucracy must take a lot of the blame for the delays in achieving freedom of information and for the fact that the principles of freedom of information have not been translated into legislation. It seems extraordinary that Ministers have used the argument put forward by the bureaucracy that the Westminster system is not compatible with comprehensive freedom of information legislation. That is completely incorrect. The Westminster system is largely a myth in Australia particularly under conservative governments. Ministers do not resign because of maladministration; they are not really accountable to Parliament and they do not take full responsibility for their departments. Time and again we have seen examples of Ministers being snowed by their departments and getting into serious political trouble. </PARA>
<PARA> However, while there is no doubt that the bureaucracy does not want adequate freedom of information legislation, there are some exceptions. There is also no doubt that many Ministers, including the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) are very wary of allowing the public to know much at all. Too much government secrecy leads to a situation where leaks become the order of the day in informing the public. We can state without qualification that leaking is a reprehensible practice and one that often leads to misinformation, depending on the motives of the person doing the leaking. Oppositions, of course, tend to have less strong views on leaking than when they are in government. Prior to 11 November 1975, the Prime Minister even invented a new theory which might be described as 'a duty to leak'. That new notion was so absurd that it took only until the relevant date-that is, 11 November 1975-before the Prime Minister discarded that theory and adopted the view that public servants who leaked, contrary to the interests of the Government, should be disciplined by firing squads. Prime Ministers, of course, do not leak to the Press; they merely give background briefings. These background briefings are sometimes regarded by State Premiers in much the same way as the Prime Minister regards leaks by public servants. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason for freedom of information legislation is to give the public a legal right to information held by Ministers and government agencies. The exceptions to this right must be kept to an absolute minimum. For example, there must be no constraint on the ability of Cabinet to have full and frank discussions. Freedom of information does not make people a party to what happens in the Cabinet room. The problem with this Bill is that the list of exemptions is far too wide. Many of the exemptions are too widely drafted and, in most cases-this is fundamental to what we are about-the decision of the Minister is final. One can advert to clauses 33 to 47 which are included in Part IV of the Bill. The trend of judicial opinion shown in Australia in cases such as the Sankey case and the case known as the Fairfax case is that it is the courts and not the Government which ought to decide whether the public has a right to information. </PARA>
<PARA> If one takes the view that the public has a right to information, which can be excluded only in the most exceptional cases, it is quite wrong in principle to allow the Government, which may be an interesed party in the withholding of information, to be the final arbiter of whether disclosure will be allowed. There is provision in the Bill for the creation of the Document Review Tribunal. It can act as some mitigation of the position. But that does not alter the basic objection that the withholding of information can be finally decided by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> While one has some respect for Senator Durack for deciding on the Document Review Tribunal model, one has no respect for the Liberal senators who made so much noise about freedom of information but who acquiesced in it. For Senator Durack it was a concession. For the Liberal senators it was a sellout. I make the point that we were given this recommendation by the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs of which those senators were members. I note from the Senate Hansard that one senator spoke about the seven deadly sins when objecting to what the Bill meant. The first deadly sin nominated by the honourable gentleman was that relating to conclusive ministerial certificates. The honourable gentleman, with others, acquiesced to the relevant provision in the Bill. So if one is to be condemned to hell for practising the seven deadly sins, these senators should look at their careers in the future because certainly they did not vote in accordance with what they said, nor did they vote in accordance with the recommendations of the Senate Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> At least the Government knew that it could convince its own senators. The almost indecent haste with which the Bill was pushed through the Senate in the last session was in order that the Bill could be passed, as I said earlier, before the Government lost its Senate majority. We hear all kinds of nonsense about how Government senators treat their positions seriously in the so-called House of Review. The proof of promises is performance. Government senators-in particular the three senators who I have mentioned-who are members of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs did not perform in respect of this Bill. Statements of intent and promises were made; they were not kept. The failure of the Senate to remove the use of conclusive ministerial certificates is an indictment of those senators. It places us in the House of Representatives again in the position of considering that perhaps at times we ought to have a few committees. If these senators could carry on a review over a period of years, as well meaning as it was, and be able to debate the Bill at such length and, to some extent, improve it, one must, in all humanity, suggest that if the House of Representatives could have this Bill before it for longer than a week, perhaps we could make some amendments. If we could have a committee of Government and Opposition members considering this Bill, surely we could make even more amendments than the worthy gentlemen in the other House were able to make over a period of years. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of the exemptions remain too wide. Clause 44, for example, dealing with documents affecting the national economy, is a nonsense provision. Paragraph (1) (a) declares documents exempt if disclosure could reasonably be expected to have a substantial effect on the ability of the Government of the Commonwealth to manage the economy of Australia. The simple answer to this, I suppose, is that no document can be exempt on this ground because the Government has no ability to manage the economy of Australia. However, this simply demonstrates how absurd it is to put such a criterion into legislation. If the exemption related to adverse effects on the economy of Australia-that is, not of the Government-it would at least be explicable. In its present form it is ludicrous. </PARA>
<PARA> Paragraph (1) (b) of clause 44 is either a confidence trick or a piece of careless drafting. It exempts any document which could reasonably be expected to cause undue disturbance to business or an undue benefit or detriment to anyone because of a premature disclosure of proposed Government action or inaction. Surely there ought to be some limit on that sort of criteria. This clause is in no way confined to documents containing material of an economic nature, so it covers the whole field. If the Government were to accept one amendment in this place, it ought to accept our amendment to this clause, which is to redefine that provision and to guarantee that it relates to the question of the economy; otherwise the provision is so wide that the Government's bona fides must come into question. </PARA>
<PARA> We also object to clause 33, not simply because of the use of conclusive certificates by Ministers, but also because there is a reference to Commonwealth-State relations which are put on the same basis as international relations. Information communicated by any government, whether it be a State government or a government of another country, is automatically exempt. State governments will be aware of the possibilities here. All communications with the Commonwealth and information supplied to the Commonwealth will simply be stamped 'Confidential' and 'In Confidence'. That will be enough to exempt that document completely from disclosure. We propose an amendment to provide that disclosure must be contrary to the public interest-that is to ensure a test: Whether a document is contrary to the public interest-before it is exempt and to allow for appeals to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal on a refusal to grant access. We would also like to see a provision for reverse freedom of information as it is called whereby a State government can appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for a review of the decision that a document is not exempt. If it is good enough for the Commonwealth, why is it not good enough for a State? As far as Cabinet documents are concerned, there is at present no definition as to what exactly is meant by the term 'Cabinet documents'. It would appear that the term will embrace documents containing only factual material, technical reports, or reports prepared by outside consultants or statutory bodies. They ought not to be excluded on the grounds that they have been Cabinet documents or have been submitted to Cabinet or to the Executive Council. </PARA>
<PARA> The provisions relating to other legislation containing secrecy provisions effectively mean that any such legislation is given an overriding force over the Freedom of Information Act. A list of such legislation was provided to the Senate Select Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs by the Attorney-General's Department on 5 June 1979. It is Appendix 6 to the report, pages 485 to 489 inclusive. At the very least a full-scale review of this legislation should be made in order to ascertain whether these provisions in other Acts conform to the principles of freedom of information. If honourable members look at that list, they will see that it is very substantial indeed. The Schedule to this Bill ought also to contain provisions relating to freedom of information, that is, relating to secrecy provisions, in such a fashion that all such information is contained in the one piece of legislation. It should not be spread all over the place so that one has to look at Commonwealth statutes, statutory rules, Australian Capital Territory legislation, and at various bits and pieces of imperial legislation such as that applying to the Navy, Army and Air Force. It is quite an extraordinary way to draft these provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the objections generally concerning Part IV of the Bill is that, apart from clause 36 dealing with internal working documents, the concept of public interest is not consistently adopted as a separate criterion. It is quite illogical to adopt a public interest test as a separate test for internal working documents, and then to exclude it as a test, for example, for financial or property interests of an agency-that is, clause 39-or documents relating to agency operations such as tests and audits, or personnel considerations or industrial relations negotiations, for example, clause 40. Clause 43 relating to trade secrets and business information is also too wide. Paragraph (1) (b) exempts information of which disclosure could diminish commercial value. There is no test whether disclosure would be reasonable or whether the disadvantage that the person would suffer would be unreasonable. Further, it relates to all businesses, whether lawful or unlawful. If a business were unlawful-for example, a business which was in breach of Commonwealth export controls or currency regulations, or Foreign Investment Review Board guidelines-one would have thought that it was necessarily in the public interest that this should be disclosed as should information concerning any illegal business whether it be gambling, prostitution or anything else. </PARA>
<PARA> We also have strong objections to Schedule 2 which exempts certain agencies from the operation of the Bill either generally-that is Part I-or in respect of particular categories of documents as found in Part II. While these agencies themselves fall into different categories, particularly defence and commercial categories, it is the view of the Opposition that there is no justificatoin for exempting any agencies at all under Schedule 2. One might, of course, say that the Commonwealth Bank should not be subject to the Freedom of Information Act in such a way that it would be exposed to commercial disadvantage from its private bank competitors, or that it would be against the interests of national security for the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation to be open to public scrutiny under the Act. The answer to such suggestions is that the Bill provides exemption for categories of documents such as business affairs and national security. In that respect, I refer to clauses 33 and 43, for example. It is simply not necessary to exempt agencies in total. One would not think that very much information would be provided by ASIO. Nevertheless, any information provided by that agency under the Act will be a considerable improvement. </PARA>
<PARA> In matters relating to procedure the Bill is also defective. In the area of documents in existence before the commencement of the Act, the Opposition in the Senate moved, as we propose to do again in the course of this debate, that all documents relating to the personal affairs of a person should be disclosed as should documents not more than five years old after the Act has been in operation for 12 months. The Government, in what appears to be a nice piece of sleight of hand, moved that documents relating to personal affairs could be obtained under the Act if they were not more than five years old. This is very different from the Opposition proposal which was that all documents relating to personal affairs, irrespective of time, should be included within the ambit of the Act and that, after the Act has been in operation for a year, there should be retrospectivity for five years from the commencement of the Act. While the Opposition is pleased with the insertion of Part V which enables people to have their personal records amended, that right is contingent upon the person being able to obtain access to the documents. Under the Bill there is no right of access to documents which are more than five years old. </PARA>
<PARA> Again I make the point that there is a great need to look at what happens from the point of view of access to documents. We have had privilege committees of this Parliament investigate many matters and, during the most recent and most famous inquiry, it was very clear that if the Parliament or the members of it had had access to the documents relating to a person they would have seen that that person in fact appeared to have suffered an injustice. A recommendation has been made to this Parliament that there should be protection of witnesses legislation that ensures that anybody who appears before a parliamentary committee and gives evidence will not suffer damage or retribution in any way. There was strong prima facie evidence that that had in fact happened in the past and the only safety net for what had happened was the fact that this Parliament had a privileges committee. It might well be appropriate for us to have a standing committee to which any of our constituents who feel there is some reason to have a look at records may apply for that to happen. The records should be made available to that parliamentary committee to use its discretion as to what should be made available to the person concerned. When the records were looked at, the most disquieting feature of the case that I have in mind, was not only that the person concerned might be prevented from getting information but also that the members of this Parliament, constituting a committee of the Parliament, were not to be given accurate information. If we cannot get the information and we have this sort of facility given to others to advise Ministers not to give that information, it will be very difficult indeed for the public to have access to it. In other words, if something is wrong, incomplete, out-of-date or misleading, it should not just be passed over. It does not become right simply because five years have passed. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the arguments against retrospectivity is that it would cost too much to apply. This is an argument used by opponents of freedom of information. It was a cost argument which led to the adoption of the proposal for only five years' retrospectivity and then only after the Act has been in operation for one year. However, the cost argument can be easily overstated. The cost of the Freedom of Information Bill will be very small compared, for example, with the cost of the Government's propaganda. The cost of retrospectivity for five years could be met easily by abolishing the Government Information Unit which is now costing half a million dollars a year-something at which I think the Government ought to have a serious look. There are various other areas where the Act will be defective unless the Oppostition amendments are agreed to, and we are not always confident that they will be accepted. It is unfortunate that the Ombudsman has not been given the wide jurisdiction envisaged by the Committee and as moved for in the Senate by the Opposition. If honourable members look at the report of the Senate Select Committee, they will see that there was a role recommended for the Ombudsman. It was a question of being able to act as a counsel or an advocate. It was also to guarantee that the ministerial decisions would be within the jurisidiction of the Ombudsman. None of that has happened. It is unfortunate that the Government has not seen fit to adopt the proposal to reduce gradually the time limit for dealing with requests to 45 days after two years of operation of the Act and 30 days after four years of operation of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> It is now nine years since freedom of information became part of the Australian political agenda in the Labor Party's policy speech of 1972. Since then we have seen obstruction by the Public Service, particularly that manifested in the inter-departmental committee reports of 1974 and 1976. They could be described as proposals for freedom of information only by a misuse of the English language. There was no intention in those reports to give information. We saw the regrettable 1978 Bill which led to the referral of the matter to the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. We saw a less than adequate response to that Committee's report from the government and the introduction of the 1981 Bill, which was only a slight improvement on the 1978 Bill. A Bill has now been introduced into this House which at least adopts the first principles of freedom of information, but only just. It ought to be our responsibility to improve that Bill. If we do not, we cannot say that we are concerned about the encroachment of the Executive-that includes both the Government and the Public Service-on the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments which have been moved in the Senate will be moved again in this House. They are not being moved for the sake of rhetoric or point scoring. We believe that all governments should pass legislation such as we have proposed. If it cannot be done by this Government it will be done by a Labor Government. The Government rushed the legislation through the Senate during the last session. It said that it had gone so far and would go no further. That is still not far enough. Senator Missen said at one stage that it was the last opportunity to do something for the Bill. He said that before he voted the wrong way. However, he made the point that it is not good enough to pass a weak Bill and hoped that we will be able to improve it in 10 years' time. That is the present position. I hope that the Government takes notice of what I have said. It is well aware of the situation because of the length of the Senate debate. The Opposition will move the amendments which I have foreshadowed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the Freedom of Information Bill. It has been a long time in the making. The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner), in his second reading speech, gave a history of this Bill. It has been before the Senate and before various committees. It has finally reached this House. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) sounded as though he would like to prolong its passage through this place. I think it is all to the good to ensure that at long last we pass some freedom of information Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill is designed to give effect to the right to know. It is a real step forward. It fundamentally affects the relationship between the Executive and the Parliament and between the citizen and the Government. The right to information is essential in a democracy such as ours. If the Australian electorate is to be able to make a valid judgment on government policy it should have the greatest possible access to the information available. How can any community progress without a continuing and informed debate? How can it conduct such a debate unless there is available to it information on what action a government is taking and why it is taking it? This Bill is designed to ensure that if someone wishes to have access to information held by government it will not be unreasonably withheld. The object of the Bill is stated in clause 3. It can be summarised as being to extend the right of the Australian community to access to official information in the possession of the government or the Commonwealth by making available to the public information about the operations of departments and public authorities ensuing, in particular, that rules and practices affecting members of the public in their dealings with departments and public authorities are readily available to persons affected by those rules and practices. Further, it is to create a general right of access to official information in documentary form in the possession of Ministers, departments and public authorities, limited only by what is necessary to maintain essential confidentiality. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the Bill was reintroduced into the Senate this year a number of amendments have been made. They go a long way towards dealing with the alleged defects in the Bill. I refer in particular to the provisions regarding retrospectivity and what are known as conclusive certificates. The initial Bill was framed in a way which provided that no access to documents in existence at the date of the commencement of the Act could be obtained. This prohibition was not included for any sinister purpose. It was included for common sense, practical reasons. Nobody can yet be sure what the demand on Commonwealth departments and agencies for information will be once it is available pursuant to this Bill. It is not hard to imagine that if there were no provisions limiting retrospectivity somebody might want information 10 or 15 years of age. It would take some days, perhaps even weeks, of searching to procure the appropriate documents. Even if it were only a matter of days, when one considers the cost of an employee of the Commonwealth, it is easy to appreciate that costs could be considerable. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said that the cost would be less than the cost of the Government Information Unit. I suggest that he would not have any idea of what the cost would be if there were a completely open access to all information held in government. The cost may be small or very large indeed. Until the Act has been in operation and we see the kinds of demands made upon the service that will be available, there is no sensible way of assessing the cost. It was for this reason that the Bill first prohibited access to information in existence prior to the date of commencement of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Attorney-General (Senator Durack) has stated that after three years there will be a review in the light of the experience of those three years. The Minister for Industrial Relations, in his second reading speech, repeated that today. However, the Government has now changed its position to some extent. It has made an arrangement which I believe is reasonable pending that review. Certain documents will now be available even though they are already in existence. They are documents or parts of documents that contain information relating to the personal affairs of a person where those documents become the official documents of an agency or a Minister not earlier than five years from the date of commencement of the Act. It also includes documents or parts of documents that are necessary to understand reasonably a document to which a person would otherwise be entitled to have access. It seems to me that these two amendments provide some protection for persons who are involved in or touched by a particular document already in existence and also, quite sensibly, give access to documents which, were that access not provided, would render incomprehensible documents which are already available. I repeat: The Attorney-General has reiterated on a number of occasions that there will be a review in the light of experience and in the light of the demands made upon the Public Service once the Bill is passed. Should experience demonstrate a tolerable level of demand for access to information, I would expect that a more relaxed approach could be taken and that a phased-in form of retrospectivity could take place. I notice that an amendment which was moved in the Senate and which I gather will be moved here by the Opposition later this week proposes a form of phased-in access in that it is intended that the retrospectivity will not take place for a year after the commencement of the legislation. Quite clearly the Opposition itself realises that there may be some difficulties in the early stages of the operation of this legislation and acknowledges that it cannot have any real knowledge of what demands will be made upon the Public Service to provide information. </PARA>
<PARA> The area of conclusive certificates is another where there has been a significant amendment. As both the Minister and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition have explained, there is a range of documents which at the moment, in pursuance of provisions of this legislation, cannot be provided to the public when it is stated that they are documents of a particular kind. They include documents affecting national security, defence, international relations and relations with States, Cabinet documents, Executive Council documents and internal working documents. It is intended that whenever a Minister, Cabinet secretary or Executive Council secretary signs a certificate to say that such documents are of a particular character, the documents will be exempt and the certificate will be conclusive of that fact. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Government accepted in the Senate a provision for a document review tribunal. This tribunal will have the opportunity of examining documents, albeit very briefly in some cases, to ensure that they meet the description in that provision and, therefore, that they are genuinely documents covered by the exclusions set out in that provision. It is true that in those instances the findings of the review tribunal will be not mandatory but rather recommendatory. But when one considers the kinds of documents which are involved and which are listed, it is clear that the tribunal's findings, though important, cannot be conclusive because in many instances presumably only the Ministers involved would know of the documents' ultimate significance. However, the findings of the tribunal, though not mandatory, would be public and one would hope and expect that the Minister would not lightly ignore the findings. Indeed, one would expect, should a tribunal make a finding that a document ought to be made public, that a Minister would be reluctant not to do so except in the most pressing circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one area where I think access is still overly limited. Clause 6 of the Bill provides for certain organisations to be exempt from the provisions of the legislation. The clause permits certain organisations to be wholly exempt and permits other organisations, whilst not to be wholly exempt, at least to have certain of their documents exempted. It appears to me that a number of organisations that are wholly exempt seem, at first sight at any event, to have no reasonable justification for that exemption. One can understand a variety of reasons for documents not being made public, including security reasons and the possibility that commercial disadvantage may be suffered. But I refer to the second Schedule to the Bill. Part I lists the organisations or agencies which are wholly exempt. Part II lists the organisations or agencies which are exempt in respect of particular documents. Part I includes the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and the Office of National Assessments. Let me make it quite clear that I am more than content for them to be exempt agencies. I do not suggest in any way that their documents should be open. For example, ASIO is subject to a judicial audit and I believe that is sufficient protection for the public interest having regard to the kind of work it is required to carry out. </PARA>
<PARA> But in respect of some organisations listed in Part I of the second Schedule the explanation is less apparto the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories Commission. Why that organisation should have all its documents exempt I frankly do not understand. No doubt it has commercial dealings. Perhaps they ought to be exempt in the sense that in Part II documents in respect of the competitive commercial activities of some agencies are exempt. I understand that and were that Commission in Part II, I would not raise the matter. But it seems rather odd that it should be in Part I. I refer also to the Aboriginal Land Councils and Land Trusts. No doubt some of those organisations would have commercial activities. Their documents in relation to those activities possibly ought to be exempt. But I am sure that they are engaged in many activities which do not require exemption and which in no sense involve the kinds of documents which the organisations themselves would expect to have classified or to be forbidden from public gaze. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>In doing so, I present the Budget for 1981-82. </PARA>
<PARA>1980-81 IN RETROSPECT</PARA>
<PARA> 1980-81 was a year of solid growth and achievement for the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> It was a year in which the benefits of this Government's economic policies not only became more apparent, but were widely enjoyed by the Australian people. Nothing illustrates this more than the fact that real wages rose by over 4 per cent in 1980-81-a gain that was shared by 140 000 extra people in employment. </PARA>
<PARA> It was a year in which the fight against inflation was seen more clearly than ever before, not as an end in itself, but as a means of achieving greater investment, more jobs and higher living standards for all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> I say these things fully recognising that for those affected by the recent drought it was a year of adversity and, in many cases, real hardship. </PARA>
<PARA> Economic success was achieved across a broad front. </PARA>
<PARA> Production, employment, investment and consumer demand were not only stronger than a year earlier, but greater than thought likely at the time of the last Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's international reputation as a strong, reliable country in which to invest, was further enhanced. </PARA>
<PARA> Among the economic indicators, the area of greatest strength was undoubtedly business investment, which contributes so much to activity and employment and hence to rising living standards. </PARA>
<PARA> Even last year's optimistic Budget forecast of strong growth in this area clearly under-estimated the upsurge then in prospect. </PARA>
<PARA> During 1980-81, private business fixed investment grew by more than 20 per cent in real terms-the largest such growth for 30 years. </PARA>
<PARA> There could be no clearer proof of the extent to which confidence in the economic future of this country has returned. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the mining sector made a hefty contribution towards this investment growth, strong increases were recorded in manufacturing and other sectors. </PARA>
<PARA> Private dwelling investment continued to grow firmly, with a real increase of about 11 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> There was also a strong lift in personal consumption expenditure of about 3 1/4 per cent in real terms. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the year to June 1981, Australia's inflation rate as measured by the Consumer Price Index was 8.8 per cent-almost 2 per cent below the rate a year earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> This outcome-again better than had been forecast in last year's Budget-was aided by a lower rate of increase in import prices flowing in part from the strong appreciation of the Australian dollar. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the margin narrowed, Australia's inflation rate remained below the average of OECD countries. </PARA>
<PARA> Business profits grew strongly last year but their further growth, so vital to continued investment and employment, is now being threatened by rising wage pressures. </PARA>
<PARA> Overall, gross domestic product increased by almost 3 per cent in 1980-81, with growth of 4 per cent in the non-farm sector being offset by the fall in farm product associated with the drought. </PARA>
<PARA> The sharp rise in non-farm activity was reflected in a strong rise in total employment, which increased by 2.6 per cent. This was enough to reduce overall unemployment to its lowest level for four years, well beyond our original expectations. </PARA>
<PARA> This brief summary of the Australian economy over the past year presents a picture of considerable success and progress. </PARA>
<PARA> It contrasts sharply with the general experience of other OECD countries where, in aggregate, there has been higher inflation and unemployment and slower growth. </PARA>
<PARA> I would, however, be less than frank if I did not also point to some areas of concern to the Government and to certain challenges which, if not effectively tackled by this Budget and policies more generally, could undermine the progress and success to which I have referred. </PARA>
<PARA> If a response to those challenges is put off to another day, they will be infinitely harder to resolve, the process of resolution more painful and the damage to our economic recovery all the greater. </PARA>
<PARA> In my Budget Speech a year ago, I spoke of the threat then posed by excessive wage demands and industrial disputes. </PARA>
<PARA> Regrettably, the past year-and particularly the past few months-has seen the pressure for higher wages intensify. If unchecked, this will not only lead to higher inflation but reverse the falling trend in unemployment and put at risk both investment and employment growth. </PARA>
<PARA> It would be grossly unfair if excessive wage demands from those in employment were now to damage the prospects for further job creation just when we have begun to see real gains being made in reducing unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important that the abandonment of the wage indexation principles not be seen as having left a vacuum in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent days Commonwealth and State Governments, as well as the ACTU and National Employers, have all pointed to the continued existence of workable conciliation and arbitration processes-which in some respects are more flexible than the indexation arrangements-to settle wage claims. It is essential that all parties co-operate to make these processes work effectively. </PARA>
<PARA> Such an outcome would help to moderate excessive wage claims. </PARA>
<PARA>INTEREST RATES</PARA>
<PARA> No Government likes to see interest rates go up. This Government is acutely conscious of the effects of rising interest rates on all borrowers, especially home-buyers. We therefore regret the necessity for the further increases announced last week. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important for all of us to understand why interest rates have increased and what needs to be done to reverse this trend. </PARA>
<PARA> Interest rates have risen because the total demand for money in the community has exceeded its availability. </PARA>
<PARA> In such circumstances interest rate rises are unavoidable unless the Government were prepared to print as much money as was demanded. This it will not do because of the inflationary consequences. </PARA>
<PARA> It follows that if interest rates are to be brought down the growth in the total demand for money must be reduced. </PARA>
<PARA> This demand comes from a number of sources, including businesses and prospective home-buyers. </PARA>
<PARA> There are also demands from governments at all levels to finance their current activities and to refinance earlier deficits. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent years government borrowing demands have been reduced, due entirely to reductions in the Commonwealth Budget deficit. However, with strong private sector demand, this fall has not been sufficient to prevent a significant increase in the total demand for funds. </PARA>
<PARA> As a consequence, there has been upward pressure on interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> If this pressure is to be eased in a way that does not damage private sector activity or add to inflation-outcomes that would reduce job opportunities and retard economic growth-it is imperative that the borrowing demands of all levels of government be further reduced. </PARA>
<PARA> The need for such action led to the Loan Council decisions in June to cut by about 4 per cent in real terms the total Commonwealth and State semi-government borrowing programs. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, however, this Budget must make a further and substantial contribution towards reducing government borrowing demands if the upward pressure on interest rates is to be eased and indeed reversed. I can think of no cause more important to Australian families at present. </PARA>
<PARA> We have therefore decided that this year we must go as far as possible towards eliminating the Commonwealth's Budget deficit. </PARA>
<PARA>THE BUDGET OUTCOME FOR 1980-81</PARA>
<PARA> Last year's Budget generated the first domestic surplus since 1973-74; in the outcome, both it and the overall deficit were about $400 million better than had been expected. </PARA>
<PARA> Outlays were within 1 per cent of the Budget estimate. Receipts, however, were 2 per cent-$683 million-greater than estimated, mainly reflecting larger than expected income tax collections from both individuals and companies. </PARA>
<PARA> Receipts from the crude oil levy were $35 million less than estimated, with the effects of industrial disputes on production from Bass Strait more than offsetting the higher import parity price from 1 January 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> For two years in a row now, large reductions in the Commonwealth Budget deficit-$1444 million in 1979-80 and $906 million in 1980-81-have been accompanied by strong growth in private sector economic activity. </PARA>
<PARA>THE BUDGET STRATEGY</PARA>
<PARA> In putting together this year's Budget the Government had to ensure that it would meet a possible resurgence of inflation head on. </PARA>
<PARA> A less firm Budget, while easier to prepare, would carry wof inflation, thereby undermining the prospects for sustained economic growth in the years ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> In particular, the uncertainty and loss of international competitiveness that would result from a new inflationary spiral would deter the production and investment essential to the creation of additional jobs and higher real incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> We have therefore opted for a Budget which gives priority to containing and reducing inflation and sustaining private sector growth. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a Budget which reduces the overall deficit by almost $1000 million. </PARA>
<PARA> This decisive move towards overall balance symbolises the Government's determination to play safe with the gains we have already made. </PARA>
<PARA>OUTLAYS</PARA>
<PARA> Total outlays are estimated to increase by 12.6 per cent in 1981-82, to $40 862 million. This represents an estimated increase in real terms of a little under 2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The growth in outlays in 1981-82 is affected by an additional payday for public servants and most social security benefit recipients. Adjusted for this special factor, outlays would increase by about 11 1/2 per cent in nominal terms or less than 1 per cent in real terms. </PARA>
<PARA> Within total outlays, particular priority has been given to defence, pensions and other cash benefits and foreign aid. </PARA>
<PARA> In total, provisions for these purposes are estimated to rise by 15.8 per cent in 1981-82; the increase for all other purposes is 10.4 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to some paricular expenditure provisions; additional details are contained in the accompanying Budget documents, notably Statement No. 3. Relevant Ministers will be releasing further information as appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA>DEFENCE</PARA>
<PARA> The Government continues to give high priority to the strengthening of our national security. </PARA>
<PARA> The Defence provision of $4112 million represents an increase of 16.3 per cent in current prices or 5.3 per cent in real terms. </PARA>
<PARA> This increase reflects the continuing implementation of the planned improvements in Australia's defence capability announced by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence in February 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> The proportion of defence outlays to be spent on capital equipment is a little lower than had been planned because of contractual and other delays which have affected spending in this area, notably on the tactical fighter program. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Defence will advise the Parliament of further details later in the year. </PARA>
<PARA>SOCIAL WELFARE</PARA>
<PARA> Total expenditure on social security and welfare is estimated at $11 357m, an increase of 14.5 per cent. After allowing for the additional pension payday in 1981-82, the increase is about 12 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> This Budget provides for some new initiatives in areas of particular need whilst also demonstrating our continuing commitment in the family area. </PARA>
<PARA>Family Allowances</PARA>
<PARA> Prior to the last election the Government stated that any significant increase in oil revenue in 1980-81 over the Budget estimate would be returned to Australian families. In the event, receipts from this source last year were actually below the Budget estimate, as I have already indicated. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, we have reviewed the levels of family allowances and decided to increase the rates of assistance for third and subsequent children by 50 per cent, with effect from 1 January 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> This means that the rates for the third and fourth child will be increased from $26 a month to $39 a month. For the fifth and each subsequent child, the rate will increase from $30.35 to $45.55 a month. A family with 5 children will therefore gain by $41.20 a month. </PARA>
<PARA> The rate for children in institutions will be increased from $21.70 a month to $39 a month. </PARA>
<PARA> In total, some 540 000 families will benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> These changes are estimated to cost $62m 1981-82 and $124m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA>Indexation of Pensions and Benefits</PARA>
<PARA> Basic pension and benefit rates will continue to be adjusted in line with movements in the Consumer Price Index. In November the standard or single rate of social service pension, for example, will rise by $3.05 to $69.70 a week, while the combined married rate will increase by $5.10 to $116.20 a week. </PARA>
<PARA> These new rates will represent increases of $5.60 and $9.40 respectively since November 1980. </PARA>
<PARA>Supplementary Rental Assistance</PARA>
<PARA> In recognition of the particular hardship suffered by many needy pensioners in rented accommodation, we have decided to increase and redirect the program of rental assistance to pensioners and long-term sickness beneficiaries so as to provide more support to those paying higher rents. </PARA>
<PARA> From the first pension payday in February 1982 the maximum rate of assistance will be increased by $3 to $8 a week. At the same time the rate of rent subsidy will be reduced from $1 for each $1 of rent paid, to 50 cents for each $1 of rent in excess of $10 a week. </PARA>
<PARA> The income test will be eased for single persons to provide a $1 for $2 rate of withdrawal in all cases. </PARA>
<PARA> New public housing tenants will not be eligible for such assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> Present rates and conditions for assistance will continue to apply for those current recipients who would otherwise be made worse off by these new arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> The changes are estimated to cost an additional $20m in 1981-82 and about $50m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA>Unemployment Benefits</PARA>
<PARA> The non-indexed rate of unemployment benefits for persons 18 years and over without dependants will be increased from $53.45 a week to $58.10 a week in November 1981. </PARA>
<PARA>Assistance for the Handicapped</PARA>
<PARA> This Government has provided substantial support for the mentally and physically handicapped since it came to office. The total provision of $1134m for handicapped people in 1981-82 represents an increase of $666m or 140 per cent over the comparable provision in 1975-76. </PARA>
<PARA> New measures provided in this the International Year of the Disabled Persons are:</PARA>
<PARA> $1.5m as part of a $5m three year program to improve access and facilities in Commonwealth buildings for disabled persons;</PARA>
<PARA> $690 000 to establish work preparation centres in Perth, Adelaide and Brisbane for mildly retarded young people;</PARA>
<PARA> an increase from $5 to $8 a week in the incentive allowance payable to all sheltered employment allowees; and</PARA>
<PARA> almost $1.4m to assist in the production of braille and audio books, the improvement of radio and TV services for the handicapped, and the provision of sport and recreation facilities for the disabled. </PARA>
<PARA>Aged Persons' Accommodation and Crisis Accommodation</PARA>
<PARA> Other welfare measures in 1981-82 include a $12m increase in expenditure on aged persons' accommodation to $58m, and the provision of $2m to commence a crisis accommodation program for families in distress. </PARA>
<PARA>Assistance to Veterans</PARA>
<PARA> The Budget extends eligibility for repatriation benefits and service pensions and also provides for increases in a number of repatriation benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Veterans' Affairs will announce details but the main points are:</PARA>
<PARA> counselling centres for Vietnam veterans will be established in each State capital and Darwin;</PARA>
<PARA> Australian mariners who served in a theatre of war during the Second World War will become eligible for service pensions from February 1982;</PARA>
<PARA> for service pensioners, the amount of disability pension disregarded in the income test for pension and associated fringe benefits will be increased from 50 per cent to 60 per cent from January 1982; and</PARA>
<PARA> the maximum rate of repatriation funeral benefit will be increased from $300 to $400. </PARA>
<PARA> These measures are estimated to cost $6m in 1981-82 and $22m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA>Assistance for Aboriginals</PARA>
<PARA> In recognition of their special needs, this Budget provides $147m for Aboriginals, a 16 per cent increase on last year. </PARA>
<PARA> This includes $8m as the first instalment of the Government's election commitment to provide $50m over five years for Aboriginal environmental health improvements. </PARA>
<PARA> The Aboriginal Development Commission, which emphasises self-help for Aboriginals, will receive $47.8m in 1981-82, including a $9m addition to the Commission's accumulating capital investment fund. </PARA>
<PARA>HEALTH</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has already announced important changes to the funding of health services in 1981-82. </PARA>
<PARA> Total outlays for health services in 1981-82 are estimated at $2872m. </PARA>
<PARA> Additional payments totalling $1151m will also be made to the States and the Northern Territory as the health component of the financial assistance provided in the revised tax sharing arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> In all, these payments are $373m or 10.2 per cent higher than last year. </PARA>
<PARA>Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided to grant pharmaceutical manufacturers and wholesalers increases in PBS drug prices from 1 November 1981. The decision provides for an increase of 3.5 per cent on the price to chemists, plus 10 cents per benefit item. </PARA>
<PARA> These increases are estimated to cost $9m in 1981-82 and $18m in a full year.</PARA>
<PARA> The decision by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal to increase chemists' remuneration for dispensing prescriptions is estimated to add a further $33.4m, including retrospective payments of $10.9m, to the cost of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme in 1981-82. </PARA>
<PARA> Given these cost increases the Government has decided to increase the current patient contribution by 45 cents to $3.20 for each benefit item prescribed, effective from 1 December 1981. Those presently exempt from paying contributions will remain exempt. </PARA>
<PARA> This increase will offset the costs of the Scheme by $10m in 1981-82 and $20m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA> CULTURE AND RECREATION</PARA>
<PARA> A total of $461m has been provided for cultural and recreational activities in 1981-82. </PARA>
<PARA> The National Broadcasting and Television Service will receive $273m, an increase of $50m. The Australian Broadcasting Commission will receive almost $234mmission as host broadcaster for the 1982 Commonwealth Games and $16m to meet employer superannuation liabilities which fall on the ABC for the first time in 1981-82. An amount of $9.7m is also provided to improve and extend the National Broadcasting and Television Service network, including facilities used for Radio Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Other expenditures include:</PARA>
<PARA> $26m to the Special Broadcasting Service for ethnic radio services and for the first full year of operations of multicul $29m for the Australia Council, including a special allocation for the Commonwealth Games Arts Festival;</PARA>
<PARA> $25m for the National Gallery, which is planned to open in October 1982; and</PARA>
<PARA> $6.6m for the development of international standard sporting facilities in co-operation with the States and the Territories. </PARA>
<PARA>IMMIGRATION PROGRAMS</PARA>
<PARA> Although the Assisted Migration Program is being discontinued, provision is being made for an expected migrant intake of up to 120,000 in 1981-82, compared with 111,000 last year. </PARA>
<PARA> Funding for the programs established on the recommendations of the Galbally Committee is being maintained, pending the review during 1981-82 of programs reaching the end of the initial triennium. An amount of $31.3m is provided to maintain the Adult Migrant Education Program at its present level. </PARA>
<PARA>FOREIGN AID</PARA>
<PARA> The Budget provides for an increase of over $100m or 18 per cent in foreign aid expenditure. This is estimated to raise the ratio of official development assistance to GDP from 0.43 per cent in 1980-81 to 0.45 per cent in 1981-82. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs will be making a full statement on this program later in the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>EDUCATION</PARA>
<PARA> Details of funding for the Commonwealth Tertiary Education and Schools Commission programs have already been announced. </PARA>
<PARA> Total direct outlays on education are estimated to rise by 11.1 per cent in 1981-82 to $3255m. </PARA>
<PARA> This provision continues the priority given to technical and further education and to vocational programs. It also includes a further $35m under the Commonwealth's five year school to work transition program. </PARA>
<PARA> Within the schools sector, increased priority will be given to particular areas of need, with migrant and special education receiving an additional $11m and the country areas program an additional $1.2m. </PARA>
<PARA> The progressive implementation of the Government's 1980 election commitment to raise the subsidy levels applicable to non-government schools is estimated to cost almost $28m in 1981-82. </PARA>
<PARA>Student Assistance</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is taking steps to adjust certain student assistance programs.</PARA>
<PARA> The Secondary Allowances Scheme and the Adult Secondary Education Assistance Scheme will be made more accessible to refugees, migrants and other students whose special circumstances make it difficult for them to gain fully from these schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> The allowance under the Secondary Allowances Scheme will be increased by 10 per cent from the beginning of 1982 and the income test requirements governing eligibility for tertiary and secondary allowances will be eased. </PARA>
<PARA>EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING PROGRAMS</PARA>
<PARA> Expenditure on programs designed to expand the supply of skilled labour sought by industry and to assist young people in their search for employment is to be increased by 22 per cent to $203 million in 1981-82. </PARA>
<PARA> This total includes $65 million-$24 million more than last year-to assist young unemployed people to obtain prior work experience and practical job skills or otherwise prepare them for employment. </PARA>
<PARA> Some 100 000 apprentices, 5000 more than last year, will be assisted through the CRAFT and special apprentice training schemes in 1981-82 at a total cost of $76 million. </PARA>
<PARA> Expenditure on school to work transition allowances will rise by $8 million to $13 million. </PARA>
<PARA> A total of $20 million-an increase of 35 per cent-is being allocated for training in skills which are in short supply, including in the metal and electrical trades and in the construction industry. </PARA>
<PARA> In the light of the increases in these programs, the Government has decided to terminate the Community Youth Support Scheme on 31 October 1981. This will allow available funds to be concentrated on programs more attuned to labour market conditions. </PARA>
<PARA>ASSISTANCE TO INDUSTRY</PARA>
<PARA>Rural Assistance</PARA>
<PARA> Existing programs of budgetary assistance to rural industries are being maintained, at an estimated net cost of $226 million in 1981-82. This includes $19.2 million for rural research and $17.7 million for the Rural Adjustment Scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>Export Incentives</PARA>
<PARA> The Budget includes $281 million for export expansion and export market development grants in 1981-82, an increase of $21 million which will permit a substantial reduction in the carry-over of outstanding claims. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government recently announced that grant rates under the Export Expansion Grants Scheme will be reduced by 50 per cent from 1 July 1982 and that both this Scheme and the Export Market Development Grants Scheme will be extended by one year to June 1983 pending their review by the Industries Assistance Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>Research and Development</PARA>
<PARA> As part of its response to the recommendations of the Committee of Inquiry into Technological Change in Australia, the Government initiated a further five year research and development program from 1 July this year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Budget provides $50 million for industrial research and development grants, broadly the same amount as in 1980-81. </PARA>
<PARA>Energy Programs</PARA>
<PARA> Energy research is to be given further impetus with a provision of $14.9 million in 1981-82. Coupled with this will be an allocation of $1.6 million for energy conservation and energy information programs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Budget provides $2 million to the Bureau of Mineral Resources for a geophysical study of the Bass Basin region. This work will complement private sector activity in the search for new hydrocarbon reserves. </PARA>
<PARA>Other Assistance</PARA>
<PARA> The Government will provide $129 million in 1981-82 for the Petroleum Products Freight Subsidy Scheme, an increase of almost $9 million over last year. </PARA>
<PARA> Support will be provided for a further three year joint Commonwealth/Industry program for the development of the Interscan microwave landing system. </PARA>
<PARA> The Budget also provides $49.8 million for bounties for the textiles industry; these are being introduced as part of the revised assistance arrangements to apply to this industry from 1 January 1982. </PARA>
<PARA>NATIONAL WATER RESOURCES PROGRAM</PARA>
<PARA> A total of $35 million has been allocated for the National Water Resources Program in 1981-82, an increase of 20 per cent on last year's allocation. </PARA>
<PARA>TRANSPORT</PARA>
<PARA>Air Transport</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided to increase air navigation charges for domestic trunk airlines by 12.5 per cent, regional airlines by 25 per cent and the general aviation sector by 20 per cent. These increases are effective from 1 October 1981; overall, the level of cost recovery from these sectors is expected to decline slightly. </PARA>
<PARA> To reduce the level of over-recovery of costs from international airlines, charges for that sector are to be lowered by 5 per cent with effect from 1 October 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> These variations are expected to yield net additional recoveries of $3.5m in 1981-82 and $5.3m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA>Roads</PARA>
<PARA> The Budget provides $685m for roads grants to the States and the Northern Territory in 1981-82, $57m more than last year. These grants form part of the Commonwealth's undertaking to provide a total of $3,650m for roads over the five years to 1984-85. </PARA>
<PARA>Shipping</PARA>
<PARA> An amount of $32.7m is provided for the Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme; the Government is currently reviewing this Scheme to assess its performance in relation to its intended objectives. </PARA>
<PARA>Rail</PARA>
<PARA> The Budget includes $3m as part of a $10m program for the planning of the proposed Alice Springs to Darwin standard gauge railway. </PARA>
<PARA>HOUSING</PARA>
<PARA> Total expenditure on housing programs is estimated to increase by 17 per cent, to $399m. </PARA>
<PARA>Welfare Housing</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth has undertaken to provide the States and the Northern Territory with a base amount of $200m a year for welfare housing for each of the next five years. </PARA>
<PARA> This year we are allocating $262m for welfare housing, including the transfer of $12m from the States Grants for Aboriginal Housing program. </PARA>
<PARA> Of this total, $116m, including the whole of $62m above the base amount, is in the form of non-repayable grants while $146m is allocated as repayable loans at the highly concessional interest rate of 4.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>Homes Savings Grants</PARA>
<PARA> Following last year's initiative to increase substantially the maximum value limit for homes savings grants and to provide a family bonus, expenditure on this scheme is estimated to increase by over $29m to $74m in 1981-82. </PARA>
<PARA>PAYMENTS TO THE STATES, NORTHERN TERRITORY AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT</PARA>
<PARA> The major decisions affecting payments to the States have already been announced. </PARA>
<PARA> Total net payments to the States, the Northern Territory and local government, including all specific purpose payments, are estimated to increase by $1,059m of 8 per cent in 1981-82. </PARA>
<PARA>STAFF CEILINGS</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is continuing to maintain firm restraint over its own administrative costs. </PARA>
<PARA> Provisional staff ceilings provide for a reduction of about 9000, or almost 3 per cent, in staff under ceilings control during the course of 1981-82. </PARA>
<PARA> This is in line with the Government's decision to reduce, abolish or transfer certain Commonwealth functions and to aim for an additional 2 per cent cut in staff covered by ceilings over two years. </PARA>
<PARA>CIVIL WORKS</PARA>
<PARA> Public works expenditures also are being firmly restrained and the 1981-82 provision of $262m represents an increase of just over 5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> This provision will allow a limited number of high priority new projects to commence, including further upgrading of airport facilities for the operation of wide-bodied domestic jet aircraft, upgrading of Adelaide Airport for international services and rebuilding and upgrading of Australia's Antarctic bases. </PARA>
<PARA>COMMONWEALTH ENTERPRISES</PARA>
<PARA>Australian Postal and Telcommunications Commissions</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided to increase the interest rates payable on the capital advances by the Commonwealth which were taken over by the Postal and Telecommunications Commissions on their inception in 1975. The average rates of interest on such advances will be increased from about 5.2 per cent and 6.9 per cent, respectively, to 10 per cent with effect from 1 January 1982. The resultant increase in revenue is estimated to be about $60m in 1981-82, and $210m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the terms of the outstanding advances will be consolidated with a view to being progressively converted, over a ten-year cycle commencing in 1982-83, at the semi-government rate of interest prevailing on 1 January preceding the year of conversion. </PARA>
<PARA> These measures will put the operations of Australia Post and Telecom on a more commercial footing. </PARA>
<PARA>Australian Shipping Commission</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Shipping Commission has advised that it will make early repayment of interest bearing Budget advances totalling $30m in 1981-82 as a result of refinancing arrangements to be made on commercial considerations. </PARA>
<PARA>RECEIPTS</PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the revenue proposals and estimates, details of which are presented in Statement No. 4. </PARA>
<PARA> In line with our election undertaking, a half indexation adjustment was made to the personal income tax scale and dependant rebates with effect from 1 July 1981. That measure is estimated to cost $495m in 1981-82 and $525m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, legislation has already been passed to introduce a tax rebate for basic health insurance contributions. This measure, which will be reflected in tax refund cheques next year, is estimated to cost $600m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA> This Budget also allows for a number of other recently announced taxation measures. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the new revenue proposals which I shall announce tonight will help to broaden the tax base and this, combined with measures in other areas, will enhance the potential for further personal income tax relief in future years. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to measures to contain expenditures and broaden the tax base, the Government is continuing its efforts to stamp out tax avoidance. I mention in particular the replacement of the old section 260 by the broader general anti-avoidance provisions, which have attracted wide support within the community. </PARA>
<PARA> I have also announced the Government's intention to tighten section 136, which is directed at tax avoidance in international business transactions. </PARA>
<PARA>Sales Tax</PARA>
<PARA> For reasons that were announced at the time, the Government decided earlier this year against a major restructuring of the tax system towards greater reliance on broadly based indirect taxes. That decision did not rule out later consideration of smaller adjustments within the present system. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear that there is advantage in some change in the mix of direct and indirect taxes to increase the potential for desirable reductions in direct taxes, and particularly personal income tax, as economic and budgetary conditions permit. </PARA>
<PARA> To this end the Government has decided to increase by 2 1/2 per cent each of the existing rates of sales tax, effective in relation to goods passing the taxing point after tonight. The necessary legislation will be introduced this evening. </PARA>
<PARA> This increase in rates is estimated to yield $314m in 1981-82 and $420m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation will also provide for the correction of a significant number of anomalies and inconsistencies in the sales tax law; the estimated net revenue gains are $107m in 1981-82 and $142m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the Government will be bringing in legislation as soon as practicable to tax, at a rate of 2 1/2 per cent, a range of goods that are now exempt-such as clothing, footwear, drapery, soft furnishings, manchester; building materials; books, magazines and newspapers; packaging and wrapping materials; hand tools; and certain other goods but not including medicines, food or wine. To the extent that the goods in question are covered by other over-riding exemptions applicable to particular industries or organisations (including governments), they will retain their exempt status. </PARA>
<PARA> This measure, which will have effect with respect to goods passing the taxing point on or after 1 January 1982, is estimated to raise $132m of additional revenue in 1981-82 and $330m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA> Further details will be given in the amending legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>Excises</PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the question of excises. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been no increases in the excises on refined petroleum products, beer or spirits or tobacco products for several years. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be no increases in these excises in this Budget. </PARA>
<PARA>Coal Export Duty</PARA>
<PARA> At present, the coal export duty applies to exports of coking coal, at rates of either $3.50 per tonne or $1 per tonne depending on the quality of the coal and certain other features of the mining operation. There is no duty on steaming coal. </PARA>
<PARA> The present rates are below those which applied when the Government came into office but it is no longer considered appropriate to phase out the duty, which was the intention some years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> Rather, developments in the world market for energy resources and the consequential strengthening of export demand for steaming coal indicate that there is no longer any reason to differentiate between coking coal and steaming coal in the application of the duty. </PARA>
<PARA> The $1 per tonne rate will therefore be extended to exports after 8 p.m. tonight of black coal not at present subject to duty. </PARA>
<PARA>Deductions for Capital Expenditure of Mining Businesses</PARA>
<PARA> Very generous income tax deductions are allowed for capital expenditure incurred in the development of a mining property or an oil or natural gas field. In 1976, when the mining industry was in the doldrums, deductions calculated by reference to a maximum statutory life of a mine or field of 5 years were introduced; this was increased to 6 years in the Review of Commonwealth Functions announced in April 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> With the resources investment boom now proceeding apace, there is no longer justification for the continuation of this specially favourable tax regime for this sector of the economy. Accordingly, it has been decided to increase the maximum statutory life to 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be no gain to revenue from this measure in 1981-82. The first full-year yield is estimated to be $85m. The yield will be less than that in 1982-83, but is expected to build up gradually to $250m or more by about the mid-1980s. </PARA>
<PARA>Depreciation Allowances on Plant used to produce Basic Iron and Steel</PARA>
<PARA> In the light of the far reaching importance of the iron and steel industry in the Australian economy, the Government has decided to allow accelerated write-off for income tax purposes of capital expenditure on plant and equipment used exclusively to produce basic iron and steel. </PARA>
<PARA> Eligible plant ordered under a contract entered into after today will be depreciable at a special rate of 20 per cent per annum where the current scheduled life for taxation purposes is 5 years or more, and at 33 1/3 per cent where it is less than 5 years. </PARA>
<PARA> These new provisions will apply until 1991. Full details will be provided with the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>Industry Assistance-IAC Reference</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided to ask the Industries Assistance Commission to report on certain budgetary forms of assistance currently provided to industry and on possible changes or redirections which would be more cost-effective. </PARA>
<PARA> At present, industry benefits from a wide range of measures-from direct grants and subsidies to taxation measures-which have significant budgetary implications. </PARA>
<PARA> Consistent with its overall policy of fiscal restraint, and its desire to encourage the development of more efficient and internationally competitive industries, the Government wishes to ensure the maximum cost-effectiveness of these measures. </PARA>
<PARA> Details of the reference will be announced shortly. </PARA>
<PARA>Stamp Duties in the Australian Capital Territory</PARA>
<PARA> At present, stamp duties in the Australian Capital Territory apply to a narrower range of instruments and transactions than those in the States. Moreover, most of the rates applying in the Territory have not been altered since they were introduced in 1969 and are generally lower than those in the States. Accordingly, we have decided to bring the range and levels of Australian Capital Territory stamp duties more into line with those of the States. </PARA>
<PARA> The changes are estimated to yield $5m in 1981-82 and $6m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA>Departure Tax and Passport Fees</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided to increase the rate of departure tax from $10 to $20 and to lower the taxable age from 18 years to 12 years. These changes will take effect from 1 October 1981 and are estimated to yield $15m in 1981-82 and $20m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA> Fees for passports are to rise by $5 to $30 with effect from tomorrow. </PARA>
<PARA>Commercial Radio and Television Station Licence Fees</PARA>
<PARA> A new structure for fees payable by commercial radio and television station licensees is to be introduced. This will raise revenue from this source to an estimated $31.5m in 1981-82. The Minister for Communications will announce the details. </PARA>
<PARA>Zone Allowances</PARA>
<PARA> The Public Inquiry into Income Tax Zone Allowances, announced in the 1980-81 Budget Speech, has now reported and I shall be tabling the report tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> In the main report, the Inquiry suggested that additional assistance be directed to taxpayers with families and to those living in especially isolated areas, and that certain other changes be made to the system. </PARA>
<PARA> The recommendations of the main report have largely been accepted by the Government; the changes are to take effect from 1 November 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> The full-year revenue cost is estimated at $10m. </PARA>
<PARA>Friendly Society Dispensaries</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided to change the basis on which dispensaries conducted by friendly societies are subject to tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Beginning with income derived in the 1982-83 income year, dispensaries will be taxed like other non-profit companies, at normal company rates on a net profits basis, inclusive of investment income but exclusive of profits arising from transactions with members. The revenue consequences of the change will be small. </PARA>
<PARA>The Small Investor</PARA>
<PARA> The Government attaches great importance to the part played in our economy by small investors; in this connection, we have been examining the present income tax treatment of persons with modest shareholdings. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System is, however, expected to report soon in some depth on this matter, and we have therefore decided to defer any decisions until we have studied relevant sections of the Committee's Report. </PARA>
<PARA>BUDGET OVERVIEW</PARA>
<PARA> Total outlays in 1981-82 are estimated to increase by 12.6 per cent to $40,862m. </PARA>
<PARA> Total receipts, after allowance for the measures I have just outlined, are estimated to increase by 15.8 per cent to $40,716m. </PARA>
<PARA> The overall Budget deficit is therefore estimated at $146m, a reduction of $981m on the outcome for 1980-81. On present estimates the deficit expressed as a proportion of GDP will be a mere 0.1 per cent in 1981-82, compared with a peak of 4.9 per cent in 1975-76. </PARA>
<PARA> After allowance for transactions abroad, there will be an estimated Budget domestic surplus of $1,542m. </PARA>
<PARA>ECONOMIC OUTLOOK</PARA>
<PARA> As the figures I have just quoted show, this Budget represents a decisive response, in the area of fiscal policy, to mounting wage and cost pressures. </PARA>
<PARA> By restraining the growth in total outlays the Budget will curb public sector demands on real resources at a time when those resources are being keenly sought by expanding businesses in the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> It will also significantly reduce the total public sector requirement for loanable funds in 1981-82 at a time when the corporate sector is likely to be seeking substantially larger borrowings to help finance its investment program. </PARA>
<PARA> This will help to ease the pressures which, otherwise, that increase in private borrowings would produce. </PARA>
<PARA> For a variety of reasons monetary conditions last year were more accommodating than had been intended; one illustration of this is that M3 increased by 12.7 per cent during the course of 1980-81 compared with the Budget projection of about 9 to 11 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> While there are many unpredictable influences on the money supply-including external developments in particular-it is fundamental to winding back inflation that growth in the monetary aggregates also be wound back. </PARA>
<PARA> In particular, we are determined not to allow the money supply to expand so as to accommodate a new round of excessive wage increases. </PARA>
<PARA> In these circumstances, it is clearly desirable that the rate of growth of the money supply be reduced. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will therefore be seeking to restrain growth in the monetary aggregates to a degree consistent with growth in M3 of 10 to 11 per cent over the course of 1981-82. The sharply reduced Commonwealth Budget deficit will facilitate this task but an appropriate balance of other domestic and external policies will also be required. </PARA>
<PARA> The increases in tap stock yields announced after last week's Loan Council meeting, taken together with this Budget, will make a major contribution towards reducing pressures on interest rates, settling capital markets and restraining monetary growth. </PARA>
<PARA> As in recent years, arrangements will be made for the forthcoming wheat harvest to be financed in a manner consistent with monetary objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> This tightening of fiscal and monetary policies is designed to prevent an acceleration in the underlying rate of inflation in 1981-82. Avoiding that acceleration is essential to restoring the conditions for a downward movement in 1982-83 and later years. </PARA>
<PARA> It is to be hoped that current developments in the wages area will lead to more flexible and more orderly wage determination processes which pay proper regard to the economy's capacity to bear wage increases. I have already referred to the responsibilities on all parties in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> Given developments to date, however, it appears that average weekly earnings in 1981-82 could rise by about 13 1/2 per cent. This would be much the same as in 1980-81, when the rise in earnings was enlarged by the flow through of the so-called 'work-value' round of wage increases which began in 1978. </PARA>
<PARA> On that basis, the forecast rise in the Consumer Price Index in 1981-82 as a whole is about 10 3/4 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Leaving aside the effects of the revenue measures mentioned in the Budget and the previously announced changes in health care arrangements, the rise would be a little under 9 1/2 per cent-an underlying rate of inflation much the same as that recorded in 1980-81. </PARA>
<PARA> The tighter policy framework which is now essential for containing inflationary pressures does of course carry some implications in the short-term for activity and employment. Nevertheless, the non-farm sector of the economy should continue to grow strongly in 1981-82. </PARA>
<PARA> Business fixed investment, in particular, seems certain to grow rapidly again this year. The rate of that expansion-especially in the building and construction sector-will depend importantly on the availability of materials and skilled labour, including the extent to which supplies of both can be augmented from overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> Given continued strong growth in real household incomes, personal consumption expenditure could rise a little faster in 1981-82-perhaps by around 3 1/2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Private dwelling investment, however, is likely to decline somewhat in 1981-82 after rapid increases in each of the past two years. This will in part reflect a reduction in investment and speculative activity. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government continues to attach a high priority to maintaining a steady flow of private housing finance. The availability of such finance will be affected, of course, by the relative competitiveness of interest rates offered and hence the rates charged by housing finance institutions. As this Budget demonstrates, the Government has made major efforts to reduce public sector pressures on capital markets in the interests of limiting the competitive pressures on housing finance and interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> On present indications gross non-farm product could grow by between 3 and 3 1/2 per cent this year-below the 4 per cent rate estimated for 1980-81, but higher than the average rate of about 2 1/2 per cent in the second half of the 1970s. </PARA>
<PARA> With farm production expected to recover in 1981-82, gross domestic product could rise by more than 3 1/2 per cent this year, compared with about 3 per cent last year. </PARA>
<PARA> This outlook is considered to be consistent with employment growth of about 2 per cent in 1981-82. This would be below the increases of about 2 1/2 per cent recorded in each of the past two years but would still represent strong growth in employment, particularly by standards in other industrialised economies today. </PARA>
<PARA> A further strong increase in imports is likely in 1981-82 but any recovery in the level of exports will be limited by the continued sluggishness in world trade-a fact which underlines the paramount need for Australia not to throw away the international competitiveness so hard won over recent years. </PARA>
<PARA> Taken together with the prospect for invisibles, this means that the current account deficit may widen further in 1981-82 to around 4 1/2 per cent of GDP. </PARA>
<PARA> Though the outlook for the balance of payments is as always subject to many uncertainties, it seems reasonable to expect this current account deficit to be covered by private capital inflow-provided that, as we are determined they shall be, wage demands and inflation are successfully contained. In those circumstances a surplus on private sector foreign exchange transactions of a similar order of magnitude to the $2800m recorded last year could occur. </PARA>
<PARA>CONCLUSION</PARA>
<PARA> It is vital to the nation's interests that there be no acceleration in the rate of inflation in 1981-82. </PARA>
<PARA> Such an outcome would have most adverse consequences for confidence-both here and abroad-in Australia's future and for the competitiveness of our industries. </PARA>
<PARA> This is especially so given that most of the major industrialised countries, led by the United States, are now bent on firm anti-inflation policies. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has been doing better than many of these countries in containing inflationary pressures in recent years. Our aim is to keep it that way. </PARA>
<PARA> This Budget is an essential part of the Government's strategy for containing wage and price inflation. It will also help in a major way to ease pressures on interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> The Budget is being supported-and will continue to be supported-by equally decisive action in monetary and other policy areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Such action is necessary if we are not only to preserve the hard won gains of the past but also if we are to exploit the potential for even greater gains in the years ahead from the large investments now under way, particularly in resource projects. </PARA>
<PARA> The Budget will also help to maintain further solid growth in private sector activity and to provide more jobs for Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Budget to Honourable Members. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill is the first of three Bills needed to give effect to the proposal announced in the Budget Speech by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) earlier tonight to increase the rates of stamp duty and similar tax payable in respect of certain instruments and transactions connected with the Australian Capital Territory, including the Jervis Bay territory. </PARA>
<PARA> By way of background, I mention that stamp duty was introduced in 1969 on a range of instruments and transactions in the Australian Capital Territory. At that time, the rates of duty were set at levels comparable with rates imposed by the States on similar instruments and transactions. </PARA>
<PARA> In the intervening years the rates of duty applying to the majority of instruments and transactions dutiable in the Territory have fallen significantly behind those imposed by the States. The Government believes that there is no justification for maintaining this advantage for residents of the Australian Capital Territory over residents of the various States. For this reason, and taking into account also the marked growth of Canberra both as a city and as a centre of business, the Government has decided to take steps that ensure that residents of the Territory bear stamp duties comparable with those levied on residents of the States. This Bill and the Bills that follow give effect to this decision. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer now to the various instruments that are to be subject to an increased rate of duty. Cheques drawn or made on a banker at a branch of the banker in the Territory, and other bills of exchange or promissory notes drawn or paid in the Territory, are the first category. The present rate of stamp duty on this category of instrument is 5c. The rate proposed by this Bill is 10c per instrument. The new rate will apply in respect of cheques drawn on or after 19 August 1981 and to any other bill of exchange or promissory note that has not been duly stamped by reason of having been drawn or paid before 19 August 1981. Transitional arrangements included in the Bill will, however, enable bank customers to continue to draw cheques on forms supplied to them before 19 August 1981 without incurring the higher duty. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also proposed that conveyances of freehold land in the Territory and agreements for the granting, transfer or assignment of leases of land in the Territory executed on or after 19 August 1981 will be subject to increased rates of duty. The increase will not apply in respect of conveyancing transactions for which an agreement for transfer had been executed by the parties before 19 August 1981. For a transfer of freehold land, the present rate of duty is at the flat rate of $1 for each $100, or part thereof, of the value of the interest transferred. This basis of duty also applies in respect of a transfer of a crown lease granted for more than five years. For other transfers of leases, including Crown leases granted for periods of five years or less, the existing rate of duty is the same as I have just mentioned, but it is imposed on the value of the consideration given by the transferee. </PARA>
<PARA> The remaining dutiable transaction dealt with by the Bill is the grant of a lease other than by the Commonwealth. On the granting of such a lease, duty is presently payable at the general rate I have mentioned but is applied to the value of the consideration given by the lessee otherwise than by way of rent. For consideration given in the form of rent, duty is imposed at the rate of 30c for each $100, or part thereof, on the total rent payable for the specified period for which the lease is granted. </PARA>
<PARA> It is proposed that the general rate of stamp duty in respect of all of these classes of instruments be increased, as follows: For every $100, or part thereof, of the freehold value or lease premium the rate is to be $1.25 for amounts up to $14,000; $1.50 between $14,001 and $30,000; $1.75 between $30,001 and $50,000; $2 between $50,001 and $100,000; $2.25 between $100,001 and $250,000; and $2.50 for amounts in excess of $250,000. It is also proposed that the duty payable in respect of the rental component of a lease be increased from 30c to 35c per $100 or part thereof. </PARA>
<PARA> A memorandum containing more detailed explanations of the technical aspects of this Bill and the other two Bills to which I have referred is being circulated to honourable members. I mention that legislation to introduce a Territory stamp duty on new and transferred vehicle registrations and on life insurance policies will be brought before Parliament later in the sittings. I commend the present Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act to alter the sales tax classification of certain goods. I referred to this Act when speaking a moment ago about rates of sales tax and indicated that the exemptions and classifications Act not only classifies particular goods as exempt from sales tax but also places other goods in one or other of the tax rate categories. The present Bill is primarily concerned with the alteration of those sales tax classifications. In all, there are some 36 substantial changes. In a sales tax system that has exemptions and a number of rate categories it is inevitable that at the border line between one category and another there will be anomalies, real or apparent. </PARA>
<PARA> There has in fact been no general review of the sales tax classification of goods for many years and a review that has been carried out has brought to the Government's attention a number of anomalies and inconsistencies which we think should be remedied. In carrying out the review we have given attention to representations that have been made to the Government by honourable members and other interested people. The sales tax system operates according to a number of principles. In our review, we have endeavoured to work within these. We have been concerned to remove anomalies in classifications that give some goods a competitive advantage over other products and to achieve a greater measure of uniformity in classification. We have necessarily had to keep an eye on the revenue consequences of the possible solutions that have come up for consideration. We have found in our review that certain exemption provisions have not kept pace with technological changes. </PARA>
<PARA> Decisions of the courts and administrative experience have highlighted weaknesses in the law that allow exemptions beyond what waswhen the law was first framed, or that result in an unacceptable lack of clarity in the law. Some exemption items have become redundant due to changes in other laws, such as those relating to customs duties and laws covering the manufacture of motor vehicles. A number of amendments resulting from the review will bring into the taxable field goods which, for technical reasons only, have had to be accepted as exempt, although the exemption does not fit in with the general policy of the tax. Other amendments will, for consistency's sake, move goods into a higher tax bracket. However, it is not all a one way street and in some instances anomalies and inconsistencies are being removed by exempting goods that are at present taxable. </PARA>
<PARA> Speaking in more detail, one of the important changes relates to the treatment of containers for use in marketing soft drinks. At present, non-returnable bottles used in marketing taxable soft drinks are exempt from sales tax, while cans used for the same purpose are taxable. Manufacturers of cans have urged the Government to remedy this inconsistent treatment. We propose to correct it by removing the exemption for non-returnable bottles and containers used in marketing soft drinks. Returnable bottles will remain exempt. </PARA>
<PARA> Photographic materials and products are generally taxable at 27 1/2 per cent, or 30 per cent as they will be from tonight. However, the particular item, which was intended to cover all photographic materials, does not catch instant-type film packs which have become popular in recent times. These packs compete with conventional films and it is appropriate that they be taxed on the same basis. Similarly, photographic cameras and equipment have been taxable at 27 1/2 per cent, while projectors and other viewing equipment have been taxable at 15 per cent. Both will now attract tax at the new rate of 30 per cent. Projection equipment of the kind used for commercial purposes, such as in theatres, will remain taxable at the lower rate. Further alterations relate to the unusual position of cathode ray tubes for television sets and motor vehicle seat belts. </PARA>
<PARA> A general principle of the sales tax law is that goods are classified according to their commercial indentity, and not on the basis of the component parts of which they are comprised. Television receivers, of which the picture tubes form a major part, and motor vehicles, in which seat belts are fitted, are taxable as such. However, for reasons relevant at the time but no longer applicable, provisions were introduced into the law some years ago to exempt cathode ray tubes and motor vehicle seat belts from sales tax, even where they form an integral part of taxable goods. The reasons for this special treatment having disappeared, it is proposed to repeal the relevant exemption provisions. This will result in these goods being taxed according to the identity of the product of which they form part, or in their own right when sold separately. </PARA>
<PARA> Foodstuffs for human consumption, but not including confectionery, are exempt from tax. Due to deficiencies in the law, the exemptions relating to foodstuffs have in some instances not operated as intended. They were never intended to exempt manufactured pet food, but exemption for this has had to be conceded under the present law. It is proposed to restrict the foodstuffs exemption to goods for human consumption, with the result that manufactured pet food will again become taxable. Food for livestock will remain exempt under other provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> A similar problem has arisen with certain chocolate-coated confectionery. As a general rule, confectionery is taxable. However, some confectionery lines have gained exemption on the basis that they are biscuits which are exempt under the general foodstuffs exemption. These lines compete directly with others of the same basic type and are sold as confectionery. They are now to be taxed as such. </PARA>
<PARA> Some industry-related exemptions in the law which are couched in wide terms do not specifically exclude road vehicles and this has led to some industries being able to obtain vehicles free of tax, while vehicles for use in other industries remain taxable. A particular problem has occurred in connection with road vehicles used for bulk handling of grain. Relevant exemptions are to be amended to exclude road vehicles, so as to place industry use of vehicles on a more equitable footing and to prevent continuation of abuses that have occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> Consistent with the overall philosophy of the sales tax law in relation to motor vehicles, it is proposed to tax oil, greases and other lubricants used for motor vehicles. These goods are at present exempt whereas motor fuels are subject to excise. These comments outline the more important alterations to sales tax classifications that will result in increases in revenue. There are others, but I think what I have said sufficiently illustrates the kind of adjustments that are to be effected by the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The other alterations will result in the withdrawal of minor exemptions and the restriction of certain business exemptions to restore them to their original intention. I think that I need not go into all of them in this introductory speech. They are fully explained in the explanatory memorandum that is being circulated to honourable members. There is one further point, however, that I should mention. It is a feature of the sales tax law that aids to manufacture-goods used in manufacturing processes-are exempt from the tax. The Bill makes a number of amendments to the definition of aids to manufacture to clarify its meaning and to remove weaknesses. I indicated earlier that there are measures in the Bill that will reduce sales tax revenue and they are also covered in the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA> There are three I would like to make some comment about at this stage. The first relates to log forwarders for use in timber-getting. The expansion of logging of softwood forests has led to the development of specialised equipment called log forwarders to haul the felled logs from the felling point in the forest to road-side pick-up points. These vehicles perform the same function as tractors, which are exempt. It is proposed, in the interests of equity and consistency, to provide an exemption for log forwarders also. I am sure the timber industry will welcome the Government's decision, both because it recognises technological advances in the industry and because log forwarders give better protection to forests than less sophisticated equipment does. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also decided to exempt protective clothing of a kind used for sport or recreation, such as helmets, guards, gloves and mittens. Clothing in general, including sporting clothing such as football jumpers, cricket trousers and swimwear are already exempt. The protective headgear, pads, gloves and mittens are worn primarily to protect participants from injury and it is proposed to bring these goods into line with clothing in general. </PARA>
<PARA> Exemption is also being proposed for compressed natural gas. This is consistent with the Government's energy policy. Natural gas supplied through a reticulation system is already exempt. The net result of the changes will be an increase in revenue estimated at $142m in a full year and $107m in 1981-82.</PARA>
<PARA> It is customary for sales tax changes to come into operation on the day following the introduction of the amending Bill and the Bill therefore provides that the amendments are to be effective from tomorrow, 19 August 1981. Other sales tax changes that the Treasurer (Mr Howard) announced in his Budget Speech-those that involve tax of 2 1/2 per cent on a number of goods now exempt from sales tax-will be the subject of legislation to be brought in later in the sittings. That legislation will not come into operation until 1 January 1982. I commend this Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bills be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>These Bills will give effect to the proposal the Treasurer (Mr Howard) announced in the Budget Speech to increase the various rates of sales tax by 2 1/2 percentage points. The Bills will increase the respective rates from 2 1/2 per cent to 5 per cent, from 15 per cent to 17 1/2 and from 27 1/2 per cent to 30 per cent. The nine amending Bills are necessary because sales tax is imposed by nine separate Acts in order to meet the constitutional requirement that an Act imposing taxation shall deal with only one subject of taxation. Increased rates of tax are proposed for all goods other than those covered by the first Schedule to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act, and which are thereby made exempt from sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA> The second Schedule to that Act identifies the goods that are to be taxed at the top rate, now to be 30 per cent. Goods embraced by the second Schedule include radio and television receivers, record players, cameras, films and photographs, watches, jewellery, cosmetics, fountain pens, certain goods made of precious metals and furs. Goods in the third Schedule to the exemptions and classifications Act at present attract a rate of 2 1/2 per cent, which is now to be increased to 5 per cent. This covers household furniture, appliances such as refrigerators, washing machines and a range of household goods. Motor cars and commercial motor vehicles are in the fourth and fifth Schedules to the exemptions and classifications Act and they, together with goods not coming within the terms of any schedule to that Act, are at present taxed at 15 per cent. It is proposed that they be taxed in future at 17 1/2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Other goods also now to be taxed at 17 1/2 percent include boats, confectionery, stationery, computers, soft drinks, potable spirits and imported wines and beers. It is customary for changes in the rates of sales tax to take effect on the day following the introduction of amending Bills and these Bills, when enacted, will come into operation tomorrow, 19 August 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> The sales tax is basically a tax on sales at the wholesale level and, in the ordinary case of sales by a wholesaler to a retailer, the increased rates of tax will accordingly apply to sales made after today. As usual, an explanatory memorandum covering technical aspects of the Bills and providing, on this occasion, a detailed listing of the goods affected by these measures is being made available to honourable members. I commend the Bills to the House. </PARA>

<PARA>The Customs Tariff (Coal Export Duty) Proposals I have just tabled relate to proposed alterations to the Customs Tariff (Coal Export Duty) Act 1975. The Proposals implement the Government's decision foreshadowed by my colleague, the Treasurer (Mr Howard), in his Budget Speech earlier this evening by introducing a duty on exports of black coal, not at present subject to duty. </PARA>
<PARA> The effects of the Proposals are to impose a duty of $1 per tonne on coal that was previously exempt from export duty, that is, coal that: The Collector of Customs is satisfied the crucible swelling number of which is not greater than 3; or the Collector of Customs is satisfied, if subjected to proximate analysis, on an air dried basis, would be classified as coal having an ash content greater than 12 per cent. These changes will be effective in relation to all exports after 8 o'clock this evening. I commend the Proposals. </PARA>

<PARA>The main purposes for imposing a fee on companies licensed to earn income from broadcasting are to cover the cost of industry regulation, and to contribute to overall Commonwealth revenue requirements. The Government is, however, concerned that due notice is taken in this process of the ability of the industry to pay. It has, therefore, canvassed a number of alternatives for a new formula for calculating radio and television licence fees which would take into account the projected profitability of broadcasters in all areas. Changes contained in the Broadcasting Stations Licence Fees Amendment Bill and its counterpart, the Television Stations Licence Fees Amendment Bill, are designed to give a measure of relief to commercial licensees whose stations' gross earnings were less than about $2 1/2m in 1980-81. For some 120 of the 130 radio stations, licence fees would be reduced. For stations whose operating costs would be increased by these proposed changes, there would be some off-setting income tax effect. </PARA>
<PARA> The formula for calculating radio station licence fees proposed in this Bill removes the $200 lump sum component of the annual fee, and varies the percentage of a stations' gross earnings which is payable as the licence fee. For stations with low gross earnings, the percentage payable as the licence fee is reduced, and for other stations the percentage payable is increased. The Bill also proposes that the fee payable on the grant of a commercial radio licence would be increased from $200 to $500. The new measures in this Bill, and the Television Stations Licence Fees Amendment Bill, effective from 1 September 1981, are expected to yield the Commonwealth an extra $5m in revenue from licence fees in this financial year. I commend this Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill is a machinery Bill. It is designed to amend the Air Navigation (Charges) Act 1952 which prescribes the charges payable in respect of the use by aircraft of aerodromes, air route and airway facilities, meteorological services and search and rescue services maintained, operated or provided by the Commonwealth. The purpose of the Bill is to vary the rates of air navigation charges-ANCs-payable for aircraft operating in all sectors of the aviation industry. It is proposed that the variations should be effective from 1 October 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> The variations proposed in the rate of ANCs are to reduce the rates applicable to the international sector by 5 per cent; to increase the rates applicable to the domestic airline sector by 12 1/2 per cent; to increase the rates applicable to the regional airline sector by 25 per cent; and to increase the rates applicable to the general aviation sectors by 20 per cent. If these proposals are acceptable to the Parliament, it is estimated that revenue to be earned by the Commonwealth from ANCs in 1981-82 will, together with payments made in that year for 1980-81 operations, total $115.76m. This compares with the $95.89m received from ANCs in 1980-81. Further, the levels of increase proposed for the domestic airlines should have a minimal effect on air fares as they should increase airline costs by about one per cent for regional airlines and about 0.5 per cent for domestic trunk airlines. The impact on total costs faced by general aviation operators is also expected to be minimal. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members will be aware that since 1961 the Government has had a policy for the eventual full recovery of the costs properly attributable to the air transport industry from providing and maintaining the aviation infrastructure. Full recovery of attributable costs was first achieved in 1975-76 in respect of the international sector. While this sector has continued to be fully recovered, the rates of ANCs for international operations have not been varied since 1 December 1976. Further, in the 1980-81 Budget, the Government announced that over recovery in this area should be credited to the cost recovery program and applied to the development of the aviation infrastructure. The Government has decided that there should be a reduction of 5 per cent in the rate of ANCs for international operators effective from 1 October 1981. While there will be over recovery in this sector, the Government re-affirms its 1980-81 decision on the treatment to be afforded over recovery from this sector of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be noted also that the Australian charges for international operations compare more than favourably with those imposed overseas when the comparison is made on the same basis. Australia, unlike most overseas countries, imposes a composite fee which covers landing fees, parking fees, terminal air traffic control and en-route aids and services, et cetera. Overseas, these elements are often the subject of separate charges which can be raised by different authorities, and in some cases they may vary accordingly. Honourable members will recall that in the 1981 airlines agreement, the Commission and the company recognised that the Commonwealth is entitled to fully recover its infrastructure costs. Both airlines agreed to facilitate the implementation of measures designed to achieve this objective. Their agreement was subject to the proviso that, allowing for minor variations between the years, the Commonwealth did not seek to recover more than 100 per cent of its costs. Moreover, to achieve this objective, the agreement does not limit the level of ANCs which the Commonwealth may impose. The decision taken by Government to increase the rates of ANCs for the domestic trunk airline sector by 12 1/2 per cent is in accord with the agreement and should result in a recovery rate approaching 100 per cent in 1981-82. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year the Government decided that there would be no change in the level of air navigation charges for both the regional airline and general aviation sectors. These charges, however, were to be reviewed in the light of the study of the general aviation sector. As honourable members will know, the Government has not accepted the cost recovery recommendations of the general aviation study, although the rate of charges will continue to be reviewed annually. The Government has decided to increase the rate of air navigation charges by 25 per cent and 20 per cent for the regional airline and general aviation sectors respectively. These rates of increase should result in similar rates of recovery to those achieved in 1980-81 for those sectors. For the information of honourable members, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a paper setting out the cost recovery rates for the civil aviation industry by sectors and in total for the 10 years commencing 1970-71. </PARA>
