<TITLE>Tertiary Education</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in the Parliament Assembled. This Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. the proposal to introduce fees for higher and second degrees will mean that access to post-graduate and recurrent education will be limited to the rich; Australian research and ability to cope with technological change will suffer; this proposal must be seen as a step in the direction of the introduction of fees for all tertiary students.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. the proposed introduction of a loans scheme for students will mean graduating with a heavy debt or being denied a tertiary education if loans are refused because a student is seen as a 'poor risk' (particularly affecting women and those doing non-vocational courses); only the rich will be able to get a tertiary education without course restrictions and the burden of indebtedness.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. in regard to the proposal to restrict eligibility for TEAS and the foreshadowing of reviewing TEAS levels only in the light of the availability of loans, it should be noted that any further downgrading of TEAS, which is already inadequate can only further limit access to education.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. the proposed restriction of Adult Secondary Assistance to those needing qualifications for employment will severely restrict access to a full high school education and necessary bridging education to tertiary education for those who left school early.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. the proposal not to fund 30 Colleges of Advanced Education if they are not rationalised is an attack on teacher education.</PARA>
<PARA> This attack will create teacher shortages in the mid 1980s, restrict access to education now and endanger the future quality of teaching available to Australian children.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore pray that:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) post-secondary tuition fees not be introduced for any courses or for any category of students;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) that the TEAS scheme be extended so as to more fully meet the real financial needs of students.</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) that a comprehensive loans scheme not be introduced.</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) that there be no restriction of Adult Secondary Assistance.</PARA>
<PARA> (v) that the proposal not to fund 30 CAEs unless they are rationalized be rescinded.</PARA>

<PARA> That the decrease in Federal Government funding for health, transfer of Commonwealth responsibility to the States, application of the 'user' pay principle to health services and encouragement of private business and profits in the health sphere will inevitably lead to a downgrading of health services and increasing health risks among people who cannot afford health insurance or private payment of doctors and hospitals.</PARA>

The humble petition of the undersigned showeth that your petitioners are gravely concerned by the threats to women's health and lives posed by Toxic Shock Syndrome, and urge the following steps to be taken as a matter of urgency:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Tampons, sanitary napkins, vaginal deodorants and similar sanitary products to be re-classified under Therapeutic Agents (not under ''Cosmetics'' as at present), in order to bring them under the scrutiny of the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee. We believe manufacture must be under the strictest hygienic conditions.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) After re-classification, we urge an immediate government-funded inquiry into all aspects of manufacture and content of these products. This must lead to: (i) contents of product and instructions for correct usage to be shown on packaging; (ii) removal of synthetic fibres, chemicals or ingredients that are potentially or actually harmful to users.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Allocation of extra funding for ongoing research by the National Health and Medical Research Council into these products, results of this research to be made public to ensure all health workers and potential users are fully informed.

<PARA> That the projected repeal by the Queensland State Government of the Aborigines Act 1971-1979 and the Torres Strait Islander Act 1971-1979 will almost certainly lead to the degazettal of all Aboriginal reserves in Queensland, as has already been the case with Aurukun and Mornington Island.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Commonwealth Government has the power to legislate and acquire land for Aboriginal people under its constitutional powers since the amendments to the Constitution in 1967, but it is your petitioners' sincere belief that it failed to act in 1978 and thus, failed in its duty before the people of Aurukun and Mornington Island.</PARA>

<TITLE>Tertiary Education</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. This petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) The financial situation of students enrolled at Australian post-secondary institutions is already extremely difficult (as indicated in the Commonwealth Department of Education 1979 survey of student incomes and expenditures) and any substantial increase in the financial commitments of students would gravely worsen their difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The imposition of post-secondary tuition fees of comparable levels to those imposed prior to 1974 would force currently enrolled students to discontinue their studies and deter many persons willing and able at present to undertake post-secondary study from doing so.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Those students and potential students from social groups currently under-represented and disadvantaged in the post-secondary education system would be most severely affected by the reintroduction of post-secondary tuition fees.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore pray that:</PARA>

<TITLE>Privacy and Personal Information</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> Paragraphs 107 and 108 of the Privacy and Personal Information discussion paper number 14, brought down by the Law Reform Commission in June 1980, undermine the family unit and the authority of parents, which is the Christian basis of our society, by proposing that 'between 12 and 16 years, a child should be entitled to object to disclosure of information to a parent.'</PARA>
<PARA> It is your petitioners sincere belief that:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) an adolescent between the ages of 12 and 16 is not at a mature enough stage of life to decide whether or not the disclosure of information to a parent will be in the best interests of the adolescent.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) as a record keeper has no responsibility for the child, and as his moral standards may be different to those of a parent, he should not be permitted to come between child and parent.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) a parent has a unique position which may enable him/her to perceive a situation that the record keeper does not. The parent must therefore be aware of the problem if remedial action is to be taken, and has the right to guide the child in the direction he/she feels fit.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore pray:</PARA>

<TITLE>Excise on Wine</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The wine industry is accepted throughout the nation as occupying an important place in the social and economic activities of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. The wine industry of Australia has a need to sustain an appropriate level of production and sales to ensure profitability and to sustain and improve the level of employment with the wine producing industry.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. The wine industry of Australia has a need to sustain an appropriate level of production and sales to sustain and improve the economic viability of persons, partnerships or companies engaged in the occupation of wine grape production and the level of employment and standard of living of persons employed in the grapegrowing industry.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. An excise tax of 50 cents per gallon applied to wine in 1970 severely retarded sales of wine and converted a 10.7 per cent increase in sales in the previous year to a 0.3 per cent decrease.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. Any tax applied to wine would seriously retard the industry at a time when the economic viability of all sections of the industry is essential if the necessary reconstruction of vineyards and expansion of plantings of premium quality grape varieties is to continue and further enhance the quality image for which Australia is becoming increasingly recognised.</PARA>
<PARA> 6. The grapegrowing and brandy producing sections of the wine industry are presently suffering the effects of substantial increases in excise on brandy which effectively reduced sales of that commodity by more than 1,600,000 litres (approximately 180,000 dozen bottles) or 20 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> 7. It has been assessed by both the Australian wine industry and representatives of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics that the application of a 15 per cent sales tax on wine would retard sales of wine by 20 per cent, or the equivalent of approximately 50 million litres of wine annually which in turn represents approximately 80,000 tonnes of grapes of a market value of approximately $13,100,000.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that Honourable Members of the House of Representatives:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Recognise the importance and the place the Australian wine industry has in the social and economic life of the communities which constitute the wine producing industry in Australia and in the economic life of those persons employed in goods and service industries associated with the wine industry.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Recognise the importance of the wine industry as an attraction for tourists and the economic advantages gained from this source of income at district, State and Commonwealth level.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. Accept that the economic viability of the wine and grapegrowing industries is essential to the maintenance of employment opportunities in the period of reconstruction so necessary to the further development of the industry.</PARA>
<PARA> And further, that Honourable Members of the House of Representatives resist and reject any move to apply a sales tax or an excise on wine.</PARA>

<PARA> 6. Sales of beer constitute the major source of income of most of the industry.</PARA>

<TITLE>Plant Variety Rights</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. I, Dr Paul Robert Neuman, Leader and Lord of Knights of the Order of the White Cross International, a humanitarian knighthood for the defence and protection of life, jointly with officers and members of the Order and with citizens of the Commonwealth of Australia by this our humble petition respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That I, jointly with and on behalf of the undersigned petitioners voice our concern and objection about the proposed legislation of the so-called Plant Variety Rights Bill 1981 and that I claim, according to the nature and principles of my organisation, to have a mandate to defend the silent Millions of Life-forms which are unable to defend themselves and are not represented otherwise to protect their fate and future and also the majority of people, who are not or very little informed about the consequences of this Bill and whose freedom and wellbeing is at stake, should the Bill become Law in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Since time immemorial, life has dominated Earth and has formed in the course of evolution a Web of Life, composed of animals and plants which are depending on each other and are adjusted to each other within their Eco-system. Man, as part of nature and being bound to the laws of nature, must suffer the consequences if this nature is brought out of balance. The new life-forms, this Bill will allow to enter Australia, are tailor-made creations of genetic-engineers, aliens and monsters to our eco-system, but fit to open an entirely new marketing opportunity for food and chemicals. Scientific achievement or not, the Gene-manipulators play a wicked Leggo-game for international finance and the chemical industry. I hold, that the natural species in Australia or elsewhere in the world have not even the slightest chance to compete with the invaders from man's laboratories, since the new creations are invested with the power of money, using man's abilities, man's Laws and man's chemicals to clear the way for gene-manipulated commercial Mono-cultures, designed and controlled by those who hold the Patent Rights over these plants.</PARA>
<PARA> It requires no imagination to realize that all power for dominance over people is contained by those who control the food. Indeed, control over all beings bound to eat. Over farmers and horticulturists as to what to grow, how to grow and with which kind of chemical to treat. It also means control over licenced breeders of the new varieties, who may be directed to refuse supply to certain growers as the patent owners feel fit. Beneficiary of the entire exercise is the chemical industry which is eagerly buying up already such patents, thus the toxic pollution level in the environment must rapidly rise as a result of such policy. In the final analysis, I am convinced, that people in fear of famine due to possible repercussions, will to a great extent surrender their freedom and dignity to the will of those, who are in control of food. It has been voiced in various circles of Science and Philosophy that the potential of genetic engineering and cloning can be more devastating than the Nuclear-Bomb and I believe, a unification of gene-manipulation, cloning, computer-technology and international finance together can form a power able to result in a sort of Domesday for the world as we know it. It may be the beginning of a ''Brave New World'' similar to that, described in Huxley's novel, but whether mankind can survive it's own creations or vanish together with nature, remains a question mark.</PARA>
<PARA> When the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives deal with this Bill, they may also consider the religious aspects of the matter. Australians, being so close to nature, have naturally a strong attachment to the Creator. It is not unlikely that spiritual divisions may be enhanced amongst people over this ethical atrocity, indeed, the scientific take-over of creation is in a sense a dethronement of God as a control over all beings. I am awaiting in anticipation the protest of the World-Leaders of Religion to come to the defence of the Divine Creation, since they do so very often on the subjects of procreation and abortion and I pray, the very same Leaders will not 'side with the powerful' as they usually do. After all the foundation of Judeo-Christian Faith is at stake.</PARA>
<PARA> I am sure, the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House do share the pride of all Australians over the unique beauty of this continent and the natural composition of it's diverse life forms. Surely no-one of sound mind would wish to see this marvel of the Pacific Region being harmed and finely transformed into gene-manipulated mono-cultures, and yet this very Plant Variety Rights Bill 1981 is the door-opener for such a future. We believe, the driving forces behind this Bill did get away with far too much already in Australia. I refer here to the chemical pollution and the concerted efforts of that industry to increase the sale of toxic chemicals to the agricultural community. Many housewives nowadays fear the method of high pressure salesmen: ''Foot in the door and no retreat.'' Australia is well advised to keep her doors tightly closed to the salesmen of new life-forms.</PARA>
<PARA> We cannot undo the scientific 'success' of cloning and gene-engineering, but the people of Australia can refuse to legalize their own dependence upon the mercy of Multi-National Corporations. Such corporations generally do not break the Law openly, but rather lobby for the introduction of new laws, tailored to fit their future intentions. The present Bill, we believe, is a typical example of this kind and will give full cover of the Law to any foreign body or person as outlined in Division 2 Section 12 of the Bill and Division 1 Section 10 states unmistakably that virtually every plant of commercial interest falls under the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA> The promotes of gene-engineering may praise Interferon as a Wonderdrug, capable of eliminating cancer. We hold that from the very same corner of the industry once DDT was praised to be the Wonderchemical, capable of eliminating the insect-pest, but yet the insects have not suffered real losses in the long run, while the environment of the planet is cursed with a dreadful chemical which causes constant harm to nature now and in times to come and we believe, since the increase of cancer incidents appear in correlation with the increase of chemicals, it may be wise to reduce these chemicals rather than adding more to it, including substances derived from gene-manipulated matter.</PARA>
<PARA> I conclude, jointly with the undersigned petitioners that:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) The Plant Variety Rights Bill 1981 bears destructive consequences for the environment of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Due to protective chemicals, required for this kind of plants, the toxic level in the environment must increase.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The independence of people and the free trade is endangered.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Peace of Faith is likely to be disrupted.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The beneficiaries of the Bill will primarily be Foreign Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA>Should this Bill become law.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that:</PARA>
<PARA> The Representatives of the Commonwealth of Australia reject the Plant Variety Rights Bill 1981 entirely and in all parts.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask a question of the Prime Minister. Has the Government decided on a huge increase in sales tax of more than $800m-an increase in fact of 39 per cent? Has the Government also decided to increase personal income tax collections by 22 per cent, which is the equivalent of $11 a week extra per taxpayer? Does the Prime Minister recall that the Government pledged in this House on 12 March that greater indirect taxation 'should be accompanied by a noticeable reduction in personal income tax'? Would he regard this as evidence of another solemn undertaking to the electorate being broken by the Fraser Government?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very conscious of what the Government said to the House on 12 March of this year when it explained in a statement the reasons why it was not going to move to a broadly based indirect tax. The decisions that were announced last night represent no more than a modest broadening of the taxation base in a very limited area. Any suggestion that one can liken what was announced last night to the type of change that was in contemplation earlier this year, which included amongst other things the introduction of a retail turnover tax and also, as an alternative, the introduction of a broadly-based indirect tax including not only the major expansion of the wholesale tax base but also the introduction of a tax on services, is without foundation. I think the true way to measure the increase in indirect taxes in this Budget is to compare the rate of increase in indirect tax in the prospective financial year 1981-82 with what occurred in 1980-81. If the Leader of the Opposition does that, he will find that the differences in increase between the two years are minor indeed.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FS7">Mr STREET</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. As the House will know, the Australian Government's policy is that all people should be able, by free act of self-determination, to decide for themselves the form of government they want. That policy applies to the French territories in the Pacific to which the honourable gentleman referred. The issue was raised at the recent meeting of the South Pacific Forum and discussed at length. Interestingly, after this discussion the Forum decided by consensus, without any opposition, that a delegation led by the Prime Minister of Fiji should go to France and convey to President Mitterrand the concern of the Forum members that progress should be made towards the independence of the French territories in the Pacific. I think this is a sound, common-sense approach to what is a very difficult and sensitive issue, because it has to be remembered that in the case of New Caledonia, anyway, the Melanesian population is not in the majority. Therefore, the handling of the independence issue has to be approached with great care. The timing of the visit of the delegation to President Mitterrand has been left at the discretion of its leader, the Prime Minister of Fiji. The Australian Government, through my colleague the Deputy Prime Minister, gave strong support to this initiative. I hope that it will lead to movement on the part of the new French Government towards what we all regard as a desirable objective-that is, independence for the French territories in the Pacific.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Is it a fact that the Camp David Accords have brought the first real peace between the two major military powers in the Middle East after a period of 30 years and four wars? To enable a step by step process involved in solving the problems of the Sinai, the West Bank, Gaza and the Palestinian people to proceed, did the Camp David Accords and the Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty propose a United Nations peacekeeping force without super-power involvement being stationed in the Sinai Peninsula to facilitate a final Israeli withdrawal from that region? Has that proposal the support of both the Australian Government and the Opposition? What barriers exist to the raising of a United Nations peacekeeping force? What action is this Government taking to remove those barriers?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FS7">Mr STREET</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true that the Camp David Accords and the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty have had a significant effect in reducing tensions in the Middle East. I understand that those Accords and that peace treaty had the unanimous support of all honourable members of this House, as the honourable gentleman suggested. It is a fact that peace now exists between Egypt and Israel, the two major antagonists in past Middle East conflicts, not that that has resolved all Middle East problems. The failure to solve the Palestinian issue and the present difficulties in Lebanon illustrate that only too clearly. It is true that, in an annex to the peace treaty, reference was made to the composition of a United Nations force, excluding the involvement of any permanent member of the Security Council. It was against the possibility that the United Nations may not be able to fulfil its role that the United States of America undertook, at the time of the signing of the peace treaty, to ensure the establishment and maintenance of an acceptable multinational force. Of course, it is this force that the Egyptian, Israeli and United States governments are presently endeavouring to form.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In my statement to the Parliament in May I expressed regret that for various reasons, including the prospect of a veto by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the President of the Security Council was unable to agree to United Nations involvement in the implementation of the peacekeeping arrangements in the Sinai. Accordingly, for the immediate future anyway, United Nations involvement is not an option.</PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members should be aware that, at a meeting with the Secretary-General of the United Nations in New York in July, I raised again the question of a United Nations force to be responsible for peacekeeping arrangements in the Sinai. Dr Waldheim confirmed the earlier advice that I had had from the President of the Security Council and he stated categorically that United Nations involvement was not an option unless and until the Soviet Union indicated that it would not use its veto against United Nations participation. In reply, I expressed to the Secretary-General the hope that the option of United Nations involvement at some future date could be kept open. I understand that the parties to the multinational force agreement also want to keep that option open for the future.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The reports that the Brisbane Airport will be closed for short periods as from 10 September are correct. The actual periods of closure are yet to be determined. We are discussing with the airlines the period that is least likely to cause disruption to the travelling public. The partial closure of the Brisbane Airport is due to a very severe shortage of air traffic controllers in Australia. We are short of 110 air traffic controllers. We are training air traffic controllers to our maximum capacity. We have in hand plans to transfer some air traffic controllers to Brisbane in the near future, but that will not have any real effect on the situation until some time next year. We are also recruiting air traffic controllers overseas. We have had some success in our recruiting campaign in the United Kingdom and also in Hong Kong. We are, of course, looking to other areas to see whether it is possible to recruit a few more.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Quite clearly, there is a shortage of air traffic controllers and there has been a shortage for some time. There is a very high wastage rate among them because of the intensity of the work that they perform. It is not easy to recruit people who have the qualifications or the stamina necessary to carry out the task. We are most concerned about the problem and we are taking every measure possible to ensure minimum disruption to services to Queensland. We are taking every measure possible to recruit and to train additional air traffic controllers to overcome this immediate problem. I might add that I have also asked my Department to make sure in whatever arrangements it makes that there will be no closure of the facilities at Brisbane over the Christmas holiday period.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister for Health to an advertisement which has appeared over recent days concerning FAI Healthcare Insurance and featuring the Honourable Harry Jago who is identified as a former State Minister for Health. The advertisement says in part:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> And remember, you may be entitled to additional tax deductions at 32 cents in the $1 on your total medical and hospital costs.</PARA>
<PARA>I ask the Minister whether that statement concerning possible tax benefits is correct. I also ask whether the statement attributed to Mr Harry Jago that 'FAI Healthcare Insurance gives you the best possible health cover available' is correct. Does FAI Healthcare Insurance come within the ambit of the National Health Act? If it does not, will the success of this insurance scheme in creaming off the low health-risk people and taking them away from the insurance schemes offered by the registered health funds increase the health costs of those people who are insured with registered health funds?</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="397" SPEAKER="MacKellar The Hon M.J.R." NAMEID="014" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="WARRINGAH" MINISTERIAL="HEALTH" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="014">Mr MacKELLAR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, my attention was drawn to the advertisement in a very broad sense. I have not read the fine detail contained in it. I have not seen the words quoted. The rebate of 32c in the dollar for basic health insurance is available only to those people who take out health insurance with a registered health insurance organisation. The FAI is not a registered health insurance organisation. So people taking out insurance with companies such as FAI will not be eligible for the tax rebate, as suggested in the honourable gentleman's question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have no comment to make about Mr Jago's participation. Nor do I have any comment to make about his alleged statement that FAI offers the best cover. I do not agree with that, but it demonstrates that the Government has in place a health scheme which offers to individuals within the community a range of choices which enables them to pick the form of health insurance which they believe is most suitable for their circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the last part of the honourable gentleman's question, I think that people who take out insurance with commercial organisations should look very carefully at the fine print in relation to the cover offered. All in all, I am not aware of any evidence that commercial insurers are taking a high proportion of individuals away from the registered health insurance organisations. Therefore, the community rating principle is very largely in place, as the Government intends. Finally, I advocate that all members of the general public look very carefully at the alternatives that are offered in health insurance. I advise them to think very carefully before they decide not to insure with a registered health insurance organisation.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GH4">Mr HUNT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The truth of the matter is, of course, that Mr Willis agreed to it. Mr Wran agreed five years ago to co-operate with the Commonwealth in setting up a major airport needs study committee involving both Commonwealth and State officials. But in December 1979 the New South Wales Government decided to withdraw its officials, leaving the Commonwealth officials to make a report. The Commonwealth has agreed to the recommendation for a close-spaced parallel runway to meet the immediate needs of those people wishing to use Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. They happen to represent 60 per cent of the travelling public in this country. It has been Australia's No. 1 international and domestic airport, but it will rapidly decline from that position day by day as a result of this inactivity on the part of the New South Wales Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is not the slightest doubt that there will be restrictions on the traffic using Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. I have made it clear to my Department that I will not stand by and see regional aviation, general aviation or commuter services singled out for those restrictions. If there are to be restrictions at Kingsford-Smith Airport they will apply to international, domestic, regional, commuter and general aviation alike. Let no one bask in any complacency that the restrictions are going to hurt just one section of the community. They will apply right across the board. Mr Wran can carry the blame for that with him throughout the forthcoming election campaign.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I address my question to the Treasurer. Is it the case that the Budget strategy presupposes a level of private capital inflow this year of $7 billion or more, which is an even greater amount than the record and extraordinary $6.5 billion inflow of last year? In view of the fact that the surplus of this private capital inflow over the deficit on the balance of payments current account adds to the money supply and this year, as last year, is expected to account for some 45 per cent of money supply growth, did the Government, in drawing up its Budget strategy, give any consideration to reducing the rate of growth of the money supply by controlling private capital inflow rather than increasing taxes on the Australian people? If that course was considered, why was it not adopted?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="399" SPEAKER="Howard The Hon J.W." NAMEID="ZD4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="BENNELONG" MINISTERIAL="TREASURER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true that the Budget is based upon an assumption that the rate of private capital inflow will be between $6,000m and $7,000m and will make a contribution to private sector foreign exchange transactions of about the same level as occurred last year. The honourable gentleman's question, like other questions from the Opposition on the subject of private capital inflow, assumes that one can turn the tap of foreign investment in this country on and off without damage to the long term level and pattern of that investment. It is necessary, if the development of this country is to proceed, for us to have foreign capital. There are simply inadequate reserves of domestic savings to support the sort of investment that is going on in Australia at present. When the honourable member for Gellibrand and the Leader of the Opposition talk about controls and blockages on private capital inflow, they are advocating a slower rate of growth, because there is an insufficient volume of domestic savings in this country to support the current levels of investment. If the Opposition argues for less investment in Australia at present, it is arguing for lower living standards, higher unemployment and less growth.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Treasurer a question supplementary to the question which has just been asked of him by the honourable member for Gellibrand. The Treasurer will recall in his answer confirming that the Government is anticipating an even larger foreign capital inflow this year than last year; it will be in excess of $6,000m and possibly as high as $7,000m. Does he recognise that the implication is that the Government must also anticipate an appreciation in the Australian dollar during this fiscal year at least as large as the 10 per cent general appreciation that took place last year and in particular cases rising much higher, as high as 38 per cent against West Germany? Does he recognise that the effect of appreciations, especially such significant appreciations, is to disadvantage the traditional farm and manufacturing export industries and manufacturing import replacement industries? Finally, does he recognise that an appreciation of this level, on top of the appreciations which have already taken place in the preceding 12 months, would effectively wipe out protection for the majority of Australian manufacturing industry?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="400" SPEAKER="Howard The Hon J.W." NAMEID="ZD4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="BENNELONG" MINISTERIAL="TREASURER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will pick up the last part of the honourable gentleman's question and correct him immediately. The highest levels of protection for a large part of Australian manufacturing industry are in respect of those industries that enjoy quotas. Exchange rate appreciation, far from reducing protection for those industries, in fact increases it to a massive degree. The really high levels of protection in Australia are in respect of the industries that are subject to quotas. I refer, of course, to the textile, clothing and footwear industries, the motor vehicle industry and a number of other industries. Any suggestion in those circumstances that exchange rate appreciation lessens the protection to those industries is diametrically opposite to what precisely happens. It is true that the private capital inflow is likely to be of about the same order as last year; but, of course, the current account deficit is projected to be somewhat larger and, as a consequence, the net monetary effect of that private capital inflow is likely to be about the same. I will not make forward speculations about how the Australian dollar will move. Its value compared with other currencies, including the American dollar and the Deutsche mark, is affected not only by what happens to our currencies and to the Australian economy but also obviously by what happens in domestic conditions in both of those economies. I can only repeat what I have said to the honourable gentleman on many occasions: Anti-inflationary objectives will remain dominant in the determination of our exchange rate policies.</PARA></TALK.START>

The capital program for Telecom has been very large over recent years. It will be very large. Even so, in some areas there are still delays in providing services.

It has been designed to provide Australian industry with the capacity to move technologically with the world industry. I believe it has produced very significant dividends to the industry to this point, but at the same time I recognise that inherent in what the honourable gentleman is saying is that some companies have been disadvantaged by virtue of the additional overseas sourcing which has been provided both to automotive manufacturers and to some specialist component manufacturers.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me relate to the House some of the events that occurred over that weekend and during that period. There had been discussions before the weekend involving the Deputy Prime Minister, myself, the Minister for Industrial Relations and, I think, one or two others and the Australian Council of Trade Unions because of a serious situation which was developing in relation to not only the Transport Workers Union but also certain matters which looked as though they could involve a total national stoppage on the Australian waterfront. For that reason-I have paid due regard to this-the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions approached me and said: 'Will the Government participate in talks in an effort to see what can be done to resolve some of these difficulties?' As a result of that, a statement was issued by the Government and the ACTU. Sir John Moore also was present at those discussions on the Friday, I think it was. It was basically a sensible statement but one which also recognised that the rigidity of the indexation guidelines was making some trade unions feel that they were not able to have their cases heard and argued before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. A form of words which had the support of the ACTU and the Government and which might have relieved some of that pressure was placed in that statement.</PARA></TALK.START>

States of emergency, we need to remember, had been declared in more than one State, and Premiers were in touch with me concerning the severity of the dispute-whether it was likely to become a full national stoppage or what might be done to relieve the matter. The Minister for Communications also was involved because he had been having discussions over the same weekend with the Minister for Industrial Relations on disputes in relation to Telecom Australia. Therefore he was involved with me and the Minister for Industrial Relations in the discussions that took place over that weekend and on the Monday. Part of the problem was to get the Transport Workers Union to accept arbitration. There was a belief that it ought to. There was a prospect at the time that its problem might be resolved through an anomalies conference, even though I think Deputy President Isaac had indicated that the Commission could not make a judgment of the kind that the union had wanted.</PARA>
<PARA> In the process of persuading the Transport Workers Union to accept arbitration, Mr Wran was in Melbourne because of a certain Australian Labor Party meeting of which some honourable gentlemen here would be aware. I think he undertook through the New South Wales Trades and Labour Council to see what influence could be exerted on the TWU. Either the Minister for Communications or the Minister for Industrial Relations rang around other States again to try to establish the circumstance where some influence could be brought to bear on the Transport Workers Union to accept arbitration. In the process of that, through my colleague the Minister for Administrative Services, an approach was initially made to Mr Lowe. After that I discussed the matter with Mr Lowe. He indicated a wish to help because Tasmania was being--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it probably will be. I thank the honourable gentleman for reminding me of the time. Tasmania had been very severely hurt by the Transport Workers Union dispute, in many cases more severely hurt than other States. I have to say that, up to the point at which my colleague the Minister for Administrative Services had approached the Premier, it appeared that the State was not doing a great deal to assist itself. I should also say that in my conversation I pointed out to Mr Lowe that other Premiers were doing a good deal to protect the interests of their States. He said in that conversation that obviously he wanted to do what he could to protect Tasmania. The action seemed to be in Melbourne and I offered to make transport available to him to come to Melbourne, again with the objective of getting the Transport Workers Union before arbitration. I think that is a quiet and accurate description of events.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to make one other point only, and that is that nobody who was involved in these matters and nobody in any of the discussions that the Government has had with the Australian Council of Trade Unions over recent months has sought to make any political capital out of the attempts that people from different spheres have been making to solve difficult problems and problems which concern many Australians. I think senior officers of the ACTU, and the Government certainly, recognise that the level of industrial disputation is not really in anyone's interests. It is certainly in the interests of all Australia to overcome that effort as much as humanly possible and to establish a better industrial environment. I think it is a great pity that that particular article ever appeared in the Hobart Mercury, because it was not in accord with the spirit of what had been taking place over the weekend. Since the Opposition does not want any further questions I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Next to unemployment, housing is the most serious social problem in this country. This Government has deliberately sacrificed both private and public housing for foreign control of unplanned and unco-ordinated resource development in this country. I want to deal with some of the social problems arising out of this Government's economic policy. Last weekend the Sydney Morning Herald reported the plight of a young couple living in Sydney's outer western suburb of Penrith. The family was forced to put its home up for sale because it could no longer afford its mortgage repayments. According to a real estate agent in the area, about 100 homes are for sale in the Penrith area, but rising interest rates and restrictions on the availability of housing finance meant that few people could afford to buy those homes. As a result, while the total repayment debt for existing home buyers went up by around $20,000 in the past 18 months for a home loan of $30,000, the selling prices had moved down on houses and land in this area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Not very long ago a young couple could buy a modest home on the periphery of the Sydney metropolitan area, delay having children, both go to work, save and scrape and forgo other needs in order to get their foot on the bottom of the home ownership ladder. They would borrow to the limit of their means and trust that they could get themselves to a position where they could improve their living standards with the security of having their own roof over their heads. Alternatively, they would consider selling their first home and use the capital gain to buy another home better suited to their needs. But this young couple in Penrith had that avenue closed to them. They faced the prospect of little, if any, capital gain and possibly a loss. They faced insecurity and the prospect of increasing hardship resulting from a continual erosion of their household disposable income. So they decided to put the home up for sale. They intended to buy a caravan. For them, buying their first home was a move that put them on the path of downward mobility. Yet these people were lucky enough in the first place to get access to home ownership. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many who are even worse off. The Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr McVeigh) admits that he has no idea of the number of homeless people in Australia. He can neither confirm not deny the estimates of the welfare groups that there are about 150,000 homeless people throughout this country-young, unemployed, elderly, deserted people-people who have been dispossessed as a result of the callous policies of this Government. The Minister can neither confirm nor deny that there are about 250,000 people across Australia excluding Aboriginal people who suffer an outrageous neglect of their housing needs, who are living in mobile, temporary or makeshift accommodation. The Minister cannot tell this Parliament how many people spend their nights in the back seats of cars, in parks or in alleys. He cannot tell us the extent of overcrowding in sub-standard, overpriced rental accommodation. The Minister does not know these details. The Government does not really care and it cannot possibly develop appropriate housing policies when it cannot understand the housing problems. It is prepared to sacrifice the housing sector to make room for corporate investment and foreign speculation. </PARA>
<PARA> In July this year, before the last round of interest rate rises, the Sunday Telegraph reported a survey conducted by the social workers in the western suburbs of Sydney. This report linked the stress of loan repayments with child abuse, drug-taking, mental illness and abortion. The survey revealed a trail of broken marriages and shattered dreams for hundreds of married couples. The men were working full time with as much overtime as they could get. In many cases they even had a second job. The women were going out to work, often at night. The survey found that despite both partners working they were incapable of keeping up with rising costs-whether in the form of higher loan repayments for those paying off their homes or the widening deposit gap for those seeking to buy their first home. The survey also found that this pattern of scraping for funds put pressure on the marriage and on the family, particularly the children. I have quoted from two newspaper reports and I commend the sensitivity of the journalists involved. Why do we not have government publications detailing such facts so that government can make a decision arising from these findings? The Government seems unwilling seriously to examine the impact of its policies on people. </PARA>
<PARA> The rate of interest is only one aspect of the effect of rising housing costs on household disposable income. But that effect is made more acute in a context of employment insecurity, partial wage indexation, casualisation of work, cutbacks in social services, rising petrol prices, increased health care costs, rises in charges for public services and increasing indirect taxes. The combined impact of these Government policies hits people, particularly little people, hard. This is part of the policies of this callous Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Since February 1980 the home loan interest rate from savings banks has increased from 9.5 per cent to 12.5 per cent. For the average mortgage of $30,000 this has meant an increase in repayments over the last 18 months of $65 a month. Over the same period, average earnings of wage and salary earners have increased by only $30.50 a month. Real household disposable income has been eroded by this Government's redistributive measures. Around 80 per cent of income recipients in Australia get less than average weekly earnings. House and land prices have been increasing in most capital cities, especially in Sydney and Melbourne, beyond the reach of the average income household. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table setting out the quarterly average of monthly median prices for houses and home units in Sydney and Melbourne for the period June 1965 to December 1980. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. In the December quarter 1975 the median house price in Sydney was $33,500. Average earnings were $167 a week. At that time the value of a home was 200 weeks of average earnings. In the December quarter of 1980 the median price of a house was $78,700 and average earnings were $278. The value of the house was then 283 weeks of average earnings. Since that period the median price of a house has moved to around $84,000 and interest rates have gone up still further. In my view interest rates on housing have not peaked yet and they will rise still further. Several effects of these changes need to be understood.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The tables show that more people are not able to obtain finance to get access to home ownership. Almost four out of five income earners in this country are excluded from access to a $30,000 loan from a savings bank at an interest rate of 12 1/2 per cent. A $30,000 loan is not enough for most first home buyers faced with rising house prices, whatever State they live in. I stress that it does not matter where they live. A loan of $30,000 pins down a person. Over 80 per cent of people-four out of five-cannot afford to meet a $30,000 loan. A modest home in Penrith, which is at the bottom end of the market in Sydney, costs around $55,000. People on average single incomes have little chance of buying a home at that price with prevailing interest rates. Dual income families have to save for years to raise the necessary deposit gap. They have to cut back on other necessities. They have to forgo having children. They have to rely on the charity of relatives or they have to take out a crippling second mortgage at an interest rate of 15 per cent to 20 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These options threaten the stability of families. They impose immense long term hardships. The policies of this Government are not helping these people in need. They are forcing more and more people into the already overstretched private rental market. Private rents are likely to increase substantially as a result of the rental accommodation increase as the landlords put the prices up to meet their own interest repayment increases. At the same time, the Government has cut back dramatically on public sector housing. In 1974-75, 3.9 per cent of government expenditure was on public housing. This year it is one per cent of government expenditure. Public housing stock represents only 4.4 per cent of all housing stock in Australia. This Government has also made decisions which will further aggravate housing costs and undermine the building industry. Inflation in the housing market will follow from the imposition of a 2 1/2 per cent sales tax on building materials and furnishings. A 2 1/2 per cent increase in sales tax could add up to $1,000 to the price of establishing a home. This is in addition to the impact of increasing interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> Deeper economic problems are also associated with the housing policies of this Government. We have seen a dramatic rise in the amount of domestic funds taken up by foreign corporations in this country. Australian borrowing by foreign corporations rose from 1.4 per cent of total domestic savings in 1977-78 to 18.8 per cent in 1978-79. We have a huge increase in the raisings of funds by public authorities to provide infrastructure for resource development. We have seen a large and rapid increase in foreign capital inflow to speculate in land and housing, to speculate on interest rates and to speculate against the exchange rate. This Government is squeezing the rest of the domestic economy to make room for the structural shift of investment in resource development and the takeover of Australian business by foreign corporations. The ordinary people of Australia are paying the real price-immediately through reduced social services and increased interest rates and in the longer term by increased dependence, widening inequality and entrenched unemployment. We are moving to a society of landlords and tenants. The rate of home ownership under this Government has peaked and is now rapidly on the decline. </PARA>
<PARA> What we need is a comprehensive housing policy that attends to the needs of people-the immediate needs of people and the emerging needs associated with population growth, structural change and relocation of people. More and more control is needed over the rate of speculative capital inflow and over the pace and impact of investment in resource development. Effective programs need to be developed to help a wider range of people secure access to home ownership at affordable interest rates. Included in that should be a program to assist first home buyers and a program which will protect those people already living in homes and paying off their mortgages. We also need a planned and substantial upgrading of the public housing sector. We also need a program which will maintain liquidity at all times in the housing sector. Were a government prepared to give housing a major priority we could achieve those objectives. But this Government has decided to scrap the housing industry for the interests of the resource sector. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;By their actions we shall know them. I thought the shadow Minister for housing and construction, the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren), was in the wrong ring. I understood that this matter of public importance was about something fundamental to Australian society-home ownership. All the honourable member wanted to talk about was overseas capital coming into this country. Let us start, therefore, from the base, because he is not concerned about home ownership for Australian people; he wants only to mouth meaningless words and platitudes. A leader of the Labor Party once said: 'We do not believe in home ownership. That will make us a nation of capitalists'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A previous Labor Minister for housing-fortunately we have not had too many of them-when he talked, under insistent and constant questioning by the then Opposition, about housing costs and about the inability of people either to get a job in those disastrous years from 1972 to 1975 or to purchase a house, said: 'We will build them smaller houses'. Does not the honourable member for Reid know that in the closing stages of the Labor Party's far too long reign on the treasury bench it commissioned a report the emphasis of which was: 'We are going to put a tax on home ownership'? That is the policy of the Australian Labor Party. The honourable member for Reid did not want to talk about it because he does not like the truth. I am disappointed. I have a great deal of time for the honourable member for Reid, but today unfortunately, because he is under pressure, he could not defend the situation and he flirted with the truth. I am disappointed and I am concerned that that has happened. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, we have had a long commitment to home ownership and to support of the family because we believe the strength of this nation is based on the citadel of home ownership. We have the figures. The honourable member for Reid said that home ownership in Australia had peaked and was now rapidly declining. I do not know where he learned his mathematics, but the simple facts are that the present rate of home ownership in Australia is 71.9 per cent, marginally lower than the 72 per cent revealed by the last census. Yet the honourable member said that the rate was rapidly declining. Does he not know that there is a price to pay for home ownership? Why does he not talk to the migrants in Australia? If he talked to the Italian community and the Greek community he would find that 90 per cent of the Italian community and 84 per cent of the Greek community own their own homes. I utterly reject and throw back in his teeth his statement that home ownership in this country is rapidly declining. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government at present, as always under the free enterprise way of life, is pledged to home ownership. I want to talk about some of the things that have happened in recent times to expose this myth, this shadow concern, this sham interest in Australian home ownership. The honourable member cited figures. I want to cite the real figures. At the end of the Labor Party's reign 104,110 Australian families were on the waiting list for welfare housing, which represented a significant increase in three years. The people of Australia had been hung, drawn and quartered with regard to housing. They had realised that they could not have home ownership, that they could not get jobs because of record unemployment in this country during those three years and they had to be placed on the welfare housing list. </PARA>
<PARA> At present on account of fundamental policies of encouraging more people to own their little bit of Australia, the number on the welfare housing list has decreased to 85,391. Home ownership has always involved sacrifice. Mr Deputy Speaker, you know that; it is not easy. People have to have their priorities right. I want to take a little time to enlighten and to encourage so that the shadow Minister can observe. In December 1978 it took 27.2 per cent of average weekly earnings at that time to pay back the interest and redemption on a home loan of $30,000. But under this Government-a government under which real incomes last year increased by 4 per cent, inflation was held down to 8.8 per cent and the working opportunities of Australians in the last two years increased by some 320,000-we find that in December 1980, two years later, it took only 25 per cent of average weekly earnings to repay that loan. The honourable gentleman talked about a $30,000 loan for first home buyers. Does he not know that at least 60 per cent of first home buyers in Australia are dual income earners? Does he not know that 60 per cent of Australian first home buyers seek a loan of considerably less than $30,000? Does he not know those things? I am sorry that I have to take the time of the House to try to explain to him the situation as it exists. He talked about the increase in interest rates. In 18 months I saw this country getting ripped apart, the heart and the muscle torn out of it, because interest rates under the Labor Government increased by 3 per cent in its first 18 months. In almost six years of free enterprise government interest rates have increased by 2 per cent. Yet the honourable member had the temerity and the cheek--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At least the honourable member has a little honesty. But the truth hurts members opposite. We found in that short time that interest rates increased so as to deny the Australian people the opportunity of home ownership. The honourable member talked about increases in the cost of housing in Sydney. I say to the honourable gentleman that there is more to Australia than the city of Sydney. One of the reasons that housing is dear in Sydney is simply the inefficiencies and lack of concern of the Wran Government. The land component of a home in Sydney is sky high, by Australian and world standards. In the first two years of the Wran Government a block of land which initially cost $9,000 had increased to $20,000. One of the reasons we have extraordinary land prices in Sydney is that the New South Wales Government has the highest stamp duties in this country and has not made enough land available to allow people to build houses where they desire them to be built. We talk about high interest rates in Australia. The Treasurer (Mr Howard), in immaculate language, has repeated for all Australia to hear the simple statement that no government and no Minister like increases in interest rates. But I say to the honourable gentleman, who raved and ranted about capital inflow instead of worrying about roofs over the heads of the Australian people and families, that in England the interest rate is one per cent higher than it is here; in the United States of America it is 15.5 per cent; and in Canada the interest rate for home ownership is 21.5 per cent. Why does he try to isolate Australia's high interest rates from those in the rest of the world? I am not happy with the high interest rates, but they are a fact of life.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We talk about the person who has a loan. The fact is that in the last two years the average weekly income has gone up by $80 but interest and redemption payments have increased by only $15 a week. People have not been depositing money with lending institutions for on-lending into housing. The simple reason is that because of the incessant and growing demands of State Governments, a tremendous pressure has been placed on the market places. That is to be regretted, but if a person obtained a loan because he had a better job opportunity and his wages increased, he had the opportunity of paying back the loan. The honourable member talks about extensions to loans. Does not he know that the facts and figures indicate that the average loan in Australia is repaid within seven years, not 25 years or 30 years? That nails once and for all the vicious lies that he is trying to permeate through the Australian population. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take your advice, Mr Deputy Speaker. We found that many people were not being allowed access to the pool of finance. It is regrettable that most of the people who advance funds to on-lending institutions which provide money for housing are elderly people. Because they did not want to be isolated, it was necessary for them to put their funds into the highest interest earning areas. We hope that the changes that have been made in on-lending for housing will increase the pool of finance that is available so that there will be a balance. Sure, people will have difficulties with paying off their existing mortgages, but we wanted to allow more Australian people the opportunity of participating in home ownership.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to refer to the honourable member's comments about welfare housing. He seemed to take great pride in his statement that public ownership of housing in Australia was only of relatively minor importance. He has been quoted in the Press. I hope he writes as many letters to correct his statements as he wrote in peddling something that was far removed from the truth. For weeks he has been parading around Australia saying that the Fraser-Anthony Government was going to provide only $200m for welfare housing this year. It must have hurt him last night when he found out that we were providing a lot more money than that. He is not concerned. He is not interested. He is only looking for cheap political gain. I used to smile every time the honourable member for Reid said that we were going to provide only $200m for housing because I knew that the day would come when he would cut his own throat. He did not even need assistance from me. The simple fact is that last night the Treasurer said in this Parliament: 'The Commonwealth Government is making available to the States the sum of $262.2m.' I say to the honourable member for Reid that he should not forget to write to the Sydney Morning Herald tomorrow to tell the people that he either did not know the truth or deliberately misrepresented the position last week. </PARA>

We have also made available to the States-we have consistently given them huge sums of money at highly concessional interest rates-a sum of $160m a year. We have given them $262.2m, plus the $160m which is basically free money. Included in that $262.2m is the sum of $116.2m which is a straight out gift. Let us note the generosity of the Government in giving to the States this huge sum of money, not with the restrictions or conditions like those imposed by the fellows opposite when they were in government. Every time the States wanted to spend a dollar they had to put their hands up. They are now allowed to do whatever they want to do. They can put into effect all those glorious interest bearing subsidy schemes and rebates on rental schemes. They do not have to ask me for permission as they had to ask the Labor Minister under that Government's housing agreement. The balance of $146m is available. I think I would be looked upon as not stretching the truth very much when I say that an interest rate of 4.5 per cent is highly concessional. That is the interest rate charged on the money that we have given the States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> How pleasing it must have been for the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) and the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton) to have been in this Parliament last night and to hear the Treasurer say that we were to give rental rebates to people in receipt of social security payments in this country totalling about $120m a year. That shows real interest, real concern and real feeling for the poor and the unfortunate in society. These are the things that we are interested in. The people shall know us by our policies. </PARA>
<PARA> The main emphasis in the Budget was to create a climate of confidence, because confidence had been destroyed by irresponsible statements that were made around the country. Today we witnessed a repetition of scaremongering tactics, of trying to undermine people. An instance was cited of a person in Sydney being forced to sell his home. I wish just to recount what happened at the time of the last interest rate increases. Mr Barry Carlton, a representative of the permanent building societies, stated that because of the permanent building societies concern at people's inability or the difficulty that people might have in meeting increased repayments, a circular was sent out to building society clients-several hundred of them-requesting them to come in to discuss any problem that they might have with repayments. Contrary to the view that has been expressed by the honourable member for Reid, only two people saw fit to respond to the circular. That is the problem we face. Home ownership has always been difficult but the position is not improved by scaremongering tactics such as those we have witnessed from the honourable member for Reid who has been reported in the Sydney Morning Herald as citing a particular instance. I wish to direct my remarks also to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden)--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EE4">Mr UREN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I will be brief. My explanation concerns two points. The first point is that the Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr McVeigh) said that I and other members of the Australian Labor Party were against home ownership. I have specifically said time and time again in this House and in other places that I believe that wherever it is possible for people to own their own homes they should do so because that is their real major source of saving in their lifetime. I also said that I and other members on this side of the House will encourage home ownership.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other aspect is in regard to what I am supposed to have said about the matter of public sector housing and the fact that about $200m was to be provided. The Minister said that I said that the States would get only $200m this year. What I said in my letter and what I have been saying publicly was that if the Government made available what the Labor Government made available in 1974-75 in constant terms under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreements to Aboriginals and to the Northern Territory, it would have to provide $850m a year. The Government is to guarantee only $200m. The Minister has pointed out that the Government has increased that sum to $262m but I point out that there is still a shortfall of some $550m. It is about time the Minister put his money where his mouth is. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is rather sad that the Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr McVeigh) could continue to misquote not the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) or any former Leader of the Opposition, but John Dedman, one of the great post-war Ministers, on an interjection which the honourable member would never have read. I am referring to an interjection during the speech of a Liberal Party member who said that the Labor Party was not concerned at all about home ownership. Mr Dedman replied: 'Do you want to turn the nation into little capitalists?' The context of the speech of the time was to point out that the Australian Labor Party's commitment was then, as it is now, to home ownership and also to providing a decent public housing stock for a large section of the Australian population. That was the commitment then and it is the commitment now. I suggest that the Minister look at what Dedman actually said rather than continue peddling this myth about Labor Party policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A reference was made by the Minister-it is constantly made by the Government-to the commitment to home ownership and to these tremendous home ownership rates. Some 70 per cent of the Australian population do not own their own home; 70 per cent of the Australian population have never owned their own home. It is true that about 70 per cent of the Australian population either own or are in the process of buying a home; that is a very different matter. One of the reasons that this matter of public importance is being debated today is that we are concerned about the people who are purchasing their own home. The Minister talks about what may have happened in terms of interest rates between 1974 and 1975 but does not recognise that since 1978 the increase in interest rates under this Government has been 3 per cent. Over three years this Government has been in charge of policies which have resulted in rising interest rates. There has been a massive increase in house prices, particularly in the Melbourne and Sydney property markets. The Minister ought to get his facts right. If he wants to talk about home ownership, let us talk about the 28 per cent of Australians who have completely paid for a home and about the people who are purchasing homes and their problems under the context of this Government's policies. </PARA>
<PARA> I take as the quote of the day the words of the Minister at the beginning of his speech. He said: 'By their action you shall know them'. </PARA>
<PARA>It reminded me of what the Governor-General said late last year. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA> It is essential that it be understood that economics and people are linked, that economic policy must serve human objectives. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The only legitimate yardstick for assessing any policy is not conformity to an ideology-</PARA>
<PARA>It does not matter whether it be the ideology of home ownership or any other ideology-</PARA>
<PARA>but the effectiveness of that policy in enhancing the lives of people. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to cite the case of housing policy as being an example of where this Government had shown its concern for people. One can only say that that is complete rubbish. If one looks at this particular Government's policy, and one has to look, as the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren) did, not simply at housing policy but housing policy within the context of economic policy, one has to recognise that this Government has been a government along with many other conservative governments in the world that has been prepared to sacrifice social policy for short run economic policy. It is a government which has its interests dictated to it by international capital, by processes and interests which bear no relationship to the interests of the Australian people. One has to say that the Fraser Government is unique in the history of Australian governments in that it fails to see any relationship between the aspirations of ordinary Australians and the wellbeing of the corporate sector; one must be sacrificed for the other. This Government has been prepared to sacrifice ordinary Australians and their housing for the interests of the corporate sector. </PARA>
<PARA> As the honourable member for Reid has pointed out, the facts are crystal clear and undeniable. The total Commonwealth outlays on housing have moved from a peak of $702m in 1974-75 to a low, in real terms, in this Budget of $196m expressed in 1974-75 values. Outlays on housing at that time represented nearly 4 per cent of total outlays. This year's outlays for housing will represent one per cent. We are talking about the priorities of this Government and housing is not a priority for this Government. It may have priorities which may be worth while but it cannot say and this Minister cannot say with any honesty or any understanding that housing is any kind of priority for this Government. Indeed, the Minister's appointment is a reflection of the low priority which housing has for this Goverment. </PARA>
<PARA> Within that context one has to look particularly at the Government's role in relation to welfare housing or public housing. Of course, public housing is a serious problem whether the Minister recognises it or not. It is a serious problem because of the failure of the Government's economic policies as a whole. At a time in which we have had record unemployment and in which real incomes have, in fact, been declining and have not been maintaining pace with inflation we have substantially reduced expenditure and public housing. This Government claims that it is looking after the people who are very poor and the people who are in serious economic difficulties. Yet if one looks at its policies as a whole in the area of social expenditure, one sees that at a time when people are emerging with special needs, homelessness is increasing and housing waiting lists are going up the Government is, in fact, reducing spending on public housing. That certainly does not indicate a government of social concern or a government of compassion; it indicates a government with priorities in which housing simply does not fit. We cannot look at the aggregate level of government spending and expect that to tell us all there is to be said about housing policy. We need to talk about the monetarist stance of this Government which has resulted in increasingly high interest rates. The effect of the rise in interest rates is to make money for ordinary people very much dearer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One might say that it is against little capitalists. The reality is that with interest rates now climbing to 12.5 per cent people will have to pay additional money in terms of monthly repayments and the total amount for housing. Many people will not be able to get into the housing market at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister talks about relative changes. Let us look at that aspect historically. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation recently calculated that where it took only 18 months' pay at the time of World War I for the average family to pay off a home, it now takes four years of pay. The CSIRO-I do not think one would regard it as a body of any particular bias-points to the fact that in 1970 people have expected with 7 per cent interest rates might to pay $63,000 in total. People are now paying nearly $100,000 for a $25,000 to $30,000 loan. The Minister talks about so many months for a loan of $25,000 or $30,000. People are literally having to pay $100,000 for a $30,000 loan to buy a modest house that is probably not properly serviced, not near shops and does not have all the facilities it ought to have. One could go on. That is what is happening in terms of this Government's policy, and this Government prides itself in its commitment to home ownership and to looking after people who are trying to get into home ownership!</PARA>
<PARA> One has to combine that reality with the fact that people are now in a market situation in terms of housing where a $30,000 loan is not anywhere near enough, certainly in Melbourne and Sydney. Average prices for housing in Melbourne are now well over $50,000; for people wanting or needing to have housing in particular locations the price may be well above the average. Those are the Government's policies in terms of the implications for quite ordinary people in the community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, this Government gets no pleasure from people who are subjected to individual hardship. The honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren) put forward his case study of someone out in the Penrith area. We do not like to see things like that happening to people. We realise that from time to time people are subjected to individual hardship. We are concerned about that. What is revealed in today's debate is the Opposition's lack of understanding of the competing influences that determine realistic interest rates. No one can continually and artificially hold down rates at an unrealistic level. We realise that the dream of almost all Australians is to own their own home. This Government places that uppermost amongst those personal desires for all Australians to achieve. We want Australians to share in prosperity. In fact the main object of this Government is to allow prosperity to go through to individuals. If any decision that we make here does not benefit the individual in the long run, there is no purpose in making that decision. As the Minister has said, Australia today enjoys one of the highest percentages of home ownership in the world. Almost 72 per cent of families in this country enjoy that as a reality, a reality that many other countries would dearly love to achieve.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at the more recent trends and alterations to interest rates and why they have developed. In the recent argument on interest rates and in the propositions put forward by the Opposition in this debate, no one has explained why interest rates have risen. No one has pinpointed the reason why the rise in interest rates has occurred. There has existed an imbalance between the number of people wanting to borrow money and those willing to provide that money. The Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr McVeigh) mentioned in his speech the need to entice people to invest in funds that lend money to people who want to buy homes. Only a realistic interest rate tends to bring a better balance between people who want to lend money and those who want to borrow can achieve this result. Only an increase in interest rates will lead to this situation occurring. </PARA>
<PARA> Surely it is better to have a higher interest rate which results in more funds being available for lending than a situation in which interest rates are artificially held down to a level that does not attract any funds for lending purposes. It almost takes me back to my early childhood in World War II, when the shortages that prevailed created a black market. If interest rates are artificially held down and if funds are made available to a few people only I can see a situation developing in which someone will do something under the lap in order to get a person a loan. </PARA>
<PARA> In this argument, we analyse the community sectors which are competing for these funds, why they are competing and the advantages and disadvantages that flow from which sector gets the funds. I select as No. 1 the manufacturing, mining and agricultural sector that is competing for funds and must get funds. Let honourable members look at the result of investment in this group. As a result of such funding, employment opportunities are created and a continuing contribution to the Australian economy is made through the goods and services that are produced. The investment is made to ensure future production. Let honourable members look next at the money which goes to the home building industry. They will see that certainly employment is created while a house or dwelling is being constructed, but that there is no further advantage to Australia as a whole from that dwelling. Once the home is completed, it does not produce anything in the manufacturing, mining or agricultural industries. However, it does provide for and fulfil the personal needs of the individual. It is the reward for which those people have worked and the reason why they have wanted to earn money. That has been their goal. </PARA>
<PARA> Guaranteed prosperity requires investment to be sensibly spread amongst those various categories that I have just mentioned. In the past, home construction has received a generous share of investment. There is now a greater need for funds to go to those industries associated with the resource boom because success of investment in this area will ensure the prosperity and long term continuation of increasing home ownership. We cannot have home ownership if we do not have prosperity. We must have prosperity first and home ownership will follow. I am not advocating starvation of home building funds, but merely identifying the major considerations when decisions on interest rates are made. I refer honourable members to some statistics. I have tables from the Indicative Planning Council's report for 1980-81. As I have said, currently almost 72 per cent of Australians own their own homes. When I look at the statistics from this report I find that, in the financial year just concluded, 131,000 homes were completed in Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. When honourable members look at these tables they will see that there must be a balance in Australia between home ownership and other investment. More importantly, there must be a balance between homes required and vacant homes so that anyone who wants to buy a second home has a satisfactory and stable market in which he can sell his first home. The honourable member for Reid spoke about people who wanted to buy a second home. They cannot buy a second home if the market on which they would seek to sell their first home has been destroyed. If we have too many vacant homes or a surplus of homes there is no way that a person can sell a first home and use the money obtained from it as a deposit for a second home. It is like the new car market. If new cars are for sale but the second hand car market has been destroyed, if a person cannot get a satisfactory price for his second hand car, he cannot buy a new car. Home ownership is exactly the same. The whole area needs to be controlled and there is a complete lack of understanding by the Opposition of the reasons why interest rates have risen in recent years and the need to have a market for second hand homes so that new homes can continue to be purchased.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> That this House-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) expresses its grave concern over the persecution of the adherents of the Baha'i faith in Iran by the regime of the Ayatollah Khomeini, and notes with alarm and abhorrence the continuing executions of Iranian Baha'is purely on the grounds of their religious faith;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) calls upon the Government of Iran to release from custody those Baha'is who have been unjustly detained, and to restore the holy places, properties, community centres and companies that have been confiscated;</PARA>
<PARA> (3) commends the Australian Government for its assistance to Australian Baha'is in expressing their protest to the Iranian Government, and</PARA>
<PARA> (4) requests the Australian Government to continue to lend its support to moves in international forums designed to restore to the Iranian Baha'is their freedom to live in peace and practice their religion in harmony with their fellow citizens of other faiths. </PARA>
<PARA>I think most members of the House will be aware by now of the nature of the Baha'i faith, but I would like to give some information on it during my speech and also to indicate some of the difficulties presently being experienced by adherents of that faith in Iran. The seconder of the motion, my colleague the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack), will detail some of the atrocities which are being perpetrated at present by the Iranian regime on Baha'is. The faith of the Baha'is arose in Persia-now Iran-in the middle of the nineteenth century, and its name, Baha'i, comes from the founder, Bahaullah, and simply means a follower of Bahaullah. It is an independent world religion. </PARA>
<PARA> The Baha'i faith first came to my attention some years ago when I met the world famous baritone, Mr Norman Bailey, who came to Australia to sing with the Australian Opera in performances of The Mastersingers of Nuremberg. I had lunch with Mr Bailey and I was very much impressed by his adherence to this simple yet universal faith. It was by pure coincidence that a few years later I found that I was representing the electorate of Mackellar, which has within it the house of worship of the Bahai's in Australia. Visitors to the northern beachside suburbs of Sydney will have noticed that remarkable building at Ingleside which can be seen for many kilometres. It is a beautiful shrine and I would advise anybody in the area to visit it and, if possible, to attend services there. More recently, and certainly since the Iranian revolution, the Baha'is who worship at Ingleside have brought to my attention the very severe difficulties being experienced by their brethren in Iran. Certainly, following the Iranian revolution, there was a major persecution to which I shall refer later. </PARA>
<PARA> On 10 September last year I made a speech in the adjournment debate drawing the attention of the House to this problem, and on the following day, 11 September, I gave notice of the motion which is substantially the same as the one I moved today. Last year the former Minister for Foreign Affairs-the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock)-saw members of the Baha'i faith in Australia and as a result had the Iranian charge-d'affaires called in to hear the Australian Government's concern about the persecution of Baha'is. With the formation of the new Parliament, I renewed the motion on notice. On 9 March 1981 Senator Wheeldon asked a question in the Senate of Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and Dame Margaret was able to indicate that the Australian representative at the United Nations Commission on Human Rights had specifically raised the problem of religious persecution in Iran and had raised the question of Baha'is in particular. Dame Margaret also indicated in that answer that the present Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) was continuing the role of the previous Minister in pursuing this matter in international forums and, where possible, with the Iranian Government. </PARA>
<PARA> On 25 March of this year the honourable member for Diamond Valley, now the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr N. A. Brown), spoke on the Human Rights Commission Bill and detailed the problems being experienced at that time by Iranian Baha'is. On 26 March 1981 Senator Puplick moved a motion in the Senate to this effect:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Senate deplores the continued persecution of religious minorities in Iran, particularly the large community of Baha'is, and urges that this total abuse of the right to religious tolerance be brought to the attention of the Human Rights Commission of the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA>That motion was supported by Senator Gareth Evans on behalf of the Australian Labor Party and it was carried by the Senate. There have been, of course, individual cases of Iranian citizens who have come to Australia, possibly before the revolution, and found that they are subject to religious persecution. I have made representations, as I am sure many other honourable members have, to the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Macphee) on behalf of such people, hoping that the Australian Government will be able to take a sympathetic view of their plight. I am happy to say that the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs has advised me that he is giving this matter very sympathetic consideration, and in a forthcoming statement on immigration policy matters he will refer to the status of Iranian citizens suffering persecution. </PARA>
<PARA> I thought that in order to indicate to the House just how outrageous it is that this should be happening to adherents I would refer to some of the basic Baha'i teachings. The Baha'i faith, which rose out of Islam but is different from Islam, proclaims the unity of God and His prophets. It recognises the basic oneness of all religions and the oneness of the entire human race. It encourages an independent investigation of truth. It provides the necessary agencies for the establishment and safeguarding of a permanent and universal peace as the supreme goal of mankind. It states that religion must go hand in hand with science and that it constitutes the ultimate basis of a peaceful, ordered and progressive society. It upholds the principle of equal opportunity, rights and privileges for men and women. It advocates universal compulsory education. It exalts work performed in the spirit of service to the rank of worship. The Baha'i faith is particularly emphatic in its teachings about obedience to government, non-involvement in politics, the oneness of religion and the far-reaching implications of the oneness of mankind. </PARA>
<PARA> I certainly have found from my contacts with individual Baha'is and also from attending religious services which are conducted by the Baha'is that they are indeed a very gentle people. The set of religious principles that I have underlined must have been startling indeed not only in Iran in the mid-nineteenth century but surely throughout much of the world. It is hard to imagine that such foresight and such understanding of the movement of human progress over the forthcoming centuries would be seen by such a small band in such a place so long ago. </PARA>
<PARA> Many find it difficult to understand why members of a religious minority dedicated to tolerance, peace and universal brotherhood arouse hatred in those amongst whom they live. The reasons for persecutions, the hatred and the violence lie deep in the socio-psychological structure of Persian society and go back more than a century to 1844 when a young merchant of Shiraz, later known as the Bab, founded this religion whose followers rejected the literal interpretation of the Koran and held that soon he whom God shall make manifest would appear on earth to bring a new law and to inaugurate a new era in the history of mankind. In nineteenth century Iran, where even the notion of religious liberty did not exist, the teachings of the Bab were bound to produce a violent reaction. Accused of heresy the Bab was imprisoned and finally executed in 1850. This did not stop the spread of the Bab's teachings nor did it stop the resistance of his disciples who defended themselves with great valour against attacks by the united forces of the clergy, the mobs and the government. There ensued a campaign of extermination in which some 20,000 Babis, as they were then called, were killed. The cruelty of the suppression, the indiscriminate massacre of women and children and the tortures inflicted upon masses of innocent people have been eloquently described both by participants and by Western observers. The bloodshed left a legacy of suspicion, fear and pain. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirteen years after the martydom of the Bab one of his leading disciples who had been exiled by the Persian Government to Baghdad proclaimed himself to be the one whose advent the Bab had prophesied. He became known as Bahaullah and is seen as the main founder of the religion. Most of the Bab's followers accepted Bahaullah's claim and they became known thereafter as Baha'is. Over the next 40 years Bahaullah produced a vast number of works that today constitute the scripture of the religion he founded, the Baha'i faith. Bahaullah taught the unity of mankind and the equality of races and nations. He proclaimed the essential harmony of religion and science, equality of the sexes and the need for universal education. He also established the principles on which this currently world-wide religion would be founded. </PARA>
<PARA> The authorities, both religious and secular, kept Bahaullah in confinement and exile for some 40 years. Fundamentalist Muslim clergy, feeling threatened by ideas that challenged the theological formulas they had repeated for hundreds of years, continued to demand the extermination of the Baha'is whom they denounced as heretics and harmful misleaders. In time, the Baha'is were turned into the scapegoats of Iranian society. As their numbers increased they became an evermore attractive target for demagogic attacks by those who wanted to distract the public or create turmoil. Since the Baha'is emphasised education and placed high value on work, they achieved a relatively high standard of living which made them attractive targets of pogroms. </PARA>
<PARA> Last, but not least, the peaceable nature of the Baha'i community made it possible to attack Baha'is without fear of violent retaliation. In moments of national stress, during famines, revolutions and invasions of the country, Baha'is could be blamed for the nation's miseries. If one did not wish to pay a debt one could accuse the creditor of being a Baha'i. If an epidemic spread throughout a province one could blame the Baha'is. Baha'i ideals of world unity could be twisted to appear as a lack of patriotism. Baha'i acceptance of the truth inherent in all great religions of mankind could be interpreted as a betrayal of Islam. When in 1896 Nasiri'd-Din Shah was assassinated by a pan-Islamist terrorist the Baha'is were automatically accused of that deed. In a brief but violent persecution that followed several Baha'is lost their lives. In 1903 more than 100 Baha'is were massacred in Yazd. The outbreak of the revolution in 1906 precipitated new attacks on Baha'is. As the constitutional movement developed, reactionaries brought groundless accusations against the Baha'is, denouncing them as supporters and inspirers of the reformist cause. In the chaotic conditions of World War I and its aftermath Baha'is once again suffered scattered attacks in various parts of the country. </PARA>
<PARA> During the 1930s things calmed down somewhat but a large scale attack on the Baha'i community was launched in the month of Ramadan in 1955. At one of Tehran's mosques Shaykh Muhammad Taqi Falsafi, a fanatical Mullah, daily urged his flock to rise up against the false religion. He accused the Baha'is of being enemies of Islam and called for severe measures against them. One can certainly see in this little piece of history as in the earlier ones precursors of what has been happening in recent times. It is almost a repeat of that old history. In 1955 there was an orgy of senseless murder, rape, pillage and destruction. The details were published in a number of leading European and American newspapers and aroused the concern of a large number of Western statesmen and scholars. The outbreaks were mentioned by President Eisenhower in a press conference reported in the Chicago Daily News on 14 July 1955. The renowned Oxford scholer, Professor Gilbert Murray, wrote an open letter in the Manchester Guardian on 22 August 1955 where he said:</PARA>
<PARA> A country such as Iran, whose Government approved the Declaration of Human Rights, can ill-afford to permit fanatics to attack with violence the peaceful followers of a harmless and progressive religion. </PARA>
<PARA>His remarks were echoed by the British historian, Professor Arnold Toynbee, who wrote to express his concern in the 3 September issue of the Times. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA> In publishing your leading article of August 30, 'A Persecuted Sect', I am sure you have done a service to Persia as well as to her Baha'i citizens. The Persian Government has, as you say, an interest in keeping order and protecting its nationals . . . The Baha'is have a particularly strong claim to be tolerated, because non-violence is one of the cardinal principles of their religion. </PARA>
<PARA>This is quite significant because in 1955 a world-wide campaign of publicity, expressions of sympathy for the Baha'is of Iran on the part of outstanding individuals throughout the world and two formal appeals to the United Nations eventually resulted in some relief. The Iranian Foreign Minister gave formal reassurances to the Secretary-General of the United Nations that the persecutions would be halted. However, it took several years for passions to abate, for normalcy to return and for the Iranian Baha'i community to begin to rebuild its shattered and desecrated holy places, community centres and educational facilities. Since then Baha'is have continued to live under the threat of further outbreaks and the burden of severe civil restrictions. </PARA>
<PARA> Though the Baha'is are the largest religious minority in the country their existence was not officially recognised by the government of the Shah. Unlike other minorities, such as the Christians, the Jews and the Zoroastrians, they enjoyed no protection under the imperial constitution. Being in their vast majority ethnic Iranians, speaking Persian or Azerbaijani, they are no foreign element but a part of the Iranian nation to which they have always been loyal. It is the medieval intolerance of fanatical elements that strives to set them apart from their Muslim brothers and fellow citizens. Being non-political, law abiding, and opposed to all violence they constitute no threat to anyone. Yet they have been the most frequently persecuted group in the nation. The current outbreaks of persecution are only one more episode in the long history of cruel and senseless oppression. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been six stages in what happened in Iran in recent times. The first stage was the seizure of the complete records of the National Baha'i Centre. This action provided those responsible for the persecution with the means of identifying members of the Baha'i community throughout Iran. The numbers are estimated-I am not quite sure of the total number-at somewhere between 200,000 and 500,000 people, which is a fairly large minority. The second stage, which began immediately, was a campaign of systematic destruction of the economic base of the community. Baha'i assets were arbitrarily seized, pensions were cancelled and bank accounts confiscated, private enterprises were looted or wrecked, farms and orchards were burned and thousands of Baha'is were discharged from public and private employment. </PARA>
<PARA> The third stage was the effort to terrorise the community. Urged on by sermons of the Shiah clergy and supported by so-called revolutionary guards, mobs destroyed Baha'i shrines and holy places, desecrated cemetries and raped and beat members of the faith in scores of towns and villages. The media collaborated by giving wide publicity to hate propaganda against the Baha'is. This has been followed by the current attempt to cut the head off the Baha'i community, so to speak. The members of the National Baha'i Assembly and many members of local assemblies in major cities and towns have been arrested and held without legal process. Unsubstantiated charges have been widely published that the prisoners were agents of imperialism, heretics, apostates or Savak collaborators, that is, collaborators with the Shah's secret police. The fifth stage took place this past summer and fall in Europe when the campaign moved into its most ominous stage with the beginning of a series of farcical trials by local komitehs in which a dozen or more prominent Baha'is have been sentenced to death on these same charges. It is apparent in the sixth phase that they wished to demoralise the whole of the Baha'i community. All those sentenced to death were offered their lives if they would take this step. They have not done so. My colleague, the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack), will indicate that many people have lost their lives in this battle, although it was a one-sided battle. </PARA>
<PARA> Why are they such a threat to the regime of the Ayatollah Khomeini? I think the reason is that they are such a liberal sect. Nothing they put forward could possibly be harmful to anybody except a fanatic. The principles of their religion are for openness of inquiry, equality of the sexes, independent investigation of the truth and the use of science in advancing the human race. These are all liberal principles which I hope all of us in this House share. But these principles, of course, are a dire threat to a regime such as that of the Ayatollah. It is for that reason that these people are losing their lives. I ask the House to consider this motion and pass it unanimously in the hope that these poor beleaguered people will be assisted in world forums. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a few comments on behalf of the Opposition. I welcome the remarks made by the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton). This matter has been the subject of debate in this Parliament. It was not raised by the honourable member for Mackellar, but was raised by his colleague, the honourable member for Diamond Valley (Mr N. A. Brown), in the debate on the Human Rights Commission Bill last March. The honourable member for Diamond Valley then referred to a notice of motion which has been brought on for debate today. In that context we welcome the Government's refreshing approach to dealing with notices of motion. They are not often dealt with. It appears that we will have a chance to debate some of them. My colleagues in the Opposition also have given notice of motions that they are anxious to have discussed. We look forward to continued co-operation in that respect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This matter is a very serious one for the reasons that the honourable member for Mackellar mentioned. I am pleased to note that he has given, in support of his motion, a number of facts which clearly indicate that over the centuries-certainly over this century-the Baha'is have been subjected to dreadful treatment by those who have been in charge in Iran. This motion mentions the present regime in Iran, but the facts clearly indicate that for some time there has been persecution of Baha'is in Iran whether it be under the regime of the Shah or under the regime of some other controller of Iran. I note that the Senate has discussed this matter. I think Senator Puplick raised it on 25 March. The motion was passed and it was supported by my colleagues in that august chamber. With the permission of my friends opposite I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a letter written by my Leader to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcom Fraser) on 5 August indicating that the Senate had passed the resolution in the following terms:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank honourable members. This letter shows that the Leader of the Opposition was anxious to co-operate in the case of that resolution. We are also anxious to indicate to the honourable member for Mackellar that we have no objection to his motion. In the course of mentioning support for the Senate's resolution, I note also that other people have had cause for concern about discrimination particularly religious discrimination in Iran. Reference has been made to the persecution of the Christians and the Jews, who have had a pretty tough time in Iran. This indicates that we do have some problems in our society. Christians and Jews could hardly be said to have had an easy time in Iran under the Ayatollah, but the group that has suffered the most has certainly been the Baha'is. I suppose one could say also that the Kurds are having a difficult time in Iran. We talk about human rights, religious freedoms and freedoms generally. At present we have difficulties in our own land. We have accepted refugees from Asia, Latin America, Cyprus and Lebanon. We now see the problems of Northern Ireland being raised in the cities of Australia such as Sydney. We are seeing the problems of what is deemed to be religious discrimination and religious persecution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Labor Party deplores religious intolerance wherever it occurs. There is no doubt that the Baha'is have been persecuted by past regimes and by the present regime in Iran. It is important that the Australian Government speaks out and condemns that persecution. We have an obligation to speak out under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It is a matter of considerable regret that in spite of many years work by the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, an effective international convention directed at the practice of religious intolerance by governments is still not in force. I understand that the Human Rights Commission has recently completed a draft convention and submitted it to the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations for transmission to the United Nations General Assembly. </PARA>
<PARA> I urge the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) to instruct the Australian delegation to the forthcoming meeting of the General Assembly to give the completion of work on this convention the highest priority and to lobby other governments to give the convention the highest priority. The Human Rights Commission is a very broadly based body with 40 member countries from all regional, religious and socio-economic groups. All the arguments which could or should be reasonably advanced with respect to the substance of a convention on religious intolerance have already emerged and been thoroughly debated. There is no reason for any further delay. It appears that the Baha'i minority in Iran is suffering from acute repression as its members cannot enjoy normal human rights and practise their religion free from intimidation and oppression. The honourable member for Mackellar and his colleagues have said previously that there have been executions, confiscations and complete discrimination against this community which has nothing but good to offer its fellow citizens. So the Labor Party is concerned about the persecution of minorities, particularly of those such as the Baha'is. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many other problems which we cannot canvass in this debate, but I have mentioned some in my opening remarks. This is a country which accepts many migrants. Migrants who have come to Australia have brought home to us the problems they have experienced in their own countries. There is no doubt that the Baha'is in Australia are anxious to have the Australian Government take some action. There are many others in the same boat and that is rather tragic. It is of some satisfaction that in the development of our democracy in Australia we have made progress in giving everybody the same rights. There are some difficulties and objections which are certainly valid in respect of our Aborigines and others. But it is important that matters such as this have a chance to be aired because people have come to Australia, perhaps not because they want to come here but to escape persecution. We cannot let that pass unnoticed. We wish to see a continuation of a responsible and humane attitude to our citizens and also to our international obligations. We cannot turn people away from Australia because they are in fear of their lives. Certainly it is tragic to think that they could be in fear of their lives because of their religious beliefs. </PARA>
<PARA>There are many hundreds of thousands of Baha'is in Iran. The Baha'is are a pacifist religious group emphasising unity and prohibiting involvement by their members in politics. The Baha'is broke away from Islam in the mid-nineteenth century. It is clear that members of that faith have been persecuted in Moslem countries ever since. They have been in Australia for over 60 years. There are Baha'i communities in every State and Territory of Australia. There have been threats against Iranian members of the Baha'i faith in Australia. Some members, apparently, fear for their safety and the safety of their families. That has to be deplored. It is intolerable in a democracy such as ours. There is absolutely no evidence to suggest that members of this faith have been other than hard-working citizens whose conduct is beyond reproach. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that the previous Minister for Foreign Affairs, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), received representations from members of the Baha'i faith and instructed his Department to call in the Iranian charge- d'affaires and protested to him about the persecution of the Baha'is in Iran. I commend him for so doing. I urge the current Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) to consider whether it is not time to take such further action. Apparently, under the present regime the Baha'is have been subjected to arbitrary arrest, job discrimination, and, as has been indicated, the desecration of graves-in other words, to every form of persecution. Many people have been executed; I am told at least seven last September and many more in recent times. So, as I have indicated, the Opposition supports what the honourable member for Mackellar has said. </PARA>
<PARA> We have obligations under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. These include the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and it is significant that the signatories of this latter Covenant include the Iranian Government. Whilst we still do not have in force an international convention against the practices of religious intolerance, there are steps which the Australian Government could take, within the framework of international law, and in accordance with its international responsibilities, to assist the Baha'i. We could, in particular, raise the serious violations to which I have referred in the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, of which we are a member. I advert to the fact that Article 27 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights states:</PARA>
<PARA> In those states in which ethnic, religious or linguistic minorities exist, persons belonging to such minorities shall not be denied the right, in community with the other members of their group, to enjoy their own culture, to profess and practise their own religion or to use their own language. </PARA>
<PARA>Quite clearly, on the evidence available this provision of international law has been violated by the regime in Iran. Other articles including Article 18 of that Covenant have also clearly been breached. We therefore have a duty as well as a right to raise the matter in the Human Rights Commission and we should do so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Less than 24 hours have passed since the Treasurer (Mr Howard) brought down this year's Budget. Next week in this chamber we will be involved in the hurly-burly of debating the Budget, disputing with one another about its particular terms, criticising one another about the level of income redistribution, the size of the cake and how it is to be split up, whether we are taking too much from one sector or whether we are not giving enough to another sector. Against that background, I think it is extremely sobering that we can join together as one chamber-the House of Representatives-in recognising the persecution of a religious minority in a foreign country many thousands of miles from this place and in condemning the persecution that is taking place in that society. Of course, we are talking about the persecution of the adherents of the Baha'i faith in Iran.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As my colleague the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton) has pointed out, there is a small Baha'i faith community in Australia. I was impressed with them when two representatives came to see me in my Perth electorate office soon after I was elected in 1977. They came to inform me of their religion in a very self-effacing, low-key way, and to leave me some booklets and pamphlets relating to their beliefs. I certainly found it a very humbling experience because they had not come to propagandise their faith but, in my presence, to genuinely pray for me and my efforts in this Parliament. It was a very humbling experience and it bears out the fact that they are a gentle and very tolerant people. It is an extremely pacifist religion. The Baha'is are concerned with unity and consensus. Indeed, those concerns lead them to prohibit themselves from any involvement in the day to day political process. Yet we know that for some time now in Irabeen facing extreme persecution solely on the basis of that very pacifist religion. </PARA>
<PARA> We have learned in this debate that the position of Baha'is in Iran has always been bleak and if we cannot relate to the circumstances surrounding the foundation of that religion in the 19th century and the persecution that followed we can certainly relate to this century. My colleague has drawn attention to the flare-ups in the 1930s when there was extreme persecution against adherents of the Baha'i faith. In my own lifetime, in 1955, the then Minister for the Interior for the Iranian Government declared that the sect be banned and all their centres be liquidated. As my colleague has pointed out, what followed was an orgy of senseless murder, rape, pillage and persecution of every variety. It was only because of extreme world pressure that the then Iranian Government gave formal reassurances to the United Nations that the persecution would be halted. It really has been a century of persecution with particularly nasty flare-ups. We are now seeing in the anarchical situation in Iran a heightening of that persecution. I have a quote from the Ayatollah Sadoughi when he called on the faithful masses to hunt the Baha'is they knew from all administrations and to deliver them to the revolutionary court. </PARA>
<PARA> What is extremely worrying about the present context is that it is not persecution prosecuted by a few outrageous individuals; it is persecution which is orchestrated and organised from the top. My colleague from Mackellar did us a very great service when he outlined in a very clear form the six stages of this conspiracy to destroy the Baha'i faith, namely: To seize all their records; to destroy systematically the economic base of the adherents of the Baha'i faith; to terrorise the Baha'i community; to cut off the head of the Baha'i community; to leave it leaderless and speechless; to move into a campaign of farcical detentions and trials; and, of course, organised murder and death. I am reluctant, against the background of that experience, to portray in detail in this Parliament the particular instances, but there are people well known in Australia-Mr Parsa, Mr Sobhani and Mr Firuzi, Professor Hakim, Mr Nafti and Mr Dehgani-who are no longer with us because they have been subjected to the organised persecution campaign going on in Iran. I have a letter here which was published in the Australian Baha'i Bulletin in July 1979. I shall read a couple of paragraphs from the letter which obviously has come out of Iran and which was written by an adherent of the Baha'i faith:</PARA>
<PARA> About 2,000 men, women, children and youth have sought refuge in the mountains and deserts and live in tents. They have spent many cold and rainy days in the caves of the mountains. Many are injured with broken arms and legs. The small children have lost their ability to talk, having been frightened so much because of the incidents-</PARA>
<PARA>The incidents of persecution-</PARA>
<PARA> . . . These believers, without having any means of livelihood, pass their days with utmost difficulty-</PARA>
<PARA>In this modern world-</PARA>
<PARA>and are banished from place to place. </PARA>
<PARA> This is only a glimpse into one incident. Every day, from every corner, there is another cry of grief. The number of Baha'is in prisons for one reason or another has increased to 200. Many have been discharged from their jobs. Many have lost their retirement allowances. The Ministry of Education has officially sent a circular that those Baha'is who do not deny their faith be immediately discharged. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> At present thousands of friends in Iran have lost everything, or have lost their jobs and are meeting their expenses by the sale of their belongings. And then there are those who are fleeing from one place to another and in grave danger. This is only the beginning of the journey of love, and its end is not known. </PARA>
<PARA>We can be very grateful this afternoon that the honourable member for Mackellar has raised the matter in this chamber. He, of course, referred to the fact that he first raised it last year and, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Bowen) has mentioned, it was raised by the honourable member for Diamond Valley (Mr N. A. Brown). Former Senator Puplick also made quite an extensive speech on the matter in the Senate last March. The Senate passed a motion deploring the persecution of Bahai's in Iran and urged that the matter be brought to the attention of the Human Rights Commission of the United Nations. I am very pleased that since this matter has been brought to the attention of the Australian Government it has seen fit to express an opinion. The former Minister for Foreign Affairs-the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock)-instructed his Department to call in the Iranian charg'e d'affaires to voice the Australian Government's protest. This protest has been continued by the present Minister. There has been world-wide condemnation from Amnesty International. The Canadian House of Commons has passed a motion similar to the motion we are considering this afternoon. The United Nations has expressed considerable concern about the situation, as have many European countries. As I have said, a motion was passed in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> An important point made by my colleague the honourable member for Mackellar was that the persecution which was perpetrated in 1955 in Iran ceased because of the weight of world opinion and condemnation. We now have an opportunity to contribute to the world condemnation so that the situation presently being perpetrated in Iran may again cease. I do not know whether, by passing this motion in the House of Representatives, we will save one Iranian life. I do not know whether we will preserve and protect the position of those presently under threat. But at least the passing of the motion in this House will draw the attention of the Iranian authorities to the Australian view that what is happening is objectionable. A free and independent democratic society like Australia has as one of its cornerstones a belief in the freedom of worship and religion. At least this motion will put forward our view that what is happening in that country is extremely objectionable and should cease forthwith. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As has been pointed out by the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton), who moved this motion, the Baha'i faith originated in Persia, as it was then known, in the second half of the nineteenth century. The Baha'is trace their faith back to the Babi faith of the 1840s, which sprang from the Shiite tradition of Islam to which the Ayatollah Khomeini belongs. It is true that Persian history has been marked by horrific persecutions of religious dissenters. I think it is important to make clear that those dissenters have not been confined to the Baha'is. No doubt the Baha'is deserve special treatment, but it also needs to be pointed out that the Jewish community of Iran, which dates back more than 2,000 years, has been virtually eliminated. The Zoroastrians, who are followers of another important religion which began in Iran, have been subject to enormous persecution. The overwhelming bulk of the members of that faith have migrated over the years to India and Pakistan. In India they are known as Parsees. The Zoroastrian religion is a native religion of Iran that has been subject to the most acute persecution. The Baluchis and the Azerbaijanis have also been persecuted. So have the Kurds and to some degree the Druses, the Ishmaelite Shiites. They suffer. They have committed the abominable crime of constituting a minority-not necessarily a dissenting vocal minority but simply a recognisable minority. The majority is disposed to express its prejudice and its lack of understanding and humanity by visiting the most barbarous treatment on these minorities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My only reservation about the motion moved by the honourable member for Mackellar is that it appears to suggest that we express concern for only one minority group. I hope the entire House agrees-I see that the mover and the seconder of the motion indicate their agreement-that we should convey to the Government that the motion ought to be read as though it applies to other persecuted minorities as well as the Baha'is. In 1850 the Bab, Sayyid Ali Muhammad, founder of the Babi faith, as mentioned by the honourable member for Mackellar, was executed in Tabriz and about 20,000 members of the Babi sect were killed in large scale persecutions over the next few years. When in 1863 Bahaullah proclaimed his new faith, the Baha'i, he was expelled from Persia into the Ottoman Empire and then confined to Aire, which was then in Palestine and is now in the modern state of Israel. Bahaullah died in 1892 but by his death the Baha'i faith had spread from Burma through the Middle East to the Sudan. The Baha'i faith was further promoted by the founder's son and grandson and extended to small groups in North Africa, the United States and Australia. Later still the faith was taken up with some success throughout the continent of Africa and in a number of Pacific islands. </PARA>
<PARA> As has been mentioned, the teaching of the Baha'is is universalist and syncretist. The Baha'is do not accept the description of syncretist, although the Baha'i faith is the best example of a syncretist faith I can think of. In their services there is no priesthood and no sermons but they read from the writings of other faiths. Shoghi Effendi, one of the leading spokesmen, described the faith in the following words:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . proclaims the necessity and inevitability of the unification of mankind . . . enjoins upon its followers the primary duty of an unfettered search after truth, condemns all manner of prejudice and superstition . . . declares the purpose of religion to be the promotion of amity and concord . . . [and] proclaims its essential harmony with science . . . maintains the principle of equal rights . . . insists on compulsory education, [and] . . . eliminates extremes of poverty and wealth. </PARA>
<PARA>The Baha'i community is organised on an elective basis, but not in Calvin's sense. The Baha'i community has made representations to the United Nations about the treatment of its members in Iran. The Baha'i International Community is a non-government organisation in consultative status with the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations in New York. The community reported to the United Nations that their members have:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . been harassed, dismissed from their jobs, denied back pay and pensions; they have been terrorised, individuals and families beaten, and in some instances driven to the mosques and forced to recant their faith; and their homes, shops, and businesses have been looted, burnt down, or otherwise destroyed. Baha'i homes have continually been invaded by armed groups, and the family members subjected to long and harsh interrogations. The Iranian Baha'i community has had its holy places, centres, and businesses confiscated, even destroyed and its cemeteries have been seized and desecrated. </PARA>
<PARA>The national spiritual assembly of the Baha'is reported to the United Nations. It said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . they were denied civil rights, such as permission to register their Baha'i marriages, the privilege to hold Baha'i religious endowments in the name of the Baha'i community, and freedom to publish Baha'i literature or establish Baha'i schools (indeed, during the reign of Muhammad Reza Shah's father--</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the late Shah's father-</PARA>
<PARA>more than 30 Baha'i schools throughout the country were permanently closed). Many from the rank and file of the Baha'is were denied jobs and sometimes even their rights to pensions because of their refusal to deny their Faith. </PARA>
<PARA>So the events of the last few years-the persecution under the Ayatollah Khomeini-ought not to be thought of as peculiar. No doubt it has been heightened and it has become quantitatively and qualitatively worse. But it is a long tradition that goes back to the Pahlavi monarchy and the Quaja dynasty from the nineteenth century that preceded it. I draw the attention of the House to a particularly distressing case referred to in the Medical Journal of Australia on 16 May 1981. It referred to the murder of Dr Manuchir Hakim in Iran, which was mentioned by the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack). The article reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Professor Hakim returned to Iran in 1938 where he established the Chair of Anatomy at Teheran University. He was also a well known specialist in the field of gastroenterology and he served for 30 years as a director of the Baha'i Hospital in Teheran. This charitable hospital treated all, irrespective of their religious affiliations or nationality, and cared for the poor free of charge where necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> His other great humanitarian work was as the founder of the Baha'i Home for the Aged which accepted people of all religious and racial backgrounds. He was decorated by the French government in 1976 with the Legion D' Honneur. </PARA>
<PARA>He does not sound to me like a very dangerous terrorist. </PARA>
<PARA>It continues:</PARA>
<PARA> In the months before his assassination, Professor Hakim received constant threats and anonymous telephone calls. During a short visit to Europe in 1980 he was warned by friends not to return to Iran, but his high sense of duty made him return to serve people in need despite the knowledge of danger to his own life. On January 12, 1981, he was murdered by an unknown assassin who entered his office and shot him to death after his last patient had left his clinic. </PARA>
<PARA> Professor Hakim was in no sense a political dissident and one is even more concerned at the loss to the world of this eminent humanitarian and gravely disturbed to learn that his property was confiscated by the Islamic Republic on January 14, two days after he was murdered, despite legal protests, and that his family is without the protection of Iranian law. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federation of Protestant Churches in Switzerland, through its Human Rights Commission has declared its belief that the new constitution of Iran should include protection for all religious minorities so that Professor Hakim's family and fellow Baha'is may enjoy religious freedom. </PARA>
<PARA>Before I conclude I want to return for just a moment to the question of the Zoroastrians. A letter that appeared in the New York Times on 21 January 1979 pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA>Over the past millenium, most Zoroastrians have fled to India, where they live in freedom and safety; these have come to be known as Parsis. The Parsis have distinguished themselves in commerce, science and the arts (Zubin Mehta, conductor of the New York Philharmonic, will be well-known to your readers). But some 27,000 Zoroastrians remain in Iran, mainly in Teheran and in the Yazd area. </PARA>
<PARA>That is considerably less than the number of Baha'is. The twentieth century has been the most appalling era in terms of religious and tribal persecution. The elimination of six million Jews in Europe in World War II stands out, but there are very many other horrific examples in other continents. The Ayatollah Khomeini presides over one of the most unattractive regimes in the world today with strong elements of obscurantism and cruelty. In the Iranian Bulletins, the news bulletins of the Committee for Defence of Political Prisoners in Iran, published by Index on Censorship in London in 1979 there is an introductory comment by the writer, Edward Mortimer, which says:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the future of human rights in Iran is far from being assured, and it is still possible that the revolution will in the end produce a new dictatorship no less savage than that of Mohammed Reza Pahlavi. It would not be the first revolution in the world to follow such a cycle. What would be wrong would be to attribute any such tendency to the Islamic and or anti-Western character of the revolution and the regime that is emerging from it . . . It is hardly surprising if they suspect the good faith of criticisms of their new rulers emanating from the West in the name of freedom or human rights . . . Even those of us in the West who did speak out against the Pahlavi dictatorship in the days of its strength have to admit that we were quite unsuccessful in changing the policies of our own governments towards it. </PARA>
<PARA>I point out that the Baha'i faith has not emanated from the West. It is not something imposed historically. It is something that has arisen out of the Iranian tradition, out of Iranian history. This persecution is a black mark against the record of the current Iranian Government. Why are we in the Australian Parliament raising the question of the Baha'is, people who are mistreated in a distant country? The reason, of course, is that we recognise our common interest-we are all part of the human race. Before I close I should mention that the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi) was very anxious that I should indicate his very strong support for the motion. He has had many representations on this issue. The matter was raised-the honourable member for Mackellar should be congratulated for doing so-because of the common bond, membership of the human race. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) That a standing committee be appointed to maintain a continuing surveillance of the practices and procedures of the House of Representatives with a view to making recommendations which would enhance the role of the House and its operational efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) That the committee consist of four Government Members and four Opposition Members to be appointed by Mr Speaker after consultation with the Party Whips.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) That Mr Speaker also appoint a Chairman of the Committee who shall have a casting vote only. </PARA>
<PARA> (4) That any additional terms of appointment of the committee be the subject of a subsequent resolution of the House. </PARA>
<PARA>The motion which I have moved arises out of a select committee of this Parliament which met some years ago to examine the procedures of the Parliament and to make recommendations in respect of a committee system for the Parliament. That committee was the Procedures Committee of the House of Representatives. The purpose of the committee I am seeking to set up is to provide the means by which the House itself can review its own procedures, can make recommendations or can have recommendations on changes in procedures brought before the House to enhance and improve the efficiency of the House and the role that the House plays in the government of the country. Unfortunately, in recent times the Standing Orders have ceased to be the prerogative of this chamber. That prerogative has been transferred outside this chamber, largely to a committee of Government back bench members and the Executive. That is not the manner in which the Standing Orders were handled when you and I, Mr Deputy Speaker, came to this Parliament. At that time they were dealt with on their merit by members of this chamber voting without party whip. So whilst the Standing Orders were not all that we would have liked, and certainly advantaged the Executive to an extent which is probably beyond the wishes of most back benchers, they were approved in free vote by members of this House at the time they were put forward. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent times the procedures by which changes to the Standing Orders have taken place have almost always consisted of an Executive resolution and a subsequent reference to the Standing Orders Committee after a long term of practice based on the change. Whilst one does not deny the input of the Executive into the chamber, it is highly desirable that a house of parliament should reserve unto itself the right to consider its own procedures and to bring forward wherever possible recommendations which would amend those procedures in such a way as to make them more effective for the house of parliament to carry out its function. </PARA>
<PARA> It can be argued, and I have no doubt that it will be argued, that there is a Standing Orders Committee. The House of Commons also has a standing orders committee and has found that it is not a satisfactory vehicle for examining ongoing matters relating to procedures or new procedures which may be desirable for a parliament to fulfil its role in a society which is ever more demanding on members of parliament and the government of the day. Clearly, in the Westminster system, the parliament has more than one role. First of all, it has a responsibility to facilitate the government of the country by enacting and dealing with legislation in a manner which does not unduly inhibit good government. It should seriously inhibit bad government. This chamber has allowed to pass from its control the procedures by which it operates. I do not deny that resolutions are carried by a majority of members, but on almost all occasions now when Standing Orders matters are dealt with, they are carried by a majority of members after party decision and on party lines, and rarely with any adequate consultation with the Opposition. Usually it is a take-it-or-leave-it proposition. </PARA>
<PARA> The Standing Orders Committee, as I have already mentioned, does exist. It recommends the form in which new procedures should be written into the Standing Orders of the House. It is not a committee which has a capacity or could have a capacity for ongoing consideration of changes or for examination of the manner in which this chamber operates as a house of parliament. The Standing Orders Committee is cumbersome. Its personnel alone prevent it from meeting regularly or from carrying out any investigation other than a cursory one. It has one advantage. Because of its personnel, those things to which it agrees are usually able to be presented to this Parliament almost as a fait accompli, although some of its recommendations have not been adopted in the past, and unfortunately a number of reports of that Committee have never been listed for consideration in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite seriously, a procedures committee would give us the flexibility that is necessary to examine our procedures. One would hope that the members of such a committee would be experienced in the operations of parliament and would recognise the various roles that this chamber has to carry out. It would give this chamber the opportunity for self-examination of its procedures on a continuing basis. Clearly, recommendations would come back to this House and the House would determine whether or not those recommendations were to be proceeded with. If they were to become part of the Standing Orders or the regular procedures of this House, one would expect that the Standing Orders Committee would ultimately draft and present the necessary Standing Orders. </PARA>
<PARA> Procedures committees operate successfully in other parliaments, and are a far more flexible and a better vehicle than the Standing Orders Committee. We have no means now by which we can bring about a review of our procedures on any specific matter. An honourable member may list for debate in this chamber a resolution of the Standing Orders Committee but the chances of it actually being debated are almost nil. Certainly there is no vehicle by which such a matter can be seriously considered by members of this chamber or alternatives which can be considered to meet any given situation. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not seeking in this motion to bring about a decision-making function, but merely to bring about a facility which would enable this House to examine itself and to report upon itself to its members for their determination on how its procedures should be conducted. We have had many changes in recent years, some good and some bad, but none of which would not have been better had it been the subject of substantive consideration on the best means by which the Parliament could conduct certain items of business, and none of which would not have been better had it not received the unanimous recommendations of this House. For instance, in recent years we have had the introduction of Estimates committees. When I say that they are a farce, I think that I reflect the majority view of the Opposition and the majority view of members who have participated on those committees. They have been set up without any substantive consideration of what their role is, other than to take the debate out of this chamber, which seems to be the only role they perform, how they are to be conducted, the nature of their business and what time should be allocated to the conduct of that business. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that members of this chamber, meeting as a smaller committee, giving consideration to a need on occasions to conduct outside this chamber business which normally would be conducted in this chamber, in order to permit there being greater time for the major debates which should take place in this chamber but do not, would have come down with a more workable proposition than the one we are faced with. We have legislation committees which I think are of doubtful validity as regards functioning effectively as part of the operations of this chamber. Agreements have been made, and they have been broken. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that in future this Parliament will have to devise a means whereby matters not considered to be of major consequence and therefore able to be debated outside this chamber, can be debated outside this chamber, and whereby the procedures for doing that should if possible-it is possible-be devised by members of this Parliament meeting to determine procedures that will bring about the best possible resolution of the problem that faces this chamber. The business which now goes through this chamber and has gone through it for the last six or seven years, is probably 10 times as great as that which went through this chamber 20 years ago, when some of us were not here. Nevertheless, it is undertaken in a time frame which is almost exactly the same. It is probably 50 times as great as that which took place in the immediate post-war years. For instance, the conciliation and arbitration legislation of 1947 was debated in this chamber for four weeks. Other Bills have been before this chamber for longer periods. Now such legislation takes two hours to consider, sometimes even three. </PARA>
<PARA> There are no means, and there have been no examinations of the procedures whereby substantive and important legislation can be adequately considered by the Parliament without necessarily being considered on the floor of this chamber. The Senate debated the Freedom of Information Bill, which is presently listed on our Notice Paper, for almost a year, and the Bill was before the Senate for longer than that. A similar situation occurred with the marriage Bills which were before this chamber not that long ago-in 1974-75. The debate and consideration in the Senate was 10 times as long as that which took place in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> In these instances our procedures are not conducive to proper examination of matters which are important to honourable members and to the country. We are supposedly the chamber which is responsible for the financial affairs of the country. We have no procedures for examination of the financial statements or the financial considerations which come before this chamber. This Committee would not, in any way, jeopardise the Goverment's control of the Parliament or its ability to run the Parliament. It would not jeopardise or reduce the standing of the Standing Orders Committee or its members. It would enable a continuing debate and examination of the methods by which this chamber does its business. It would enable new ideas to be examined in detail and tested and either put forward to the Parliament as suggestions for change or rejected. Majority views of honourable members from both sides of the Parliament would be reflected in that Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> We are confronted with a situation where we can maintain a stubborn insistence on a committee which cannot carry out the functions of considering changes which may be necessary, we can adopt procedures whereby examination by this chamber as reflected in a committee can take place or we can take the third alternative which, unfortunately, is the current position where the party empowered determines, on party lines, the procedures and Standing Orders of this chamber. This is an unfortunate departure from what was a very satisfactory arrangement at an earlier time. The Standing Orders, considerations and matters of actual conduct of this chamber which rested with individual members-I fancy that they still do in the Senate-have been transferred largely to an executive and party function. That has occurred, especially in the party sense, because of a vacuum which exists in the ability of this chamber to conduct its business. There is no facility for someone who wants to make an input into consideration of change. We have party back bench committees examining the change where really the Parliament itself should be looking at that change. </PARA>
<PARA> This motion arises from a unanimous decision of a parliamentary committee which reported to both Houses in 1976. At that time it was chaired by the former President of the Senate, Sir Magnus Cormack. It had previously been chaired in its initial stages by myself and subsequently by the honourable member for Scullin (Dr Jenkins). All of the honourable members of the committee supported this recommendation. I believe that it was supported by the majority of honourable members of this chamber at that time. At this time the House should give consideration to adopting a procedure which is eminently successful elsewhere and which would enable this chamber to look at its own procedures in an objective, rational and sensible way on a continuing basis. The Standing Orders Committee should deal with matters of form and Standing Orders which actually govern the chamber. There are two roles in this matter. A procedures committee would fulfil a very necessary role in the future of this Parliament. The Parliament tends to have stagnated and fallen backwards in its place in the parliamentary government of this country because of its inability to cope with the increased workload and the changes which have taken place in parliamentary and political operations in this country in recent years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have much pleasure in seconding the motion. It is not surprising that I should do so when the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) has pointed out that I was the Chairman of the Joint Committee on the Parliamentary Committee System which considered this matter and made a recommendation. One of the fears is that the proposed committee is seen as replacing the Standing Orders Committee. The Standing Orders Committee is concerned with the form of words put in the Standing Orders which are to be applied. I suggest that the Standing Orders are not reviewed enough. When they are reviewed they are generally concerned with subjects that are discussed in the House or discussed by honourable members privately around the House and given some impetus.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Committee is not suggested as a competitor with the Standing Orders Committee. It is put forward as a sensible procedure for suggested initiatives to be examined, discussed and their practicability tested and, finally, for the matter to be put before the House for decision and for incorporation in the Standing Orders. One feels at times that many of the practices and procedures do not require changes to the Standing Orders; they just require a change in the attitude of the House in the day-to-day functioning of Parliament. Over the years there has been a changed functioning of Parliament. There is the question of the volume of legislation and the question of the increasing demand by executive government on the time of the Parliament in putting matters forward. </PARA>
<PARA> One must ask whether Parliament exists just simply to provide that time for executive government. Should it not, after all, provide time for the elected representatives of the people to discuss a number of matters that are of importance? One has only to read a number of debates that occur on the Estimates for the Parliament to see that there is a lively interest amongst a number of honourable members on practices and procedures. Suggestions may be made for certain changes which are tested, but there is no discussion or testing of the effectiveness of those changes. </PARA>
<PARA> One thinks of the recent setting up of Estimates committees, legislation committees, expenditure committees and so on. Who tests them? When do we get a chance as a parliament to examine how they function? It may be found, from their functioning, that there should be an alteration in their role, that they should be given more powers or fewer powers and that they should use procedures which are more appropriate to the matters that are before them. For example, the legislation committees so far have dealt with the committee stages of Bills. While some of the Bills have been technically difficult, they have not necessarily been controversial. The operation of the legislative committees has been effective in that amendments and suggestions from Opposition members have been accepted and incorporated in the legislation. Is it necessary that all second readings of Bills are dealt with in the House, or is it appropriate that they be dealt with by these committees after being presented to the House? Who can make a recommendation to parliament with regard to it? Surely it is not a matter of party opinion that the parliamentary procedures used in dealing with such legislation are the ones that must be used. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that with this sort of committee, which is set up to have a look at our practices and procedures, one would probably, after reasoned discussion, get a very practical attitude on the matter and an opinion which would be unanimous. The Joint Committee on the Parliamentary Committee System comprised members from both Houses and all parties. There is not always sweet accord between both Houses of this Parliament, yet the report that was presented on that system was unanimous. It was a report on which senators and members, with wide variations in points of view politically, had been able to agree. They suggested to the Parliament that its recommendations should be implemented. One of those suggestions related to the surveillance of the practices and procedures of parliament. Honourable members will recall that members of that Committee visited other parliaments and heard of their experiences. That reinforced our belief that a practices and procedures committee-or whatever title it was given-would be of benefit to this Parliament in adjusting those practices and procedures to allow maximum participation of all members in the matters that Parliament should deal with to prevent it being bogged down on whatever action the Executive Government required it to take so that broader issues could be taken on and debated. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the matters you, Mr Deputy Speaker, will know has been raised is the relevance of our Question Time. I will not talk much further on that. We have the argument about whether answers to questions are relevant. That is always a bone of discontent between the Opposition and the Chair, and one for great joy for the Government at any time. But it does downgrade the information that we get from Question Time. In Question Time in other parliaments, such as the British House of Commons, a two or three line question to a specific Minister is printed. After the short and succinct answer is given, there is an opportunity at the discretion of the Speaker for supplementary questions. A discretion that we do not allow the Speaker of this Parliament. With good will and such a procedures committee, we may well find there is overwhelming agreement on the matter. That I believe, would be quite an improvement in the procedures of this House. </PARA>
<PARA> Should we set up standing committees? I will name one that I served on, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation. I am very proud of that committee. I wonder at times whether a committee such as that should continue year after year when subject matters are raised in Parliament by members, and by petitions that never get an airing before a parliamentary committee. That is one of the procedures that I would like to see examined. I am not trying to judge that matter. I am saying that this sort of committee made up by four Government members, four Opposition members and a chairman who obviously, having the casting vote, would probably come from the Government side of the House-so there need be no fear in that respect-could decide just where we should head on this subject. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that there is a desire amongst most members of this Parliament that we should review our practices and procedures from time to time to protect the interest of the ordinary back bench member of the Parliament to see that matters of national importance are able to be discussed in the Parliament and that these discussions allowed by practices and procedures are manifestly fair to all concerned. The practices and procedures committee that looks at these matters may ask about petitions which may come before the House. I know they are read by the Clerk and then referred to the appropriate persons. But surely there is a place for some of those to be discussed by this Parliament. I invite honourable members who have been here for some time to ask how often this practice has occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> I recall, when I first became a member of this Parliament, that there were petitions by the thousand on the killing of kangaroos. That is one example where a series of petitions did produce the House of Representatives select Committee on Wildlife Conservation. I believe that that was a matter in which the Government Whip of the day, Mr Max Fox, had a great interest and he was able to persuade the Government to take it on. But that is not the proper procedure in Parliament. The petition is made to Parliament. Surely we can define a bipartisan approach through a practices and procedures committee that would enable us to look at these matters and say: 'These are reasonably routine petitions. We expect such petitions, but this one is of particular interest to the Parliament and the Parliament should proceed to do something about it'. </PARA>
<PARA> I strongly support the setting up of a practices and procedures standing committee for the House. I believe that the Government need have no fear that it would bring about its downfall. I think all honourable members would realise that it would improve our practices and procedures in the House. There are many other arguments which I could advance if it had not been for the fact that I had about three minutes notice to second this motion. Certainly there is no backwardness in my support for this motion for a standing committee of practices and procedures of the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not suggesting that you are an historical dodo at all. I feel that I must take a lot of notice of what these two gentlemen have said today to this House. They have, of course, done what we did when in opposition-that is, put the position forward from where they sit. In some ways I must differ-I do not think very greatly-from what they have said. At the core of this whole debate is the proper balance-I do not think anyone has mentioned it yet-achieved by Parliament as a check and control on Executive power. That is really what this debate should be about. Again this magnifies the difference between where I sit currently as a slightly senior Government back bench member and where the two honourable gentlemen sit as highly important members of Her Majesty's Opposition. Under the current Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser)-and I am not being political in any shape or form-the back bench system, the number of committees and the power given to those committees resolves, in my view, any problems regarding the check and control of Executive power. For the first time I chair a committee that is quite entitled to refuse-and in fact has refused-leave to a Minister to introduce a certain matter into the party room. So we get the position within this Government, contrary to other governments, where this House-I suppose this is one thing that is genuinely perturbing the two Opposition speakers in this debate-becomes, in some ways, the House of ultimate self-justification. Apart from patching up procedures such as amendments agreed to subsequent to decisions being made, that is really what it is today. Decisions of government are now being taken not one step below this Parliament-in other words, by the Executive or in the party room-but in many cases one step below that again. Therefore, Mr Deputy Speaker, you will excuse me, if I say that the reasoned argument that the honourable gentlemen put forward did not convince me about what should be the core of this debate, that is, whether there is a proper parliamentary check and balance on Executive power.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The matter of Estimates committees was mentioned by the honourable member for Corio. He put forward a view on the Estimates committees which I do not hold. If ever there is a responsibility on this Parliament to function as a check and balance on Executive power it is to mount those Estimates committees properly. That is what they are about. I can think of an instance when a team from one party in this Parliament-I will not mention which one it was-succeeded in having nobody there when an industrial relations Bill was being considered. If one is talking about check and balance and the role of the back bench members of parliament, one should get one's perspective right because that is a complete example of the proper check that there should be within a limited portfolio responsibility on Executive power. I was disappointed to hear the honourable member for Corio treat the Estimates committees in a cavalier fashion in that instance. He also questioned-maybe this is what is worrying him-whether the structure is right and whether the power of such a committee, for want of a better phrase, is correct. If it has done nothing else, it has improved the capacity of this House to scrutinise every Minister's portfolio eight to twelve times more than this House and the Committee of the Whole used to. Some honourable members used to make parochial speeches for their local newspapers. I did the same thing; it was a marvellous opportunity for it. That was the degree of scrutiny of the Executive estimate by this House. Do not let us run away from the fact that we have taken big strides. I ask the House to remember that within the Government back bench structures today there is real power and a real check on Executive power emanates from that source. That power was not there before. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall now refer to the speech made by the honourable member for Scullin (Dr Jenkins). He said that the role of the Standing Orders Committee now was primarily a matter of deciding on the form of words that should be used. Even that is not true, as I see the situation. The last meeting of the Standing Orders Committee was on 3 December 1980, a little while ago now. Maybe the honourable member for Scullin, the honourable member for Corio and the member for Wakefield should have been promoting the fact that we needed another meeting. I do not know; that is another matter. As to whether the Committee simply looks at the form of words, let us look at some of the matters still under consideration by the Standing Orders Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly there is the Standing Orders Committee's report relating to petitions and parliamentary privilege tabled November 1979 but not considered by the House. In regard to petitions, I point out in passing that we have had two very solid days of presentation of petitions. No member of parliament has really listened to them, other than to listen for his own name to be read out, which is a matter of gross offence to the honourable members concerned and of even greater offence to the people who had that petition put down by their local member of parliament. Secondly, the Standing Orders Committee is to look again at the appointment of expenditure committees and their incorporation in Standing Orders-hardly a matter of words. It is also to look at discretions to the Speaker, quorums, divisions, closures, points of order generally-perhaps merely a form of words in that instance. It is to look at Question Time, which is surely a matter of substance, including the length of questions, and the House of Commons practice. That is not just a matter of words. It is to look at notices of motion, their content and the method of giving notice-'bringing down', as I would term it. The appointment of a committee on procedure is also mentioned. That, of course, is precisely what we are debating today. </PARA>
<PARA> If, on the agenda of the Standing Orders Committee, item 6 states 'Committee on Procedure', perhaps an idea ought to emanate there. I inquired earlier today as to whether the form of motion brought down by the honourable member for Corio could not be looked on more properly and more usefully as a sub-committee of the Standing Orders Committee on the Standing Orders basis. I was informed-I have no doubt quite accurately-that currently the Speaker does not have the power to bring about such a sub-committee in line with the Standing Orders Committee. Maybe that is one thing the Standing Orders Committee ought to look at. But as long as it is on the agenda for the next meeting, I should have thought that the first step would be to convene the Standing Orders Committee and to move that that be supported. The honourable member for Corio has not seen that as the proper course, for reasons I do not fully understand. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I accept that as a reasonable matter. It does not alter what I said, though, and that is that I think what ought to happen is that the Standing Orders Committee ought to decide in favour of it, and if it does that it is a matter of action by the Government to bring it down. Maybe that is the way it will go anyway.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another matter that I ought to refer to is that under the current structures of the Fraser Government the very people from the Government side who are on the Standing Orders Committee-I think the member for Corio or his colleague suggested they were probably the proper people-are experienced people who ought to be members of that standing committee and are, of course, the ones with the least time. I am not refering to the leaders of the House; I am referring to people such as myself who, under this system, have very little surplus time. I ponder upon whether we need another standing committee. I am concerned that there are now so many committees when one considers the party committee system as well. This causes a sort of mental constipation to occur within the system, and it is very difficult for people who are very busy on a wide variety of committee structures to get the sort of dynamism and result which I think the honourable member for Corio has in mind. </PARA>
<PARA> Those are my current views. I do not hold the view that the honourable member for Corio is doing anything he should not. I do not hold the view that there is no room at all for a standing committee on procedures; there might well be. But I point to the structural problems in having more and more committees. In contradistinction to the growth in the number of members of State Houses of parliament, both upper houses and lower, over a 20-year period, the number of members of this House has gone down by one and gone up by one in the 17 years I have been a member of parliament. It may well be that to mount committees properly with competent people we need more federal members of parliament. I think that time will come. I hesitate to speak without a great deal of thought on this problem and to give complete carte blanche agreement to the proposition of the honourable member for Corio. To bring it down now might not do justice to the system that the honourable member for Corio wants to adopt. To do it justice it must be mounted by experienced people who have a sense of history and a knowledge of how the committees function. We are asking the busiest people in Parliament to take part in yet another standing committee to be set up on a long term basis. I repeat: The argument must be about the proper check and balance on the Executive by Parliament itself. That is what it is about. If we are to argue that, as I think we should-it should be discussed-let us be consistent and give support to the other structures, such as the Estimates committees, that this Parliament so badly needs if it is to adopt its proper responsibility in checking the actions of an Executive. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that everybody in the House appreciates the interest of the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) on matters such as this and the valuable role he has played in looking at the structure of Parliament and making Parliament more effective. I thank him for moving the motion. I think a number of the honourable members who served on the committee which examined these matters-the Joint Committee on the Parliamentary Committee System-in fact involved themselves more closely with the operation of committees of the Parliament both in the Senate and in the House of Representatives. That was an extremely valuable committee which came forward with a number of recommendations many of which have been adopted over a period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The proposition being put by the honourable member for Corio is, indeed, an extension, as I understand it, of the work that was done by that committee on committees, as it was called. The report of the committee on committees, in fact, made recommendations on a number of important areas but I think the most significant ones related to the scrutiny of government activity by the Parliament. That scrutiny process, in fact, devoted itself to mainly financial matters, budgetary decisions, the decisions of government lending up to the Budget and the general administration of government. It also devoted itself at some length of the proposition of legislation committees. </PARA>
<PARA> Those two recommendations, whilst not completely in the form recommended by the committee on committees, have been adopted. They were pursued by a number of people. I remember the work of the honourable member for Scullin (Dr Jenkins) in this regard. In particular I remember the way in which the honourable member for Moore (Mr Hyde) followed through, in fact, to bring into place some of these ideas. Much of the work was developed privately within the ranks of the Australian Labor Party and also within the ranks of the coalition. We came to a concensus and, in fact, established legislation committees which have not been used in this Parliament as yet. But I hope that they will be used because I found the discussion and the effectiveness of legislation committees, whether they be for complicated legislation or for simple run-of-the-mill provisions that can be dealt with quickly--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Dr Jenkins" NAMEID="XF7">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XF7">Dr Jenkins</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very valuable.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SD4">Mr CADMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very valuable indeed. In fact, we have been able to allow members to examine and scrutinise legislation with care and proper attention to detail. That has resulted in more effective and better legislaion and in better laws being made for this country. The other element that has been taken up by the House has been the decision that we should establish committees that look at the Estimates in the Budget. The honourable member for Moore was particularly keen to pursue this matter. The House has adopted for the last two years the process of Estimates committees. I personally see value in that process. I think those committees will continue or not continue depending on the value that is seen for them by members of this House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The matter that has been raised by the honourable member for Corio, however, goes beyond that point. The motion that he has moved seeks to establish a committee to maintain a continuing surveillance of the practices and procedures of the House of Representatives with a view to making recommendations which could enhance the role of the House and its operational efficiency. My colleague the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Giles), I think, put a compelling case as to why part of those activities should be, in fact, put to the Standing Orders Committee. The establishment of that committee is set out in our Standing Orders. Its role in fact should be to look at the functioning of this House and to enhance the role of the House through amendments to Standing Orders procedures. My view is that these matters should best be dealt with in the way that we have been dealing with them. </PARA>
<PARA> Parliamentary reform and the efficiency and the enhancement of the operations of the House of Representatives have occupied the time and the minds of many people, mostly unsuccessfully. One individual seeking to bring about reform or change has a very difficult problem in convincing his colleagues that his ideas can be successfully adopted. But a number of individuals working together have been successful in having the Parliament look at a change to sitting hours. That has occupied the minds of parliamentarians on many occasions. Experiments have been tried; some have failed. In fact, they mostly have failed. But we are about to launch into an experiment for a change of sitting hours. I believe that a committee of the type envisaged by the honourable member for Corio would suffer the same difficulties that an individual suffers because one would have a group of dedicated enthusiastic individuals who would spend all of their time convincing their colleagues of the wisdom of their recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> There is great reluctance in many ways to change the manner in which we operate here in these chambers. It is difficult to do that. There are vested interests perhaps, with each individual having his own vested interest in the style of life that he has here, in the requirements of the chamber and in the requirements of the Parliament. I suggest that further consideration be given to this proposal so that, in fact, the basic thrust of the matter can be taken up to see whether it be by means of Standing Orders committees, whether it be by agreement between the parties or individuals to pursue certain matters with their colleagues, or whether it would be practical to extend the scope of the Standing Orders Committee of the House of Representatives. I am not sure whether this will meet the needs and the requests of the honourable member for Corio. </PARA>
<PARA> I see merit in what the honourable member has proposed. I see obstruction in bringing it to achievement with any real success. I think we all know that in order to have enthusiastic membership of committees of this Parliament there needs to be some sense of fulfilment. There is not enthusiastic acclamation, I would think, for people to get themselves involved with the proposition of the honourable member. But I think there is interest in achieving the objectives he has laid down. I suggest to the honourable member that, privately and in discussion, a number of us may be able to pursue this matter to see whether we can establish a satisfactory method of working. Within the Government for five years we have had a committee which has worked to seek to establish parliamentary reform. There are a few successes on the board. Those successes are worthy successes. They relate to the factors that I have mentioned-the examination of Estimates and the legislation committees. I would like to see this progress continue because it has been a satisfying part of my time in the Parliament to see changes made. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to conclude on the note that whilst I appreciate the thrust of what has been proposed and the comments made by the honourable member, I think his proposition to establish yet another committee would not meet with the approval of the House at large. But the objectives should be something in the mind of every member. Perhaps other techniques can be adopted to achieve the honourable member's objectives. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In reply-I just want to respond to the debate on this matter. I want to thank all honourable members for the consideration they have given to the matter. I do not believe, as the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Giles) has indicated, it is a satisfactory situation that because the back bench members of the Government are satisfied with the methods by which legislation is considered outside this chamber, this chamber or this Parliament should abrogate its responsibilities as a parliament. Honourable members are, in fact, elected to serve in the Parliament. Whatever other activies they take are consequential on that, not part of it. My motion follows a recommendation of the Joint Committee on the Parliamentary Committee System. It deals with a practice which is adopted in other parliaments. It is highly successful. I believe that it would not become a lobbying exercise or an excercise whereby members seek to impose limited views. I think a broader consideration of matters and their practicality would have to be considered by such a committee otherwise its reputation would suffer. I am sorry that the Government is not prepared to adopt this procedure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I say only one thing. The matters read out by the honourable member for Wakefield are listed for consideration by the Standing Orders Committee. The Speaker has taken the opportunity to list for the Standing Orders Committee a number of matters which are, in fact, on the Notice Paper of this chamber and other matters which have been raised in debate by members in this chamber. The reason the matters are still listed for consideration is because the Standing Orders Committee is a cumbersome committee and its personnel are almost totally unable to deal with any sort of discussion other than in an extremely cursory manner. The matters will stay listed for consideration. If my memory serves me correctly, I think the time taken up by Standing Orders committees in the last three Parliaments would not add up to one working day. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 4 August 1822, in a letter to W. T. Barry, James Madison, who had been the fourth President of the United States, wrote these words:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A popular Government, without popular information, or the means of acquiring it, is but a prologue to a farce or a tragedy, or perhaps both. Knowledge will forever govern ignorance and a people who mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power knowledge gives. </PARA>
<PARA>Those wise words, 160 years old, are really the whole rationale of freedom of information legislation. But the legislation when it came in was a profound disappointment. Certainly, after it was worked over by the Senate it was a great improvement on its original form. It was still not as good, I think, as the American legislation of 1966 as amended in 1974 and certainly not as good as the draft Bill that was prepared by the Australian Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> The long-awaited Freedom of Information Bill should be more accurately described as a 'Public Service Preservation from Disclosure' Bill. It is perhaps better than nothing. There are some guidelines which will enable citizens and organisations to gain access to information in the possession of the Government of the Commonwealth as set out in clause 3 of the Bill by, and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) making available to the public information about the operations of departments and public authorities and, in particular, ensuring that rules and practices affecting members of the public in their dealings with departments and public authorities are readily available to persons affected by those rules and practices; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) creating a general right of access to information in documentary form in the possession of Ministers, departments and public authorities, limited only by exceptions and exemptions necessary for the protection of essential public interests and the private and business affairs of persons in respect of whom information is collected and held by departments and public authorities. </PARA>
<PARA>The tragedy is that the comparative breadth of the first paragraph of clause 3 is really cut back very considerably by the broad exemptions and exceptions created by paragraph (b). As Patrick Cook suggested in the National Times, perhaps the best way that the Bill could be described is as the 'Ask Me No Questions and I Won't Have to Waste Time Lying' Bill or, for those honourable members who follow the television program Yes, Minister, the 'Yes, Minister' Bill. </PARA>

The first question is that of retrospectivity. Originally there was to be no retrospectivity at all, but now there is a degree of qualified retrospectivity in respect of personal files-the capacity to go back and correct errors or omissions that are significant with respect to one's own personal file. The honourable member for Chisholm dismissed any claim for general retrospectivity. 'Why,' he said, 'people might be hunting back through files for the past five or 10 years'-as indeed they might. And so they should. I make the point that the United States legislation of 1966, as amended in 1974, does provide for retrospectivity and the result is that it has been possible to go back and to examine a number of very contentious matters on the historical record.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KH4">Mr BARRY JONES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So they ought, as the honourable member for Hawker says. One could just mention very briefly some of the matters that have been raised of very general public concern. The Rosenberg case, for example, was not a very popular case in 1953 and it still arouses a lot of sensitivity in American breasts. But it has become quite clear from the papers derived from the Rosenberg file that whatever the guilt or innocence of Julius Rosenberg, one can only say that the case against Ethel Rosenberg was absolutely threadbare-conceded in prosecution files-and that essentially her conviction was sought because it was thought it would apply additional pressure on her husband to speak. But there was not even a prima facie case against her. Whatever one's view of the Cold War there has been a general concession that United States justice did not operate correctly in her case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One might argue that the Ethel Rosenberg revelation indicates a weakness in the United States judicial system, but I think, to the contrary, it shows strength when it is prepared to make files available even in a case as sensitive as that one. The United States in fact has not suffered from these revelations. If we consider the case of Alger Hiss, we find very serious weaknesses in the prosecution case. It is quite clear from the Federal Bureau of Investigation files that very significant information was withheld from the prosecution case. If it had been put to the jury in the way that Australian prosecutors put a broad case to the jury-that is, not just a narrow and segmented case-it is difficult to see that Hiss would have been convicted. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of the assassination of President Kennedy, it is now patent on the basis of documentation brought out by the freedom of information legislation that there were grave deficiencies in the way that the Warren Commission operated, although the final conclusion reached by the Warren Commission may well be correct. What one can say pretty safely is that one could not safely reach that judgment on the basis of the evidence that the committee looked at. There may be other factors that have to be taken into account as well. We know a great deal more about the operation of the United States Government than we do about our own Government, partly because of the access to the documents related to the Watergate affair. We know a lot more about the relationship of the Mafia and government agencies and, most significantly, because there are no exemptions granted in the United states freedom of information legislation, we know, and the United States citizens know, far more about the operations of the Central Intelligence Agency or the Federal Bureau of Investigation than we do about the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation or the Australian Security Intelligence Service or the Office of National Assessments. </PARA>

<PARA> There are a whole number of issues, some of them historical, that one would like to know about in Australia. One of these, for example, would be the relationship of the Armed Forces and the civilian government in Australia during World War II-an issue I have raised before-to find out more about that potentially explosive situation where the Army was executing significant numbers of New Guineans, at least a hundred at the last count, without telling the Australian Government and also going to some pains to keep the Australian Government of the day from knowing. Another very contentious question concerns how it was that we got into the Vietnam War. Clearly, the whole question of the documentation-what contact there was with the United States Government and with the Government of the Republic of Vietnam-is of the greatest importance. And so it ought to be of the greatest importance. We have a right to know as citizens. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. In the list of exempt agencies about which no information can be provided are the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories Commission, the Health Insurance Commission, the Office of National Assessments, the Pipeline Authority and, as I said earlier, ASIS and ASIO. We have to ask why it is possible for the United States to grant access under freedom of information legislation to documents of the FBI and the CIA when it is impossible for us to have the same right. Why is the whole issue of security so much more sensitive in Australia than it is in the United States?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Agencies are also to be exempt in respect of particular documents. For example, we will not be able to ask for information about the Australian Broadcasting Commission in relation to its program material. Can anyone advance any rational reason why that should be the case? Further, we will not be able to ask the Special Broadcasting Service about its program material. I refer to a case that has been brought to my attention. The ABC, for its own peculiar reasons, has declined to buy the British Broadcasting Corporation's recent three-part television dramatisation of Dostoevski's Crime and Punishment. I would like to know the reason. No doubt, if as a member of parliament I ask the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair) I will get an answer sometime in the dim, distant future. If a citizen asked for this information under the freedom of information legislation, he would be told: 'We cannot give you that information. The ABC is exempt'. Why? In the United States citizens would get such information. It is quite absurd. The same situation applies to the Australian Dried Fruits Corporation in relation to documents in respect of its competitive commercial activities. Why should it be so secret? Why should citizens not know? In the United States freedom of information legislation, agencies are prima facie included. In Australia the legislation is drawn so that the more sensitive agencies are prima facie excluded. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of costs was raised last night by the honourable member for Chisholm, who is not with us at the moment. He argued that if we tried to draw the legislation too widely we might find that the costs would be prohibitive. I draw attention to some material that the Parliamentary Library has been able to obtain about the actual cost of running the United States freedom of information system. The original legislation was passed in 1966 in the time of President Johnson. In 1974 during the Watergate period it was very much expanded. The most recent figure for the total cost of running the freedom of information operation in the United States was cited by Allen Weinstein, a historian who would be well known to the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Coleman). He wrote in the New York Times Magazine:</PARA>
<PARA> In 1978, according to the Department of Defense, its agencies processed over 56,466 requests at a cost of $6 million, and fees collected from FOIA requesters covered only a small portion of the expense. </PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member for Wentworth will not be surprised to learn that Professor Weinstein is an opponent of the freedom of information legislation. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> This 'shortfall' affects all Government departments and agencies. In 1977, for example-</PARA>
<PARA>Here is the total figure-</PARA>
<PARA> FIOA users' fees amounted to $1.36m, less than 4 percent of the estimated $35m it cost the Federal Government to comply with the Act. </PARA>
<PARA>The United States has a population 14 times that of Australia. The United States Freedom of Information Act is much wider than ours. Some of the areas which have had the largest number of requests have been the Department of Defence, the CIA and the FBI. In 1977 the total cost was $US35m. It seems to me that that figure would be the equivalent in Australia of about $2.5m on a pro rata basis, taking population only into account. Considering that our legislation is so much narrower in its scope, that it does not cover sensitive areas and that it is so much easier to get an exemption than it is in the United States, one might assume that the costs would, in fact, be considerably less than $2.5m in 1977 money values. I would estimate that even on the most generous estimate freedom of information would cost about $3m or perhaps a little more here. Another factor that has to be taken into account is that Australians are far less aggressive than Americans and far less likely to want to find out the truth. They do not show any passionate curiosity. That is obvious when we look at honourable members on the other side of the House. They have no very passionate concern or great zeal to find out the truth. The total outlays in this year's Budget, including permanent and special appropriations, are just over $40,000m. Even if the cost of operating under the freedom of information legislation were as high as $4m-I do not think it would be; it would be considerably less-it would represent only 0.001 per cent of the total Budget allocation. We have to ask ourselves whether that is too much for finding out what is going on in government and to have the right to be fully informed. Clearly, this Government does not like that idea and has done the absolute bare minimum in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some major deficiencies in the legislation, some of which we will raise by way of amendments. We are also told that after 12 months or so there will be a review of the legislation. Two points need to be made in addition to our amendments. They are two fundamental issues of principle which will have to be looked at in the future and which make the United States Act worthwhile. Firstly, we have to be able to impose penalties directed at specific offices and officers. The real problem that often occurs when a person comes up against the bureaucratic maze is that he is not given a flat refusal. The officers do not say: 'No, you cannot have the file'. They say: 'Look, we had the file a few days ago but somebody else is using it. Come back next week'. When the person comes back the next week they say: 'We are terribly sorry. It had to go somewhere else. Perhaps if you come back next week you will get it'. A person is often not refused absolutely; he is just fooled around with. </PARA>
<PARA> The United States legislation provides that it is possible to go to a court and request it to impose a monetary penalty on an officer or a section of the access office which is procrastinating in a way that is unreasonable. Of course, an applicant has the onus of proof to prove that the officer is unreasonable in his procrastination, but it is an effective deterrent. The other factor is the provision of indices. The provision of a fine grained index is extremely important. Let me read what the legislation says. I do not regard this as adequate. Clause 8 states:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) The responsible Minister of an agency shall-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) cause to be published, as soon as practicable . . . a statement setting out particulars of the organization . . . particulars of any arrangements that exist for bodies or persons outside the Commonwealth administration to participate . . . a statement of the categories of documents that are maintained in the possession of the agency . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It seems to me that the sheer setting out of a bland statement of heads of categories does not tell us enough. If a layman or an organisation which is not particularly skilled is trying to look for particular information, it is very easy to be snowed. There may be very valuable information in a document but the document may be of such imposing length and complexity that one does not know where to look. It is a matter of absolute necessity that there be an adequate fine grained index. Of course, with the computerised facilities available to the Government it should be possible for that to be provided very easily. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not doubt that the whole democratic system is under very serious challenge. We have an enormously powerful Public Service in Australia and the Parliament, relatively speaking, is losing its place in the sun under this Government. I think freedom of information is a very powerful instrument that can strengthen the hand of the Australian voter, and if we have a more informed electorate we should have a better Parliament. I vividly recall, as you do, Mr Deputy Speaker, the Berthelsen case when we sat on the Privileges Committee of this House. It became patently clear that many senior public servants despised their Ministers. They downgrade and disregard the Parliament, members of which they outrank and outearn, and they feel that the electorate should be left in the dark. The attitude expressed so vividly in the British Broadcasting Corporation's television series Yes, Minister in which a hapless Minister has rings run round him by his wily permanent head is as accurate for the Australian scene as it is a faithful representation of what happens in Great Britain. I conclude as I began by re-reading those words of Madison which are the whole justification, the whole rationale:</PARA>
<PARA> A popular Government, without popular information, or the means of acquiring it, is but a prologue to a farce or a tragedy or perhaps both. Knowledge will forever govern ignorance--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Freedom of Information Bill. The Bill is an important initiative of the Government of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). I wish strongly to applaud the fact that after a long period of gestation since the proposal for freedom of information was first advanced by spokesmen for the Australian Labor Party when it was in Opposition prior to its last being in government, the first Freedom of Information Bill introduced to any Parliament in Australia was a Bill introduced by the Government of Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser. It ought to be applauded because it was a very fine initiative and a very worthwhile reform of which Australians have every right to be proud. I admit that there might well be scope for argument about the clauses of the Bill. One might want to discuss the extent to which the Act, when it is in operation, ought to apply to particular departments and particular statutory authorities, and the manner in which we ought to apply the legislation to those authorities. But the fact is that this is a unique and admirable initiative of the Government of today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The legislation was first proposed by the Labor Party when it was in Opposition. When it came to power in 1972 it did not come into the Parliament with a Bill of its own ready to proceed. It referred the matter first to an interdepartmental committee. We saw its first report in 1974. After the change of government in 1975 there was a further report from the interdepartmental committee and later we saw legislation in a draft form introduced into the Senate. It was the subject of consideration by a standing committee of the Senate. The Bill was the subject of reconsideration by the Government and the present Bill, in another form, was introduced into the Senate, was amended and has now reached this chamber. It comes here after contributions from the Opposition as well as from the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I made those comments because I regard this Bill as a very worthwhile reform which one might hope would be discussed in this place in a bipartisan spirit. I was, therefore, exceedingly disappointed to hear the speech of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) when he spoke on behalf of the Opposition on this matter. He was most grudging in whatever praise he had to offer in relation to the Bill and had some most uncomplimentary remarks to make about the Fraser Government. I must say that I could not let the moment pass without having a look at the Labor Party's record, which I propose to do. I think its record gives its members every reason to hang their heads in shame. I would not have done this except for the sorts of comments made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. I quote from the House of Representatives Hansard of 18 August, page 44. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> However, the Attorney-General was overridden by a very dominant Cabinet with a most dominant Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) who appears to be obsessed with secrecy. We will deal with some of these matters as we go through some of the amendments later in the week. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen the Government somewhat obsessed with secrecy. </PARA>
<PARA>I would suggest that members of the Labor Party hang their heads in shame when they listen to their Government's record on these matters, notwithstanding their rhetoric before 1972. On page 45 Mr Bowen was reported to have said:</PARA>
<PARA> There is also no doubt that many Ministers, including the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) are very wary of allowing the public to know much at all. </PARA>
<PARA>He says that is so notwithstanding the fact that the only Bill introduced into an Australian Parliament to give freedom of information was introduced by this Government, and notwithstanding that the Labor Party had three years in office after having promised in its policy speech to introduce legislation to give effect to freedom of information. I must say that I was somewhat alert to the fact that members of the Labor Party had an interest in this matter. There was a book written by a gentleman by the name of Spigelman. An Inside Dopester's Index of 100 Examples of Secrecy was included in that book by Mr Spigelman, his book being entitled Secrecy-Political Censorship in Australia. In relation to those 100 examples of secrecy I sought information from the then Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam. I asked him to specify which of those 100 items were not publicly disclosed up until 1972, how many of those items had been made publicly available since he took office and, if all of them were not readily available, what the reason was for the continuing secrecy in each case. I think that was a fair question to ask. There were 100 examples and I expected him to do a little work in relation to those matters which he had spoken of and which his private secretary had written so much of when the Labor Party was in Opposition. The then Prime Minister had the following remarks to make when he answered my question. They were published in the House of Representatives Hansard of 15 December 1974. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>I am, of course, aware of the book to which the honourable member refers. The author is now my Principal Private Secretary and I did most of the research for the book. </PARA>
<PARA> With respect to the items listed in this index and the many other examples of secrecy of which my Government became aware on assuming office, the honourable member would be aware that most are of historical interest only. </PARA>
<PARA>What an excuse to offer. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> On 2 April 1973, I wrote to all Ministers suggesting that they exercise their discretion on items of current interest and in cases of doubt should await the criteria for release of documents in the proposed Freedom of Information Act. </PARA>
<PARA>How convenient! He never introduced it. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> I believe a number of documents were released in 1973. If the honourable member is interested in any of the particular documents, I suggest he ask the Minister responsible. </PARA>
<PARA>That prompted my asking 100 questions of each of the Ministers in relation to each of the documents. Honourable members may be interested to know the results of those inquiries because they involve some prominent front benchers of the Opposition today and many prominent Ministers in the Labor Party at the time. I will take honourable members through a few of them. Mr Barnard, as Deputy Prime Minister, refused to make available the report of an independent firm of consultants on community attitudes to Service careers. Mr Barnard refused to make available a report on tests of anti-corrosive coatings carried out by the Central Testing and Research Laboratories. Mr Barnard refused to make available an interdepartmental study of housing problems of the Services. Mr Barnard refused to make public a report on the Defence Services Flying Training Program. Mr Barnard refused to make public the Morshead report on Army structure. Mr Barnard refused to make public the Hasett committee report on Army reorganisation. Mr Barnard refused to make public the reports on the proposed tri-Service academy. Mr Barnard refused to make public the report of the Commonwealth Paint Committee's tests on household paints. Mr Barnard refused to make public the submissions on the proposed Army base in Western Australia. Mr Barnard refused to make public the report of the court of inquiry on RAAF Laverton. Mr Barnard refused to make public the administrative directive on the responsibilities of the Department of Defence. Mr Barnard refused to make public details of the Defence Standards Laboratories consumer tests. Mr Barnard refused to make public the review of civilian substitution in the armed services. He refused to make public advice and analysis concerning the reintroduction of conscription. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Whitlam also was involved in some refusals. Mr Whitlam refused to make public the statistics on Public Service applicants rejected on security grounds. Mr Whitlam refused to make public records of the Commonwealth-State Ministers' official meetings. One could go on. Mr Hayden refused to make public the interdepartmental report on the state of the economy, also referred to by Mr Spigelman. Mr Charles Jones refused to make public the report of the Department of Civil Aviation on Electra aircraft noise levels on the ground that specific noise considerations were not mentioned in the report and were not in a suitable form for public release. Mr Charles Jones refused to make public the report on Sydney's second airport. Mr Connor refused to make public the blueprint for national resources. I could go on. There were others by Mr Enderby, some by Dr Cass and some by Dr Patterson, all of whom were Ministers in the previous Labor Administration. </PARA>
<PARA> I regard those refusals as very important examples of the way in which members of the Labor Party when in office dealt with these important items of secrecy upon which they base their campaign. I suggest to honourable members that their campaign was based upon a deceit, because they were not prepared, when they had to look at these matters coolly, as one might have expected from them when they were in office, to publish them. If they were not prepared to publish those items, what justification did Mr Spigelman have for his Inside Dopesters Guide for which Mr Whitlam did most of the research? Quite frankly, if we look at the comments of some honourable members of the Opposition and previous members of the Opposition we find that there were good reasons for the decisions that they took when they were in government. Perhaps those decisions were justified, but I believe that it would be fair to say that the Government that in the first place withheld those documents which were identified by the Opposition was also justified in withholding them in the manner in which it did if the Labor Party was not prepared to release them itself when it came to office and had the opportunity to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Peter Rae asked a similar question to mine in the Senate. He asked all Ministers what reports and documents the then Labor Government had prepared but had not publicly released. I think that was a pertinent question for a member of the Senate, who was interested in the Labor Party's record on freedom of information when it was in office, to ask. I believe that Mr Whitlam's answer, given through Senator Wriedt in the other place, was interesting. Members of the Opposition might well be interested in the answer he gave. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> It would be clearly impractical to identify every unpublished document produced by or for the Government and I am not prepared to authorise the expenditure, time and effort which would be involved in attempting to do so. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> In my answer on 13 May 1975, (House of Representatives Hansard, page 2198)-</PARA>
<PARA>That was in answer to the question that I had asked-</PARA>
<PARA> I pointed out that my Government's record in relation to the release of information, in contrast to that of its predecessors, has been outstanding. I draw honourable senator's attention to illustrations I give in that answer of the Government's performance in this area. </PARA>
<PARA>I come to the answer that the then Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, gave me. It is most illuminating to learn what Mr Whitlam, when he was in office, thought that the public was entitled to know. I will paraphrase to a degree but I do not think it will destroy the content of the answer that was given. I shall quote from page 2198 of House of Representatives Hansard of 13 May 1975. Mr Whitlam said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is committed to the principle of open government and will continue to honour that commitment. </PARA>
<PARA>Nobody could object to that. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> My Government has made public details of its decisions; . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Well, fancy that! I would be most surprised if any government refused, on the basis of secrecy, to announce its decisions. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>it has set up a large number of Committees, Commissions, etc. of inquiry before which interested members of the public have been able to put their views-and the reports of which are being progressively released; I have provided the Parliament each half-year with a detailed account of the Government's activities; . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Having sat in this place and listened to the way in which he harangued us about the Government's performance and its record, I know exactly what he meant when he said that. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>the Australian Government Liaison Service has been instituted to provide ready access to official government information and an abstract of government decision, legislation and Ministerial statements and speeches is regularly published in the Australian Government Weekly Digest. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the Government propaganda arm with which we were all so familiar. The foregoing was Mr Whitlam's idea of freedom of information. It was to set up a mechanism by which the Government could propogate those decisions about which it wanted the public to know and to enable it to do so in the most efficient way with the taxpayers' support. As I have said, I did not want to be political in this debate. I decided to introduce this material only in a straightforward--</PARA>

One would think that he would also have an interest in freedom of information, perhaps the same sort of interest that Mr Whitlam, the then Prime Minister, had demonstrated. One would have thought that, having been so critical of the then McMahon Government and its predecessor governments, when he was in Opposition, he would have been quite prepared to unlock all those secrets which his party had condemned the former governments for failing to disclose. But the fact of the matter is that Mr Hayden, then the Treasurer, was no different from the rest. He thanked me for my letter of 4 June which I had addressed to the Australian Loan Council concerning the confidentiality of the proceedings of the Council. That was one of the items that Mr Spigelman had so carefully selected. Mr Hayden's reply stated:</PARA>
<PARA> I have noted that in the first paragraph of your letter you draw on a reply dated 13 May 1975 given to you by my predecessor, in response to your question upon notice No. 2253. </PARA>
<PARA> Regarding the question of the confidentiality of Loan Council proceedings the facts are as stated in the answer to that question. The Loan Council, as constituted under the Financial Agreement, comprises members of all State Governments as well as the Australian Government, and all decisions taken by the Council, including those regarding the confidentiality of its proceedings and records are binding on all members. </PARA>
<PARA>Well, fancy that! They were binding on Mr Hayden as well, even though he suggested, I assume along with his colleagues who were so committed to freedom of information, that they should be published. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> It is not open to the Australian Government member or the Secretary to provide information in regard to them. It would therefore be inappropriate for me to provide further information except to say that all decisions on these aspects have been carefully observed during the period that members of the present Government have participated in proceedings of the Council. </PARA>
<PARA>I think it has to be observed that oppositions seem to have one standard when they are in Opposition and one standard when they are in government. I would say that that was very plainly demonstrated by the Labor Party's performance. I hope that some honourable members opposite will have regard to the comments of their colleagues in considering these matters and recognise that perhaps there are cases which, if they were faced with the facts and the information, were in office and had to make decisions, they would wish to consider very carefully before they made them public. I hope that they will settle down to review this legislation essentially in a bipartisan way, looking at what might properly be made available, whichever party is in office. I believe that then we will have much better legislation, legislation which is worthy of support. I can assure honourable members opposite that I am prepared to examine such legislation and to look at their proposals in that way. I hope that they will stop the acrimony that was evidenced by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in relation to this matter and debate it in good faith. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a matter of great regret that on this occasion the Parliament is considering legislation which is so clearly deficient in terms of the objectives that it purports to have. The concern about this legislation is not exclusively with the Opposition. In fact, the Opposition finds itself in a position where it shares this concern with very wide sections of the Australian community whose objectivity, fairness and concern could not be impugned. It is surprising to hear statements of the kind that have just been made by the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock). His honesty in connection with this question will be determined when this House considers the amendments that will be moved and which have been foreshadowed by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen). At this time it will not be sufficient for the honourable member for Dundas to claim that the Opposition took a political stand on this because the amendments will commend themselves. At the time we will see the way in which the honourable member for Dundas, with all of his high sounding concern about this issue, responds to sensible and desirable amendments which will be moved by the Opposition. The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner) in his second reading speech said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The crucial element in drafting the Freedom of Information Bill has been to strike the appropriate balance between openness and confidentiality. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition does not quibble with a statement of that kind. Despite the fact that such a significant proportion of the total time of the honourable member for Dundas was used in listing examples of Labor Ministers who, for very legitimate reasons, chose not to make public some documents, I am firmly convinced that the question of adequate balance between those two conflicting objectives in relation to legislation of this kind and to which the Minister made reference has, to a disproportionate degree, come down in favour of confidentiality. I am not surprised that the list that the honourable member for Dundas read out contained a greater number of reports that were not made public by Mr Barnard when he was Minister for Defence. That is the situation we would expect to find. It is certainly not the claim of the Opposition, any other section of the Australian community or any individual that the issues of government can be carried out in a goldfish bowl. No such claim has been made and no such claim is being made in connection with our consideration of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The omissions of this legislation indicate quite clearly that the Government, which has been responsible for formulating it, is suspicious of the Australian people. It is suspicious of the Australian electors, fearful of open Government and feels threatened by public access to information. If it were possible for us to have full community participation in democratic decision-making that would probably be the most desirable form of democracy we could have. The practical difficulties of that, of course, preclude it. We have settled for an alternative which involves representatives of the community taking the responsibility for making those decisions. There is no concern on our part that legislation of this kind would or could in any way damage the essential nature of that decision-making process. The contrary applies. If details of the legislation were more effective, legislation of this kind would strengthen the operation of democratic government. </PARA>
<PARA> I emphasise, particularly to Government members, that they, like Opposition members, should realise that the question of freedom of information in connection with government operations-the operation of departments, bureaucrats and public authorities-is not a question for debate between the Opposition and the Government. In fact, it is a question of whether the Parliament will assert its authority over the bureaucracy and over the Executive and whether the Parliament-Opposition and Government-will ensure that people within the Australian community will have reasonable, ready and simple access to documents which are not matters of vital national security. </PARA>
<PARA> The Deputy Leader of the Opposition emphasised our concern about the exclusions in this legislation and the wording of some of the provisions of this legislation. He has already foreshadowed the fact that the Opposition will be moving amendments. If there are any Liberal democrats or any democratic Liberals on the Government side someone from the Government side will need to support the amendments that will be moved. If, in fact, no member on the Government side chooses to support those amendments, the political nature of this debate and the political nature of the decision which will follow it will not be of the making of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> It is probably as well, because reference was made to the role of the Australian Labor Party when it was in government in relation to this legislation and in consideration of this particular issue, to have a look at the background to the situation that we now find ourselves in. Certainly before the election in 1972 the then Leader of the Opposition who became Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, promised open government. In 1974 while the Australian Labor Party was in government the first interdepartmental committee, which was appointed to investigate the provisions which could be involved in freedom of information legislation, delivered its first report. A subsequent report was delivered by the second interdepartmental investigation in 1976. In 1978 the first legislation was introduced. Certainly the Government and honourable members speaking for the Goverment have attempted to claim some credit for that legislation. It was suggested that members of the Opposition should hang their heads in shame. The same thing could be said about the Government in relation to the 1978 legislation. The attitude towards that legislation was reflected by all responsible thinking persons in Australia. It was a shameful piece of legislation. It was an apology for freedom of information and, in fact, it was referred to as a Bill which was designed to ensure freedom from information. That legislation, on the motion of an Opposition senator, Senator John Button, was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. That Committee produced a unanimous report recommending major changes in the Bill. The total number of recommendations made by that Committee was 93. This legislation we are considering now in no way accommodates all of the major matters of concern that were raised and decided unanimously by that Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> In a ministerial statement in 1980 Senator Durack rejected most of the recommendations despite the fact that senators on his side of the Parliament were parties to the unanimous decision that was made and the unanimous recommendations which that report brought forward. From 1972 until now-and probably into the future-the parallel furrows that have been made by the dragging heels of those reluctant bureaucrats can be traced from one stage of the development in connection with this legislation to the next. The people who have resisted freedom of information have been the bureaucrats. The results of the two interdepartmental inquiries reflected very unfavourably on the extent to which the bureaucracy will go to ensure that the community does not have access to information which is vital to it. </PARA>
<PARA> For all the high sounding platitudes of the honourable member for Dundas, the simple fact remains that some of the most significant and valuable features of this legislation would not be here had it not been for the fact that Government senators crossed the floor in relation to some amendments and threatened to do so in relation to other proposals had the legislation not been changed. Those senators were Senator Alan Missen, Senator Kathy Martin, Senator Chris Puplick, Senator Neville Bonner and Senator David Hamer. They joined the Australian Democrats and the Opposition in voting for the amendments. The result was, of course, that, even after the legislation had been introduced in the Senate, it was withdrawn and redrafted. No claim can be made that the Government has been enthusiastic about ensuring that adequate safeguards and adequate provisions would be included in this legislation. In fact the contrary has been the case. </PARA>
<PARA> Ministers have, in consort with the bureaucracy, attempted at all stages to make sure that this legislation will be less effective than it should be and less effective than it might otherwise have been. That is the reason why the Parliament must assert its authority not only over the bureaucracy but also over the Executive and the Executive arm of Government. I include as the major component of the Executive arm of Government Ministers of the Government. One of the most important changes which resulted from that revolt in the Senate was the establishment of the Document Review Tribunal to review the conclusive certificates given to exempt documents. Of course the provisions in that respect certainly do not go far enough. But, of those changes that were introduced, certainly that was the most important and did overcome some of the reservations that existed in relation to the original legislation. The provisions for the correction of personal records that go back five years was another very important change introduced into the legislation. The Opposition certainly supports not only those changes but also others which have a less significant character. Changes were introduced also to ensure improvements in the mechanical means by which accessibility to documents would be facilitated. For example the indexing of documents was another desirable change and there were some relatively minor changes in the exemptions. One of the most disturbing aspects was that when the legislation was reintroduced in the Senate not only had there been some improvements built into it but also were additional exemptions for documents written into the legislation, which had not been considered in the 1978 legislation, and which had proved to be so insufficient that it was thrown out and reconsidered completely. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government resisted other well founded and desirable changes that were proposed by the Opposition in relation to such matters as the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman, the time limitation, prior documents, personal records and the exemption list. In relation to this legislation, I emphasise the fact that the Opposition, as I have said, does not find itself alone in its concern. For example, the Sydney Morning Herald in an editorial on 1 June this year in relation to this legislation stated:</PARA>
<PARA> On the whole, the Federal Government's Freedom of Information Bill, in the amended form in which it will go through the Senate this week, is probably better than nothing-but not much better. It cannot be greeted with enthusiasm, in spite of the many concessions-some of them fairly important, most of them minor-made by the Government in response to sustained pressure from critical senators, especially five dissatisfied Liberals. These five, in the words of Labor and Australian Democrat spokesmen, now seem to have capitulated to counterpressure from the Government, or to have done a deal with it. </PARA>
<PARA>They are not my words; they are the words of a responsible, national newspaper. Certainly that newspaper does not act as a spokesman for the Labor Party. If anyone is going to suggest that the Labor Party is conjuring up concern about the deficiencies in this legislation he needs only to refer to editorials of that kind and other types of comments that have been made by other individuals and interest groups within the community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I could not have written a better editorial myself. There is one example that I will make particular reference to because it indicates better than any other example with which I am familiar the excessive secrecy, the obsession with secrecy, the fear of freedom of information which has accompanied decisions of this Government. I refer to the attempt by the Government to ensure that the book Documents on Australian Defence and Foreign Policy 1968-1975 would not be published, would not be distributed, would not be sold or be made available to the Australian people. That attempt on the part of the Government was defeated as it should have been defeated, but it was not defeated until the matter went before the court. Mr Justice Mason described the contents of that book, about which the Government had been so obsessive and so determined in its attempt to prevent publication, in these terms:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The book sets out a large number of Government documents. The book does not contain technical information of military significance; it does not deal with weaponry, armaments, military technology, logistical information or dispositions of forces. It is not affected by the 'D' Notice procedures. Even the two documents referred to in the ex parte injunction contain no material of value to a hostile power.The appreciations made of Australia's strategic situation and the outlook in South-East Asia are based on information which is generally known. The judgments made are fairly elementary and they are now quite out of date. </PARA>
<PARA>Will we ever forget the attempt that was made by the Government on that occasion to frustrate the endeavour on the part of the publishers of that book to publish it and make it available to the Australian people? If that is not obsession with secrecy, I would need to be shown a better example. </PARA>
<PARA> I also quote a statement from the evidence of Mr Henderson, the Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs, in that case. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it is much more likely to facilitate our future relations if the Government has been seen to try its utmost to prevent that (disclosure) happening. </PARA>
<PARA>In fact it appears that the attempt was made to frustrate the publication of that book because of the Government's concern about its relationship with its powerful friends. The Sydney Morning Herald states:</PARA>
<PARA> This led to a suggestion, as Mr Justice Mason noted, that the Government acted as it did merely to demonstrate its bona fides to foreign Governments. If that is well founded-and Mr Henderson's evidence seems to bear no other construction-then the Government's philosophy would seem to be: Keep our foreign friends happy-even if this can be done only by taking away Australian freedoms. Popularity at any price. </PARA>
<PARA> I will quote from another editorial of the Sydney Morning Herald because I find the writer of these editorials a very comfortable bedmate in relation to this question. I refer to an editorial of 3 December 1980 which relates to an attempt by the Government to prevent publication of the book Documents on Australian Defence and Foreign Policy 1968-75. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government acted in haste, if not panic, with a demonstrable lack of political nous. It acted to preserve not security but face and the convenience of ministers and public servants. And in acting it ignored from habit, if not arrogance, the principle affirmed by Mr Justice Mason, that against one kind of public interest, the confidentiality of government processes, there has to be weighed another, the need for the public to be fully informed of the actions of those who govern them. </PARA>
<PARA>The whole purpose of having effective freedom of information legislation is to ensure that the processes of democratic government are strengthened, that the decisions mady by the bureaucracy which impinge so much on the lives of ordinary Australian people will be open to public scrutiny and that the electorate will have the opportunity to determine the nature of the evidence upon which decisions are made and the nature of the decisions that are made and then make some sensible and balanced judgment about the adequacy of those decisions and the purposes that those decisions are designed to fulfil. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has been some years since the introduction of freedom of information legislation was proposed and there is no escaping the fact that the Government has taken a long time to present legislation which seems to find acceptance in both chambers of the Parliament. I suppose that if one looked back upon the years that the matter has been before the House, one could count on one hand the number of letters that one has received demanding that this legislation be implemented. The public interest would probably be best typified by saying that there are only three people in the Speaker's Gallery of this chamber tonight. When one looks at the Press gallery one sees that there is one lone reporter there who is probably wondering what she has done wrong to be sentenced to cover the debate on the Freedom of Information Bill. It is a matter which is of limited interest. I compliment the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Robert Brown) for having such deep compassion on a subject which seems to pass unnoticed by the vast majority of the community. I know, of course, that some people in some areas have had a vital interest in this subject, but there is no escaping the fact that they have been in a teeny-weeny minority overall. As a member of the Government side, I suppose it would be expected that I would be here this evening supporting the Bill in toto.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate that compliment. Perhaps during the next election campaign the honourable member might care to stand on my platform and tell the people of my electorate just that. I am quite sure that with the earthiness of the honourable member for Hunter, at the next election I would sweep home with a larger majority than even I would have predicted. Whilst this Bill may be seen to have some shortcomings and indeed whilst some senators of the Liberal Party of Australia and the National Country Party may have some difficulty in accepting the legislation in its final form, I ask whether all members of the Parliament recognise that at least we have made steps forward. As far back as the early 1970s, while I was an external student of the University of Queensland and a member of Parliament, I was doing an assignment for the University on this very subject of freedom of information as it existed in the United States. I remember my heart beating fast and thinking how wonderful it would be. That was a decade ago. Those feelings in terms of reasonable access to reasonable information have not abated. However, I believe that honourable members on both sides of the chamber should concede that there is some information which is of a very vital nature and which, if the Government were to believe that it was to become public property the day after, would result in the functions of government suffering. We should be prepared to accept that this legislation goes a long way further than anything we have had before. We should also accept that in the years ahead after the nation has had an opportunity to assess the legislation there will be further chances to amend the legislation if it is found to be necessary and if it is found to have the shortcomings that honourable members on the other side of the chamber are predicting. Indeed, they share a view which is shared even by some members of my own party in the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to make some criticism of the Bill in terms of the various schedules where exemptions exist. I refer particularly to Part 1 of Schedule 2, which classifies exempt agencies. As all honourable members know, Schedule 1 sets out the courts and tribunals which are exempt in respect of non-administrative matters. In Schedule 2 there is a Part I and a Part II, and Part II classifies the agencies exempt in respect of particular documents. It is my view that the Government has been over sensitive in terms of classifying some agencies in Part 1 of Schedule 2. In regard to the Australian Secret Intelligence Service and, indeed, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, I have absolutely no argument with the need for the operations of those two organisations to remain private and confidential. The responsible Minister is fully aware of what is going on, and indeed the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) at times is consulted and informed as to the events and happenings in those organisations. But I turn to some other agencies which have been given total exemption. When we give an agency total exemption we are saying that its operations are so vital to the security of the nation that we must expose nothing and that it must all be kept secret. Alternatively, what the Government might be saying when we consider some of the other organisations is that it has forebodings in terms of some of the activities of these organisations becoming known publicly. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already said that I completely accept that some agencies deserve exemption in terms of certain aspects of their operations, but let me read through this list of organisations which fall within the same classification as ASIO and the Australian Secret Intelligence Service. I shall refer to them alphabetically. They are: The Aboriginal Lands Councils and Lands Trusts; the Auditor-General; the Australian Industry Development Corporation; the Australian National Airlines Commission; the Australian National Railways Commission; the Australian Overseas Projects Corporation; and the Australian Shipping Commission. The next is the Canberra Commercial Development Authority. We must be careful there! The next ones are the Commonwealth Banking Corporation-it is perhaps a legitimate item in terms of the commercial operations of these entities-the Commonwealth Trading Bank; the Commonwealth Savings Bank; and the Commonwealth Development Bank. The next one is the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories Commission. Nothing of its activities must be known by anybody. </PARA>
<PARA> In Schedule 2, Part I, listed just under ASIO, are the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation and the Health Insurance Commission. What a wonderful opportunity that presents to me! I did not even realise that it was in it. During the recess I had the audacity to make criticisms of the Health Insurance Commission over its operations in the financial year 1979-80 which were nearly a bomber. It lost millions of dollars in Queensland and millions of dollars in New South Wales. In Tasmania it lost $600,000-odd. All that saved the Commission in Australia was a profit of $8m in Victoria where it is probably ripping off the people. </PARA>
<PARA> I had a solicitor's telegram stating that if I did not withdraw my observations I would be subjected to legal threat. Now, a grievance debate is on tomorrow. I had intended to keep this matter for tomorrow. This is only phase one of what I have in store for tomorrow. That weenie, measly organisation threatened me in a telegram. To defend myself, to prove that I was right, would have eaten up a thousand times my salary increase that was recently granted. Yet, we give the Health Insurance Commission total exemption. I did not realise that I was to be given the opportunity to become so emotionally involved in this argument tonight. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, they intimidated me. We will hear more about that in the grievance debate tomorrow when I will have a time to grieve. The Government has given this organisation an exemption. I wonder how many thousands of dollars that organisation spends in legal fees every time somebody has a poke at it or questions its activities. But the organisation is to be written into Schedule 2, Part I of the Freedom of Information Bill. I go on to the rest of the exempt agencies: The Housing Loans Insurance Corporation, the National Debt Commission, the National Labour Consultative Council, the Office of National Assessments, the Pipeline Authority, the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation and the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust. All those organisations I have just alluded to are in the same classification as the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and the Australian Secret Intelligence Service. How reactionary can we be? Whilst I concede that there may be aspects of the operations of those organisations which because of various reasons should not be open to public scrutiny as closely as this Bill makes so many other areas of Government, I believe that they should be in the second part of Schedule 2.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Lest it be said that this is the first occasion on which I have expressed that view I say that I expressed it in the Party room when this matter was before the combined joint parties some months ago. I wish that I had realised prior to my rising to speak tonight that the Health Insurance Commission had been included in Schedule 2. I might have made my speech even more powerful than the one I have delivered. Nevertheless, all that aside, I believe that this Bill is a new concept in this country. Australia has not exactly been fast at gripping the nettle. At long last we have something with which to experiment and something to observe. I earnestly hope that if this Bill has the shortcomings that honourable members on both sides of the chamber have predicted as possible, the Government will at least make amendments in line with the changes which can safely be brought about. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I make this plea concerning the Health Insurance Commission. Indeed, I might even go away and word an amendment to this Bill to delete that organisation from the special section of the schedule. When an organisation resorts to intimidation and threats to a member, I wonder what it has to hide. I wonder whether its activities are as inefficient as I believe. I conclude by drawing to the attention of the House the fact that the cost of administering the Government's health insurance scheme is double or even three times more than that of the private health schemes. It is quite fair to observe that there is a grave possibility that the Health Insurance Commission is bedridden with inefficiency. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I agree, That is the point. I think he really had nothing to say about the Freedom of Information Bill because, in fact, he is very worried about it. One of the problems with conservative governments is the fact that basically they do not believe in divulging information. The present Government, without doubt the most conservative Federal Government since Federation, is no exception. Because members of this Government do not really believe in freedom of information they have produced a Bill which is full of exemptions and obstacles designed to block the attempts of persons wishing to investigate the activities of government. What is more, despite protests from Opposition members in the Senate, the Government pushed the concluding stages of the debate through on the last day of sitting of the autumn session because it knew that this most unsatisfactory piece of legislation would not be approved by the Senate after 1 July.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I find it particularly objectionable that the Bill lists in two schedules a number of agencies and documents which are exempt from the requirements of the Bill. I note that the honourable member for Chisholm (Mr Harris) in his speech yesterday also indicated his concern about certain organisations that were exempt. The honourable member for Fadden (Mr Donald Cameron) also in a very brilliant speech which he gave a little while ago referred to certain organisations.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have given the right answer, I think. What justification can there be, for example, for a cloak of secrecy over the activities of the Aboriginal Land Councils and Land Trusts or the National Labour Consultative Council? They are two of the agencies listed in Part 1. No doubt the two classes of people against whom this Government appears to harbour its greatest hostility, namely, the Aboriginals and trade unionists would also like to have that question answered. There are also a number of other bodies included in Part 1. This makes a mockery of the contention by government members that people have the right to know what is being done by government. Whilst it can be argued that there is a need to avoid the disclosure of military information it is of great concern to me and should be a great worry to all freedom loving Australians that the Australian Secret Intelligence Service and the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation are granted complete exemption. The activities of these organisations have frequently been the subject of complaint by many individuals, occasionally even members of this House.</PARA></TALK.START>

The allegation was accompanied by a request for an inquiry on the incident, particularly in view of the fact that no inquest had been held on the three deaths. It should be possible for a serious allegation of this nature to be investigated so that members of the public can feel satisfied that our security agencies are working in the best interests of Australians. It should also be possible in the case of the Hilton bombing to examine the substance of the documents which led to ASIO being granted far greater investigatory powers only three weeks after the bombing incident. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is why the matter needs to be cleared up. There can be no justification for such secrecy. I submit that exempting these bodies in such a blanket way means that innocent people can be harassed, browbeaten or even lose their lives as a result of the ignorant and bigoted activities of officials without redress for the individuals concerned or for their families. Another matter which concerns me is the fact that clause 24 of the Bill gives the agency concerned, or the relevant Minister, the power to refuse to grant access to documents on the grounds that the resources of the agency are insufficient to deal with the request without interfering with its normal work. In effect, almost any request for substantial information could be refused on those grounds. It would appear that this clause has been inserted to ensure that any such request which may prove embarrassing to an agency or a Minister can be denied for seemingly innocuous administrative and financial reasons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As has been indicated by other critics of this Bill, the Government is not really interested in open government. On the contrary it has shown itself to be obsessed with secrecy. I call on the Government to withdraw this most dishonest piece of legislation and to give honourable members on this side of the House the opportunity to incorporate amendments which will make this Bill a real vehicle for freedom of information. I repeat what was said in the Sun Herald on 12 April 1981 by Peter Robinson:</PARA>
<PARA> A much dirtier trick has been the so-called freedom of information bill which, like so much legislation in South Africa, has a practical effect diametrically opposed to what is suggested by its title. </PARA>
<PARA>At present the title is a mockery and the provisions will permanently enshrine the present lack of access of the public to the operations of government departments and public authorities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The speech made by the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Donald Cameron) following earlier in the evening the speech made by the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) was, by comparison, a breath of fresh air. The honourable member for Dundas seemed to have the view that it was not possible for a member of Parliament to be pleased that a certain advance be made in a piece of legislation like this without, at the same time, being obliged to form, with his colleagues, some sort of Greek chorus to chant approval of it in every detail or have some set of Barnum and Bailey claqueurs to dance at the back of the show to make sure that the general approval, in all circumstances, was expressed. He was also extremely churlish in his treatment of the record of the Whitlam Government and of the Australian Labor Party on freedom of information questions, this particular legislation and the general question of open government. I do not think there could be any doubt at all that the argument could be sustained that the Whitlam Government's record in office was a dramatic advance in openness on anything that had preceded it since 1949. It is a dramatic improvement and the honourable member's treatment of that was quite churlish.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Dundas then proceeded to go through a list of documents allegedly withheld from the public by the Whitlam Government. I listened fairly carefully to that list but I very much doubt whether one of the items on it would be permitted unfettered disclosure under the terms of the Feedom of Information Bill. If he really is that enthusiastic about the particular items covered in that list and the fact that they ought to be readily available to the public, I look forward to his appearance on this side of the House when we move amendments to that effect later this week. He was quite churlish about the record of the Whitlam Government and its association with this Freedom of Information Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not go into it in detail but I refer honourable members to the report on freedom of information by the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. At pages 5 and 6 of the report, the Committee points out quite emphatically that the Labor Party was the first major political party in Australia to commit itself to freedom of information legislation. The Labor Party set up an interdepartmental committee. It needs to be remembered that a majority of Government senators are members of this committee. It was conceded by that majority of Government senators that that committee laid the foundations for the initial efforts of this Government in the freedom of information legislation in 1978. It must also be said that the Whitlam Government was only three years in office. This Government has been in office for six years, and it has had all the advantages of having the groundwork laid by the Labor Government, but it has taken it six years to bring this legislation before the House. I submit that the Labor Party's record on this amply stands in comparison with the record of the Government. It stands particularly in comparison as we look at particular aspects of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a Bill with many unsatisfactory features, some of which we shall attempt to deal with at the Committee stage. When it was initially presented to the Senate earlier this year the Bill entailed only 20 of the 71 recommendations for a freedom of information Bill that would be compatible with Australia's procedures, Constitution and tradition, made by the Senate Standing Committee which examined the matter in 1978-79. It was a Senate Standing Committee with a Government majority. The Senate amendments have picked up only a few omissions. Many omissions which continue to be ignored are quite critical to the Bill's effectiveness. Most of these omissions appear to be at their most glaring in Part IV of the Bill. I intend to deal with that later. </PARA>
<PARA> I now wish to address myself to the matters of principle which the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner) considered in his speech yesterday. As this debate proceeded over a number of years, a line of argument has been produced by Ministers, by sections of the Public Service and by the Queensland Government, in particular, in submissions to the Standing Committee, that this legislation is incompatible with the Westminster system by which we are governed. I still think that some of the trepidation on the other side of the House in supporting the amendments that we will put forward at a later stage is based on similar misconceptions about the operations of the Westminster system as expressed by the Minister. In the course of the debate what is essentially a vague set of governing principles, when compared at least with those based on written constitutions extensively separating executive, legislative and judicial functions, has in this debate assumed a positively mystical aspect. It has inspired definitions of processes which those of us who are supposed to be at the core of the Westminster system in Parliament would find unrecognisable when applied to practice. The Minister has taken the trouble to define the Westminster process in such a manner. He has done so implicitly to excuse the Government's failures to implement substantially some very well thought out recommendations by the Senate Committee and by a number of public interest groups and to justify a vague promise to review the operation of the Act some years in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister's speech, as a lesson in primary school civics, has its merits. Here it is laughable. The Minister invites us to consider the relationship of Ministers to Parliament as an example of information dissemination-he went on about this at some length-which obviates the need for more stringent open government legislation. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> In this regard it is significant that Ministers are subject to questioning in Parliament on matters within their ministerial responsibility both without notice and upon notice by members of the Parliament. By second reading speeches on Bills, by their participation in debates, and by making of ministerial statements Ministers also give much information about government activity directly to Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>He could have fooled me. This is a fine statement of theory. It does not take very long in this chamber to recognise that what takes place in this chamber during the processes that the Minister describes, except on the least controversial of matters, is a vigorous stoking of the boilers to lay the thickest possible smokescreen over most aspects of government decision-making. The evasive answer is admired by government supporters. Frankness provokes dismay. Paroxysms of delight ripple through Government ranks when a pointed, information-seeking opposition question draws a raving irrelevant ministerial counter-attack chock full of appropriate ideological red meat. Standing Orders enshrine a Minister's right not to answer questions. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole process of a lack of information reminds me of what happened to an old friend of mine, Tom Hartrey, who was a former member for the State seat of Kalgoorlie in Western Australia. He was deputed by the citizens of Kalgoorlie who were then boycotting the pubs in Kalgoorlie to investigate reasons for a beer price rise in Perth. Tom Hartrey went down to investigate the reasons for a beer price rise and subsequently reported back to his thirsty constituents. He said to them on that occasion: 'Ladies and gentlemen, I have been to the Premier to find an answer to the problem that we confront. I have been to the Government to find an answer to the problem that we confront. I have been to the breweries to find an answer to the problem that we confront. I have even been to the Opposition to find an answer to the problem that we confront. I have been everywhere but never has alcohol been so anonymous'. I would suggest that this is precisely the sort of problem that we find ourselves confronted with at Question Time. Never is any aspect of government activity more anonymous than it is when it finally hits this House in the processes so beloved of the Minister in justifying his position on what is supposed to be open government. </PARA>
<PARA> The basis of democracy is not responsible government, separation of powers or any other constitutional formula or legislative administrative process. They are tools to create the possibility of an orderly life and the advancement of democratic principles. The basis of democracy is that each individual in society has a right to determine how he or she is collectively governed. Implicit in this is a right of access to information on how decisions are made that directly and indirectly affect our lives. Proper freedom of information legislation would address those questions effectively. </PARA>
<PARA> The Westminster system of government as a model is not only vague but also fluid. It changes through time. It exists and its institutions exist in a dialectical relationship with society and are modified in their practice by social change. This process is usually cumulative and imperceptible so that Ministers who rely on textbook formulas may indeed not perceive changes though they are in fact obliged to act on them. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us take the question of ministerial responsibility. Westminster theory suggests a process of decision-making which moves from Public Service to Minister to Cabinet and then of explanation from Cabinet to Minister to Parliament to public. The Minister is responsible for his Department to the Cabinet, Parliament and the public. It is many years since this paradigm actually reflected reality. Ministers will not and cannot accept responsibility for all aspects of their Department's operations. How often have honourable members heard Ministers qualify answers to questions posed by the public or in this House with a statement that to the Minister's knowledge, such and such an answer is correct. How often in recent times have Ministers resigned when their inability to exercise fully control of their departments has been exposed? Indeed, in the area of national security policy, largely excluded from this legislation, Ministers have positively wallowed-historically anyway in Australia-in their irresponsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> One former Liberal Prime Minister and Minister for Defence was pleased to say about one of the joint US-Australian installations under his direct jurisdiction:</PARA>
<PARA> I don't even know what Pine Gap is all about. I didn't then-</PARA>
<PARA>That was in 1969-</PARA>
<PARA> I could have asked but it didn't arise. I didn't ask about it. </PARA>
<PARA>More recently, the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen), who is an ornament to this House and one of the last vocal defenders of the doctrine of ministerial responsibility, was compelled to reveal considerable ignorance of the operations of his Department several years ago when he discovered from a reading of the Press, a significant upgrading of the North West Cape facility. Ministers cannot be expected to be so fully in command of the departments because the areas of government responsibility have expanded so massively since the nineteenth century when most contemporary definitions of the doctrine of ministerial responsibility were devised. </PARA>
<PARA> That is not a plea for small government. It is a vital argument for effective freedom of information type legislation as an aid to continued application of democratic principles in a modern industrial society. It is ironic that it is the democratic socialists in this House who are obliged on this legislation, as they are in so many other cases, to carry the liberal case for the rest of the Parliament, as I suggest we did strongly in the senate and as we are doing in this debate in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to one part of the Bill which I think is most unsatisfactory and that is Part IV dealing with exempt documents in particular areas of government responsibility. Almost all the 15 exemptions leave unclear the criteria on which documents will be available to the public. The lack of clarity foreshadows heavy usage of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Document Review Tribunal. In particular, I would like to discuss clause 33 dealing with questions affecting national security, defence, international relations and relations between the States. In the first place, it is positively ludicrous that communications between State and Commonwealth governments should be given the same exemption as documents involving national security. I do realise that conservative parties thrive on the prospect of a return to pre-1901 constitutional arrangements. But it would be nice if they kept that strictly to statements of principle rather than incorporating it in their legislation. State conservative governments in particular are obsessive about secrecy and that is one of the major reasons why I suggest that they had this particular section added to clause 33. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to it in a minute. The Queensland Government, for example, has already said that it will not abide by the decisions of the Freedom of Information Act and that it will do everything in its power to preclude correspondence it has from the Federal Government on it. Recently, in Western Australia, some of us were involved in an exercise to try to screw out of the Western Australian Government some information on the materials it had put before the Grants Commission when presenting the Western Australian case. Since the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Coleman) is so interested in the New South Wales Government and its relationship with its public, I point out that the New South Wales public had a chance 12 months previously to look at their Government's submission to the Grants Commission. The New South Wales Government did not make it a closed document. But the Western Australian Government obsessively gripped the document to its heart and would not reveal a single detail of it to the public. So we were obliged to read through the Grants Commission report and make some sort of assessment of the type of case that the Western Australian Government put to the Commission. One can only say from the results that the case that the Western Australian Government put was extremely weak. So it is no wonder--</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So it is no wonder at all that that document has not appeared before us. Evidently also there would be bits and pieces of it that would be extremely embarrassing to the Western Australian Government. For example, for the last two or three weeks or a month or so those of us who are active in politics in Western Australia have been obliged to watch the dancing across the screen of the Western Australian Minister for Education as he attempts to conceal various aspects of his Department's operations and the reasons for his making heavy cut-backs in that Department. He has gone to the public and said that we can afford these cuts because we have one of the best student-teacher ratios in Australia. Yet when we go to the Grants Commission documents we discover that a case was made two or three months previously by the Western Australian Government in which it pleaded for extra funds because it said that Western Australians had one of the worst student-teacher ratios in Australia. It is no wonder, therefore, that the Western Australian Government does not want these documents revealed. What a sorry contrast the Western Australian Government is with the Government of New South Wales which includes its people on matters vital to them. And how necessary it is that the Western Australian Government is compelled to face the light of public scrutiny with the sorts of cases it puts forward to the Grants Commission. How sad it is that this Government will not acquiesce to decent amendments to make sure that the Western Australian Government will have to do so in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am concerned about the possibilities of a continuation of excessive secrecy in the foreign affairs and defence field. The Opposition is concerned not because it does not agree that a wide variety of intergovernmental communications, technical defence aspects and Public Service assessments ought not to be placed before the public view. Clearly they must not. We had an appalling case last year when a diplomat serving in India had his position compromised by the premature revelation of quite appropriately frank assessments to his Department of the Indian Government. We are concerned, however, because in this area gross abuses have occurred where secrecy has not been based on national security but on naked political advantage. Recently I was privileged to accompany the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence around the various joint United States-Australian installations. I was interested to see a film which is regularly shown to tourists in Western Australia which connects quite directly the operations of the North West Cape installation with United States submarines. Yet, when the legislation to create the North West Cape installation was introduced in this Parliament in 1963, what any old tourist visiting the North West Cape installation now knows was not given to the Parliament or to the public at that time. A piece of information which was vital to an important foreign affairs debate and which was clearly not a matter of national security was concealed for deliberate political purposes. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. It was an Australian decision, not an American one. This secrecy, particularly when applied to key aspects of the United States alliance, has massively hindered effective public debate on the American alliance and foreign policy and defence issues related to it. This has been despite the fact, or probably because of the fact, that governments have sought to win elections on the issue. We have the ludicrous situation in which any Soviet foreign affairs or defence official or United States congressman is far more likely to know details of many aspects of our relationship with the United States than are Australian parliamentarians and citizens.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The legislation will not make a great deal of difference to this situation. Where the Minister declares under clause 33 that the revelation of a document is not in the public interest there is no provision for overruling his decision. There is a provision whereby documents may be reviewed by a Document Review Tribunal but acceptance of the decisions of the tribunal on the classification placed on particular documents will not be binding on Ministers. We would much prefer a situation such as that which obtains in the United States whereby judicial review can overturn the security classification given to a particular document. The operation of the United States Act in this area provides us with a very useful insight into what the operation of such a system would be here. About 40,000 documents annually are sought from the United States Department of Defense by interested parties. Most of those documents are released. As to those which the Department wishes not to be released, the courts have been very restrained in compelling it to do so. They are loath, as they should be, to overturn a decision which the Department strongly supports. But as the moment of court action nears in the United States, the Department tends to review its classifications and release very substantial amounts of the material without a fight in court, revealing that the material to that point has been overclassified. </PARA>
<PARA> As the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) pointed out, this occurs not only in the Department of Defense and the Department of State but also in much more security conscious departments, such as the Central Intelligence Agency. We ask for nothing more in this legislation than the same rights as are enjoyed by United States citizens, a nation so rightly beloved of honourable members opposite. We invite them to give the Australian public those rights. We will invite them to do that through the legislation we will put forward. We invite them to act like liberals and not people solely devoted to the possession of power, recognising that information is part of power, and wishing to preclude not only us but also the general Australian public from it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Freedom of Information Bill is significant for two reasons. First of all, the Bill is significant in its own right. It is also significant because the debate on it has been one of those occasions-regrettably they are rare occasions-when the Parliament has exercised its powers and authority to bring about significant improvement in legislation before it. During the last session of Parliament we debated this Bill, the Broadcasting and Television Amendment Bill and the Airlines Agreement Bills. On those three occasions the Parliament exercised more influence than it has been wont to do for many years. That is significant in itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I come to the Bill. It is useless for the Opposition to decry the Bill and say that it has no significance because it does not do everything that it wishes. The point is that it will improve the democratic processes of this country. For that reason, it is to be supported. Perhaps in time in the light of experience we will make further amendments. Perhaps the government of the day will do so. But let us support this Bill for the time being. Let us use it for the time being. I will endeavour to demonstrate to the House that it will make a significant contribution. Perhaps this Bill would be less necessary if we did not have so much public sector intervention in private lives. In fact if we had less to be informed about maybe we would need the access to information less. It is government's capacity to interfere in the life and freedom of each citizen that makes this sort of democratic process necessary. We ought to think also about curtailing the over-interference of government in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to quote briefly from the second reading speech of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner). He said:</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will establish for members of the public legally enforceable rights of access to information in documentary form held by Ministers and government agencies except where an overriding interest may require confidentiality to be maintained. </PARA>
<PARA> The basic principles of the Freedom of Information Bill are simple. Firstly, government departments and authorities should make their structures and functions known to the public and publish the rules and guidelines they apply in making decisions affecting members of the public. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, members of the public are entitled to access to documents held by government departments and authorities unless there are special reasons for not making those documents public. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a very good sentiment and I support it. Just to indicate to the House that my support has not come lately, because I wish to use the Bill and the freedom it will give me, I will quote again quite briefly from one of my speeches. On an earlier occasion I said:</PARA>
<PARA> And when the Government assumes it is a better judge of individual welfare than are the consumer and producer working it out between them-consider taxi regulations, airlines, shopping hours-then it ought to say how that it is so, which is a reason why most free marketeers favour open government. </PARA>
<PARA>I just quote that to establish my credibility in this matter. I invite the House to consider a case study which will demonstrate that this Bill has relevance to the process of government and will in fact be useful. It will be known to honourable members that the jet trunk air routes in Australia are in the hands of two companies-Ansett Airlines of Australia and Trans Australia Airlines-and that these companies operate a duopoly that is to all intents and purposes a monopoly. They are protected from competition and are denied the opportunity to compete with each other except in respect of such relatively unimportant matters as hostesses' uniforms and meals. They are not able to compete with each other on any of the important things such as the price of travel and capacity loading of the aircraft. Even the aircraft they buy have to be approved by the Minister for Transport. There is no reasonable market to discipline these two bodies that provide so much service and disservice to the Australian people. There is no market that will work. The report of the Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Airfares-the Holcroft report-made it quite clear that there was unlikely to be a functional market. In a letter to the Minister for Transport the Holcroft committee said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Ansett however proved far more spontaneous and the delay in settling the basis of agreement to supply information hampered the Inquiries' operations. </PARA>
<PARA>It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> As the Department of Transport is the regulatory authority for domestic airfares determination in Australia we also found it quite unhelpful that its submission was not received until 10 December, that is, some two weeks after the government had already moved to curtail the Inquiry. This made it impracticable to examine the Department in public hearing. Nor was any written submission received from the Bureau of Transport Economics. </PARA>
<PARA>It seems that the people who regulated this section of Australian economic life were less than forthcoming even when there was a government inquiry charged with the job of finding out what they were up to. The Holcroft inquiry at paragraph 1.56 of its report, said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Inquiry feels that progressive deregulation of all but safety requirements is the preferred solution. </PARA>
<PARA>The point is that the Holcroft inquiry did not believe, whatever happened, that the regulated environment could be made to work properly. It did not believe that a proper market discipline could be applied to these two airlines. The relevance of that point is that in the absence of a market discipline, the only other discipline available is the democratic discipline of complete disclosure. When the Holcroft inquiry reported the Government was not happy with the findings and it appointed Price Waterhouse to make a further inquiry. Price Waterhouse recently reported and came down with a quite radically different formula, but it also agreed that the regulated environment was not likely to work very well. I quote again, this time from the Price Waterhouse report:</PARA>
<PARA> A formula which provides a reasonable return to one airline could provide the other with an inadequate profit. </PARA>
<PARA>I remind honourable members that in a 12 month period air fares on these routes have risen by 16.7 per cent, a great deal more than the inflation rate, and that those fare increases have been justified from cost. There may be little doubt that the costs were actually incurred, but the relevant questions are whether the costs should have been incurred and whether there was waste and unnecessary featherbedding. However, there is a difference. Price Waterhouse reported its formula and sent it to the Government under separate cover in secret. Unlike the Holcroft formula, the Price Waterhouse formula is secret. Those of us who have been interested in this issue and who have called for deregulation are prepared to accept any reasonable formula. We want an unfettered and free environment, but if we are going to have a regulated environment and we cannot achieve a free environment we will accept a reasonable formula. However, it is necessary that all those calculations be made public or no member of the public should be expected to accept them, particularly when there is such prima facie evidence that it is all inefficient. An increase of 16.7 per cent is a very big increase for one 12-month period. The freedom of information legislation will enable me, other members of this House and all other members of the public to gain access to that fodemocratic discipline where this 'free enterprise' Government has not applied a market discipline. I intend to demonstrate that not from the Bill but from the explanatory memorandum because I believe that is easier to follow, at least for non-lawyers. I read from the explanatory memorandum:</PARA>
<PARA> Clause 51 places the onus of establishing that a decision given in respect of a request was justified on the agency or Minister to whom the request was made. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the onus is on the Minister if he refuses to provide documented evidence. If he does not co-operate, he must then demonstrate that he had a reason not to. I will read again from the explanatory memorandum:</PARA>
<PARA> Sub-clause 22(1) accordingly provides that where it is possible and reasonably practicable to prepare a copy of the document with the exempt matter deleted, and the copy document so prepared is not thereby rendered misleading, the applicant shall be given access to such a copy . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, if the Minister is able to delete sufficient material from the document so that it does not disclose the information that he is entitled to hold back, he is obliged to provide the rest. The onus is on the Minister to provide the document in as full a form as he can but there are certain areas in relation to which he can hold back information. The explanatory memorandum states:</PARA>
<PARA> Sub-clause 43 (1) provides that a document is exempt if its disclosure would disclose trade secrets or other information having a commercial value where the commercial value of that information would be diminished or destroyed by that disclosure. The sub-clause would also make exempt a document which contains information concerning the business or professional affairs of a person or the business, commercial or financial affairs of an organisation or undertaking where the disclosure of that information would unreasonably affect adversely the person, organisation or undertaking in respect of the lawful conduct of his or its business etc. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Sub-clause 43 (3) makes it clear that the protection of commercial privacy given by the clause extends to commercial undertakings carried on by the Commonwealth, a State or the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA>However, as it is a regulated duopoly and as the profits of the organisation are guaranteed I do not believe that any information that could be disclosed could possibly be claimed to prejudice the organisation. The Minister must provide a document on request for information. Should he not do so the onus is on him to demonstrate that he is entitled under some clause of the Bill to withhold that information. The Government has commissioned a submission to be presented to it. Price Waterhouse has submitted in secret and yet, as I read the terms of this legislation, once the Bill becomes law the Government will not have the power to withhold the secret formula that has been put forward by Price Waterhouse. I believe that will make it easier for all those members of this House and those members of the public who have a genuine interest in this issue to argue their case, to look at the relevant information and, if necessary, to apply the proper democratic disciplines to the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I understood originally that when Price Waterhouse was to report it was to report publicly. In fact, I understood that all information was to be made public and that the democratic disciplines were to be applied in the absence of the market disciplines. This piece of legislation gives the Parliament and the public the opportunity to ensure that that does, in fact, happen. Mr Deputy Speaker, I have merely taken you and the House through a case study but I believe I have demonstrated that this is useful legislation, that it will contribute to the democratic processes in Australia and that it should be supported. </PARA>

<PARA> I write to seek your help and assistance if possible in obtaining some form of relief from the situation my wife and myself find ourselves in. </PARA>
<PARA> On 28 November 1979 we purchased our first home in Noble Park. The home we bought cost $52,000 of which we had saved a deposit of $14,000 leaving a balance of $38,000. We borrowed the $38,000 from the Commonwealth Savings Bank at 9.5 per cent interest at a repayment of $340 per month which we could just manage. The following details outline the incredible turn of events since that time:</PARA>
<PARA> 17.2.80 Initial repayment $340 per month for only four months 9.5 per cent</PARA>
<PARA> Then to $354 per month for only 3 months 10 per cent</PARA>
<PARA> Then to $366 per month for only 5 months 10.5 per cent</PARA>
<PARA> 17.2.81 Then to $393 per month-current rate 11.5 per cent</PARA>
<PARA> Obviously an increase of $53 per month is way beyond our wildest expectations and has us wondering where it will end. The disturbing thing is that all these increases took place in the period of 12 months. We now have to consider whether it is worth staying in our own home or selling up and moving back into a flat or some other rented accommodation. What has happened in the first 12 months of our loan's term has horrified us. </PARA>
<PARA> We now ask you the following questions:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Is there any form of lower interest loan available to us?</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Is there any chance of consideration being given to granting us a home savings grant? (The maximum value of the house being purchased was lifted after we bought our home). </PARA>
<PARA> 3. Is it likely that interest rates will continue to rise and force people out of their homes?</PARA>
<PARA>After making 12 payments for a total of $4,252.00 we have just received a letter from the Commonwealth Bank telling us we now owe only $37,916.57 out of the original amount of $38,000 i.e. we have paid off the princely sum of $83.43 in 12 months-what an achievement!!</PARA>
<PARA> I am a clerk Class 5 with Australia Post, my wife has not been employed until 2 weeks ago when she commenced work on a temporary basis as a typist because of necessity. We have an 11 year old daughter who is going to high school and now comes home to an empty home which is the one thing we did not want. </PARA>
<PARA> We would appreciate any advice you can offer or help you can give to overcome our problem. We really feel strongly that we are entitled to a home savings grant and hope you can arrange for us to receive same. If there is no form of low interest loan available (surely there is some form of Government finance loan at a reasonable rate-even if it covered only a portion of our total loan) maybe there are some Liberal MPs who can make a donation to us to alleviate our desperate situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Hoping to hear some good news from you soon. </PARA>
<PARA> Yours faithfully,</PARA>
<PARA>The letter is signed. It then states:</PARA>
<PARA> P.S. We are hoping the worry of this matter will not affect our health as we were forced to cancel our Medibank health insurance on 30.7.80 because the contribution had risen to $27.91 per fortnight. </PARA>
<PARA>In view of repeated answers to questions in this House by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and the Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr McVeigh) stating that higher interest rates are helping Australians to buy their homes, will they get up in this place and answer the questions of my constituent? For their benefit I repeat the questions asked in the letter:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Is there any form of lower interest loan available to us?</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Is it likely that interest rates will continue to rise and force people out of their homes?</PARA>
<PARA>I will be eagerly awaiting the Ministers' answers, especially in view of the fact that since this letter was written interest rates have risen to 12.5 per cent. The family in question now has to pay approximately $420 a months and its plight is even more desperate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During my maiden speech to this House on 26 February 1981 I made reference to sweetheart deals in industrial relations. In fact, I said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These same competitors achieve industrial harmony through sweetheart deals registered through a tame arbitration system. This allows those wage increases to be included in their rise and fall clause of work contracts and so flow on to suffering clients. </PARA>
<PARA>I choose to remind the House of that statement tonight in the light of the present Australian Road Transport Federation-Transport Workers Union dispute. The road transport industry has been under severe pressure from industrial action. That is bad for business. The owners want to get off the hook. The simple and time honoured solution is for them to buy their way out of the situation. Consequently, before and during the recent strike the industry continuously stated its desire and intention to pay its workers $20 a week and to provide some other benefits. However, the Federation also said that it required the increase to be approved by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. It has inferred that it takes this action in support of the arbitration system and the notion of the rule of the umpire. It has further inferred that as it is prepared to pay the court is being obstructive in continuing to refuse to rubber stamp the proposal. It encourages the public to see the Arbitration Commission and the Government as the villains of the piece who are unnecessarily obstructing the worker from being granted a legitimate wage claim. This is hypocrisy in the extreme. </PARA>
<PARA> The facts are that the trucking industry does not want to pay its workers an extra $20 a week plus benefits and, further, it is probably reasonable to say it cannot afford to do so. The trucking industry is trying to get its customers to pay the increase. In many cases this would follow the traditional and meekly accepted policy of announcing a price increase. The dilemma facing the truck owners is that a large amount of their business is conducted under contracts. These contracts have rise and fall clauses which, in the case of wages, are tied to decisions of the arbitration system. If there is no Arbitration Commission approval there is no increase in contract payments. The change that has occurred since I made my statement in February is that the Arbitration Commission apparently has recognised the grave injustice it does the Australian consumer when it rubber stamps sweetheart deals. I congratulate it for its courage and new-found determination. The Australian consumer is where the buck stops being passed. </PARA>
<PARA> Many would argue that the companies that have these large contracts with the trucking firms make large profits and could afford to pay. Unfortunately, their customers, as users of truck freight services, generally deal in consumer goods. They do not have contracts with their clients and can pass on the increased costs at any time. They do so, just as the bread and milk industries, which are direct employers of TWU members, will do so now that they have agreed to pay the increase to TWU members. To overcome the court's resistance, the employer and employee representatives are both now arguing that there has been an increase in work value. To me, an increase in work value infers an increase in productivity. If the productivity increase is equal to the increase in wages there will be no need to pass on cost increases to anyone and the consumer will not suffer. If this is the case, why are the trucking companies so determined to ensure that they can pass on the cost? Irrespective of the evidence now being presented to the Arbitration Commission, the total cost of the wage increase will be passed on. This proves to me that the productivity argument is equally fallacious. The trucking companies are not restricted from paying the wage increase provided they take it from their profits. </PARA>
<PARA> I close by saying to the arbitrators: Please continue to remember your responsibility under section 40 of your Act, the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, which says, in part 'the Commission shall act according to equity, good conscience and the substantial merits of the case'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last Tuesday the House paid tribute to a very personal friend, Fred Temperly. We reached agreement on both sides of the house that there would be only two speakers, and I honoured that. I would like to place on record my personal and sincere thanks to a very kind friend. I have known Fred since I became a member of this Parliament 12 years ago. He has had something like 26 years service in Hansard. He had a lengthy service inside this Parliament and a splendid military record. He has helped not only me personally as a new member but also many members both in this chamber and in the Senate for a variety of reasons and on a variety of problems which all new members face. I sincerely regret the reasons for his resignation. I think they were unfortunate and unnecessary and if appropriate action had been taken I think his resignation could have been avoided.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Fred joined the Department of the Interior in 1939 and was promoted to the Parliamentary Reporting Staff as Clerk and Accountant in April 1955. He was promoted to Assistant Reporter, a designation which changed to Administrative Officer in 1968. He held that position until he retired in July of this year. Fred was an extremely dedicated and diligent officer. He helped everybody who went to him for advice and help with courtesy and kindness. This Parliament has lost a very good officer. The members have lost a very good officer. I speak with a great deal of sadness and regret. I conclude by saying that honourable members, honourable senators and officers of the Parliament who worked with Fred and knew him, as I did personally, found him to be a very courteous, helpful and dedicated officer to the Parliament, the reporting staff and the people with whom he worked. I regret to say that unfortunately he was not appreciated at the level he ought to have been. This Parliament has lost a dedicated officer but fortunately I have not lost a friend. I wish Fred and his wife good health and a long and happy retirement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I want to talk about the functions of the Commonwealth Employment Service and the Department of Social Security in Kiama which is in my electorate. The reason I draw these matters to the attention of the House is that the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West) whose electorate adjoins mine has done me the courtesy of discussing them in the local media with his usual incapacity to report accurately the facts. I advised the honourable member for Cunningham that I would be replying to his comments tonight. I regret that he is not in the House. I note that he is now entering the chamber. I welcome him. It is extraordinary that the honourable member should have found himself capable of discussing the closure of the CES office in Kiama without being able to bring himself to concede the fact that the Department of Social Security had opened an office in Kiama to deal with the very issues and the very subjects that he complained would no longer be dealt with because the CES office had been closed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For the benefit of the honourable member for Cunningham, who may well have been outside both his and my electorate examining matters in the remoter parts of Australia which appear to interest him more than the realities in both our electorates, I advise him that the Commonwealth Employment Service has given up the functions about which he complained. In fact, they are now performed by the Department of Social Security. This is why there is no longer a CES office in Kiama and why the Department of Social Security has opened an office in Kiama to deal with the very problems that, in fact, the honourable member for Cunningham apparently is unaware have been transferred from one department to the other. It may well be that the honourable member for Cunningham simply did not know that, or it could be that he chose to ignore it when making his statements to the local media. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw to the attention of the honourable member for Cunningham the fact that on the first and third Wednesdays of each month the Department of Social Security has a presence in its temporary premises in Kiama-I regret that they are temporary and I think the Department should do something about them-to handle matters relating to unemployment benefits, among other matters, raised by the people of that town. I am advised by the manager of the local social security office that despite the fact there is a big placard outside and despite the publicity generated by the honourable member for Cunningham in my local media during the week, 12 people attended that office today. There is obviously a massive demand for the services of the local social security office. I hope that what the honourable member for Cunningham has done, by his mis-statements, may bring to the attention of many people the fact that this facility is available, rather than the contrary, which is the mistaken public view of the honourable member for Cunningham. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that there is a need for a greater and a more regular presence of the Department of Social Security in Kiama. However, I would point out to the honourable member one simple thing: When the Commonwealth Employment Service was in Kiama it was housed in the only available space, which was up a very sharp flight of stairs. After some discussion with me the Department of Social Security agreed that it would be unreasonable to require pensioners, who use the services of the Department, to walk up those stairs. Ground floor facilities have been established. I hope that those facilities will be more frequently available. It is possible to send matters to the Department of Social Security and CES offices by post. In fact the Department can back-date claims received by post for seven days. So there is no disadvantage to the residents of my electorate by this change of function. The fact that only 12 people managed to turn up to the Department of Social Security clearly indicates--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise in the House tonight the situation in Poland and the need, as I believe it, for the Government to offer substantial assistance at this time to the Polish people. I think there can be no question that the substantial democratic gains made by the Polish people over the last 12 months, largely through industrial activity, are being placed in jeopardy by Poland's economic state. The Polish Government has had considerable trouble in convincing Western banks to re-schedule its debts. Poland has had considerable trouble in securing the amounts it needs from the most immediate Western nations in immediate assistance to feed its people. The problem of the shortage of food is a particular crisis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since World War II the Polish regime has been faced with popular revolt when food supplies are short or when prices substantially increase. In the past this has posed problems of survival for rigid communist regimes. It now poses a problem of survival for the liberalised Polish regime and for the general reforms that have been achieved, largely in an orderly fashion. As it happens, the principal need of the Polish people in foodstuffs is meat and sugar. Meat and sugar are staples of the Polish diet. In this, Poland is different from other nations in central and eastern Europe, where cereals form the basis of the diet. In the Polish case, meat and sugar are the staple diet. As I have said, it is no accident that when there have been shortages of meat or meat prices have risen that has been the point at which the Polish people have found the Government or the system in which they are operating least sustainable. It is no accident therefore that, at this point, the Polish people should be in a state of revolt. </PARA>
<PARA> I am reliably informed that at this time we have in this country reasonable stocks of meat and sugar. We are in a position to offer immediate and substantial aid to the Polish people. The Opposition has raised the Polish question in this House on a number of occasions. The Government has expressed sympathy for the plight of the Polish people. The time has come for people to put their money where their mouths are. In the developments in Poland, we have rightly seen a major advance in democratic principle, a major advance in the rights of people to organise industrially, the right of people to have a say in their own affairs-rights it must be said in regard to which members on the other side of the House do not necessarily offer the same degree of sympathy when they are sought in this country. Nevertheless, members on both sides of the House have welcomed those developments in Poland. Those developments need to be sustained. They can only be sustained if the population is secure in the belief that the governing processes that they have recently established for themselves are capable of delivering to them their basic needs. We all understand that in a period of chaos there will be many areas of dislocation. These areas may continue for some considerable time. We need to be sympathetic to that and to adopt a generous attitude towards it. </PARA>
<PARA> We have made available to the Polish people about $40m in credit for wool sales. In fact that is not a particularly generous offer and I understand it has not yet been taken up, although negotiations are proceeding. We can do a lot better than simply offer the Polish people a guarantee which they will in large measure wish to meet and repay themselves. We can do better than that. I think we need to make an outright grant, not a grant of credits, from our substantial stocks of meat and sugar. </PARA>

The present policy in fact acts as a disincentive for lone parents to join the work force and re-establish themselves as effective contributors to their family's well being. I wish to describe briefly the situations of two of my constituents who have called on me for help. These two women are both supporting parents with two and three children respectively. To augment their widows' pensions, they have obtained employment with a catering firm on a casual basis. This employment requires them to accept particular assignments at very short notice. By dint of accepting any work offered to them, both women have established regular work on a part time basis with this catering firm. This has enabled them to maintain a home and provide some of the requirements of their growing children. However, such employment by its very nature is casual. When the firm has a job, the employee is contacted and expected to take the work. Under these circumstances it is very difficult to average out a weekly income.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Some time may pass with no income at all. As the honourable member for Lilley says, it is impossible. At other times there is a lot of work. The arrival of the annual group certificate then becomes an object of dread for these women. If they are over the acceptable amount, they lose their fringe benefits-a vital security for all pensioners. The fringe benefits scheme, which undoubtedly can be calculated to an amount each week in money, is far more than this to a lone parent. It is security for health care for their children and themselves, their travel and communication and in fact any disaster, which intrudes on their lives, which must be severe because of their lone status.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of necessity, these women must have a telephone so that they may be informed of jobs. They must have a car to travel to these jobs, which frequently involve late night bookings. Under the circumstances of their employment, they are in such a bind that they cannot refuse work or the employment itself will be threatened. But if they do not refuse it they are likely each year to be a few dollars over the allowable income level and thus forfeit their fringe benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> Lone parents such as these are already economically disadvantaged. They still have to pay the same amount for most services and facilities that are available to two-parent families, and are usually more in need of such services as child care, home services and maintenance costs. I suggest that in these circumstances the Government's policy of taxing income which augments a pension is too inflexible. These women are in a situation in which they are virtually forced to refuse work offered by their employer and run the risk of losing their jobs, or must give up the struggle and become totally unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA> Individual millionaires and large companies are able to record massive profits year after year without any additional taxation being paid. Tax avoidance on a grand scale as we know it exists in this country, is out of the question for the recipient of a social service pension, who must face deductions from the pension for every dollar earned over the acceptable limit. I suggest that when a pensioner who brings home $106 a week thereby loses the vital security of fringe benefits our society has lost all compassion. </PARA>
<PARA> As Government members have been quoted in this House as saying, the concept of fairness also implies that tax should be levied according to capacity to pay. I suggest that a single parent with a combined pension-employment income of $106 a week has no capacity to pay income tax, and that the ever impinging threat of loss of fringe benefits is an emotional problem of great intensity for those single parents who are fortunate enough to be able to find some outside, paying employment. I urge the Government to lift the levels of allowable income which may be earned by pensioners without loss of fringe benefits. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I am informed that (a) as at November 1980, 1410 works of art were placed with Federal, State and local government departments and instrumentalities.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes. On 23 March 1979, the Federal Republic of Germany's Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe ruled that the present situation whereby people who renounce their German nationality and live abroad lose their entitlement to a German pension is not in accordance with the basic law of the Federal Republic of Germany.</PARA>
<PARA> The Constitutional Court has now asked the Federal Pensions Office in Berlin to work out a system enabling pensions to be paid to former German citizens abroad. The Pensions Office is at present working on this but cannot say when the system will be in place. It has stated that the proposed system would probably take the form of a pension based on contributions paid within the present borders of the Federal Republic of Germany since 1945, thus not including contributions paid before 1945 in the former German Reich or after 1945 in parts of the Reich not now part of the Federal Republic of Germany for example the German Democratic Republic. Applications for payment of such pensions cannot yet be approved since enabling legislation has not yet been drafted.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr Howard</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) There is a wide range of sources from which finance is made available to rural producers in Australia. Rural producers have access to certain institutions and facilities designed explicitly to provide finance for the rural sector, as well as to sources of finance available to the community more generally.</PARA>
<PARA> For more detail I refer the honourable member to the Bureau of Agricultural Economics (BAE) publication 'A Review of Credit in the Australian Rural Sector (1977)' which gives a comprehensive list of these sources to that time. (See in particular Chapter 4 and Attachment E.) Since that BAE study another institution-the Primary Industry Bank of Australia Limited-has been established to refinance loans made to primary producers by banks and other lenders. Another relevant summary reference is the occasional table 'Estimated Rural Debt to Specified Lenders' published most recently on page 331 of the Reserve Bank Statistical Bulletin for December 1980.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) and (3) Historical data of interest rates charged on term loans, farm development loans and overdrafts by major trading banks and on rural loans by the Commonwealth Development Bank of Australia are produced in Tables EIV and EX on pages 154 and 162 respectively of the BAE publication. The following figures provided by the Reserve Bank of Australia update these records. Loans refinanced by the Primary Industry Bank of Australia Limited currently carry maximum interest rates of 12.0 per cent per annum for loans of less than $100,000 and 13.75 per cent per annum for loans of $100,000 and above.</PARA>

<PARA> (b) Overdrafts drawn under limits of $50,000 and over from 4 February 1972 and $100,000 and over from 1 February 1976 are specifically exempted from the prescribed maximum interest rate requirement.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Since January 1980, all banks have submitted returns as at the second Wednesday of July and January.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) The maximum overdraft rate was raised to 12.5 per cent on 3 December 1980. Banks currently charge a range of rates within that maximum and interest rate concessions are being granted to certain primary producers adversely affected by drought.</PARA>

<PARA> (a) Basic rate for rural loans (the Development Bank also makes 'farm build-up' loans which have generally carried a rate 0.5 percentage points lower than the basic rate).</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The rates quoted are flat rates.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) These rates were increased in December 1980 to 11.50 per cent and in April 1981 to 12.0 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) These rates were increased in December 1980 to 8.75 per cent flat and in April 1981 to 9.0 per cent flat.</PARA>
<PARA> The terms of loans available vary between institutions and types of finance and depend on a number of factors, including, for example, the purpose and size of the loan and the borrower's circumstances. Terms may also be renegotiated in the light of special factors such as drought.</PARA>
<PARA> The Term Loan Fund, established in 1962, initially provided loans for fixed periods varying from 3 to 8 years; this was changed to 3 to 10 years in 1978.</PARA>
<PARA> The Farm Development Loan Fund was establshed in 1966 with a view to facilitating access to medium to long term finance for periods generally ranging from 8 to 12 years. Finance from the Commonwealth Development Bank of Australia is usually made available by way of medium to long term loans repayable over a period suited to the circumstances of each individual borrower; equipment finance is generally for terms of 3 to 4 years. Loans refinanced by the Primary Industry Bank of Australia Ltd are for terms of between 8 to 30 years (currently averaging about 16 years). Loans from other sources would generally be for shorter terms than those provided by the abovementioned institutions.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GH4">Mr Hunt</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The special arrangements made to assist disabled persons can be seperated into two areas. First, programs specifically introduced because of the International Year of Disabled Persons (IYDP) and second, programs focusing on the needs of the disabled but not specifically initiated for IYDP.</PARA>
<PARA> (i) Programs specifically introduced because of IYDP:</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Transport convened a workshop on transport planning and research and the handicapped in March 1981. The workshop enabled the transport planners who attended from all States and Territories to discuss Australian and overseas developments and generally review developments in making land transport services more accessible to the disabled. The workshop will report to the July 1981 meeting of Australian Transport Advisory council (ATAC), and will advise on the need for a common code of practise to meet the transport needs of the disabled.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth undertook to disseminate to all State and Territory Governments results of current initiatives in this area ranging from staff awareness programs, paratransit trials, vehicle restraint research, parking provisions, and low-cost modifications to fixed route systems. As a result of the workshop, the Commonwealth will look at possible ways to encourage greater utilisation of existing fleets of specialised vehicles for the disabled, as well as the possibility of reducing the costs of audio-tactile aids through bulk ordering.</PARA>
<PARA> In February I held a meeting with members of the Australian Council for rehabilitation of the Disabled (ACROD) to discuss problems associated with the use by the disabled of airports and airline services. The agenda covered among other issues, classification of people with disabilities, certificate of fitness for regular air travellers, use of personal wheelchairs on aircraft, use of Row Number One seats in aircraft, adequacy of airport wheelchairs, modification of new aircraft, staff training for the disabled, and responsibility for terminal facilities. As a consequence of the meeting Departmental officers will act as liaison officers between the airlines and ACROD to discuss the issues raised.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department is also preparing a brochure to inform the disabled of facilities and services available to them at all major airports.</PARA>
<PARA> The Office of Road Safety is undertaking a research project on the restraint of the disabled in motor vehicles; the aim of the project being to increase the use of suitable occupant restraints by disabled persons through simple design improvements and propagation of information on 'best practise'. A guidelines booklet may be produced for circulation to hospitals, organisations for the disabled, and parents.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) Programs focusing on the needs of the disabled but not specifically initiated for IYDP:</PARA>
<PARA> Under the Transport Planning and Research program, the Commonwealth has provided financial support to the States for a number of projects related to transport and the disabled. Between 1975 and 1981, Commonwealth support to the States for such projects, which is provided on a dollar for dollar basis, has amounted to almost $100,000.</PARA>
<PARA> New airport design and construction incorporates the requirements of the Australian Standard 1428 of 1977, 'Design Rules for Access by the Disabled'.</PARA>
<PARA> The Office of Road Safety has a continuing responsibility in accident and disability prevention and maintains a public awareness and education program.</PARA>
<PARA> There have been no special arrangements made to assist disabled persons employed in the Department.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (a) Special arrangements made to increase employment of disabled persons in the Department:</PARA>
<PARA> The Department co-operates with the Public Service Board through its Special Placements Scheme. In 1980, six officers-three permanent and three temporary-were placed in Central Office, Canberra, under the program and a further three are employed in the New South Wales Regional Office.</PARA>
<PARA> Victoria/Tasmania Regional Office is participating in a survey initiated by the Regional Director's Office of the Public Service Board, to identify base grade clerical/administrative and keyboard positions which could be suitably staffed by the disabled.</PARA>
<PARA> Since August 1980 a permanent officer, Clerk Class 8, has been given duties covering the Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) area. It is foreshadowed that policy recommendations espousing the EEO philosophy will emanate from this area and have a significant input in to recruitment, selection and personnel development procedures. The employment of the disabled and their needs as employees will come into this area.</PARA>
<PARA> An ancillary function of the Departmental EEO officer has been to co-ordinate activities relating to IYDP. One significant project being planned is an education program directed at staff with the purpose of sensitising staff to an awareness of the disabled, their rights as individuals and citizens, and the causes and prevention of disablement.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (b) Improved access for disabled persons:</PARA>
<PARA> The Department is aware of the needs of the disabled in their use of facilities for which it is responsible. The example given of Departmental adherence to the Australian Standard 1428 of 1977, 'Design Rules for Access by the Disabled', in the construction of airports has in recent years increased access for the disabled in their use of air transport.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department has notified airlines that certain procedures and training in respect to the carriage of handicapped persons are to be adopted. The procedures were introduced from 30 September 1979 and Air Navigation Orders, Sections 20.11 and 20.16 are being amended accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) No budgetary allocations were made in 1980-81 to facilitate any special arrangements for disabled persons working in the Department.</PARA>
<PARA> All projects and programs undertaken either specifically for IYDP, or in consideration to the general needs of the disabled, have been funded within the normal budgetary allocations of the particular Division or Region involved.</PARA>

<PARA> My Department has provided the following information in consulation with the Department of Administrative Services and the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service, on the position as at June 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Fields 22A and 22B remain untouched and the sensitive areas of Field 22B and parts of Murray Hill have been included in a National Park which was declared in 1980. The remainder of Field 22B is not planned for clearing.</PARA>
<PARA> Any clearing in Field 22A is still subject to the outcome of any decisions which may flow from a detailed expert panel appraisal of a survey (1979-80) of Abbotts Booby. Decisions on the expert panel's recommendations are expected before a moratorium which has been placed on the clearing of Field 22A and certain other fields expires on 31 August 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> Sections of Fields 22C, 23A and 23B were selectively cleared between November 1976 and September 1978 in line with plans and procedures agreed between representatives of Government and the British Phosphate Commissioners (BPC) at the time. Fields 22C and 23B are now part of computer block area 22C with respect to which the expert panel has made recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) This suggested procedure was generally instituted and sections of Fields 26 and 27 were selectively cleared in accordance with plans mutually approved by the parties (on the advice on the Government Conservator and BPC Conservation Officer) commencing July 1977. These areas are quite large, and judicious and approved clearing in sections of these fields has continued from time to time except during relevant moratoriums.

He has also been appointed Conservator to advise and assist the Administrator, and indirectly the BPC, on conservation matters and in the consideration of mining proposals. BPC also employs a Conservation officer. An Island Conservation Committee consisting of the Administrator, the BPC Island Manager, the BPC Conservation Officer, the Conservator and other senior BPC and Administration officers meet regularly to consider all conservation and environment issues.</PARA>
<PARA> A selective jungle clearing procedure was adopted by BPC around the time of the 1974 report and has been in operation ever since. It involves the submission of detailed plans for areas to be cleared for mining together with a plot of Abbott's Booby sites. The areas proposed for clearing are walked and traversed to confirm the presence of Booby sites before the submitted plans are approved.</PARA>
<PARA> The approval process involves amongst others the Administrator, Island Manager, BPC Conservation Officer and the Government Conservator on Christmas Island.</PARA>
<PARA> The detailed plan for each field is approved and signed before clearing operations commence in the area under consideration.</PARA>
<PARA> The Christmas Island National Park, covering the south-west portion of the Island, was proclaimed under the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1975 by the Governor-General on 19 February 1980 and gazetted on 21 February 1980.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) There is a ban on the use of firearms and poaching is policed by the authorities. Successful prosecutions have been made against poachers.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) The Conservator referred to in (5) and (6) above has, as part of his functions, the role of disseminating information and increasing the awareness of Island residents on conservation issues. A series of posters depicting the fauna and flora of Christmas Island has been prepared and given wide distribution.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) BPC's policy of clearing for these purposes observes this recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA> (10) Implemented.</PARA>
<PARA> (11) and (12) Backfilling and replanting are being undertaken by BPC, under the supervision of BPC's Conservation Officer. Tree nurseries have been expanded and planting of some mined-out areas has taken place.</PARA>
<PARA> (13) Implemented.</PARA>
<PARA> (14) Turtle poachers have been prosecuted but the isolated beach areas make policing difficult.</PARA>
<PARA> (15) Not applicable. The Radio Australia proposal was not pursued.</PARA>
<PARA> (16) Few fires occur. BPC has a fire station at Drumsite and trained fire officers.</PARA>
<PARA> (17) The Prohobited Imports Ordinance 1977 was made to prohibit the entry into the Territory of, inter alia, animals, including birds, unless the Administrator has granted permission for their entry. The Administrator is empowered to specify conditions to be complied with by the applicant.</PARA>
<PARA> The Importation of Dogs and Cats Ordinance 1973 was also amended in 1977 to prohibit the entry by air of those animals.</PARA>
<PARA> The Endangered Species Ordinance 1980 has the effect, inter alia, or prohibiting the entry of any specimen of an endangered species likely to affect adversely the survival of any of the Island's endangered species.</PARA>
<PARA> (18) The Christmas Island Administration is extremely conscious of the need to protect native fauna. In 1975 an expert from the CSIRO Division of Wildlife Research was engaged to remove the threat of abandoned domestic dogs running wild. His advice has formed the basis for subsequent programs to eradicate semi-wild dogs and cats. Procedures have been laid down for strict control of stray dogs and cats.</PARA>
<PARA> (19) Powerlines are kept to a minimum over open expanses of water.</PARA>
<PARA> (20) Except in a few instances where tracks have been kept open for conservation and similar purposes the jungle has been allowed to overgrow the transect and survey lines.</PARA>
<PARA> (21) An incinerator has been erected and provision has been made for the burying of solid waste in safe mined-out areas.</PARA>
<PARA> (22) Some progress has been made. A number of scientific experts have made visits to the Island in recent years to study the Abbott's Booby, the Imperial Pigeon, plant fauna, fish fauna, land crustacea including the Robber Crab, and introduced ant species.</PARA>
<PARA> (23) Apart from the educational activities referred to at (8), the Conservator has assisted in the setting up of a Natural History Society to serve as a focus for community concern for the conservation of endemic wildlife species. Close involvement with the local school on environmental education has been developed and student excursions to the park and other natural areas of the Island are undertaken as part of the environmental education program.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not possible to assess with any precision the net effect on Commonwealth outlays and receipts of a hypothetical increase of 10,000 in the number of persons looking for work. Any such calculation would require a large number of assumptions to be made, the nature of which would bear heavily on the figuring.</PARA>
<PARA> On the receipts side, the outcome would be influenced by the causes that brought about the rise in the number looking for work. If, for example, more people were entering the labour force and were looking for work because employment was expanding strongly (as it now is) then a rise in unemployment could occur without any adverse effect on taxation receipts. On the other hand, a rise in unemployment occasioned by a downturn in particular sectors of the economy could be associated with lower budget receipts.</PARA>
<PARA> The effect on expenditures also would be uncertain and dependent on underlying assumptions. To illustrate, most married women looking for work, and people looking for part time work, are not eligible for unemployment benefits, and the payments received by beneficiaries are related to their age, the number of dependants and the extent of other income. Moreover, some unemployed persons eligible for benefits do not apply. Without knowing the characteristics of the unemployed in question, it would not be possible to estimate the benefits that might be paid. An indication of the average annual cost per unemployment benefit recipient can be gained from the 1980-81 Budget estimates, which provided for total unemployment benefit payments of $959 million on the basis of an average number of beneficiaries of 300,000 (that is, an average annual cost of about $3,200).</PARA>
<PARA> The number of unemployment benefit recipients varies considerably over the year and a small change in the number of recipients during the year would be unlikely to have a major impact on administrative costs.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) and (2) It is not possible to provide the level of detail sought.

In New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia total apprentice intakes in those trades in the period 1 July 1980-31 March 1981, were up 20 per cent, 35 per cent and 26 per cent respectively on the corresponding period a year earlier.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The latest evaluation report of SYETP trainees is dated June 1980. The survey results in this report show that 50.7 per cent of trainees were still employed with the employer providing training some 4-5 months after the end of the subsidy period.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The same report shows that 17.8 per cent of trainees found full-time employment elsewhere, and 2 per cent found part-time employment.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) One third of placements were assessed as net additional positions.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The data shows that 33.9 per cent of trainees do not complete training. Most of these were dismissed but others left of their own accord, either because of dissatisfaction with the job, or to go to another job.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The same study included employer assessments of trainees at the beginning and at the end of the 17 week period. These two separate assessments related to job skills, the need for supervision, and the willingness to help. When compared the assessments indicated 63.5 per cent improved in job skills; 51.3 per cent improved in the need for supervision and 18.5 per cent improved in willingness to help. Those still with the training employer or employed elsewhere included 62.7 per cent of trainees who had been assessed as less than satisfactory on commencement.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="474" SPEAKER="Anthony The Rt Hon J.D." NAMEID="BU4" PARTY="NCP" ELECTORATE="BATMAN">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BU4">Mr Anthony</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for National Development and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Expansion of the Australian aluminium industry of that order is proposed. It is expected that existing annual production capacity of around 280 000 tonnes will rise to around 1.4 million tonnes by 1986.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The adoption of a particular production process by a company remains, in Australia, the outcome of normal commercial considerations. Of course, Governments-Commonwealth, State and local-affect such considerations; for example, through their setting of environmental standards.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) It is true that the Hall/Heroult process was first developed in the 1880s. It was the development of this process which facilitated the commerical production of aluminium. The process has, of course, been developed and refined over the last 90 odd years. The smelters it is proposed to construct in Australia will take advantage of recently developed technology relating to pot design, anode manufacture, control of airborne emissions from the potline, and reduced electricity consumption in the smelting process.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The potlines in older smelters do use about 17 000 kilowatt hours of electricity per tonne of primary aluminium produced. However, as indicated in (3) above, the smelters it is proposed to construct in Australia will be taking advantage of the latest commercially available technology. Accordingly, it is estimated that the electricity requirement for the proposed smelters will be between 14-15 000 kWh per tonne.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) As is the case with many industrial processes, there are environmental side effects associated with the smelting of aluminium using the Hall/Heroult process. Advances in smelter design and technology have generally reduced such side effects, including the emission of gaseous flourides, to acceptable levels. Nevertheless, before proceeding, each project is required to satisfy the provisions of environment protection legislation of the particular State in which it is to be located. Aluminium smelter proposals requiring Commonwealth decisions are also assessed in accordance with the provisions of the Environment (Impact of Proposals) Act.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) and (8) The Department of National Development and Energy is aware of reserach being undertaken into alternative processes to the Hall/Heroult process. The alternative processes referred to are still all in their developmental stages and it will be some time before any of these alternative processes attain commerical viability if, indeed, any do prove to be suitable for application on a large-scale.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) In 1977, Alcoa (US) entered a contract with the United States Department of Energy to investigate the technical feasibility of reduction of alumina-silica ores, based on combustion heating. Again, the success or otherwise of this long-term project remains to be determined.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) As indicated in (3), (4) and (5) above, the smelters to be built in Australia will be utlising the most advanced commercially available technology.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My attention has been drawn to these claims. However such claims are normally based on the erroneous assumption that the landing charges imposed overseas equate with the Australian air navigation charge.</PARA>
<PARA> Australian air navigation charges, unlike most overseas countries, are a composite fee covering landing fees, parking fees, terminal air traffic control and en-route aids and services. New Zealand has a similar single charge to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> In overseas countries an aircraft normally pays:</PARA>
<PARA> airport charges which can include landing fees, customs charges, security fees, passenger head charges etc (some of these charges can attract peak and off peak rates)</PARA>
<PARA> terminal area control fees which are sometimes included under airport charges</PARA>
<PARA> an en-route navigational aids and service fees.</PARA>
<PARA> As shown by the following table, the single Australian air navigation charge compares favourably with charges levied for operations to the U.K. The table is based on a Qantas QF1 flight Sydney to Heathrow by a Boeing 747-200 at 60 per cent capacity. It compares charges for operations out of Sydney and Australian en-route facilities to charges for en-route facilities for a similar distance from Heathrow (ie, approximately 3750 kms including charges for en-route facilities of Syria, Cyprus, Greece, Euro-Control, and Yugoslavia) and Heathrow airport charges. The charges for operations into Heathrow were provided by Qantas.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) My Department has no knowledge that 'Agent Orange' or 2,4,5-T from Vietnam has ever been imported into Australia through Singapore or elsewhere. According to a report of the Tariff Board of 12 April 1973, imports of material used in herbicide manufacture, namely free 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid, 2,4,5-trichlorophenol and its potassium salt (KTCP) occurred in the late 1960's and early 1970's. These materials appeared to have originated in Singapore, the United States of America, Japan and Britain.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Dr Hall and Dr Selinger have claimed that there has been an increase in congenital abnormalities of the central nervous system in the years 1968-77 but the statistical significance of their claim is debatable. At the same time, they have also recognised that there is no clear evidence to link this alleged increase with the use of phenoxyacetic acid herbicides.</PARA>
<PARA> I am not aware of evidence indicating that low level exposure of large populations to herbicides containing high TCDD (dioxin) levels has ever occurred in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Commonwealth Institute of Health is investigating the possibility that the health of Vietnam veterans has been adversely affected by those chemicals used in Vietnam, including 'Agent Orange'.</PARA>
<PARA> It has always been recognised by the investigators at the Institute that in their studies the possible effects of exposure to agricultural chemicals will need to be assessed and evaluated in relation to the control group as well as the veterans to ensure that a meaningful comparison of exposed and unexposed persons is made.</PARA>
<PARA> Officers involved in the Commonwealth Institute of Health study are aware of the Hall-Selinger results.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="014">Mr MacKellar</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) My Department only has access to prescribing data in relation to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (see (2) below). Data on use in hospitals and private prescribing data would only be available from the manufacturer. It should be noted that it is incorrect to refer to Depo-Provera as a contraceptive drug in the Australian situation where it has not been approved for this indication.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Depo-Provera is available for use in Australia in the treatment of a number of indications including malignant neoplasia and precocious puberty and its availability as a Pharmaceutical Benefit is limited to these latter two indications. The use of Depo-Provera for contraceptive purposes would be limited to clinical investigational use only. To date, no application has been received by my Department in this regard. An application for its use as a contraceptive was rejected by the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) as there were unresolved questions relating to its safety for this indication.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) No potent therapeutic agent, such as Depo-Provera can be guaranteed as being absolutely safe. The product information for Depo-Provera distributed by the company contains the following statement:</PARA>
<PARA> ''The use of Depo-Provera for contraception is not an approved indication and such use is investigational since there are unresolved questions relating to its safety for this indication''.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The ADEC supports the concept of properly controlled clinical trials using Depo-Provera as a contraceptive provided they are designed to help resolve some of the questions raised and provided adequate measures are incorporated in the trial protocol to satisfactorily protect the participants. As with any drug which is marketed in Australia a doctor may decide that special circumstances warrant the use of the product for conditions other than those for which it has been accepted. In such cases the responsibility for adequately informing the patient or guardian and for any adverse consequences of the therapy must rest with the practitioner concerned.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) No studies have been undertaken which would enable firm conclusions to be drawn about the comparative costs of the two methods of constructing roads in Australian conditions. Because of the difficulties involved in attempting an objective assessment, there are no proposals at present by the Bureau of Transport Economics or by my Department to undertake a specific study to obtain comparative cost data.</PARA>
<PARA> However, the relative cost efficiency of these methods of undertaking roadworks would be established on a project by project basis where day labour and private contractors are free to compete by tender for the work. The Government's decision to make grants to the States and the Northern Territory for National Roads construction in the Road Grants Bill 1981 conditional upon the application of tender arrangements will enable cost comparisons to be obtained for particular works on these roads.

<PARA> (1) and (2) Records maintained in my Department are not in a form that readily provides the particular detail sought on an Australian-wide basis and I am not prepared to authorise use of the resources that would be required to identify that detail. It has, however, been possible to obtain some of the information in relation to persons based in Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA> My Department has issued travel warrants for Canberra-based officers and a small number of non-departmental Canberra residents who are members of the Department's Advisory Committees. Approximately 6 400 travel warrants have been issued during the period 1 July 1976 to 31 March 1981 (1 400 in 1976-77; 1 350 in 1977-78; 1 350 in 1978-79; 1 300 in 1979-80 and 1 000 in 1980-81 to 31 March 1981).</PARA>
<PARA> The cost of the airfares for the Canberra-based Departmental officers for that period amounted to $842 463 ($150 454 in 1976-77; $171 898 in 1977-78; $208 676 in 1978-79; $184 228 in 1979-80 and $127 207 in 1980-81 to 31 March 1981.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GH4">Mr Hunt</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) to (3) The Government is aware of the keen interest of certain communities in inland Queensland air services. The new Airlines Agreement provides for an orderly withdrawal from uneconomic services it it is established that over a six month period the airline is not able to fully recover costs. In that event the airline will be able to give three months notice of termination. The new Agreement ensures stability of service by providing for notice of withdrawal and consultations on replacement operators. In circumstances where an airline serves notice that it proposes to withdraw from a route the Governments would have at least 3 months to consider whether arrangements to maintain the service, through a direct subsidy, were appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The one-way economy fare between Brisbane and Emerald (653 km) is $110.30 on a BPA Metroliner aircraft. The one-way economy fare between Brisbane and Rockhampton (530 km) is $75.60 on a TAA jet aircraft. The fare differential is a consequence of different aircraft operators using different aircraft types and the distances involved.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GH4">Mr Hunt</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Under the provisions of the Petroleum Products Subsidy Scheme, which is administered by the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs, oil companies and fuel distributors sell fuel to consumers or traders in rural areas at a price that includes no more than 0.44 cents per litre of the delivery cost of the fuel to the customer. Where the transport costs exceed 0.44 cents per litre, the oil company or fuel distributor claims the remainder from the Government in accordance with the Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) and (3) My attention has recently been drawn to non-specific allegations of this nature. In relation to these the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs has advised that it has found no evidence that these practices occur. I am advised by that Department that all subsidy claims relating to Queensland are checked by the Customs officers in Brisbane.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The honourable member will no doubt recall that when he was Minister for Health in 1975, the Code of Practice on Radiation Protection in the Mining and Milling of Radioactive Ores (1975) was drawn up by his Department. The draft code was distributed to 94 relevant bodies including mining companies, the ACTU, State Trades and Labour Councils and relevant trade unions prior to finalisation. The final code was released in 1976. An improved version of the Code was approved under the Environment Protection (Nuclear Codes) Act as the Code of Practice on Radiation Protection in the Mining and Milling of Radioactive Ores (1980) on 10 September 1980 and is available for incorporation into State and Northern Territory legislation as required. The Mary Kathleen mine in Queensland was the only Australian uranium mine in operation in 1976. Responsibility for the regulation and control of all mining operations including the enforcement of radiation protection standards in Queensland, at that time and now, rests with the State Government. I understand that all uranium mines in Australia which have received Commonwealth Government development approval as well as Mary Kathleen comply with the standards set out in the Code.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Code of Practice on Radiation Protection in the Mining and Milling of Radioactive Ores (1980) was approved under the Environment Protection (Nuclear Codes) Act 1978 and laid before both Houses of Parliament. A copy is available in the Parliamentary Library. Other relevant information would be available from the responsible State or Northern Territory authority.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) The number of officers who have been on strike over the last two years to date is 118.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1), (2) and (3) There has been a very strong response to the Government's important initiative in this matter. To the end of May applications for certification as Australian films has been made in respect of 203 films expected to cost some $145 million in all. It may be expected that this will place some strain on film production resources and some concern has been expressed as to the quality of films that may result.</PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless it is clear that the industry has generally welcomed the Government's initiative. The generous taxation benefits conferred by the scheme, plus the ordinary economic incentive to obtain a maximum return on investment should result in the attraction of investment moneys to quality films having the potential for significant box-office success. This incentive to quality is in fact reinforced by the second limb of the concessions, the income exemption, which in itself is a strong incentive to investment in films with potential for success. The operation of the scheme will, however, be carefully monitored over the next six to twelve months.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the attraction of the scheme to those concerned only with its exploitation has not been overlooked. Indeed, responsible film authorities have registered their concern at the intervention of these elements. Significant safeguards have accordingly been incorporated in the legislation. In particular, the availability of deductions is to be limited to expenditure for which an investor is at a real risk of economic loss and, with effect from 28 May 1981, deductions under the scheme will become available only when a film is completed and marketed.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Yes. The Department of Housing and Construction is aware of the proposal by the New South Wales Government for the solar-powered Bangor public school at Menai.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Fuel bills for space heating are largely determined by the climate, and in Canberra vary from $3,000 per year for primary schools to $14,000 per year for large high schools and colleges. A solar assisted heating system could be expected to contribute approximately 50 per cent of a school's heating requirements, giving potential annual savings of between $1,500 and $7,000 but at considerable additional capital cost.</PARA>
<PARA> A recent national study by the Schools Commission found that the major factor influencing energy consumption in existing schools, is the users. Annual savings of $10m in expenditure on energy for all purposes including heating were predicted if this problem of poor operational practice was addressed on a national level.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) No new Commonwealth buildings have been equipped with solar-powered space heating systems since 1975.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) No existing oil powered systems have been replaced or supplemented with solar systems.</PARA>
<PARA> The CSIRO Division of Building Research experimental building at Highett in Victoria is equipped with a solar assisted heating system. The Department of Housing and Construction office building in Townsville is fitted with a solar assisted air-conditioning system (without heating). Both installations are of a developmental nature and were not intended to be cost effective.</PARA>
<PARA> Active solar space heating systems are not yet proven to be commercially viable in Australia because the energy savings are not sufficient to recoup the additional capital expenditure over the life of the equipment. The capital costs of such a system are appreciably higher than conventional systems because of the relatively high cost of the solar component and the need to install alternative back-up equipment using conventional energy sources.</PARA>

<PARA> The Controller of the Mint has advised me as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) The number of 1981 Australian proof coin sets minted as at 28 May 1981 was 29,751, against a planned total of around 83,000 sets.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) to (7) A total of 35,120 orders for 99,216 sets of coins were received for 1981 Australian proof coin sets up to 28 May 1981. The offer of these sets has been closed for some time. Orders from whatever source are being met in the order of receipt of remittances, subject to a limit of 100 per order from private collectors and, in the case of dealers ordering more than 100 coins, a level held at or below the level of the previous year. Comprehensive statistics are not maintained separately for private collectors and dealers. However, of the 18,362 sets despatched to Australian customers up to 28 May 1981 3,300 sets have been despatched to dealers ordering more than 100 coins.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) to (10) Orders received from overseas were given equal treatment to Australian orders. As of 28 May 1981 7,000 sets have been despatched to the Mint's overseas sales agent for distribution to customers in North America and areas of Europe including the United Kingdom. This will account for the bulk of orders accepted for overseas sales.</PARA>

<PARA> * For import statistics the 'Country of Origin' is defined as the 'Country of Production', that is, in respect of refined petroleum products, the country responsible for the last phase of the substantial manufacturing operation before the goods take their final form. This is normally the country in which the goods were loaded for export to Australia. Imports of petroleum products, however, present a special case because trans-shipment of these goods occurs at Singapore en route to Australia. It is usual practice for petroleum products to be held in common storage at Singapore, where there is co-mingling of the goods originating from a number of different countries. On exportation to Australia, it is not possible to differentiate where the petroleum products originated and thus Singapore is shown as 'Country of Origin'.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Has his attention been drawn to The Story of the Commonwealth Bank by D. J. Amos, FAIS, which suggests at page 7 that Sir Denison Miller's 1920 issue of #23 million of bank credit caused private banks to abandon in Australia their world deflationary policy.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr Howard</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) and (3) I do not think any good purpose would be served by attempting to make judgements called for in parts (2) and (3) of the question, which involve events of up to sixty years ago.</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to part (3), however, I would point out that from 1942 until the end of the war there were extensive wage and price controls. There was also extensive rationing. In the short term, therefore, the subsidies for Consumer Price Index items (principally clothing, some food and other commodities in short supply to the civilian economy) would have had little effect upon recorded prices. These subsidies, together with other measures of wartime government finance, did however add to the amount of money held as idle bank deposits. The activation of these deposits, in conjunction with post-war shortages, helped to raise the price level some 30 per cent between 1945-46 and 1948-49.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Excessive increases in the money supply would be inflationary in the circumstances postulated, even assuming that slack areas of the economy could be pinpointed in the manner proposed. The economy is an inter-related whole, and action taken in one area inevitably has consequences for others. For example, the resulting increases in personal incomes would give rise to demand for a wide spectrum of goods and services, including those in short supply. In addition, some of the measures referred to (selective spending in slack economic sectors, issues of interest free capital) would inhibit the capacity of the economy to adjust to changing circumstances, and thus reduce its efficiency and increase its susceptibility to inflation.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr Howard</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (a) The information referred to is not made available by the Australian Statistician because to do so would reveal the transactions of individual exporters.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Section 24 of the Census and Statistics Act 1905.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) The Australian Bureau of Statistics compiles export statistics from export entries and periodic returns submitted to the Bureau of Customs. The Bureau of Customs also provides copies of all entries and returns to the Reserve Bank, solely in connection with its responsibilities for supervising the receipt of export proceeds under the Banking (Foreign Exchange) Regulations. In addition, it provides to the Department of Trade and Resources copies of relevant entries and returns for the purpose of monitoring exports of commodities, including bauxite and alumina, which are subject to export control pursuant to Regulation 9 of the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations. I am advised that the Department also receives information on exports of these commodities direct from exporters. Consistent with undertakings given by successive governments, information obtained through the exercise of export controls, including export statistics, is treated as strictly confidential by the Department of Trade and Resources.</PARA>
<PARA> With the above exceptions other departments and authorities do not have access to those returns or entries showing exports of bauxite or country of consignment details of alumina exports.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FS7">Mr Street</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) An alliance between the United States and Japan has not been announced recently. In the joint communique issued by Prime Minister Zenko Suzuki and President Ronald Reagan on 8 May, it was stated that ''the Prime Minister and the President, recognising that the alliance between Japan and the United States is built upon their shared values of democracy and liberty, reaffirmed their solidarity, friendship and mutual trust''. Although there has been debate in Japan about the interpretation of the word 'alliance' in this sentence, in particular as to whether it committed Japan to a new or altered security relationship with the United States, the Government of Japan has made it clear that its relationship with the United States remains as it has been.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The joint communique further states that ''the Prime Minister and the President reaffirmed their belief that the Japan-United States Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security is the foundation of peace and stability in the Far East and the defence of Japan. In insuring peace and stability in the region and the defence of Japan, they acknowledged the desirability of an appropriate division of roles between Japan and the United States. The Prime Minister stated that Japan, on its own initiative and in accordance with its constitution and basic defence policy, will seek to make even greater efforts for improving its defence capabilities in Japanese territories and in its surrounding sea and air space, and for further alleviating the financial burden of U.S. forces in Japan. The President expressed his understanding of the statement by the Prime Minister.''</PARA>
<PARA> These positions outlined in the communique do not alter our perception of Japan's defence and security policies nor of Japan's relations with the United States. The Government sees cooperation under the Japan-United States Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security as a vital part of the defence of the Asia/Pacific region, as are the separate arrangements under ANZUS. It is in Australia's interest that the defence relationship between Japan and the United States remain a harmonious one.</PARA>
<PARA>(3), (4), (5) and (6) As suggested in answer to questions (1) and (2), no event as suggested by those questions took place which required specific consultations with Australia by any other government. In both formal and informal consultations with the United States on security issues in the Pacific area, discussion would include, as appropriate from time to time, subjects related to Japan. Similarly, established patterns of consultations with Japan on matters of common international concern include subjects such as Japan's, and our own, relations with the United States.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Many factors have to be taken into account in any consideration of major changes to a taxation system, including the possible implications for exporters of any such changes. Not all factors would carry the same weight in such consideration.</PARA>
<PARA> My statement to the House on 12 March 1981 was not intended as an exhaustive primer of taxation principles and practices-nor, indeed would I seek to strain the patience of the House in that way. However, since the matter has been raised, I note that under the present sales tax (an important element in our present taxation system) exports are exempt, and similar exemption could be expected to apply with a value-added tax (VAT).</PARA>
<PARA> I add that, unless exemption were provided for export sales, a VAT could not, in itself, be expected to enable manufacturers to compete better on export markets. I understand that many countries that impose VAT do indeed grant exemptions of this kind. At the same time, they impose VAT on imports without granting credit for tax paid in the country of production. Where trade takes place solely between countries that impose VAT on this basis and at the same rate, the ultimate effect would be neutral on imports and exports, each country's VAT amounting to a tax on the consumption of its residents only. In the interests of fiscal harmonisation, and the avoidance of double taxation, the member countries of the EEC have moved towards a uniform practice of this kind.</PARA>

<PARA>The United States Environmental Protection Agency has advised that the number of drums of radioactive waste dumped by the United States of America from 1946-70 at the above Atlantic and Pacific Ocean sites was 76,301. The number of drums dumped in the Pacific (at the Farallon Island sites) was 47,500. No strontium release was detected by monitoring at either of the Atlantic or Farallon Island sites. Plutonium 239/240 was detected at the Farallon Island sites (not at the Atlantic sites) at concentrations 2 to 25 times greater than would be expected from background attributable to fall-out from nuclear weapons testing. Cesium was not detected at the Farallon Island sites. It was, however, detected at Atlantic sites at concentrations 3 to 70 times greater than background.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, present activity at the Farallon sites is estimated to amount to 14,500 curies, not 300,000 curies as suggested.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The United States authorities have advised that their experience is that drums holding nuclear waste actually remain intact when dumped and that any release takes place over a long period of time. The US Atomic Energy Commission has always taken the position, however, that it needs to be assumed for the purpose of analysis that drums holding nuclear waste would fracture on impact when dumped, and that activity would be released.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) United States official sources have confirmed that releases of low-level radioactive liquid wastes from US nuclear submarines in Pearl Harbour from 1964-78 totalled 4,843,000 gallons, containing about 1.0 curie of activity. Most of this release (0.98 curie) occurred in 1964 in a volume of 405,000 gallons.</PARA>
<PARA> The State of Hawaii established an environmental monitoring program for Pearl Harbor by granting a one-year contract to the Gamma Corporation. This commenced in June 1980.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The Gamma Corporation has reported that three quarterly samplings have been made in the course of the monitoring program. The first quarter sampling in September 1980 showed the highest cobalt-60 activity of about 0.25 picocurie per gram. The second quarter sampling in December 1980 showed the same general pattern of cobalt-60 activity as in the first quarter. Crab and seaweed samples showed only normal activity. Sampling of air activity showed a continuing rise in fallout activity, presumably from a recent nuclear test in the atmosphere by China. Third quarter sampling in February 1981 showed about the same distribution pattern as obtained in the previous quarter sampling, except for sample station no. 6 which recorded an activity of 0.488 picocurie per gram, about three times the average of previous activity recorded by that station.</PARA>
<PARA> Further sampling is required for a greater period to determine whether these samples are indicative of an increasing activity level in Pearl Harbour.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Japan has announced that it is proposing to conduct a trial dumping of about 10,000 drums of cement-solidified low-level waste, comprising less than 500 curies of radioactivity in the North Pacific. The dump site, 30*N147*E, is approxi- mately 510 nautical miles (945 kilometres) south-east of Tokyo, and 290 nautical miles (540 kilometres) from the nearest island, which is a Japanese possession. The nearest island of the Mariana group is about 590 nautical miles (1,090 kilometres) from the proposed dump site.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) Australia and Japan participate in international studies on nuclear waste disposal in the Nuclear Energy Agency of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and in the International Atomic Energy Agency.</PARA>
<PARA> Bilaterally, there has been an exchange of correspondence between scientists in the Australian Atomic Energy Commission and the Japan Atomic Energy Institute concerning papers relating to the SYNROC technique for the immobilisation of high-level nuclear waste developed at the Australian National University.</PARA>
<PARA> Apart from the exchanges between scientists on the SYNROC technique, Australia and Japan have not had bilateral discussions on alternative waste disposal techniques and Australia is not in a position to offer other alternative techniques on radioactive waste disposal to Japan.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) Details of the SYNROC research and development program have been published widely in scientific journals and elsewhere. This is the only Australian invention for handling nuclear waste disposal in the form of high-level waste.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has said that there is no intention of Australia's storing other countries' nuclear wastes. Information on atomic test sites and related details of nuclear contamination within Australia has been published in reports by the Australian Ionising and Radiation Advisory Council and the Department of National Development and Energy. These reports are available to the public.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia has made clear its opposition to the Pacific region becoming a dumping ground for the indiscriminate and uncontrolled disposal of nuclear wastes. Consistent with that position the Government will continue to monitor closely all developments related to the dumping of nuclear waste in the Pacific.</PARA>
<PARA> Japan's announcement that it proposes to dump low level radioactive waste in the North Pacific is the only case known to the Government of a country which has plans to dump radioactive waste in the Pacific Ocean.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) Australia supports the Antarctic Treaty, Article 5 of which prohibits the nuclearisation of the whole of the area south of the 60*S parallel. The question of extending the region to cover a wider area has not been raised in the regular consultations which take place under the Treaty.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government does not consider that calls for nuclear-free-zones, which try to encompass the totality of nuclear issues affecting regions, are likely to be effective in meeting the security and environmental concerns of countries in the areas where such calls have been made. These concerns and interests are more likely to be taken into account if attention is focused on particular problems which are raised by particular issues.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="523" SPEAKER="Moore The Hon J.C." NAMEID="EI4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="ADELAIDE">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EI4">Mr Moore</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Most industries assistance decisions necessarily involve the granting or withdrawal of some benefit to industries located in particular States or regions. Therefore representation of various points of view are expected and welcomed by Government to assist it to make a balanced decision which takes into account all relevant viewpoints.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) It is Government policy that tariffs and other assistance to particular industries are not changed before advice is received from either of the government's advisory bodies on industry assistance, the IAC or the TAA. The public inquiry process provides all bodies, including State Governments and regional authorities, with ample opportunity to put their point of view. The draft report procedure allows comment on the IAC's draft recommendations before a final IAC report is submitted to the Government.</PARA>
<PARA> Under Section 23A of the Industries Assistance Commission Act 1973, the Commission is required to report on the probable economic and social consequences of implementing its recommendations, as well as the likely employment consequences, both generally and in particular regions.</PARA>
<PARA> Before taking a decision on assistance levels for an industry, the Government fully considers the views of all interested parties as well as the likely implications of its decisions. In these circumstances it is not reasonable to criticise changes on the grounds cited.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Following the adoption of the recommendations of the Committee of Review of Commonwealth Functions, the workload of the IAC will be examined. Any changes to the staffing levels in the IAC will only occur as a result of reductions in the general workload. There are no plans to make reductions that would limit in any way the IAC's capacity to meet its obligations to provide the Government with full and detailed information on matters pertinent to industries assistance.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for National Development and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) (i) Under normal flows, South Australia is entitled to 1,850,000 megalitres per annum in specified monthly quantities. Having provided South Australia's entitlement, New South Wales and Victoria are entitled to an equal share of the flow of the River Murray at Albury, plus any contribution from their own tributaries below Albury.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) During periods of very low flow and after a formal period of restriction has been declared by the River Murray Commission, special arrangements apply. An assessment is made of the water resources available to the Commission taking account of estimated evaporation and transmission losses. Allowance is made for a base flow of 58,000 megalitres per month to South Australia or such other quantity as may be determined by the Commission. The balance of water available is then divided equally between New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. In these circumstances, New South Wales and Victoria also retain their entitlement to the additional amounts of flow contributed by their respective tributaries below Albury.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No; from information available in the River Murray Commission's 1980 Annual Report, the percentage was about 81 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Information contained in the 1980 Annual Report of the River Murray Commission shows that the median values for sodium concentrations during the year at the following locations were:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Director-General of the Confederation of Australian Industry wrote to me recently, setting out, inter alia, the Confederation's views on the Australian taxation structure and suggesting that a Green Paper should be prepared to enable informed public discussion of taxation questions.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) and (3) Judgments about the tax system differ not only on points of emphasis and detail but also, and more importantly, concerning such weightier issues as the constraints which the effects of possible changes upon the budgetary aggregates must impose, and the relative importance attached to effects on particular sectors or on the structure of the taxation system as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA> It should not be surprising that different views on these matters are possible, given the different basic stances from which people start out. I do not think that the existence of such differences of view is open to the kind of black-and-white interpretation implied in the question.</PARA>
<PARA> In his letter, the Director-General reiterated the Confederation's request for urgent consideration of several substantial amendments of the income tax law. A point I wish to make in regard to those suggestions is that their immediate implementation would have consequences for the revenue on a scale that would put at risk the Government's budgetary strategy and jeopardise the economic progress achieved since 1976.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I refer the honourable member to the statement to the Parliament by the Prime Minister on 25 March 1980 in which he outlined proposals agreed with the Prime Minister of New Zealand for a possible closer economic relationship between Australia and New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) and (3) No agreement has been reached on any aspect of the proposed closer economic relationship. In his statement the Prime Minister emphasised that ''no commitment to any specific proposal has been entered into at this stage, nor will any decisions be taken until the studies have been completed and there has been full consboth countries''. However the central trade objective of the proposed closer economic relationship is the gradual and progressive elimination of all barriers to trans-Tasman trade on all goods produced in either country.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) There are no imports of fresh potatoes from New Zealand due to quarantine restrictions and any concerns the industry may have can only relate to processed potato products, imports of which have been minimal in recent years and well below Australian shipments to New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA> Implicit in the Prime Minister's statement of 25 March 1980 is the principle that trade between Australia and New Zealand within a closer economic relationship could only take place under conditions of fair competition. This means that any movement towards trade liberalisation would only occur on the basis of fair and equitable trading opportunities. The honourable member can be assured that the concerns expressed by Australian potato growers relating to the prospect of unfair New Zealand competition in potato products are being carefully assessed in the light of the central trade objective of the proposed closer economic relationship.</PARA>

Sub-section 6 (2) of the Apple and Pear Levy Collection Act 1976 enables wholesale fruit agents to deduct the amount of the levy from the proceeds of the sale of the fruit they handle on behalf of the grower. Section 29 of the Australian Apple and Pear Corporation Act 1973 provides that all moneys received under the Apple and Pear Levy Collection Act 1976 and the Apple and Pear Export Charge Collection Act 1976 (see (3) below) shall be paid to the Corporation. Section 6 of the Australian Apple and Pear Corporation Act 1973 provides that the promotion of apples and pears in Australia and overseas is one of the functions of the Corporation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Australian Wool Corporation has informed me that Hill-Samuel Ltd undertook two feasibility studies during May 1981 at the request of the Australian Wool Corporation to canvass possible options for the sale of AWTA to the private sector. I have been informed that Hill-Samuel forecast various levels of costs from no significant increase up to a 25 per cent increase but could not be definite because the levels of some critical parameters were not known at the time of those studies. A third and more detailed study commissioned by the Wool Corporation is at present in train.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Prime Minister gave an undertaking to the Chairmen of the Wool Council of Australia and the International Wool Textile Organisation that the AWTA would not be sold until the Minister for Primary Industry is satisfied that the terms and conditions surrounding such a sale are satisfactory to the Industry. The Government has charged the Corporation to recommend suggested terms and conditions for the sale of AWTA and the preferred form of the commercial entity to continue its wool testing activities. No final recommendations have been formulated, and consequently the future cost structure cannot be accurately assessed at this time.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Government's decision to sell the AWTA is based on the belief that activities of a commercial kind are generally better performed in the private sector. AWTA in recent years has been operating as a commercial entity.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) There should be no increase or decrease in Government spending as a result of the sale of the AWTA.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The Government did not commission the Hill-Samuel reports; in the circumstances outlined above, they are commercially confidential to the Wool Corporation. However, in due course a synopsis of the reports, or at least their main thrust, will no doubt be communicated by the Corporation to industry representatives to permit the development of a consensus recommendation on the sale arrangements for AWTA.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) In 1979 the Sri Lankan Government called public tenders in Australia for the supply of 32 prefabricated grain storage sheds and subsequently entered into a contract with the successful tenderer for their supply and shipment to Sri Lanka. Funds for the purchase of these sheds were made available by the Australian Government as part of its development assistance program to Sri Lanka. The agreement between the two governments related to the provision of funds. Erection and inspection of the sheds was the responsibility of the Sri Lankan Government.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The storage sheds have not been inspected by Bureau officers. Consultations between the Australian and recipient governments are held from time to time to ensure effective implementation of particular projects but it is neither feasible, and nor would it be appropriate, for Bureau officers to inspect all aspects of all projects.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for National Development and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Although the Australian Representative Basins Program (ARBP) was not part of Australia's formal contribution to the program of the International Hydrological Decade, it was established in the spirit of the objectives of that international endeavour in 1965.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Department of National Development and Energy (as well as earlier departments with responsibility for the interests of the Commonwealth in water resource matters), CSIRO, the Bureau of Meteorology and all State government water agencies have been involved in the ARBP.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The primary objective of the ARBP was to improve understanding of the relationships between catchment characteristcs, climate and run-off by studying data obtained from matching meteorological and hydrological installations in catchments representative, in the main, of all Australian environments.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Yes, but mainly in respect of run-off management requirements including regulatory structures, culverts, bridges, etc.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Within the general resources available to the Bureau of Meteorology, considerable progress was made in meteorological instrumentation early in the program. Twenty-nine of the eighty-five basins established have been fully instrumented with the minimum meteorological instruments, and forty-eight basins are partially instrumented (of which about half have sufficient data for analytical purposes). Most of the data in the ARBP data bank have been provided by the Bureau, involving approximately 1050 station years of average basin rainfall, 950 years of pluviograph data and 400 years of evaporation data. The remainder of the basins/sites require automatic equipment which has development, manpower and funding problems not yet fully resolved.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) CSIRO has devoted considerable resources to the development of the Australian Representative Basins model, partly using data obtained from the ARBP. Sufficient co-ordinated data has been available for the CSIRO research program to proceed, but not within the broader scope of the program as originally envisaged.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) The future of the ARBP is at present under consideration in the Australian Water Resources Council.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) A reliable estimate of the cost of the program to date cannot be provided owing to problems in identifying costs incremental to the normal expenditures of the numerous agencies involved. However, the success of the program will depend on the extent to which analyses of data from the selected gauged catchments meet the objectives of the program, as indicated in (4) and (5) above. It will be some time before this becomes clear.</PARA>

<PARA> (2) (a) and (b) No. The high infant mortality rate among Aboriginals as compared to the non-Aboriginal infant mortality rate is due to a variety of factors not least of which are the adverse environmental and living conditions prevailing in many Aboriginal communities which place infants at risk from respiratory, gastrointestinal and other communicable disease. To attribute this entirely to the use of contaminated water or excessive dilution of infant formula, in the preparation of infant feeds, as has been reputed to occur in Third World countries, would be incorrect.</PARA>
<PARA> Sporadic incidents and occasional epidemics of gastrointestinal infections do still occur, but the presence of Aboriginal health workers, (chosen by their communities), who are trained in preventive measures and capable of administering prompt and effective treatment, has resulted in a decline in both mortality and morbidity. Breast feeding is also encouraged and where formula feeding is necessary, health workers can assist and train mothers in hygiene and other measures necessary in preparation of feeds.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government recognises that while there has been some improvement in Aboriginal health status in recent years, it is still unacceptably low and, among measures necessary to achieve further improvement, priority is being given to the provision of appropriate housing, clean and adequate water supplies and sanitation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The inflow of foreign investment in enterprises in Australia, depending upon the uses to which it is put, can have several effects on the capital and current accounts of the balance of payments. In addition to its direct and immediate effect of providing Australia with financial resources from the rest of the world, the investments undertaken with foreign capital may reduce Australia's reliance upon imports or develop exports and also affect the current account through servicing payments.</PARA>
<PARA> While it is not possible to trace through all the effects of foreign investment inflows on the capital and current accounts of the balance of payments, it is clear that Australia has been able to sustain a deficit on current account, and thus have command over a greater pool of goods and services than are able to be produced domestically, because of the contribution of foreign capital.</PARA>
<PARA> The relative importance of foreign investment in enterprises in Australia can be gauged from a comparison of such inflow with an indicator of aggregate economic activity in Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Department of Housing and Construction has been undertaking work on a type of manufactured housing, commonly called mobile homes, which has been very successful in the USA.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth-State Ministerial Council on Housing Costs has been considering the potential of manufactured/ mobile homes to offer lower cost housing in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department undertook a review of mobile homes in Australia and overseas for the Council. It is assisting the Council to develop model guidelines for the construction and siting of manufactured homes. The construction guidelines are being developed within the principles implicit in the Australian Model Uniform Building Code to maintain acceptable health and safety standards without the emphasis on conventional site building techniques.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department is acquiring a prototype manufactured house based on North American design principles featuring a lightweight stressed skin construction box beam design on an integrated steel chassis with its own running gear and suitable for replacement on low cost foundations. The prototype will help governments, industry, and consumers to assess the quality and potential of this type of dwelling.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Neilsen Design Associates Pty Limited were engaged by the Department to assist with the preparatory design work for the prototype as the basis for tenders.</PARA>
<PARA> The contract to construct the prototype manufactured house has been let to Yarrawonga Housing Industries Pty Limited.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) I am not aware of any other Commonwealth authority being involved in the design or development of mobile homes and mobile home parks.</PARA>
<PARA> State and Territory Governments are participating with the Commonwealth in the Ministerial Council on Housing Costs in reviewing the potential of manufactured housing and developing model guidelines. The Council has informed the Planning Ministers Conference and the Local Government Ministers Conference.</PARA>
<PARA> While I understand from meetings of the Council that some States are interested in giving more detailed consideration to manufactured housing, I have no information on specific proposals they may be considering.</PARA>
<PARA> The Age newspaper of 5 June 1981 reported that the Victorian Housing Minister was reviewing proposals for a pilot scheme in Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA> The New South Wales Parliamentary Inquiry into Caravan and Mobile Home Parks recommended that mobile homes be studied as a form of alternative housing and consideration be given to a pilot scheme of mobile homes in a mobile home park. I am informed that following the Inquiry a committee of officials on mobile homes was set up to pursue this recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Department of Housing and Construction is not involved in the placement of mobile homes other than the prototype manufactured house, for which consideration is being given to various locations for display in the eastern States.</PARA>
<PARA> I have no specific information on locations being considered by the States for the placement of mobile homes.</PARA>
<PARA> Transportable houses have been used by Commonwealth authorities and others in various parts of Australia, especially rural and remote areas, over a long period and usually where they are a more practical option to site building.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Transportation of a mobile home in North America usually consists of running gear which is attached to the integrated steel chassis. The running gear can be subsequently removed and re-used or left on the house. It is also possible to place the home on a low loader.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Transport Advisory Council and the National Association of State Roads Authorities are considering appropriate policies and regulation for the movement of manufactured housing. It will be up to the market place to develop the most appropriate cost-effective means of transportation.</PARA>

<PARA> (a) and (b) Projections of the type requested, especially over such a long period, are subject to considerable uncertainty at the national level and even greater uncertainty at the State and Territory level, where interstate migration is an important factor to be considered.

<PARA> That is why a range of projections of annual additional dwelling requirements for each State were presented in Chapter 5 of the 1981 Report of the Indicative Planning Council for the Housing Industry which I tabled in the Parliament on 10 June 1981. The demographic projections on which the demand estimates in that Report are based are generally consistent with the sets of assumptions suggested in the Review of Australia's Demographic Trends although this Review did not produce population estimates below the national level.</PARA>
<PARA> Projections of total dwelling stock requirements can be derived from these estimates, after allowing for replacement for stock losses, and the 1976 Census count of dwellings.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Annual estimates of the percentage of average household earnings devoted to categories of personal consumption expenditure as requested in the honourable member's question are not available. The following tables provide estimates of the percentages of both household income (Table 1) and household disposable income (Table 2) devoted to those categories of private final consumption that most closely correspond to the items requested. These estimates are based on national accounts data released in 'Quarterly Estimates of National Income and Expenditure, March Quarter 1981' (5206.0). Estimates for the year 1980-81 will not be available until about March 1982.</PARA>
<PARA> Separate details are not available for (a) (i) food and drink purchased for domestic preparation and consumption and (a) (ii) food and drink purchased in a hotel, restaurant, or fast food outlet. The national accounts item 'operation of motor vehicles' has been used for (b) (ii) motor vehicle running costs. Operation of motor vehicles includes some household expenditure (e.g. parking fees and insurance service charges) which are not generally regarded as running costs. Housing costs have been represented by gross housing rent which includes imputed rent for owner occupied dwellings. Item (c) (ii) repairs and maintenance, rates and taxes can be considered as an expenditure paid out of gross rent. In the case of tenanted dwellings such expenditures are paid directly by the landlord and, as for owner occupied dwellings, they are one of the deductions made from gross rent to derive gross operating surplus in respect of the ownership of dwellings. Estimates for expenditure on tourism are not available from the national accounts since this expenditure is included in a number of categories of private final consumption expenditure e.g. 'fares', 'meals and accommodation' (which is part of 'other services') and is not separately identified within each relevant category.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) No. ICAO has not published Standards and Recommended Practices relating to the design of holding patterns. The ICAO procedures which have been published are statements of operation practices with respect to which a measure of international uniformity is desirable. It is important to note that, where statistical wind data are available, the published ICAO material recommends the use of maximum wind speed within the 95 per cent probability calculated on an omnidirectional basis.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No. Because statistical wind data are not always available, the Australian practice is to use an alternative ICAO formula for calculating wind velocities. This then allows standardised holding patterns to be used in all cases and produces a result which is less restrictive, in most cases, then the use of statistical data.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) and (2) Under the National Health legislation it is the prescriber, that is a medical practitioner or participating dental practitioner who determines whether or not a prescription is required to be dispensed urgently and who is required to communicate the prescription to the dispenser in order that the pharmaceutical benefit can be supplied before the prescription is surrendered to the dispenser.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 9 April 1981 (Hansard, page 1519) Mr Ian Robinson asked me, as Minister for Communications, the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Is it a fact that a senior reporter with the Australian Broadcasting Commission maintained a virtual open line contact with a senior Australian Labor Party campaign official throughout the 1980 Federal election campaign and that the Australian Labor Party used this link to try to apply pressure on ABC producers? It is further a fact that the Australian Labor Party was being given advance information about the content of ABC current affairs programs and that the Australian Labor Party through this contact attempted to influence the coverage given to the Government side? Were program producers threatened by the Australian Labor Party? Did they find it necessary to complain to the management? Finally, can the Minister inform the House whether at the end of the election campaign the reporter concerned was a guest at a 'thank you' party put on by the Australian Labor Party?</PARA>
<PARA> The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> The General Manager of the ABC has advised me that it is normal practice, during an election campaign, for reporters to have daily contact with officers of all political parties. There is no evidence to suggest any untoward contact existed between an ABC reporter and an ALP official during the last Federal election campaign.</PARA>
<PARA> The General Manager further points out that had advance information about the content of ABC public affairs programs been given to such an official by a reporter, that information could not have been used to influence the content of the programs, professional responsibility for which rests not with the reporter but with an executive producer.</PARA>
<PARA> It is a fact that on one occasion during the election campaign an executive producer answered a persistently-ringing telephone while a reporter was otherwise engaged and spoke to a person who identified herself as being a press officer with the ALP. It is also true that this person spoke forcefully to the executive producer who asked if she was attempting to bring political pressure to bear. At that point the caller terminated the conversation and apologised.</PARA>
<PARA> The incident caused concern and was brought to the attention of a member of the ABC's senior management.</PARA>
<PARA> It is not unusual for reporters to attend parties given by all contenders in an election. As the honourable member does not name a particular reporter whether or not this reporter attended an ALP party, and if so, in what capacity, is not known.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) No.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes. Limited STD barring is in operation at the Department's Melbourne Regional Office. Departmental instructions advise staff that telephones are provided for official purposes. Personal trunk calls may be booked through the switchboard with the approval of supervisors and the cost of the call recovered from the officer.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Yes. Wider use of access-barring has been considered but rejected as impracticable for a variety of reasons. The need for regular contact between the Department's Central and Regional Offices and with the export sector of the business community at all levels makes the provision of STD facilities to many officers necessary as an integral part of their duties. Selective access-barring is constrained by a combination of the open-planned nature of the Department's offices and the cost of barring individual telephone extensions.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) All telephones in the Department of Home Affairs and Environment are STD barred except for those used by approved senior officers. Staff may make personal trunk calls only with the approval of their Branch Head. These calls are recorded by the switchboard operator who advises the officer concerned of the cost of the call. Payment is to be made for the call within 24 hours. The switchboard operator also provides a monthly list of personal trunk calls to the Finance Section and any outstanding accounts are pursued until payment is made.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Consideration has been given to the installation of monitoring devices. However, as trunk and STD calls are controlled, the Department has considered that the estimated cost saving on local unofficial calls would not warrant the costs involved in the installation of this equipment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Information provided to the Universities Council of the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission by Monash University shows that, out of a total of 239 students enrolled for higher degree courses in the Engineering Faculty in 1980, approximately 50 were identified as being overseas students. Even allowing for some discrepancies arising from various definitions of overseas students, it would appear that a substantial majority of students undertaking post-graduate engineering courses at Monash University are Australian residents.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Under the Commonwealth Post Graduate award scheme it has been the policy since the scheme began not to earmark awards for particular fields of study. The scheme is seen to be one of general support across the whole range of higher degree studies.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The stipend under Post Graduate Awards has always been significantly lower than the salaries available to graduates in employment. It is for the individual to assess whether the pursuit of higher degree studies under award conditions is preferable to the immediate financial advantages of employment. Acceptance of the award reflects the view that it is in the Award holder's long term interest to pursue a higher level of research and study at that stage rather than embark upon or continue in employment.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) and (6) A significant number of higher degree students, including full-time academic staff in tertiary institutions and holders of Commonwealth Government awards will be exempt from tuition fees. Higher degree students holding awards of $3500 per annum or more from State governments, universities and colleges of advanced education will also be exempt from tuition fees.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government acknowledges the importance of tertiary education to the economy and to the community generally but it believes that there are substantial benefits which flow to individuals from tertiary education and the community as a whole should not be expected to meet all of the costs.

In line with the Government's decision on the Review of Commonwealth Functions, responsibility for the regulation and control of nuclear activities in Australia will be implemented as far as possible by the States and the Northern Territory with the Commonwealth maintaining a co-ordinating role. Any changes which might occur in the responsibilities within my own portfolio could depend, to an extent, on the outcome of the discussions and negotiations with the States and the Northern Territory on control and regulation of nuclear matters.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GH4">Mr Hunt</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) The implications of resource developments for the Australian Transport sector are taken into account in the ongoing work of the Bureau of Transport Economics, the Department, the Australian Railway Research and Development Organisation and in the intergovernmental consultative fora of the Australian Transport Advisory Council and the Marine and Ports Council of Australia. Moreover, close liaison is maintained with both industry and other Government portfolios.</PARA>
<PARA> Recent examples of the work of the Bureau of Transport Economics include a Study of Western Australian Ports, and the Economic Evaluation of Proposed Completion of the Sandy Hollow-Maryvale Railway.</PARA>
<PARA> The Study of Western Australian Ports was carried out jointly by the Office of the Director General of Transport in Western Australia and the Bureau of Transport Economics and included consideration of the needs of the expanding mineral industry. The Sandy Hollow-Maryvale Railway study was concerned with the development of the Ulan coal seam and the carriage of grain and metalliferous concentrates.</PARA>
<PARA> At the instigation of the Marine and Ports Council of Australia the Bureau of Transport Economics is to undertake a study of the extension of the standard gauge rail links to the ports of Brisbane, Melbourne and Geelong. As a matter of course this will comprehend forecast impacts of resource developments projects.</PARA>
<PARA> At a more general level my Department will be providing a submission to the Senate Standing Committee on Trade and Commerce Inquiry into the Australian export coal industry. Furthermore, the Bureau of Transport Economics is preparing a paper on the transport implications of resource developments for the Transport Outlook Conference later this year.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member may be interested to know that the jointly funded State/Commonwealth body Australian Railway Research and Development Organisation is expected to release its 1981 Report on Rail later this year. The report will articulate a basis for rail's future role and is expected to outline future rail infrastructure investment requirements.</PARA>
<PARA> Within the Australian Transport Advisory Council, the Railway Group is giving consideration to the question of rail infrastructure requirements. It is expected that this work will be further progressed on completion of the ARRDO 1981 Report. This will of course have direct relevance to the infrastructure requirements of the resources boom.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="559" SPEAKER="Anthony The Rt Hon J.D." NAMEID="BU4" PARTY="NCP" ELECTORATE="CAPRICORNIA">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BU4">Mr Anthony</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for National Development and Energy has provided the following answers to the honourable member's questions:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) (a) and (b) The Government does not maintain comprehensive statistics regarding deaths from breakdowns and accidents in overseas power generating plants. However, there have been no fatal radiation accidents at commercial nuclear power plants in Britain, the United States of America or Switzerland, and I am not aware of any fatal radiation accidents at USSR nuclear power plants. Comparative studies of electricity generation from various energy sources indicate that, in terms of occupational and public health risk, and taking into account all stages of the relevant fuel cycles, nuclear powered plants are considerably safer than coal or oil fired plants.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The only nuclear reactor accident in Britain during the period 1947 to 1970 resulting in radioactive contamination of property was the Windscale accident in 1957. The United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority, in accepting responsibility for the accident, paid claims amounting to #Stg 70,000 mainly for financial losses incurred by the Milk Marketing Board and local farmers as a result of radioactive iodine contamination. I am not aware of any accident to a nuclear reactor in the USA, USSR or Switzerland during the period in question resulting in contamination of farms or other property.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Price-Anderson Act currently limits the aggregate liability of licensees of nuclear plants in the United States for a single nuclear incident to $US560 million.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) In the United States nuclear plants must be insured in accordance with the Price-Anderson Act. Rates and policies have been arrived at under special arrangements with the insurance industry, and are not directly comparable with premiums applying to non-nuclear power plants.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) recommends that radiation workers, whether short term or long term, should receive no more than 50 millisieverts in a year and that members of the public should receive no more than 5 millisieverts in a year for short term (a few years) exposure and no more than an average of 1 millisievert a year when averaged over a lifetime. These limits do not include doses received from background radiation or medical procedures. The 1977 report of the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) shows the average doses received by radiation workers in United States nuclear power plants to be 10 millisieverts per year, and in Britain 2-5 millisieverts per year. Almost all radiation experienced in nuclear power plants is gamma radiation, associated with a small proportion of beta radiation. The proportions of gamma and beta radiation are measured by film dosimetry. The only time alpha radiation would be present is in the handling of ruptured fuel, and if suspected is monitored separately.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Short term employees seeking employment elsewhere in the industry in the United States are required to disclose their previous radiation exposure levels.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) Exposure to the maximum long term ICRP recommended dose of 1 millisievert in addition to the average natural background radiation dose, also of 1 millisievert, could be expected to double the mortality risk attributable to background radiation alone. The combined risk, however, would only amount to 1.4 per cent of that from cancer from all causes.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) (a) In most countries with large nuclear industries, licensees maintain cumulative records relating to employees' radiation exposures. Some countries, e.g. Canada, have established national registries for this purpose. Studies of the incidence of cancers arising in radiation workers have been undertaken in several countries, for example, USA and UK. In Australia, records of radiation exposures are kept by centres operating personal monitoring services. The Australian Radiation Laboratory of the Department of Health is remodelling its personal monitoring service to provide for determination of working lifetime doses. This service covers over half of the radiation workers in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Licensees are required to instruct all individuals, working in or frequenting any portion of a restricted area, on the health protection problems associated with exposure to radioactive materials or radiation.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) There have been conflicting reports of the cause and magnitude of the claimed USSR disaster. No information has been released by Soviet authorities. The honourable member's attention is also drawn to answers to Questions Nos. 1633 and 1658 answered in the Senate on 25 February 1977 (pages 508 and 509).</PARA>
<PARA> (10) The Attorney-General introduced the Freedom of Information Bill in the Senate on 2 April 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> (11) (a) Currently not all power generating authorities include decommissioning costs in their rates. In the United States typical quotes for allocations to cover decomissionings are around $2.5-3.5 million per year which translates to about 2-4 per cent of current generation costs. Similar percentages have been estimated recently for the Federal Republic of Germany.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) and (c) Generally the cost of guarding and disposing of the wastes arising from the nuclear generation of electricity using current disposal methods are included in the rates charged by the generating authorities. This is a small fraction of the total generating cost, e.g. the cost of ultimate disposal of all waste arising from the light water reactor fuel cycle was estimated by an International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation (INFCE) study to be in the range of 0.10 to 0.16 cents per kilowatt hour (1978 US dollars). This would be about 3-5 per cent of the total generating cost for a reactor coming on line in the 1977-78 period.</PARA>
<PARA> (e) Regulatory requirements for the nuclear industry ensure that radioactive contamination of humans and other species does not exceed limits established by public health and environment protection authorities. The costs associated with meeting these regulatory requirements are included in the costs of nuclear generated electricity.</PARA>
<PARA> (12) A recent analysis of nuclear generation costs for 1979 prepared by the US Department of Energy, including data from 61 operating nuclear power stations (all rated over 400 MWe), indicated a unit cost of the order of 2.1 cents US/kWH: at current rates of exchange, this is equivalent to 1.9 cents Aust./kWH. The price of electricity to Australian smelters is publicly available in only two cases. Both of these involve prospective smelters, rather than existing smelters for which prices are likely to reflect long standng contracts. For the Alcoa (Portland, Vic) smelter, the net tariff for electricity (including an interruptibility discount and a rebate of the SECV turnover tax) is just over 1.7 cents/kWH (as at early 1981). At the Tomago (NSW) smelter, the price (including an interruptibility allowance) is 1.825 cents/kWh (as at early 1981).</PARA>

<PARA> (1) and (2) A pensioner who is a taxpayer may be entitled to funeral benefit and/or (2) taxation concessions in respect of the funeral expenses of a deceased person.</PARA>
<PARA> Under the provisions of the Social Services Act a funeral benefit of up to $40 is payable to any age, invalid or widow pensioner or supporting parent beneficiary whose annual income apart from pension or benefit is less than $2,040 (single) or $1,768 (married person) and who is liable for the funeral costs of either an age, invalid or widow pensioner or supporting parent beneficiary whose income also falls within those limits, or a spouse, or a child in his care. Where the pensioner or beneficiary has dependants, the income limits are higher than those mentioned.</PARA>
<PARA> A funeral benefit of up to $20 is payable to any person who is not entitled to the $40 benefit but who is liable for the funeral costs of an age or invalid pensioner whose income fell within the limits stated above.</PARA>
<PARA> I am informed that the current income tax lay provides that amounts paid by a taxpayer for the funeral expenses of deceased dependants, not exceeding $100 in respect of each deceased dependant, shall be treated as rebatable amounts.</PARA>
<PARA> For this purpose a dependant is defined to include the spouse of a taxpayer, a child of the taxpayer less than 21 years of age, or a person towards whose maintenance the taxpayer contributes during the year of income and is thereby entitled to a concessional rebate in respect of that person. This latter group would include an invalid relative, as that term is defined in the Income Tax Assessment Act, and the parents or parents-in-law of the taxpayer.</PARA>
<PARA> Unless the total of the rebatable amounts exceeds $1,590 a rebate of tax is not allowable. Where the total of the rebatable amounts exceeds $1,590 the rebexcess of the rebate amount over $1,590. Other rebatable amounts include medical, hospital and chemist expenses, education expenses, rates and land taxes and life assurance and superannuation contributions.</PARA>

<PARA> The question is a complex and wide-ranging one, requiring details of transport costs at each stage of production for a range of unspecified origins and destinations in respect of eight commodities. Against the background that much of the information sought is confidential to the organisations concerned, I do not believe that the employment of staff resources to undertake the considerable research needed to provide a detailed answer would be justified.</PARA>
<PARA> As the honourable member would be aware, most bulk commodities are transported on both land and sea at contract rates, details of which are not released by the organisations concerned. Consequently, the 'book' rates published by the various Australian rail systems do not reflect the actual rates charged for these traffics. Likewise, in respect of shipping the spot rates published in trade journals do not provide an adequate guide to rates applicable to long-term trade arrangements made between exporters and shipping companies.</PARA>
