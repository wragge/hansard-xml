<PARA> The Clerk-Petitions have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate Ministers:</PARA>
<PARA>Proposed Sale of Trans-Australia Airlines</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> Many Australians depend almost exclusively upon Trans-Australia Airlines for the provision of essential air services.</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Liberal Party policy objective of selling Trans-Australia Airlines within 4 years is contrary to the national interest.</PARA>
<PARA> Sale of Trans-Australia Airlines would inevitably result in:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the creation of a private monopoly of major airline services in Australia;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) higher domestic air fares.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House of Representatives will reject outright any proposal to sell Trans-Australia Airlines.</PARA>
<PARA> And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.</PARA>

<TITLE>Excise on Beer</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The hotel industry in Australia is long-established and a valuable part of the community of this nation, providing places where the people may partake of the three basic needs of life: a place to eat, a place to drink, a place to sleep.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. The hotel industry is accepted throughout the nation as occupying an important place in the social and economic activities of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. The hotel industry is almost entirely within the private sector and makes a large contribution to the government in taxes of various kinds.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. The hotel industry has a need to sustain an appropriate level of turnover and growth, to make profit, and to sustain and improve the level of employment.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. The hotel industry of Australia is gravely concerned at published reports that the Government intends to increase excise charges on beer in the forthcoming Budget.</PARA>
<PARA> 6. Sales of beer constitute the major source of income of most of the industry's 5,811 hotels in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> 7. The very steep rises in beer excise in 1975 and 1978 severely retarded the growth of the Australian hotel industry.</PARA>
<PARA> 8. Any further increases in excise on beer in the 1981 Budget would further retard the industry at a time when growth is essential to maintaining economic viability and the ability to serve the constantly growing needs of the community.</PARA>
<PARA> 9. Such is its significance as a community requirement, beer occupies a place on the Consumer Price Index, and any alteration to its cost to the community would have an inflationary effect.</PARA>
<PARA> 10. Any increase in excise would result in and force the hotel industry to pass on such increases to the consumer by way of higher prices for beer.</PARA>
<PARA> 11. Higher excise would be only the starting point for an upward spiral in beer prices because of the presence of other factors, such as State Licence Fee taxes, which are directly linked to excise rates.</PARA>
<PARA> 12. The hotel industry of Australia already is gravely handicapped by heavy excise and other tax imposts, its growth is at a standstill; and, inevitably must decline if beer excise is increased.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that Honourable Members of the House of Representatives:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Recognise the importance and place of the Australian hotel industry in the social and economic life of the nation.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Accept that the viability of the hotel industry is essential to the maintenance of employment opportunities and stability of the industry is essential to enable it to continue to provide for the hotel needs of the nation in this period of growing population and increasing tourism.</PARA>
<PARA> And further, that Honourable Members of the House of Representatives resist and reject any move to increase excise on beer.</PARA>
<PARA> And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.</PARA>

<TITLE>Toxic Shock Syndrome</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned showeth that your petitioners are gravely concerned by the threats to women's health and lives posed by Toxic Shock Syndrome, and urge the following steps to be taken as a matter of urgency:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Tampons, sanitary napkins, vaginal deodorants and similar sanitary products to be re-classified under Therapeutic Agents (not under ''Cosmetics'' as at present), in order to bring them under the scrutiny of the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee. We believe manufacture must be under the strictest hygienic conditions.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) After re-classification, we urge an immediate government-funded inquiry into all aspects of manufacture and content of these products. This must lead to: (i) contents of product and instructions for correct usage to be shown on packaging; (ii) removal of synthetic fibres, chemicals or ingredients that are potentially or actually harmful to users.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Allocation of extra funding for ongoing research by the National Health and Medical Research Council into these products, results of this research to be made public to ensure all health workers and potential users are fully informed. This campaign of public education would necessitate multilingual distribution of the information where appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners, therefore, humbly request that Parliament take immediate and positive action to avert possible threats posed to women's health by implementation of the above measures.</PARA>

<TITLE>Plant Breeders' Rights</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. We, the undersigned citizens of the Commonwealth, do humbly pray that the Commonwealth Government:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Note that legislation establishing plant breeders' rights in other countries has had serious adverse effects, namely:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) virtual monopoly control of seed production has passed into the hands of a few large international corporations seeking to profit from the exclusive rights over plant genetic materials created by such legislation;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the varieties of seeds available have been restricted mainly to hybrids which will not reproduce truly and will not grow without the aid of artificial fertilisers and pesticides, thus maximising corporate profits without regard for the interests of growers and consumers;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the genetic diversity of crops has been eroded, rendering them vulnerable to disease and other environmental threats.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Recognise that maintenance of the genetic diversity of plant varieties is crucial to the continued well-being of the Australian nation, and take all necessary steps to preserve and promote such genetic diversity as a public resource and to prevent exclusive control over plant genetic materials from falling into private hands.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. Defend the vital interests of Australian farmers and gardeners, independent Australian seed companies and their employees, and consumers of Australian farm and garden produce, by rejecting any proposal to legislate for the establishment of plant breeders' rights in Australia.</PARA>

<TITLE>Privacy and Personal Information</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> Paragraphs 107 and 108 of the Privacy and Personal Information discussion paper number 14, brought down by the Law Reform Commission in June 1980, undermines the family unit and the authority of parents, which is the Christian basis of our society, by proposing that ''between 12 and 16 years, a child should be entitled to object to disclosure of information to a parent''.</PARA>
<PARA> It is your petitioners' sincere belief that:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) an adolescent between the ages of 12 and 16 is not at a mature enough stage of life to decide whether or not the disclosure of information to a parent will be in the best interests of the adolescent.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) as a record keeper has no responsibility for the child, and as his moral standards may be different to those of a parent, he should not be permitted to come between child and parent.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) a parent has a unique position which may enable him/her to perceive a situation that the record keeper does not. The parent must therefore be aware of the problem if remedial action is to be taken, and has the right to guide the child in the direction he/she feels fit.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore pray:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Members of the House of Representatives will reject the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission and find some other means to protect children from the excessive abuse of some parents.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. That Federal Government proposals to shift the cost of health insurance onto the individual has placed a disproportionate and unfair financial burden on lower income groups, but particularly on large families; single income families; the chronically ill; those with recurrent illnesses and those on fixed incomes.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. That an estimated 15-20 per cent of Australians will not be able to afford insurance and will be forced to undertake extensive travel to avail themselves of outpatient services, the quality of which will be drastically reduced because of staff cuts.</PARA>

<PARA> 1.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the House will know, there was a meeting of Health Ministers in Canberra on Friday. The Government had announced its policy on hospital funding. Aspects of hospital funding had been discussed in the Premiers Conference earlier in the week and the Prime Minister at that conference had suggested that further discussion should take place at the Health Ministers conference. I listened to what the States had to say at the Health Ministers conference. They put a particular point of view. I believe that the Commonwealth's basic philosophy and the thrust of its policy are fair and reasonable and the Commonwealth has not diverted from that view. I reported back to Cabinet yesterday morning and Cabinet discussed the matter. The results of that Cabinet discussion have been made public.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The basis of the States' concern was that the assessment of potential revenue made by the Commonwealth was in fact not correct. Of course, this would have an impact upon the level of funding which would be divided up among the States in the coming year. There was really only one way in which the statement as to which was the correct assessment could be judged and that was on the actual result. The Commonwealth has decided, very reasonably in my view, that the States and the Commonwealth will come together towards the end of the next financial year and review the actual results of the imposition of charges and collection of revenue. If necessary, adjustments will be made. By that stage the relativities review which the Grants Commission will be required to carry out will be available not only to the States but also to the Commonwealth. The States have been invited to make a contribution towards the terms of reference for that Grants Commission inquiry. In all these circumstances I think this is a very reasonable way for the Commonwealth to behave in relation to aspects of concern expressed by the States. The basic thrust of the Government's policy remains utterly in place.</PARA>

The Australian proposal was developed in my discussions with the board of Qantas Airways Ltd over an extended period. Country of origin arrangements have been in place between Australia and the United States of America for some years now and they have worked well. The agreement with the United Kingdom represents an extension of this approach in the light of experience and in response to changes in the international aviation environment. The agreement does not represent complete deregulation. Arrangements for the filing of new fares by Australian and British carriers and for disapproval of fares filings still remain, but only in exceptional circumstances will filings by those carriers for their services be disapproved. The arrangements allow flexibility for the airlines to respond promptly to changed market circumstances. Existing fare arrangements with other countries remain unchanged at present.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Changes to existing fares and conditions between Australia and the United Kingdom were also agreed on by the delegations for consideration by governments. Most important will be the introduction of a new excursion stopover fare priced between the existing APEX fare and the Excursion fare. This is a long overdue introduction of a new fare regime. The new proposals would place Association of South East Asian Nations airlines on an equal footing with Qantas Airways Ltd and British Airways in that they would have common opportunities to participate in the carriage of traffic on all available fare types. In discussions with the United Kingdom, Australia had regard to its obligation to consult with ASEAN countries. ASEAN views have been taken into account in formulating the new fare arrangements. Yesterday, the Chairman of the ASEAN committee on transportation and communications was informed by the leader of the Australian negotiating team of the changes agreed between Australia and the United Kingdom. Advice is being passed separately to individual ASEAN governments.</PARA>

I refer him to the assessments made by the various State Health Ministers as to why the amounts of money they will receive under the new funding scheme are incorrect in comparative and absolute terms. Is it a fact that these errors arise because: Firstly, Queensland's bed costs are lower than those of other States; secondly, Victoria's offer is wrong because its funds, on a population basis, are lower than those for other States; thirdly, Tasmanian funding was based on an incorrect assessment, on the Commonwealth's part, of cost-sharing in the previous year; fourthly, for Western Australia the Commonwealth had overestimated the additional revenue to be gained; and, fifthly, South Australia saw the hospital charges increase as unrealistic? Can the Minister state whether these assumptions are incorrect and, if not, why he will not delay the changes and hold meaningful discussions with the States?</PARA></TALK.START>

The fact of the matter is that the Commonwealth has announced its policy to move towards the inclusion of funding in this area in the general tax-sharing arrangements. Those arrangements will have a transitional period while, as I have already stated, the Grants Commission looks at relativities and, of course, again as has been stated, the Commonwealth consults with the States as to the outturn results of the imposition of charges. I say again that the only way in which assumptions can be tested is to put the proposals into place. The consultations which will take place towards the end of the next financial year will enable both the Commonwealth and the States to have a realistic appraisal of the actual results of the imposition of hospital charges.</PARA></TALK.START>

I think we need to understand that these payments have been made on an historic basis, because of a way of life to which many people have grown accustomed and which they have been led to expect. It would be rather unkind and unnecessary to upset those arrangements and the expectations that have come out of them. If patterns change some years in the future, so be it. When we have a circumstance in which many people qualify either for an age pension or in some cases for a widow's pension, if those pensions did not exist those people would merely qualify for the unemployment benefit. There would then be no financial saving in that, but a social change would be forced on people which I personally would regard as most unfortunate.

The subject of the unhappy recent experiences of the country of Lebanon were recently a matter of comment in this House. So far as the most recent events in that country are concerned, the Australian Government has asked the Australian mission in the United Nations to convey to the Secretary-General of the United Nations our great concern at the potentially explosive situation which is developing there and which could affect not only the stability of the region but also stability throughout the world. We have asked our mission to make clear to the President of the Security Council our concern and to urge on all parties involved the need for commonsense and restraint at this particularly difficult time. We have further said that any initiatives which the President of the Security Council feels he can take in this respect would have our support. I understand that there is little or no prospect at the moment of a United Nations peacekeeping force being introduced to cover the whole of Lebanon because such a force would require a request from the Lebanese Government as well as a resolution from the Security Council of the United Nations. In respect of that possible development and others in the area, the Government is watching the matter closely and will take what opportunities it can to reduce tensions in the area.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In reply to the honourable member for Maranoa I point out that it is not true, as his question implies, that this Government has deferred all financial decisions until receiving the Campbell report. It is correct that a number of possible changes to the structure of our financial system have been put off until we receive that report. But even in that context a number of quite significant decisions have been made in advance of the report, including in particular the decision taken last December to deregulate the then existing controls on borrowing rates by Australian banks. I do not believe that it would be a satisfactory discharge of my responsibilities under the Banking Act, in the face of the mergers which are currently being contemplated, to say that the matter was altogether too difficult for the Government and that it ought to be put off until after the receipt of the report of the Campbell Committee of Inquiry. I think that obligations are cast upon the Government-myself in particular-under the existing provisions of the Banking Act and I think that it would be an inadequate discharge of those responsibilities to say that the matter should be put off until we receive the report of the Campbell Committee of Inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Treasurer. I refer to the near record monthly private capital inflow for April disclosed today and the fact that 99 per cent of foreign investment approvals for the first half of 1980-81 were for takeovers of existing enterprises. Is it a fact that the huge volume and direction of this private capital inflow is blowing to pieces the Government's money supply target of 9 per cent to 11 per cent, is inherently inflationary and is applying substantial pressures for further interest rate increases? Is it a fact also that it is responsible for a large scale alienation of Australian ownership and control of established Australian industry? Furthermore, is it a fact that it is forcing significant revaluations of the Australian dollar and accordingly creating serious price disadvantages on competitive export markets for exports of Australian manufactured goods and farm products? Does he acknowledge that these effects are contrary to the best interests of Australian farm and manufacturing industries, stable economic management, and the promotion of the national interest? Will he therefore take immediate steps to haul back this damaging flood of foreign investment into a more manageable flow?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Leader of the Opposition has asked a very long and very important question. I will try to give it the detailed response that it merits. It is true that the most recent balance of payments figures have indicated a very large increase in the volume of private capital coming into Australia. It is true that that inflow contains a very high element of portfolio investment. It is equally true that all of the reasons for that very large increase can be a matter of conjecture. It has something to do with the existing interest rate differentials between United States domestic interest rates and Australian interest rates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not accept the description that the Leader of the Opposition places upon this situation; that is, that it is blowing the Government's money supply projections to pieces. The most recent indications for the 12 months to, I think, March show that the growth in M3 is about 11.7 per cent. That is up by about 0.7 per cent on the previous month's figures but, as the honourable gentleman knows from his earlier experiences, these figures can fluctuate very wildly from month to month. It would be a fairly brave person who tried to put a precise figure upon the final outcome at this stage of the year because at this time of the year the external account is always the wild card so far as the money supply outcome is concerned. It appears that there was a stronger seasonal element in the most recent balance of payments figures than is normally the case. This is partly due to the fact that provisional tax payments are larger this year-by an estimated 30 per cent-than was the case a year ago and that they are being paid earlier. Some of the information from the money markets suggests that arrangements for tax payments have been made earlier than last year and that more funds have been brought in from overseas for those purposes.</PARA>
<PARA> As the honourable gentleman knows, all of the matters which bear upon the external account are interrelated and the conduct of exchange rate policy has an impact upon international competitiveness. Equally, of course, international competitiveness is a reflection of domestic success in controlling prices. To the extent that the external account is conducted in a way that reduces and does not increase the level of inflation, that has a beneficial effect on our international competitiveness.</PARA>

The Government will await the advice of the consultants before taking a decision on the matter. In the meantime, TAA will be established as a public company with 100 per cent Commonwealth ownership. However, the memorandum and articles of association will not inhibit the sale of TAA or part thereof to the private sector.

Is the Minister aware of the very widespread concern amongst Australian manufacturers about the lack of a market price for aluminium ingot in Australia and the fact that they are paying consistently higher prices-I might say identical prices among all of the companies-than those on international markets?

The Administrative Appeals Tribunal asked for a specific explanation of the statement made to this Parliament. This was given in response to a request from the AAT. The detail of the amendments, as they will appear, will, of course, have no impact on any proceedings before the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal or the Administrative Appeals Tribunal until such time as they, in fact, have been passed by the Parliament.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Following a request from the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure conducted an examination of alternative delivery systems for Commonwealth public works. The Expenditure Committee's report was tabled in this House last year. It contained conclusions and recommendations that addressed the need for flexibility, efficiency and accountability in relation to public works. The Committee concluded that:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The choice of a particular delivery system for a particular project has to be made in the context of the circumstances of that project and hence is a matter for the judgment of administrators. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) The choice of delivery system for a project should remain with the organisation that has prime carriage for the planning, design and construction of public works. </PARA>
<PARA> (3) It is not practical to formulate guidelines for the selection of a particular delivery system. </PARA>
<PARA> (4) Since a government department or agency is responsible for the efficient administration of public works, that department or agency should always have overriding authority over project management companies and others on these works. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to inform the House that the Government fully endorses these conclusions. The report went on to make three recommendations:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) The Department of Housing and Construction either include in its annual report or supply the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for inclusion in that Committee's general reports information relating to tender price, costs of rise and fall contract clauses, design alterations and other costs, and the particular delivery system used for each completed major capital work. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Department of Housing and Construction expedite the preparation of design and supervision costs for major public works and publish these costs in its annual reports. </PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Department of Housing and Construction assess the advantages and disadvantages of contractual project management and use this delivery system when circumstances permit its use. </PARA>
<PARA> I am also pleased to inform the House that the Government accepts these recommendations. Action is in hand to publish this information on tender price and other costs in the Department of Housing and Construction's 1980-81 annual report. It will cover major works completed during that year and will cover all projects referred to the Public Works Committee and those exempted from that Committee's scrutiny on the grounds of expediency. Works exempted on security grounds will not be covered. The Government has taken and will be taking other steps to enhance the efficiency, flexibility and accountability of the Commonwealth's works programs, particularly in relation to the works of statutory authorities. Amendments to the Public Works Committee Act will extend that Committee's scrutiny to cover many statutory authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also introduced new public works procedures aimed at achieving more consistency and better value for money from the Commonwealth's works expenditures. The Department of Housing and Construction is working on the detailed arrangements to apply these procedures. These procedures will result in consistent conditions of contract for all Commonwealth works, including works of all statutory authorities. Those statutory authorities which are or will be subject to the Public Works Committee scrutiny under the proposed amendments will be required to consult with the Department of Housing and Construction on design and cost aspects to ensure that soundly based and consistent estimates of cost are prepared and presented to the Government and the Public Works Committee. The recommendations made by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure, in conjunction with other initiatives the Government is taking, will in no small measure help to ensure that the Commonwealth receives value for money from its construction expenditures and that the Parliament, the Government and the public are better informed about those expenditures. Finally, I would like to congratulate and thank the Committee for this report. I commend the report to the House. I present the following paper. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The ministerial statement on Commonwealth public works arose out of the request by the Joint Standing Committee on Public Works and the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure which conducted an examination of alternative delivery systems by Commonwealth public works. Of course, we know that the Expenditure Committee report was tabled in the House last year. I wish to briefly make a few comments in regard to the report. The three recommendations accepted by the Government are welcome in particular, recommendation (1) which deals with information relating to tender prices. As the Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr McVeigh) knows, and would have heard prior to taking over his ministry, there was a great deal of criticism during the last Parliament in relation to the tender prices for the purchase of a computer for his own Department and the manner in which those tenders were carried out. We know that as a result of pressure, both externally and later internally, within his Department the lowest tender and even the tender with the greatest Australian component in the project were not chosen. Therefore, it is important that tender prices be made public and that a section of this Parliament should be able to examine such tenders.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Recommendation (3) deals with contractual projects of management. For instance, in examining the day labour force under the control of the Department of Housing and Construction it can be seen that the number of people employed has actually fallen from 6,592 in 1977-78 to 4,995 in 1978-79. I have no doubt that the Government is very proud of the cuts in the day labour force. What will happen, particularly when contracts are given out to private enterprise? It will be revealed that we certainly can ill afford such drastic labour cuts in the Department particularly in relation to supervision by the Department in policing and making sure the work is done properly. Page 3 of the Minister's statement deals with Commonwealth works expenditure. This is where the real cuts have been made. The situation concerns us because if we look at the report of the Department of Housing and Construction we find that in 1976-77 an amount of $683.6m was made available but in 1979-80 that allocation had been cut to $496.4m.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. Those figures demonstrate that public works expenditure, expressed in constant prices, has been cut from $884m in 1976-77 to $496m last year. That is a drop of something like 44 per cent. We can go back still further in respect of the cuts proposed by that violent group of this violent Government which so proudly calls itself the razor gang. Page 29 of its report states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Expenditure on capital works is an important item in the Commonwealth Budget.</PARA>
<PARA>I want to stress that we on this side of the House agree that public works expenditure is an important item of Budget expenditure. But, as I have just pointed out, there has been a cut of 44 per cent since 1976-77. We can now see the philosophy behind why the cut has been made. The razor gang report goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> With the boom in the private investment associated with resource development there is a need to avoid overstretching the capacity of the building and construction industry. We have accordingly decided on major reductions in this area. </PARA>
<PARA>The interesting aspect of this is that since May 1974 there has been a cut in employment in the building and construction industry of over 60,000 people. Today, 60,000 fewer people are working in that industry than were working in it in May 1974. The fact is that this Government is still drastically cutting back a sector of the Budget which is particularly important. We must consider the importance of public works as a whole in the development of our nation. To a great extent it is cutting back in cities and regional areas, particularly in the old, established areas. They are being cut back to a great extent and yet employment is being created in isolated areas which sometimes have difficult social infrastructures and so on. It seems to me that again this is a part of the Government's policy of which we should be highly critical. </PARA>
<PARA> The technical aspects of the Minister's statement probably will assist the Parliament to police actions more thoroughly. Certainly I hope that public works carried out, particularly the tendering aspects, will be policed more strictly in the future. I hope the skulduggery that went on-I use the word 'skulduggery' deliberately-in the tendering for a computer for the Minister's own department does not continue. The tendering process was so bad that I believe something was very wrong. I think that there was collusion between certain sections of the bureaucracy and the IBM company to allow that computer to come through. I must say that the Government and the Department will find it extremely difficult to carry out a lot of the supervision on the work that has to be carried out because of the drastic cut which has occurred in day labour. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to take a couple of minutes to comment on some aspects of the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure. Perhaps more importantly, I express my pleasure that a report of one of the House of Representatives standing committees, of which I had the pleasure to be the Deputy Chairman in the last Parliament, has been accepted by the Government. I think that it is fairly honest to say that some of these committees find great frustration inasmuch as they put an enormous amount of work into formulating a report which they believe to be honest, accurate and forthright, and then find that the report is largely ignored by the Government. So it is pleasant to find that the Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr McVeigh) and the Government have seen fit to accept fully the recommendations made by the Expenditure Committee in this report which is entitled 'An Examination of Alternative Delivery Systems for Commonwealth Public Works'. I express my pleasure also on behalf of the members of the Sub-committee. By some strange quirk of fate I am the last remaining vestige of that Sub-committee. My colleagues, Mr Kevin Cairns and Mr Ken Aldred, unfortunately for them, have passed into early retirement. I am sure that, even in their retirement, they will find some satisfaction in that the hard and diligent work which they and other members of the Committee put into this report has been accepted, honoured and put into practice by the Government. On their behalf, may I express pleasure at that event but, more importantly, that the honest and difficult work of committees of the House is not altogether ignored.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There should, after the farcical events of the last four days, be very little reason to argue the ill-conceived nature of the Government's hospital funding proposals. What was non-negotiable on Friday has become highly negotiable, at least for one of the States, by Tuesday. Indeed one might now describe the new federalism as simply a surrender to the noisest and most obstreperous of the little Australians, Joh Bjelke-Petersen, without regard for the interests of the other States or for the logic of the agreement, if there be logic to it, which was presented to the Health Ministers last Friday. However, it is not simply the flaws in execution of the agreement that we on this side of the House are attacking. We believe there are far deeper flaws than the farcical events of the last few days regarding the hospital funding agreement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We believe the fundamental principles of those funding proposals are wrong. It is, first of all, simply a reactionary step in late twentieth century Australia to abandon a national government role in determing priorities for the hospital sector. We believe that it is simply a backward step to abdicate at this point in the development of the nation responsibilities of the Commonwealth Government towards the hospital sector. Although the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar) often in very vague ways clothes his arguments for his new policies in the report of the Jamison Commission of Inquiry into the Efficiency and Administration of Hospitals, it is quite clear that the Jamison Commission opposed the proposal to hand back hopital funding to the States through general purpose grants. This is what the Commission had to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commission's view is that the existence of some form of identified funding for health services has come to be generally accepted as a means of ensuring that a high standard of health care is available across State boundaries for the Australian population. </PARA>
<PARA>Although transitionally there may be some identification, it is clearly and explicitly the intention of the Government simply to include hospital funding in the general purpose grants to the States so that it would be unidentified, untied and quite contrary to the beliefs of the Jamison Commission. The ideal of that Commission was that there should be a rough equality of services across State boundaries. It did not believe that this could be achieved unless there was a significant contribution by the Commonwealth Government. The ideal of a Commonwealth contribution to maintain a rough equality of services across State boundaries was supported by most of the national health agencies in this country. That ideal is now being undermined by the present policies to which the Federal Government is committed. Indeed, the Federal Government's position is basically an abdication of responsibility for the public hospital sector. </PARA>
<PARA> I have argued before that this will ultimately lead to a fragmentation of service provision. For example, it is already apparent that quite different means test proposals will apply in most of the States. Queensland has indicated quite clearly that a means test will not be introduced into the free hospital system which it has had for a generation. New South Wales and Tasmania are both looking at applying more generous means tests than those propounded by the Commonwealth Government, which has a very narrow definition of need. No doubt some of the other States will simply follow the Commonwealth plan and have a fairly narrow definition of 'socially disadvantaged'. Quite different sets of means tests will apply in some States. In one State at least there probably will be no means test at all. This will lead to quite different health cover provisions in each of the States; the health cover needs in each State will be different. We are then left with questions concerning not only the variety of health covers but also the mobility of Australians: Will Australians need to adjust their health cover as they move from State to State? The whole of the implications of this abdication of responsibility are really quite foreign and quite antagonistic to the development of society in the late 20th century. </PARA>
<PARA> When honourable members on this side of the House make these points they are often subjected to quite false reasoning from honourable members opposite. Members of the Australian Labor Party are not suggesting that a rigid uniformity should be imposed by the Commonwealth on the States. We are suggesting that the Commonwealth should participate with the States in the determination of priorities for public hospitals in this country. It should do so not just on one occasion; there should be regular participation by the Commonwealth Government with the States in determining national priorities for public hospitals in this country. We are not suggesting that the participation should be practised as it is presently being practised by the Minister; that is, simply at the crude level of squeezing funds and letting the States pick up the burdens. We are suggesting that there should be genuine co-operative federalism in the health field, not the unco-operative federalism that has characterised this federation in recent weeks. Indeed, the whole evolution of the present hospital package is a classic example of unco-operative federalism. There has been no effective give and take. There has been no genuine consultation between the Commonwealth Government and the States on the Jamison proposals. In order to support the statement I have just made I will quote the statement made by all the State Health Ministers: It states:</PARA>
<PARA> We observe that we have never been consulted in the real sense of the word and at no time prior to its recent decision has the Commonwealth indicated any clear intention to the States. </PARA>
<PARA>Unless the Government is going to say that all these State Health Ministers are simply money grabbers, that they have simply got no care or concern for health issues, then that statement is a very clear repudiation of the whole unco-operative approach that has been adopted by the Government in response to this matter. Indeed, I think it is true to argue that there has been more consultation with powerful vested interests-the private health funds and the Australian Medical Association-than there has been with the States. I am confident that the Government and the Minister have talked more with those vested interests who have done very well out of this package than they have with the States. Indeed, in many ways the package was designed to serve the interests of the vested interests in the health sector rather than to serve either the interests of the States or the people of this country. Our first major objection to those proposals-these inefficient and ill conceived proposals-is that we oppose the abdication of the Australian Government from any responsibility in the public hospital sector. </PARA>
<PARA> The second principle that we oppose is the imposition of the means test at the point of service delivery. The Government, of course, is now attempting to ensure that a means test is imposed by the financial sanctions that it is using against the States. I will come back to that point. The Minister often clothes his rhetoric in the words of Jamison. The Jamison report is a conservative report, very sympathetic to the values of Government. Yet this report referred to the means test. First of all, the report echoes the views of the Minister on the principle of the user pays, so it is very much sympathetic with his line. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> Because the Commission believes that those able to pay should do so, and that they should be encouraged to do so through insurance, it gave much consideration to the reintroduction of a means test for free access to both inpatient and outpatient services at public hospitals. In doing so, it recognised:</PARA>
<PARA> that sickness often generates costs other than medical costs-for example, cost of the breadwinner's income for part or all of the term of incapacity;</PARA>
<PARA> that hospital administrators who gave evidence to the Commission were almost unanimous in their opposition to such a proposal;</PARA>
<PARA> that collection of debts has been a difficulty in the past. </PARA>
<PARA>It considered various proposals for formalising such a means test. It found major objections to all of them. </PARA>
<PARA>The best it could suggest was possibly an informal income test without sanctions. That is certainly not the view of the Government. The Jamison committee looked at it and discovered, therefore, that not only did most hospital administrators oppose it, not only did it create enormous inefficiencies in relation to debts, but also it recognised, of course, that with sickness there are a whole lot of after costs besides simply the medical bills. Therefore the Jamison committee opposed the kind of rigorous means test which this Government is trying to impose on the States. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, if the Government is successful it will create in the hospital sector a two-tier system. We will have the public sector primarily catering for the poor, the disadvantaged, and also, of course, for the high cost technology activities. All the straight forward, high profit surgery will be channelled into the private sector, which, of course, has received increased subsidies for those very types of surgical activities which the Jamison committee pointed out were one of the major cost problems in this society-the excess elective surgery in Australian society. Yet, this Government, supposedly worried about costs, provides a specific subsidy to encourage that activity in the private hospitals. All of the double talk of the Minister cannot cover that up. Indeed, on this issue of the means test we have really had the most extraordinary double talk from the Minister. During the election campaign, when of course, it might have worried the voters if they were told that in six months time the Government was going to endeavour to impose on the public hospitals a means test, the Minister was very strong on this point. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . there was absolutely no truth in the statement that the Government was planning to restrict patients' free access to public hospitals by reimposing a means test for hospital care. </PARA>
<PARA>With the need to win the election only six months ago the electors were assured that no means test would be imposed. Six months later the Government is going all out to compel the States to impose a means test. But when questioned on this the Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> A decision as to whether a means test will be imposed for access to public hospitals in entirely a matter for the States concerned. </PARA>
<PARA>That does not have anything to do with the Minister. That is no explanation whatsoever. If one had read the Minister's statement of a fortnight ago, one would see that it clearly implied that unless the States imposed a means test they would have financial sanctions imposed upon them. The Minister deliberately set out-whatever he said yesterday-to compel the States to impose a means test. Let me just show how this is to be done. First of all, each of the States has had a very significant cutback in funds. I ask the permission of the Minister to incorporate a table in Hansard to try to suggest some of these fund cuts that have been made. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will explain each detail in a moment. We then can have a debate about the accuracy of this table and about the statements which are being made by various State Ministers. The Health Ministers have stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We believe the Commonwealth financial decisions are arbitrary and dangerously unfair to the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Borthwick, the Liberal Minister for Health in Victoria, says that the figures are demonstrably wrong. If one looks at them what the Commonwealth has tried to do is to impose a financial sanction in order to make the States charge full public hospital charges on all people except the very narrowly defined poor. The Commonwealth clawback from each of the States would be: For New South Wales $77m; Victoria $59m; Queensland $64m, until yesterday; South Australia $27m; Western Australia $23m; Tasmania $12m; and the Northern Territory $7m. Let me show how significant that sanction is. It represents a percentage cut. In each case this is quite high in order to persuade the States to do what the Commonwealth Government wants them to do. For New South Wales that cut is about 14 per cent of what the State would otherwise have got; for Victoria it is a cut of 16 per cent; for Queensland, until yesterday, it was a cut of 29 per cent, but because of the special back door arrangement that appears to have been reduced to 22 per cent; for South Australia it is 18 per cent; for Western Australia 13 per cent; for Tasmania 23 per cent-almost a quarter-and for the Northern Territory 25 per cent. If we take just the States and leave out the Northern Territory, it appears to me that Tasmania, since the back door deal with the Premier of Queensland, is the most seriously disadvantaged State. Of course, the Queensland decision means that if those figures had any logic at all, they have now been undermined. We want to know on what basis those calculations were made. We want to know what is the logic behind them. We want to ask the Minister whether there is any logic across the board now that one State has received this special grant. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, let me say that last week the Minister pilloried the position of the Labor Party in crude and dishonest terms. We accept the need to cover the costs in this country, but we say that the costs should be covered by an income related payment so that every Australian contributes to health care according to his means and takes from health care according to his needs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government rejects the Opposition's politically motivated claims that the new funding arrangements for State health services will adversely affect State and personal finances or will lead to a decline in hospital standards. I believe, the Government believes, that the Government's position on future funding levels is a fair and reasonable one. It could, in fact-the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett) who led for the Opposition has not acknowledged this-lead to the States having additional resources available to them next year because of the cushioning factor which has been built into the arrangements over this transitional period. The Government's position will, we believe, lead also to increased efficiency in costly institutions, such as public hospitals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I notice that the honourable gentleman did not spend any time at all on the efficiency of public hospitals-the most expensive component of the health care delivery system. He did not attach any weight to the question of increasing the efficiency of the administration of public hospitals. I am sure that this is something quite foreign to persons of a big spending nature, such as those exemplified by members of the Opposition. It is typical of the approach taken by a socialist Labor government. It is typical that the questions of cost, administrative leanness and administrative efficiency are completely left aside. Without in any way jeopardising the level of care now available in public hospitals, the arrangements we will put in place will be an advantage to all taxpayers because they take into account the necessity for administrative efficiency. The Opposition's track record demonstrates beyond any doubt whatsoever that it is not concerned about efficiency or ensuring that taxpayers are protected by government action and that we receive the greatest value possible for each dollar spent on health care. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said on many occasions in this House and outside, the fundamental goal of the Government in the health area is that all Australians should have proper access to high quality health care at a cost that the individual and the community can afford. I remind the House that health care delivery is a very expensive proposition. All developed nations are finding the containment of health costs one of the most difficult aspects of their general administration. As part of the containment of costs the Government believes that welfare assistance in the form of so-called free public hospitals should be made available only to those in genuine need, those people whom the honourable member for Bonython has said are defined narrowly by the Commonwealth Government. I will say more about that in a moment. The Government believes equally that those who cannot be viewed as needy should contribute towards the cost of the health services available to them. That aspect of the Government's attitude seems to have escaped the attention of the honourable gentleman opposite. I was pleased to see that even the Queensland Minister for Health agreed with this position. He said recently:</PARA>
<PARA> It is recognised that some people abuse the present free public hospital system. Therefore, the individual who uses the free outpatients or the free hospital system, who can afford to pay, needs to examine his own conscience on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA>The Queensland Minister for Health, who has very recently made something of a feature of the Queensland free hospital system, in line with his Premier, has publicly stated that a person who can afford to pay and does not pay, in his words, 'needs to examine his own conscience on this matter'. The Government also firmly believes that there should be a number of inbuilt checks and balances in the health care delivery system to minimise unnecessary use and abuse of the system. This is because over-use and abuse of the health care delivery system unnecessarily increase the cost of financing that system for the community. These beliefs are fundamental to the Government's health policy. Socialised systems for the provision of health care have been allowed to continue without those necessary checks and balances. They have resulted in a continuing increase in the utilisation of services and the drain on taxpayers' funds. </PARA>
<PARA> The new funding arrangements for State health services embody the principles that I have outlined. We will continue to ensure that special arrangements operate to protect those in genuine need. The honourable member for Bonython said that the Commonwealth has abdicated its responsibilities in the public health area, particularly in relation to hospitals. That is simply not true. What the Government has done is to ensure that those in genuine need are protected by allowing them free access to public hospitals. We require the States to provide free access for eligible pensioners and their dependents plus those who are defined by the Commonwealth as disadvantaged. The honourable member for Bonython said that disadvantaged people are narrowly defined. The arrangements will protect about three million people in this country. Over 20 per cent of the population will be protected. How that category can be put forward as being narrowly defined I cannot conceive. We believe that all other people should be required to contribute towards the high cost of public hospital accommodation and treatment. In calculating the level of funds that should be provided to the States next financial year for their health services, we have subtracted from the funds they would otherwise have received a reasonable share of the additional revenue they could be expected to receive if those people not in genuine need were required to contribute towards the cost of their accommodation and treatment and if more realistic bed day charges were introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of the misinformation that has been put about in relation to the Commonwealth estimates of the revenue raising capacity of the States in the public hospitals area, I will spell out this afternoon the manner in which the level of funds for State health services in 1981-82 was calculated. As I advised the House last month, in calculating these grants the base figure adopted was the amount to be provided to the States and the Northern Territory for public hospitals, the general community health program and the school dental scheme, plus an amount to maintain the real worth of the year's figure. I emphasise that the base figure for each State is the same real level of funds it is to receive this financial year for the three health programs to which I have just referred. From this base figure we have subtracted only 60 per cent of each State's assessed capacity to increase its revenue through the public hospital system if, amongst other things, the existing bed day charges of $50 and $75 for shared ward and private room accommodation respectively were increased to $80 and $110 and an out-patient charge of $15 per service was applied. The remaining 40 per cent is free to the States. It is additional revenue which will be available to the States to spend in whatever area they wish. </PARA>
<PARA> In calculating the potential revenues for each State's public hospital system, the Commonwealth has assumed that only half of public hospital patients will be paying patients. That is a reasonable assumption given that the other measures announced to the House last month will see a much larger percentage of the population taking out health insurance. Obviously, in those States in which close to 50 per cent of patients pay for their beds at the present time, more than half will pay when the new arrangements come into effect. We have also assumed that charges will be made for only one-third of existing out-patient services. Again, this is a very reasonable, if not a conservative, assumption. We have assumed that people covered by third party and workers compensation will be charged at the full average cost which, again, is fair. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat that the Government believes that the assumed level of charges and the other assumptions involved in calculating each State's revenue raising capacity are fair and reasonable. Hospital bed day charges at $80 a day are especially reasonable when we remember that the figure is equal to the amount one would have to pay in a good hotel these days. Of course the hotel charge would not include three meals and expensive attendant care which is provided in a hospital. An out-patient charge of $15 per service is also fair and reasonable when we remember that the charge for a standard consultation with a general practitioner is $11.80 in New South Wales and that out-patients receive pharmaceutical items free of charge whereas a person who receives a prescription from a private doctor has to pay at least an additional $2.75. </PARA>
<PARA> As a number of honourable members will know, the States have questioned the Commonwealth's assumptions stating that they are unrealistic. The honourable member for Bonython has drawn attention to this in his statement to the House today. Only experience will prove whether the claims of the States or the Commonwealth are correct. The Government has now decided that an assessment should be made towards the end of the next financial year of each State's capacity to increase revenue with adjustments being made to the level of funds provided if that is considered appropriate. Again, I believe that this is a fair and reasonable approach to a problem caused by the States' saying on the one hand that they do not believe that the assumptions the Commonwealth has made are correct and on the other hand the Commonwealth's saying that it believes that they are correct provided they are based on the figures provided by the States. There they are based on the figures provided by the States. There is only one way in which the matter can be realistically sorted out and that is to look at the actual results of the implementation of the policy. If the estimates are grossly wrong and adjustments are necessary, the Commonwealth stands ready to make those adjustments. </PARA>
<PARA> Concern has also been expressed by Queensland about the loss of funds it would have sustained in 1981-82 under the Commonwealth's original proposition. It was argued that Queensland is a special case as it is the only State with a free public hospital system. In considering the Queensland Government's arguments the Commonwealth was particularly mindful of the view presented by the Jamison Commission of Inquiry into the Efficiency and Administration of Hospitals that any changes to the public hospital system should be gradual and that sudden changes could be disruptive. The Jamison report stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . sharp, sweeping changes can be disruptive and impractical . . . much can be gained from continued small measures, rather than from sweeping structural change. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government also took into account the fact that only about 40 per cent of the Queensland population has hospital insurance, while the national figure is about 55 per cent. It also took into account the fact that a much smaller percentage of patients in Queensland's public hospitals are paying patients, whereas in States, such as Victoria and New South Wales, well over 40 per cent of patients are already paying patients. Therefore, in the case of Queensland I think it is questionable whether our assumption that 50 per cent of public hospitals patients would be paying patients, is reasonable. In other words, we have looked at the situation in Queensland and we have made an adjustment for it. These were the arguments that were put to the Commonwealth and I believe it is only proper that the Government should review its position in the light of them. </PARA>
<PARA> I must say that I find it difficult to understand a situation in which if one does not react to any proposition, one is regarded as stubborn, but if one does react, one is regarded as weak. It seems that a Minister or a government with the capacity to review realistically propositions put by States or individuals and make judgments is in a no win situation either from the point of view of the Opposition or the media. But the Government is prepared and has been prepared, and I as a Minister have been prepared, to look at the situations which have been put to me by State Ministers. As has already been announced, the Government has made its statement clear in relation to the individual circumstances. As honourable members will be aware, the Commonwealth has agreed to introduce, for one year only, a cushioning factor in the level of funds to be provided to Queensland in 1981-82 by providing an aditional $16m to that State. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the House that the Government has decided that the Grants Commission should, as a matter of urgency, be asked to look at relativities among States in order to remove inequities and to provide incentives for States to correct inefficiencies. The Government, therefore, recognises that there could be inequities in relation to the allocation of funds between States in the health area and that action may be needed to correct this. If necessary, that action will be taken, and I have asked the State Health Ministers to make submissions on possible terms of reference to the Grants Commission as soon as possible. Again, I think that this demonstrates a reasonable approach to a difficult problem. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard much today and over the past few days of the need to provide additional funds to the states for their public hospitals. Regrettably we have heard very little about the need to operate efficient public hospital systems and the considerable waste and inefficiency in those systems highlighted by the Jamison inquiry. For too long States have been more concerned about having the Commonwealth underwrite their inefficient public hospital systems instead of taking appropriate action to ensure that their public hospitals operate efficiently. The new funding arrangements under the Government's new health policy are designed to promote efficiency by requiring the States to take up their full constitutional responsibility for the provision of health services. This will ensure that taxpayers get the greatest value possible for each health care dollar spent in maintaining the high quality health care system we all enjoy, and it is a high quality health care system. I am sure that all taxpayers will welcome this and will expect the States to take up this challenge. </PARA>
<PARA> We have also heard much today about how the Government's new health policy will adversely affect the community. Let me remind the House that under our policy about three million people-those in genuine need-will be entitled to free public hospital and medical services. Much has been made of the fact that all other people will be required to pay for the health services they receive or take out health insurance. Let me again say that exponents of this view fail to acknowledge that those who are not in genuine need will be required only to contribute towards the health services they receive. They will not be required to meet the full cost of those services, a cost that in many cases is well in excess of the charge actually levied. The actual cost of a public hospital bed, for example, is now close to $200 a day because considerable subsidisation is provided by the Government to bring the cost of health services within the reach of the community and to ensure that all people have access to health insurance at that reasonable cost. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A number of cold, hard facts have been covered up by a lot of the hot air that is being generated in statements from the Government side of the House regarding the most recent health mess. The statements just made by the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar) have done nothing to alleviate this mess. The ill logic in the statement that the States have not been running their hospital schemes efficiently and therefore the Federal Government will withdraw entirely not only from funding but also from any position in which it could inject some efficiency into the hospitals, is unbelievable. We now see that the Government believes that by standing back the hospitals will magically become efficient. The Minister has also indulged in very selective quoting. He quoted from the report of the Jamison Commission of Inquiry into the Efficiency and Administration of Hospitals to back his very spurious arguments. But, in fact, the Jamison report stated that the Queensland hospital scheme is the most efficient scheme and has the most efficient administration in Australia. Yet it is this very scheme which the Goverment is moving to dismantle.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister also quoted the Queensland State Health Minister, Mr Brian Austin, again very selectively. The Minister quoted Mr Austin as saying, in the Telegraph of Wednesday, 22 April:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the individual who uses the free out-patients or the free hospital system, who can afford to pay, needs to examine his own conscience on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA>He completely neglected to quote further. Mr Austin went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> It has been stated by the Commonwealth that the states will be forced to means test at public hospitals. This statement would indicate that the Commonwealth has absolutely no idea of what's involved in the running and operation of a public hospital system. </PARA>
<PARA>I find it entirely objectionable that different little facts are taken out of context to try to pull the wool over the eyes of the Australian public. Many facts have been hidden. I would like to speak on behalf of ordinary Australians who have been affected by this Government's complete neglect of a decent health insurance system. The Australian Labor Party is the only party which is concerned with health costs and which supports a health insurance scheme which meets the needs of ordinary Australians. The Labor members of this House are the only members who support the retention of Queensland's free hospital scheme, which the Jamison report-the report on which this Government is basing its action-describes as the most efficient system in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to point out these further facts: Prior to the introduction of Medibank, Queensland's free hospital system was on its last legs; it was on the point of collapse and could not have gone on. I speak from close experience, my father having been the shadow Minister for Health in the Queensland Parliament at the time. When Medibank was introduced the Government injected the necessary funds into the scheme and it, as honourable members have heard, has become the most efficient in Australia. In its original form Medibank was also very acceptable to the electorate. In my electorate of Lilley doctors were afraid before the introduction of Medibank that everything would fall into shambles. After its introduction, those doctors actually supported Medibank because it was much more efficient and it gave proper health treatment to everyone without the doctors having long lists of bad debts. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government, instead of being honest and dropping the scheme, as contrary to its private enterprise philosophy, has worked consistently to put health insurance out of the reach of middle and lower income earners. It has succeeded. There are hundreds and thousands of people who now cannot afford medical care or medical health insurance. People in Queensland have been forced into out-patient departments or they have had to stay home and go without the treatment they need. In recent months the out-patient departments in hospitals have been overflowing. With this scenario as a background, this Government now moves to withdraw funding not only from Queensland but also from all the States, as positive proof of its lack of interest in any health insurance scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> It is particularly ironic that the Government's two week-old health policy, suffering symptoms of terminal prevarication, should come unstuck at the very time that the Government has never been more unhealthy. This indecisive, disintegrating Government, showing symptoms of its last dying days in office, is thrashing about looking desperately for some direction for its policies. The fact that Cabinet fidgeted and fussed over hospital funding arrangements for four months indicates its divisiveness and the lack of leadership at the helm. These indications that Government policy was drifting aimlessly were confirmed by the extraordinary events of the past two weeks and particularly the events of yesterday. It is typical of the inefficiency continually displayed in the Government's administration of health services. As my colleague the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett) pointed out, the philosophy linking the Government's health policy and its hospital arrangements is that the sick pay. The user pays principle does not apply; the sick pay. We all know which economic group in society is the most prone to sickness and hospitalisation: it is those who are too poor to afford stable and nourishing diets and those who cannot afford regular medical check-ups which enable diagnosis and treatment of illness in its early stages. </PARA>
<PARA> The Queensland Minister for Health said recently that, if the Federal Government had its way, Albert Schweitzer's inscription outside his African jungle hospital would have read: 'Here, in whatever hour you come, you will find the light and help of human kindness, if you have got enough to pay'. The words of the Federal Minister for Health two weeks ago were: 'If you are willing to pay for yourselves'. This is the Government's motto and its approach to the provision of health services to the public. It is the old survival of the fittest and wealthiest principle, a social Darwinist approach to health. The poor pay through the teeth. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday marked the anniversary of Florence Nightingale's birthday. I am sure she must be turning in her grave. In the health field this Government has replaced the sorts of principles that Florence Nightingale represented with the cold hard doctrines of Ayn Rand. This Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), who beats the drum of co-operative federalism and who, until a couple of weeks ago, boasted that Federal-State relations had never been better, did not even have the nerve to consult the States on the new Commonwealth provisions for health services. Right up until the Minister's statement was made in this House, State Health Ministers were guessing about the form in which the Federal Government's assistance would be provided, whether it would be by absorption in general revenue grants or by block grants as recommended in the Jamison report. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister and his Cabinet cronies ride roughshod over the States in the same fashion as they steamroll Ministers who do not completely toe the Fraser line, in the same way that they contemptuously ignore the view of their own increasingly restless and rebellious Government backbench and in the very same way that they handle the business of disseminating information about the process of Government policy-making by selective leaking to the media. We are told that the devolution of responsibility and blame for the country's system of health will supposedly grant greater freedom to the States because hospital assistance will now be absorbed in the category of general revenue grants and the States will have greater flexibility and discretion in the distribution of federal money. What they do not say is that there will be substantially less federal money to go around. Besides that, anything that offers the Government of Mr Bjelke-Petersen greater dictatorial power, greater manoeuvrability and greater leverage, must raise fears even in the stoutest hearts. I have little sympathy for the predicament of the Queensland Government in this matter. After all, it continually supports the Prime Minister's now very publicised manic obsession to withdraw government services, devolve powers to the States and to leave people generally to fend for themselves. Now that the Federal Government extends that principle to the Queensland Government so that it must fend for itself, it is screaming blue murder. For many years, Queensland had to pay a financial penalty to a Federal Liberal Party Government for providing this service. Two weeks ago, the Minister, while calling for deinstitutionalisation with one breath, introduced, with the next breath, measures designed to kill individual associations and to fortify institutionalisation. I refer to the lumping together of a number of services such as the school dental scheme. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the second week in a row that the Opposition's spokesman on health (Dr Blewett) has raised a matter of public importance which relates to health. This, coupled with questions that have been asked, has, quite frankly, allowed for an almost ad nauseam debate. One wonders just what impression he is making. It is my view he is making no impression at all. As a matter of fact, it is my view that the present Opposition is sick and needs medical attention and, indeed, hospitalisation. It is the Australian Press at the moment which plays the role of the opposition to this Government. It is about time that this Opposition got off its backside and started to do something about providing a reasonable Opposition to this Government. It is the Press, not the Opposition, that is the real opposition to this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>

It is true. There are many such people in my electorate. All honourable members have them in their electorates. I am concerned about those people. But I am also concerned to see that there is some self-help involved in their lives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Bonython mentioned the Government's non-negotiable position at the Commonwealth-State Health Ministers conference which was held last Friday. He indicated that proposals discussed at that conference were changed this week. This is utter nonsense. The Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar) has not, in any way, departed from the basic policy that was announced by the Government in this House two weeks ago. Of course the States are unhappy. I have never known the States, since Federation, to be happy with any decision made by a government in relation to funding. Let us consider the $16m that has been given to Queensland. Queensland does have a special position. At the present time, in Queensland, 20 per cent of the total number of beds in hospitals are paid beds. Under the formula of the present health arrangements, that figure would be increased to 50 per cent. If this occurred in the first year of the new funding arrangements, it would create certain difficulties for that State. That is an unrealistic position that had to be rectified; hence, of course, the extra assistance that has been given to Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us have a look at the wording of the matter of public importance which we are now debating. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> The detrimental impact on State and personal finances--</PARA>
<PARA>The Government, this financial year, will collect about $34.5 billion. Whether this is collected by way of personal income tax, or by way of indirect taxes such as excise, sales or company tax, it is the duty of this Government to ensure that those collected dollars are spent efficiently. It is not the Government's money; it is the people's money. The money does not belong to Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser. The money does not belong to Mr Howard. The money belongs to the people. (Quorum formed). It is obvious that the Opposition does not like what it hears and therefore it is taking up some of my time. The States, under Fraser federalism, have the capacity to raise their own funds. They can impose their own taxes and their own charges if they want to. We have seen over the years a certain erosion of that capacity to raise funds. It is my view that if they want more money for hospitals they have the capacity to raise that money and spend it on those hospitals or set their own priorities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Opposition stands for bigger government and bigger taxation. In actual fact it is saying that it wants this Government to increase taxes so that there will be more money in the tax pool to pay out to the States for whatever purpose. It is my view and the view of this Government that, as far as possible, the earnings of individuals should be left to those individuals to spend and that, as far as possible, governments should keep their hands out of the pockets of individuals. This is contrary to the statement made by the honourable member for Bonython when he talked about the detrimental impact on personal finances. Indeed, the situation is to the contrary. In actual fact the Government's policy is beneficial to the individual. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Party supports open-ended arrangements. We saw so many of them in the three years of the Whitlam Government. We have seen repeated statements from the honourable member for Bonython and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden)-they are well documented-that they want to see a return to Medibank. The honourable member for Bonython nods approval. That sort of statement should be promulgated as widely and as strongly as possible throughout the nation because the people have not forgotten the three years between 1972 and 1975 when this policy was in operation. That policy was disastrous then and it will be disastrous if Labor ever comes to power and institutes it. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost incurred by governments on behalf of the people in the health field and in other fields must be identifiable. People must be responsible for their own affairs. All accounts, whether they be hospital accounts, accounts for diagnostic services or whatever, should show clearly what costs are involved. Indeed, even if the accounts are not actually paid by the individual because that individual falls into the disadvantaged category-he may be a pensioner or whatever-the costs ought to be set out clearly so that the individual has some idea of what those costs are. Indeed, those persons within our institutions who order these services also ought to be aware of the nature of the costs. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen the general thrust of the health policies that the Commonwealth introduced a few weeks ago supported by most of the States. Queensland, Victoria, Western Australia and South Australia support the general thrust of the policy. They are unhappy with the quantity of money they have received but they support the actual policy involved. The assessment of the hospital payments that has been the subject of some debate over the last three or four days has been made on the data supplied by the States themselves. It has not been based on Commonwealth figures; it has been based on information that has been provided by the States. Of course, as the Minister for Health has stated in the House on more than one occasion, the Commonwealth Grants Commission will look at the situation in relation to the relativities between States and assess whether any State ought to be better treated in the future. </PARA>

<PROCTEXT><PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Debate resumed from 12 May, on motion by Mr Moore:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA> Upon which Mr John Brown had moved by way of amendment:</PARA>
<PARA> That all words after ''That'' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ''whilst not opposing the Bill, the House:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) expresses its concern-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) at the Government's abdication of its responsibility to make national laws for companies and securities pursuant to the Commonwealth's own constitutional powers, and in accordance with the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange in 1974 (the Rae Report);</PARA>
<PARA> (b) at the lack of effective accountability of the National Companies and Securities Commission to either the Government or Parliament of the Commonwealth, or to any other single elected Government or Parliament, and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) that despite the inordinate delay in introducing the legislation, the Parliament of the Commonwealth has not been given an opportunity effectively to scrutinise this bill and associated bills and will not be able effectively to determine company law in the future under the Co-operative Companies and Securities Scheme;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) calls upon the Government in the event of the breakdown for any reason of the scheme, of which the Bill is a part, immediately to proceed to the introduction of Commonwealth legislation for the national regulation of companies;</PARA>
<PARA> (3) notes that this Bill places uniformity before reform in deference to powerful vested interest groups and represents a retreat to the lowest common denominator standard of company law;</PARA>
<PARA> (4) calls upon the Government to expedite the establishment of an Accounting Standards Review Board, and</PARA>
<PARA> (5) calls upon the Government immediately to pursue a fundamental reform of company law, including:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the abolition of the category of ''exempt proprietary company'' and the privileges associated with it;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the provision of statutory directions and powers to the National Companies and Securities Commission and the courts to look behind the corporate entity in appropriate circumstances, to ascertain those who control it or hold shares in it, and, having regard to the purpose of the creation of the corporate entity and the manner of its control, to affix personal liability and adjudicate personal rights where it is just and equitable to do so;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the extension of the powers of inspection of the National Companies and Securities Commission to ensure the fullest reasonable access of the Commission to books;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) the amendment of any provision which enables questionable practices to be hidden by means of legal professional privilege;</PARA>
<PARA> (e) the requirement for all companies to raise and maintain a prescribed minimum nominal and paid up capital;</PARA>
<PARA> (f) rationalisation of the cumbersome provisions in respect of company names on the basis of single nationwide registration;</PARA>
<PARA> (g) a requirement that companies disclose all donations for political purposes;</PARA>
<PARA> (h) a requirement that dividends be paid only from the genuine profits of a company;</PARA>
<PARA> (i) full review of the provisions relating to fund raising and prospectuses to ensure maximum disclosure and to require independent valuation of assets exchanged for issued shares;</PARA>
<PARA> (j) reform of the provisions relating to companies financing dealings in their own shares, including the removal of the exemption given to financial assistance to salaried directors;</PARA>
<PARA> (k) provision for a higher required standard of competence, care and diligence for directors and officers of companies;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Clause 5 specifically refers to the interpretation of the Companies Bill. I wish to speak generally about interpretations and specifically about one of those interpretations. In a Bill where complexity and detail have already passed well beyond any desirable limit, it should be recorded that there are at least six confusingly similar but technically distinct modes of referring to the corporate entities to which the Bill is in various ways applicable. The terms used are as follows: Company, body corporate, corporation, foreign company, recognised company and recognised foreign company. In addition, in certain parts of the Bill reference is made to companies which are intended versions of all of those six foregoing terms. It appears to me that the Government's much vaunted uniformity has done nothing to simplify companies legislation which is what it has allegedly intended to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Turning to one specific interpretation contained in the Bill, that is, the interpretation of an exempt proprietary company, I wish to make a few observations. We of the Opposition believe that exempt proprietary companies and the privileges associated with them should be abolished. My reason for saying that is that there is at present an elaborately defined category called 'exempt proprietary company'. Some of the peculiarities which these companies are allowed to use in the performance of their duties are, firstly, that they need not appoint an auditor, and secondly, that they need not file a copy of their accounts along with their annual returns so long as they either operate as an unlimited company or have the accounts audited. The underlying policy seems to be that companies which are genuinely private, being not directly or indirectly owned or controlled by a public company, should have to appoint an auditor, file accounts or risk unlimited liability but should not be afflicted with more than one of these alternatives. We think that this is muddled thinking. Why should a limited private company, which has gone to the trouble and expense to have an audit, be allowed to keep its accounts in secret to the detriment of creditors and credit rating agencies which perhaps could make good use of those accounts if they were listed? Conversely, why should unaudited accounts which may be inadequate and misleading be the ones which have to be made public?</PARA>
<PARA> In England since 1967 and in other countries a simple formula has applied. The price of limited liability is financial disclosure. We find that this is one of the paramount weaknesses of the Companies Bill as introduced in this chamber. Credit rating agencies have derived significant benefit and private companies have been better induced to look after their finances when they have to disclose their accounts. I note that the report of the United Kingdom's committee of inquiry into small firms, the Bolton Committee, moved exactly as I suggested to eliminate limited private companies. There may be a case for exempting small private companies from disclosing certain individual items. For example, their turnover might be non-disclosable in order to protect them from takeover. The general notion that such private companies should have financial privacy based perhaps on the idea that individual proprietors do not want their employees, or dare I say the tax man, let alone anyone else, to know how rich they are is outmoded and unjustified in a society where pay scales in virtually all salaried employment are easily ascertainable. </PARA>
<PARA> In the interests of simpler company law, better creditor protection and better financial control in small companies, the status of exempt proprietary companies should be abolished and all limited companies compelled to prepare and file audited reports. I leave it at that. I hope that our views are clearly known to the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Moore) in this regard. I think that my colleague the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi) may have some further pointed observations to make on the same clause.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to deal with the matter of exempt proprietary companies which was dealt with by the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown). In my view they ought to be abolished. I suppose one could argue that there are some reasons for retaining the purposes set out in clauses 250 and 278 of the Bill, but sub-clauses (5) and (6) of clause 5 ought to be deleted. In May of last year I sent a telegram to the predecessor of the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs in the following terms:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Further to your answer to question number 5760 and in view of the overriding competence of the EEC in the company law area why have your department and the States failed to closely consider the Bill submitted to the U.K. Parliament. Will you urgently raise this matter at the next Ministerial Council meeting so that adequate consideration may be given to the inclusion of appropriate amendments in the forthcoming Australian legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>I received a letter dated 1 July from the former Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned in my reply that the U.K. Companies Act 1980 will be examined in the context of the draft Commonwealth Companies Bill and also for the purpose of any longer-term reform of the Australian companies legislation. You have now asked why the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs and the States have failed to closely consider the Bill sub- mitted to the U.K. Parliament and you have asked that I urgently raise this matter at the next Ministerial Council meeting. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of reasons why I consider such a course of action is unnecessary. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, officers of the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs have in fact been keeping a watching-brief--</PARA>
<PARA>I interpolate that it must have been done with blinkers on-</PARA>
<PARA>on the passage of this legislation through the U.K. Parliament ever since the proposals were first mooted . . . </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Notwithstanding this time differential, the Companies Bill 1980 in fact contains a number of new provisions which are similar to corresponding reforms in the latest U.K. reforms and I am advised that officers of the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs will be giving close consideration to some of the provisions in the U.K. Companies Act 1980 in the light of public submissions that have been received on the Companies Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>I would be delighted if the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Moore) could explain to me where, in this package of Bills, there are provisions incorporating the United Kingdom legislation. He did not have to wait until 1980 to do so. In the Jenkins committee report of 1962 are recommendations dealing with exempt proprietary companies which were subsequently embodied in legislation. Paragraph 61 of that report states:</PARA>
<PARA> We appreciate the argument that the filing of accounts may cause embarrassment or inconvenience to some exempt private companies though the fears which have been expressed to us on this score are, we believe, exaggerated (like the fears expressed to previous Company Law Committees about the effect of the publication of full accounts by public and, later, by non-exempt private companies). We think that in general such disadvantage as there may be should be accepted because disclosure is right in principal and necessary to protect those who trade with and extend credit to limited companies. But some of the information now required by the Act (or to be required if our recommendations on accounts are accepted) is of much greater interest to shareholders and prospective shareholders than to creditors, and its omission from the copy of the accounts of small unquoted companies, required to be filed with the Registrar and therefore open to public inspection, might perhaps avoid some of the embarrassment without seriously reducing the value to creditors of the filed accounts. Accordingly we would require all companies which are incorporated with the privilege of limited liability to file their accounts with the Registrar of Companies for the benefit of those who may have dealings with them. But we recommend in paragraph 352 below that directors' emoluments, and company turnover and rents should not be required to be disclosed in the filed accounts of companies whose securities have been neither quoted nor offered to the public (this information should however be given in the accounts of such companies circulated to members and debenture holders). </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 62 states:</PARA>
<PARA> We would, on the other hand, exempt all unlimited companies from the requirement to file accounts: we can see no good reason why they should be treated differently, in this respect, from partnerships and individual traders who trade with unlimited liability. </PARA>

The honourable member probably should be reminded that this provision is to be found in the Labor Government's companies Bill of 1974. If he did not learn then, how can he expect us to learn now? He mentioned also the question of exempt proprietary companies. I see no reason for subjecting proprietary companies that are owned by individuals and that are strictly within the personal domain of individuals to public scrutiny if matters are audited. The non-filing provision is strictly in accordance with the privacy of individuals. I cannot accept the proposition of the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown) that turnover would protect people from a takeover.

We need to turn to clauses 278 and 279 to see what advantages an exempt proprietary company has. I think the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown) has already outlined those advantages. In other words, they need not appoint an auditor and need not file a copy of their accounts along with their annual returns as long as they either operate as an unlimited company or have their accounts audited. I believe that there should not be any provision for exempt proprietary companies. From the point of view of trading creditors, exempt proprietary companies are bad. Trading creditors, particularly those small firms which deal with companies, have no guarantee that the company is in a sound financial situation if they cannot see its accounts or if those accounts are not audited. In addition, I believe that employees of private companies should be able to view the finances of those companies in an audited return. I support the view that has been put forward by the Opposition that the exempt proprietary company area of clause 5 should be struck out of the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In our overriding amendment we have a clause which refers to clause 7 in the Companies Bill. That amendment states that we call upon the Government immediately to pursue a fundamental reform of the company law, including the provision of statutory powers to the courts to enable the lifting of the corporate veil in appropriate circumstances, including that whereby a holding and subsidiary company effectively operates as a unit and where a private company acts as a trustee for a trading trust. In backing up that amendment which we have moved I would like to make a few remarks about trading trusts. As I said, we believe that trading trusts, having small private companies as trustees, should be abolished, not left substantially unregulated with only a vague promise of future regulation, as has happened in the second draft of the Companies Bill. Trading trusts provide a classic instance of a tail, that is, tax avoidance by a private business, wagging a dog, that is, carrying on business activity with a proper legal structure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Over the last 100 years or more-not that any of us would remember that; not even you, Mr Deputy Chairman-the Companies Act and the accompanying case laws have built up an elaborate set of rules to which business enterprises must adhere if they are to have such privileges as limited liability. Accounting rules, standards of skill, care and honesty for directors, personal liability of officers when a business is carried on fraudulently-these, along with many other legal protections for existing and potential shareholders, creditors and other interested parties are all based on the premise that the company in question owns and runs the business in its own right. If, instead, a small, grossly under-capitalised company is permitted to hold the business on trust, the value of these protections is, at best, doubtful and, at worst, negligible. In a manner which is wholly confusing to outsiders, the normal roles associated with the company's form are changed around. As an example, the recipients of surplus profits become trust beneficiaries instead of shareholders, although the trustee company itself is a shareholder. Management of the business is formally vested not in the directors but in the company itself in its capacity as trustee and so on. This is merely because tax planners saw that the company-trust combination might produce tax advantages for their clients. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no reason why Parliament should give in and allow many years of work in developing a sophisticated system of company law to be undermined. To allow only private individuals or properly established large-scale trust corporations to manage businesses on trust, as is the case in various parts of Canada, would both preserve the effectiveness of company law and reduce the range of tax fiddles available to private business. We are unsophisticated enough in the Opposition to believe that companies should be set up to enable business to be conducted properly, to enable the shareholders to be properly protected, to enable creditors who are dealing with a company to be properly protected also and not merely to have an opportunity to deceive people by having what is known as the corporate veil pulled across the eyes of those people who seek to do business with that company. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's proposal that the National Companies and Securities Commission and the courts be directed and empowered to look behind the corporate entity, to ascertain those who control it or who hold shares in it, relates to the process known in common law as lifting the corporate veil. Some people euphemistically refer to the corporate veil as the purdah used by capitalist Muslims, but in this case we refer to it as that veil of secrecy which is placed across companies to prevent proper scrutiny of that company and all that it stands for. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OD4">Mr JOHN BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. We believe that this process of lifting the corporate veil is rendered necessary by the long established principle that the company, as a legal entity separate from its shareholders and director, is an artificial legal personality capable of perpetual succession and capable of sueing and being sued. The liability of the company to pay its debts extends to the assets of the company, but the individual shareholder is not liable beyond the amount unpaid on his shares. The misuse of the corporate personality in the shape of $2 companies is very well known. In fact, the offices of the Corporate Affairs Commission are littered with the number of $2 companies that have crashed, to the detriment of employees, creditors and shareholders. The immunity of shareholders and, in the absence of fraud, directors from liability for contractual or tortious wrongs upon the part of a company is in striking contrast to the joint and several liabilities of the partners in the partnership. The courts will not, except in certain limited circumstances, lift the corporate veil unless there is a specific legislative direction to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition requests that these powers be granted and, indeed, that the NCSC and the courts be directed to look to those who should properly be liable in cases where the corporate vehicle is simply used as a shield against liability. I reiterate what I started to say in the first place in relation to this clause and that is that we would like the provision of statutory powers given to the courts to enable the lifting of the corporate veil in appropriate circumstances so that companies can be made accountable both to their creditors, their shareholders and their employees. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CV4">Mr JACOBI</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Recently, if Press reports are an indication, there has been a considerable interest in the trust device to carry on conventional business practices. By using this device the provisions of the Companies Act may be avoided, no matter how many beneficiaries of the trust there are. There is no doubt as to why that device was deliberately deleted from the legislation. We all know that. There has been a contentious decision of the English Court of Appeal that unit holders, as a unit trust, do not associate together for the purpose of gain. That has been the generally accepted position. The Court of Appeal in reaching that decision reversed the decision of Jessell at first instance. The trust device in question was a mere subterfuge for the evasion of companies legislation; it still is. The trustees in reality were directors and the unit holders were really members or shareholders. The modern unit trust vests the trust property in trustees but the property is managed by an independent management company and not by the trustees. I think we ought to understand that. The management company, therefore, fulfils the role normally played by directors. Surely the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Moore) does not dispute that concept.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since the Smith v. Anderson case, trusts involving more than 20 unit holders or beneficiaries have frequently been used to operate investment schemes in companies securities and land. Such fixed or flexible tusts are regulated, or were, by Part IV, Division 5, of the old Companies Act, if units of interests are offered to the public. Until recently, there has been no indication that trusts with more than 20 beneficiaries would be used to carry on conventional business activities. I would like that explained. Such trusts should be subject to the same regulations as companies. Why not? I would like an answer from the Minister as to why they should not be. This is necessary if we are going to protect beneficiaries and creditors of trusts. I hope that the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender) perhaps will get up and we can have a little bit of a debate on the matter. It is recommended that beneficiaries under a trust should be deemed to be associated together for the purposes of the provisions of the Companies Act. This would mean that trusts with 20 or more beneficiaries, established for the purposes of gain, would have to be registered as corporations. The Minister ought think about that. The Ministerial Council ought to think about it. </PARA>
<PARA> Dealing with clause 267 (1) (a), I should like some observations from my kind friend the honourable member for North Sydney. Creditors who deal with management companies may be misled into believing that the property used by a management company belongs to the management company. I will repeat that so that we can debate it. Creditors who deal with management companies may be misled into believing that the property used by a management company belongs to the management company and so will be available to creditors in satisfaction of their claims. We agree on that. That is the position. The reality is simply that the property belongs to beneficiaries of the trust and is not available to creditors. Hence it is important for the legislation to require all companies whose business is to manage property not belonging to them to disclose to creditors that the property apparently in their control and ownership in fact is held in trust. Is anybody prepared to dispute that? I would not think so. Disclosure should be made, firstly, in all business correspondence with creditors and, secondly, in the company's audited annual accounts filed with the Corporate Affairs Commission. At present most companies acting as trading trustees fall within the classification of exempt proprietary companies. As a consequence, those companies do not have to file audited annual accounts. So we have to contend with both-exempt proprietary companies and trading trusts. </PARA>
<PARA> I make two simple observations: Not only does this structure-corporate structure, if you like-avoid being bound by the provisions of the Companies Act but also, I think it is true to say equally that it is a scheme for tax avoidance. It is an indictment of the Ministerial Council that there is not adequate provision to cover trading trusts, and I support my friend the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown). </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me say, since I have been invited to do so, that from this side of the Committee I do not think we would say that one forecloses the question of the introduction of provisions concerning trading trusts. As I understand the position, the matter is under examination. Some very complex questions are raised by the disclosure provisions originally included, and I will put one of those to the Committee. We can have a trust company whose task it is simply to administer trusts. That is a perfectly legitimate exercise. Let us assume in favour of the trust company I am talking about that there is no tax avoidance, no tax evasion, and that it is a perfectly straightforward exercise. One of the problems it then faces when it deals in the open market, for example when buying shares on behalf of a number of different trusts, is the complexity of saying on each occasion: 'We will buy 200 shares for Trust Y, 200 shares for Trust Z, 200 shares for the next trust', and so on. The imposition of the disclosure requirements could be highly technical and not easy to comply with, and I speak of the requirements as they appeared in the April exposure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Honourable members have referred to the use of trusts for tax avoidance purposes. Certainly that takes place, there is no doubt about that, and there is no doubt that companies acting as trustees are sometimes used for the purposes of tax avoidance. But that does not say that we should introduce legislation which may pose many more problems than it cures. I put it to the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi) that, after all, he is not looking at a novel situation. Trusts have been around for a long time, and if we move companies to one side, as it were, and provide that there shall be, as he has said, the lifting of the corporate veil in all cases, then the true tax avoiders will simply find another means of going about it, which I assume would be to have an ordinary trust without a company holding the position of trustee. I certainly agree that it is a matter that is worthwhile looking at, and it should be looked at further, but I have reservations about the provisions as they originally existed in the April exposure draft. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition does not believe that the clause dealing with subsidiaries, holding companies and related corporations affords sufficient protection to the public in the way it is presently drafted. The definition of subsidiaries and holding companies is crucial to other clauses of the Bill. The Bill does not seem to recognise that in a great many cases holding and subsidiary companies act as a unit and not as separate entities. Creditors can therefore be disadvantaged since a holding company need take no steps to bail out the creditors of its insolvent subsidiary. The subsidiary's employees, of course could be similarly affected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Insofar as trusts are concerned, and I believe they are covered by clauses 164 to 167, might I say that over the last 100 years or more the companies Acts and accompanying case law have built up an elaborate set of rules to which business enterprises must adhere if they are to have such privileges as limited liability. Accounting rules, standards of skill, care and honesty of directors, personal liability of officers when a business is carried on fraudulently, along with many other legal protections for existing and potential shareholders, creditors and other interested parties, are all based on the premise that the company in question owns and runs its business in its own right. If, instead, a small, grossly undercapitalised company is permitted to hold the business on trust, the value of these protections is at best doubtful, at worst negligible.

<PARA> I worked in private enterprise for many years prior to coming into this House and I know that many holding companies have subsidiary companies for the purpose of manipulating those subsidiary companies, particularly in high risk areas. They will form subsidiary companies in high risk areas so that, if those companies go bad, there is no loss to the shareholders. There is certainly a loss to creditors and there is certainly a loss to employees. I have seen this happen. Nothing whatsoever happens to the shareholders in the holding company. They get off scot free, but the creditors and employees are left holding the bag. For that reason, I do not think that this clause has been correctly drafted and I believe that the area covering trusts should be completely struck out. </PARA>

For example, in regard to accounts, group accounts must be prepared for subsidiaries, and that is a reference to clauses 269 to 272. However, the Bill goes only part of the way towards dealing with the reality that holding and subsidiary companies act as a unit and are not separate entities. Creditors can be disadvantaged since a holding company need take no steps to bail out the creditors of its insolvent subsidiary-that is a vital attribute as far as we are concerned-and employees can also suffer for the same reason. I instance the case of Massey Ferguson, a company which crashed in Australia a few years ago, which was a subsidiary of a Canadian holding company. The Canadian company made no effort at all to bail out the Australian subsidiary and left creditors, employees, et cetera, lamenting. So we would strongly urge the Minister to see that some reforms can be made in this area in future through the Ministerial Council so that this whole subject of subsidies, holding companies, trust companies, et cetera, is ironed out and made much more specific.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Clause 12 relates to the power of the National Companies and Securities Commission to require the production of books of companies. We have some reservations about this clause. We feel that the Commisson is prevented from getting books in certain circumstances under the provisions of this Bill. For example, we think that the Commission should be able to obtain access to books to enable it to formulate recommendations for law reform. Clause 12 (1) (a) contains a rather pleasant phrase. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Other than the power of the Commission under sub-section 6 (3) of the National Companies and Securities Commission Act. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commission is prevented from obtaining access to books by that sub-clause. We have no doubt that this clause was inserted after the 1980 exposure draft at the behest of business interests wanting to maximise privacy. I guess that in practice the provision is not likely to have any great effect but it raises the point as to how much privacy public companies are entitled to. That runs counter to the Labor Party's argument that requires maximum public accountability. </PARA>
<PARA> Clauses 12 (2) (a) and 12 (3) (a) require that the reason for the examination of the books be specified. The intention is obviously to prevent fishing by the Commission. But we feel that this is not justified in the light of public accountability. In our view it is necessary to distinguish between civil liberties like privacy and the liberties of those engaged in business. I take issue with the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Moore) on this matter-I say in passing that on this side of the House we have considerable respect for his integrity-and disagree violently with his view as to how business should be done. We do not think that doing business with a company under the many guises that companies have and under the many corporate forms that companies may take should be like being involved in a lottery. Certainly there is a risk involved in doing business with some types of companies. The old caveat emptor rule remains paramount. But if a proper national companies law existed, a lot of the risk that is taken both by creditors and shareholders would be eliminated. That is all we are asking for in a national companies law, that proper accountability be made paramount so that companies can not only be seen to be doing business respectably and be doing it respectably but also that they pay their fair share of the tax burden. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with my colleague the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown) that there should be greater access by the Commission to companies' books so that more public accountability exists. I also mention at this stage that I did not say in my earlier remarks that all subsidiary companies set out to take the public in or, indeed, to take creditors in. I said that some of them are set up for that purpose, particularly in high risk areas. I believe that if the Commission is given the proper power it deserves under this clause, it would do away with a lot of those cases involving failed companies. If the Commission was of the opinion that a company was going bad, or likely to go bad, it could pull the books in, make the company more accountable to the public and at least stop some businesses folding up. I believe that particularly in the New South Wales Companies Act there are proper provisions for this. Certainly there is more power in that Act than there is in this legislation. As my colleague the honourable member for Parramatta mentioned earlier, this Bill has been brought together by taking the very least from all of the State Acts; so there is a lowest common denominator. I believe that the Commonwealth should have used its powers more and introduced a national Companies Act rather than this emasculated legislation which we now have. As far as clause 12 is concerned, I believe that insufficient powers have been given to the Commission and I believe that they should so be given.</PARA></TALK.START>

Other circumstances are set out in clause 12 which are, if my recollection is correct, wider than those in existing laws. For my part, I think that businessmen are just as entitled to privacy as ordinary citizens. There should be no greater right of inspection than what is presently conferred by clause 12. Under that clause and in conjunction with the provisions concerning special investigations if it is in the public interest to investigate the affairs of the company, the widest of investigations can be carried out. Witnesses can be examined and books can be inspected and impounded. Taking those provisions together, there are perfectly adequate mechanisms in this Act for the inspection of books. I simply cannot understand how it can be said that to widen the inspection powers in clause 12 would in some way assist law reform. Law reform stems from the examination of a whole series of events.

These are communications which fall within a very narrow compass such as communications made for the purposes of obtaining legal advice to assist, for example, in a case which is coming up or which has been brought against one. Because of the narrowness of the protection, it has to be bona fide legal advice which has been sought, a privileged communication, within the narrow compass that the law has laid down, but an exceedingly necessary compass because we should all be entitled to obtain legal advice; and that includes companies and even company directors.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CV4">Mr JACOBI</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry. Creditors are supposed to be able to rely on a company having a particular issued or paid up share capital and that that capital will remain undiminished by any expenditure other than that on legitimate business. Unfortunately for creditors and for, perhaps, shareholders, the provisions in this Bill will be singularly ineffective in making the share capital concept an effective barrier against losses. There is nothing in this Bill to strengthen that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The English position and that applying in this country stands in marked contrast to that applying to countries throughout the European Economic Community. I regret to say that the rot set in at a very early stage. The National Limited Liability Act was enacted about 1855. It provided for three basic issues: Minimum share capital of #250 had to be paid in excess of 20 per cent; three-quarters of the company's nominal capital had to be prescribed; and the company had to be wound up if three-quarters of its capital had been lost. The situation has deteriorated a lot since then. Each one of those safeguards has disappeared. They disappeared as early as 1862. They have not been replaced. There is nothing in this Bill to replace them. Other restrictions to protect creditors-that is, the rules that reductions of capital must be approved by the court and dividends must not be paid out of capital-have proved, regrettably, weak in practice. It is an unfortunate fact that, in the United Kingdom and Australia, creditors cannot afford to rely on a company's capital. I do not think that anybody in this chamber would disagree with that statement. It is a regrettable fact of the corporate structure in Australia. Few companies that are wound up are able to meet their debts, let alone return any capital to their members. </PARA>
<PARA> The English Act of 1855 required all companies with limited liability status to have at least #250 in minimum share capital. That provision disappeared in 1962. Ever since then it has become possible, as I said the other night, to form a limited liability company with a share capital of seven shares for a par value of about one farthing. We have not changed from that. We have allowed that provision, in Australia, to reach 2c and for public companies 5c. That is a scandal. At least, the 1862 Jenkins Act reported that in principle it would favour a statutory minimum paid up share capital. It further noted that under capitalisation was a major cause of business failure. Nobody denies that. Experience in this country certainly supports that concept. But it declined to recommend the introduction of a minimum paid up capital requirement because it would be relatively easy to evade. I suppose that is true. In particular, it would be difficult to prevent a company from returning its minimum capital to its promoters in exchange for assets by way of loan or by some other way. It is interesting to note that the supposed difficulties with minimum capital requirements have not prevented some European countries from enforcing it. Austria has a minimum paid up capital requirement--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;France has a minimum paid up capital requirement of $3,650; the Federal Republic of Germany has a requirement for $7,700; Italy has a requirement for $50. That is marvellous, is it not? Australia is not even on a par with that. Australia's requirement is for a minimum paid up capital of 5c. Sweden has a requirement for $10,500; in Switzerland, it is $7,200. It is interesting that the Netherlands has no prescribed minimum capital; but, if Australia did not have that requirement, perhaps it could apply the provisions that apply in the Netherlands. The Netherlands does have the provision that authorised capital must not be more than five times the issued capital. Furthermore, the Ministry of Justice will not authorise the formation of a company unless it believes that the company's issued capital is appropriate in view of the company's objects and other financial sources. I would settle for that provision. That is far better than the inadequate provisions applying in this legislation. If we look at that panorama, I suppose it can be seen that the minimum capital requirements are the order of the day. In Australia, a minimum paid up capital of perhaps $10,000 would be appropriate for proprietary companies, while $50,000 would be appropriate for public companies. We ought to think about it. These amounts should be reviewed regularly to take account of inflation. I think that existing companies should be required to conform with the requirements within 12 months of the commencement of the legislation. When we consider the high level of liquidations in this country and the devastating effect liquidation has on shareholders and creditors we can see that this is an appalling piece of legislation. I suggest to the Minister that this is one of the matters that ought to rate highly at the next meeting of the Ministerial Council.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi) has fully summed up our reservations about this area. In fact, I think that we probably have stronger reservations about this part of the Bill than we have about any other part of it. That is why our second reading amendment referred to modifying or altering the law so that the raising and the maintenance of a prescribed minimum nominal and paid up capital for all companies became mandatory. I noticed with some interest that the honourable member for Hawker suggested what might be the minimum amounts required for Australian companies, and I would not argue with that. His suggestion is certainly a long way in advance of 2c and 5c, which I am sure even the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs finds quite ludicrous.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I am sure he does. I think the examples which the honourable member for Hawker gave of the minimum paid up capital in other nations should be quite enlightening for us when we look at the sort of companies law under which we battle in Australia. Unfortunately Australian company law has never required a minimum nominal or issued company capital. Of course, that has been used historically to the detriment of creditors and shareholders. One solution, I would suggest, is to require the amount of capital to be included in the name of a company if it is less than a certain amount-for example, Bloggs $100 Pty Ltd-and require so much to be paid up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In European Economic Community countries, particularly the United Kingdom, it is now necessary for public companies to issue shares to a nominal value of not less than the authorised minimum-in the United Kingdom that amount is $50,000-and to receive payment of not less than one-quarter of the nominal value of each issued share. We do not argue that that exact example should be introduced in Australia, but we think that anything that gets us away from the $2 companies would have to be an advancement. We find that to be one of the prime failings of this Bill. I am sure the Minister agrees with me and the Opposition generally in this respect. I am sure that we have sufficient faith in the Minister to be confident that he will press this matter at the next Ministerial Council meeting notwithstanding all the difficulties of having to obtain agreement from a majority of seven State governments. This would be one area in which he should have a specific look at taking Australia out of the ridiculous situation it is in at the moment where a company can be formed with 2c or 5c capital. This is an abolutely ridiculous situation in 1981. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; We are now dealing with one of the cumbersome parts of the Bill. We are calling on the Government to rationalise the cumbersome provisions in respect of company names. It seems to us to be quite ludicrous that we need 24 or 25 clauses in this Bill to cater for the names that companies may give themselves. I point out that the Labor Government's Bill which was rejected in 1974 would have eliminated a great deal of this verbiage and perhaps only four or five clauses would have covered the same area. The procedure for reserving and registering company names, already complicated and expensive, especially when multi-State trading is involved, becomes in fact a legal nightmare under this Bill. A quick glance at the index to the Companies Bill and the section headings in Division 2 of Part III will indicate the enormous number of different procedures for reservation and registration, depending on the precise nature, location and trading intentions of the company in question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Perhaps the most striking example is clause 57, which refers to 'Registration of name of foreign company that has become a recognised company after transfer of incorporation to participating State or Territory'. Surely even my learned legal friend the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender) could find a simpler way than that mouthful of rationalising that name. A good deal of the complexity is attributable to the numerous related but technically distinct names applicable to the corporate entity. I refer to clause 5 (1), which covers about five or six pages of the Bill and deals with the various types of companies that can be established. More importantly, the opportunity has been lost in this Bill to simplify the company names procedure by enabling companies to make an available search on a national basis and permitting only those names to be registered which are nationally available because such a system would obviate the need to specify the particular States in which registration is desired and would more particularly, if computerised, greatly reduce administrative cost. I would refer that suggestion to the Minister. It just seems to us to be flamboyantly excessive to have 24 or 25 clauses to list the number and types of names that companies might have. Perhaps this is another area in which the Minister might suggest to the Ministerial Council some quick reform. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Clause 67 deals with the powers of companies. We would like something to be done about this area. We ask the Committee to agree to our proposals, which would give the Government power to require the disclosure of donations paid for political purposes. Need I say any more? There is a requirement for companies to list donations to charitable causes. Whilst I could never in any of my wildest dreams consider the Liberal Party to be a charitable cause, I would like to think that that power should be extended to make sure that any donation to a political party should be made public, as is the case under United Kingdom law. I would like to be able to pick up the Ansett accounts every year and find there is a donation of $50,000 to the Liberal Party. At least the public would know who supports political parties. If our suggestion were implemented the same thing would apply perhaps to other organisations that contribute to the Australian Labor Party. We have nothing to hide or to fear. If this were done, I think the whole area of companies law would be considered to be more decent. Certainly, it would have a great deal more prestige if these sorts of donations from companies, public or otherwise, were made public.

<PARA>. . . full review of the provisions relating to fund-raising and prospectuses to ensure maximum disclosure and to require independent valuation of assets exchanged for issued shares. </PARA>
<PARA>In supporting the amendment I mention that in October 1970 the Company Law Advisory Committee, better known as the Eggleston Committee, reported to the Standing Committee of the Attorneys-General on control of 'Fund Raising, Share Capital and Debentures'. The detailed report of the Committee contained sections on the protection of investors in relation to fund raising operations, statutory provisions relating to prospectuses and the content of prospectuses. Some of the Committee's recommendations over the years have been implemented but the present Bill involves no significant changes in the prospectus provisions. Once again the opportunity to utilise the deliberations of the only expert committee to look at company law in Australia in the last 20 years has been missed. We feel that this is a deplorable state of affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is particularly concerned to ensure maximum disclosure to prospective purchasers of shares or debentures and to ensure that the interests of existing shareholders are not prejudiced by the issue of shares for non-pecuniary consideration, for example, in the form of assets. The latter requires a statutory obligation to obtain an independent evaluation. I think that probably there have been bad manifestations of that weakness in the law in the not too distant past. I will not mention all such instances, but the Negri River Corporation share trading was probably a fairly good example of that. I will not say any more on that matter except that the Opposition is not at all happy with the provision regarding prospectuses and the lack of information contained in them. The Opposition requires urgent reform in that area to make sure that investors buying shares in a company are fully protected and fully warned in advance of what they can expect by proper reference to a properly detailed prospectus. </PARA>

It is a very important part of the capital market. In my view it constitutes the crunch of the matter because the invitation to the public to subscribe is the starting point for investment. Because of that we need to look at the areas not only in terms of shares, prospectuses, the memorandum of offer, the type of share for asset exchange and the type of share options offered to various people from time to time such as employees or particular directors but also in terms of unsecured notes, notes and debentures and the type of debentures offered. Far too often in the past the type of prospectus offered to the public, whilst meeting the technical requirements, certainly did not give the necessary information as to what the issue was for and the real purpose behind it. With valuation, particularly in the area of the acquisition of assets for shares, there is a need for, I think, more certification of value assets and where they really come from.</PARA></TALK.START>

That is the part of which there is an appalling gap in the report of the issuing by company shareholders to the Corporate Affairs Commission. I will not canvass the whole issue to the report which was very competently made to the South Australian Government in 1977.

I suggest to the Minister that this is one area that ought to be looked at closely by the Ministerial Council. I will read some brief extracts from sections 24 to 27 of the United Kingdom Companies Act 1980. Sub- section (1) of section 24 reads:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a public company shall not allot shares as fully or partly paid up . . . otherwise than in cash unless--</PARA>
<PARA>This is then set out in paragraph (b) which states:</PARA>

<PARA>I will not read any further. The point I am trying to make simply is that there is more than ample coverage in a provision if it were inserted in the Bill to cover this situation as has been done in the United Kingdom Act. As I said earlier I see no reason at all why in fact the Ministerial Council or its advisers could not have examined this provision in the period they have had. It is not an unusual provision to be in the United Kingdom Act. It is also far more competently set out, if I might say so, in the Swedish Act.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Clauses 116 and 117, when read together, clearly seek to limit a limited liability company to issuing shares at a discount of up to 10 per cent provided that the companies memoranda or articles do not prohibit the practice. That is referred to in clause 117 (1) (a). It parrots paragraph 302 of the explanatory memorandum with which the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Moore) has kindly furnished the Parliament. That paragraph indicates that clause 117 applies to all payments, not just to commissions and brokerage which the explanatory memorandum states, in effect, that the provision deals with. Sub-clause 117 (2) states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . the allowance of a discount by a company shall be taken to be the making of a payment by the company. </PARA>
<PARA>Consequently, the provisions of the following clause, clause 118, which are aimed at ensuring the creditors and shareholders are not prejudiced by the discount share issues, have no application to discounts of up to 10 per cent. Clause 117 ought to be amended so that it covers only commissions paid to underwriters and a brokerage paid to registered sharebrokers in connection with an issue of company shares. I would like some response from the ministerial advisers on that matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the part of the Bill dealing with commissions was intended to make it clear that companies could legitimately pay underwriting and brokerage commissions incurred in issuing shares without infringing the prohibition of issuing shares at a discount. It is worded very broadly, and it is arguable that a company could legitimately issue shares to anyone under this clause at a discount of up to 10 per cent. I suggest it ought to be amended so that it authorises only underwriting commissions, salesmen's commissions and brokerage commissions incurred in the issue of company shares. I believe that clause is defective to that extent, and again I ask the Minister to raise the matter in the Ministerial Council. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This clause relates to re-operation. The National Companies Bill, a private member's Bill introduced by the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen) in 1976, abolished the articles of memorandum distinction and simply adopted the concept of company rules. Clause 73(1) provides that the memorandum of a company may be altered to the extent and in a manner provided by the Act, but not otherwise. Clause 73 (2) provides:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Subject to this section, sub-section 78 (3) and section 320, if a provision of the memorandum of a company could lawfully have been contained in the articles of the company, the company may, unless the memorandum prohibits the alterations of that provision, alter that provision by special resolution. </PARA>
<PARA>Clause 73 (5) states:</PARA>
<PARA> Nothing in sub-section (2) permits the alteration of a provision of the memorandum of a company that relates to rights to which only members included in a particular class of members are entitled. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, class rights clauses cannot be altered under this provision. The question I raise with the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Moore) is whether clause 125 (2) permits the alteration of a class rights clause which is contained in the company's memorandum of association, where there is no existing variation procedure, prohibition or variation. Clause 125 (2) (a) applies where rights are attached to shares included in a class of shares. But nowhere in clause 125 is there any express reference to the rights clause itself, as distinct from the variation of the rights clause-that is important-being in the memorandum of association. Clause 125 (2) expressly allows the memorandum to be altered so as to include a variation of the rights clause. I can see the ministerial advisers are certainly following the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 125 (2) does not expressly or by necessary implication state that class rights provisions in the memorandum of association may be altered by adhering to the stated procedure. It must therefore be considered doubtful that such a provision could be altered under clause 125 when clauses 72 and 73 are borne in mind. I suggest that that is where the conflict exists. Perhaps this doubt could be resolved. I ask the Minister to reconsider this and perhaps the Ministerial Council and the advisers could look at it and amend clause 125 (2) to read: 'Rights are attached to shares included in a class of shares whether in the memorandum of articles of association of the company or otherwise'. It seems clear from clause 125 (3) that rights clauses in the memorandum are included and intended to be altered. The consequential amendment to clause 126 is obvious. It would have to read: 'Rights are attached to shares in a company whether in a memorandum of articles of association or the company, or otherwise'. There would also have to be a consequential amendment to clause 127. I ask the Minister to look at that. I believe there are some anomalies and that at least that part of the legislation should be straightened up. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Part of the Opposition's amendment to the motion for the second reading of the Bill related to clauses 129 to 136. We asked for the reform of the provisions relating to companies financing dealings in their own shares, including the deletion of salaried directors from the definition of employees. Of course, the Labor Party approves of any scheme to assist employees to buy shares in the company they work for. However, we feel that often these schemes are really only perks for directors. The privileges do not usually get down to those on the shop floor. In fact, in the United Kingdom the Labor Government's companies Bill of 1978 recognised the possibility of abuse and excluded salaried directors from the definition of employees. We certainly agree with that. We believe that the provision in clause 129 (1) (a) and (b) which exempts financial assistance in respect of any director holding salaried employment or an officer of the company from the provision of these clauses is unwarranted and should be removed. Clause 129 (4) states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . a company shall be taken to have given financial assistance in connection with an acquisition or proposed acquisition referred to in paragraph (1) (a) if, when the financial assistance was given to a person, the company was aware that the financial assistance would financially assist--</PARA>
<PARA>I pose a question to the Minister in relation to clause 129 (4). How can a company be aware that financial assistance would financially assist? It seems to be a pejorative question to begin with but in the absence of any deeming provision it must be wondered which of the company's officers or employees must be aware of the relevant facts for the company to be held to be aware of the same facts. It need only be said that in the state of the common law at present the criteria governing those persons who can bring this primary liability on a company are very ill-defined. We are asking for some assistance in that area. I hope that the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Moore) will heed those remarks and refine the language of clause 129. More particularly, we are concerned at the possibility of employees not getting the advantage that is obviously intended because, as I have pointed out, when these things are promulgated they normally do not go to those most in need. </PARA>
<PARA> We also have some grave reservations about clause 130, which relates to the consequences of a company financing dealings in its own shares. We feel that some sad consequences could follow from that sort of practice. Notwithstanding commercial opinion to the contrary, some provisions are necessary to catch certain abusers. I give a couple of examples. For instance, person A may borrow money to take over company B and then strip the assets of company B to finance the loan he used to purchase the company in the first place. That is a perfectly good example of the consequences of companies financing dealings in their own shares. Another example is when the controllers of a company strip the assets of that company to feather their own shareholdings. We are very worried about that. The wording of clause 129 (4) (b) may not extend to the first mentioned abuse, that is, person A borrowing from company B to finance the purchase of the same company, because of the phrase 'of the subscription' which is included in the text. The Minister should look into these clauses and bring some of the difficulties before the Ministerial Council. If he does so there may be some improvements in the drafting of those clauses to eliminate possible abuses. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take notice of what has been said. This is a very technical area. Whilst the Government did not accept the Opposition's amendment to the motion for the second reading of the Bill, I will look into the matters raised in it. I think the proposition of employee shares is a vital one in the administration of any company and every encouragement ought to be given to their issue. The difficulty lies not so much with the companies and the issue of the shares but with the taxation implications. Under the present Income Tax Assessment Act those shares afford a disadvantage to employees rather than a straight-out advantage. The problem lies not so much within the Companies Act as within the Income Tax Assessment Act. As a general rule, whilst the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown) seemed to suggest that only directors or senior executives were the participants--</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EI4">Mr MOORE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take the point. The most important thing to me is that the advantages ought to be open to all employees. Naturally, they will depend on the scale of responsibility. In my view, companies would be well advised to look at the issue of employees' shares in their own interests and in the interests of the shareholders. Secondly, I think that the redemption of shares is a very technical area. I noticed recently an article by the Australian Merchant Bankers Association which supported the proposition. In principle, I think there is a lot to recommend it. It is a practice used in the United States of America in redemption of certain shares under financial conditions of a company. There are circumstances in which it would be of advantage to a corporation. Whilst I do not think that is the general application, it may well be that the Ministerial Council should give consideration to its application with certain qualifications.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want some clarification of clause 229. I have discussed it with the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Moore) who had the courtesy to allow me to discuss it with his ministerial advisers. We disagreed, but I would like to put the matter on the record for future reference. I raised the position of receivers appointed out of court under clauses 229 (5) and 535 (4) as distinct from receiver managers. Subject to clause 229 they cannot seek relief from the court under clause 535. I can anticipate the answer from the Minister that the word 'officer' in the definition clause as well as in clause 535 (4) has a broader meaning than the definition under clause 5 (1). I do not accept that. However, I suggest to the Minister that he return to the drawing board and introduce an appropriate amendment which I will indicate later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Under clause 535, the court has the power to grant relief to certain persons in connection with civil proceedings brought against them for negligence, default, breach of trust or a breach of duty. Breaches of clause 229 would be within clause 535 to the extent that a company has a civil right to claim loss or damage sustained as a result of a breach of clause 229 (6). The persons who can seek relief under clause 535 are set out in clause 535 (4). They are (a) an officer of a corporation; (b) an auditor of a corporation; (c) an expert; or (d) a receiver, receiver and manager, liquidator or other person appointed or directed by the court to carry out any duty under this Act in relation to a corporation. The question which I pose is: Are previously appointed receivers entitled to seek relief under clause 535? Rather anomalously the answer would appear, in my view, to be no. </PARA>
<PARA> The reference to 'officer' in clause 535 (4) (a) seems to be a reference to 'officer' as defined in clause 5 (1)-that is, the definition clause-rather than 'officer' as defined in clause 229. That this seems so is clear by the reference in clause 535 (4) (d) to court appointed receivers and receivers and managers. This provision would be unnecessary if 'officer' was intended to be covered by the definition in clause 229 because that definition clearly embraces court appointed receivers and receivers and managers, whereas the clause 5 (1) definition expressly excludes them. Clause 535 (4) should be amended so that it covers all persons, and in particular privately appointed receivers, who come within the clause 229 definition of 'officer'. I suggest to the Minister that we ought to amend that clause as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Clause 535, by adding to sub-clause (e) 'a receiver of the property or any part of the property of the corporation appointed under a power contained in an instrument'. </PARA>
<PARA>That would overcome what is in fact, in my view, a clear oversight. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now deal with the question of clause 237. I believe the clause should be amended. Again, the word 'officer' as defined in clause 237 (1) would apply only to those persons within the clause 5 (1) definition of 'officer'. Consequently, clause 237 (1) would not catch exemption or indemnification provisions relating to privately appointed receivers and court appointed receivers, receivers and managers and liquidators. All of these classes of persons are subject to clause 229 which refers to duties in favour of the company. It follows that 'officer' in clause 227 should have the same meaning as it has in clause 229. The same amendment should be inserted as in clause 229. I also suggest to the Minister that he take back to the Ministerial Council the suggestion that we add a new sub-clause to clause 229 which deals with the protection of shareholders. Such a provision is contained in the Swedish Act and it highlights in effect the total inadequacy of the current provision. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard an extract of the Swedish Companies Act. I refer to chapter 9, section 3 of the 1975 Act. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a few short remarks on clause 229 of the Companies Bill. We are asking for the provision of a higher required standard of competence, care and diligence for directors and officers of companies. I doubt that anybody would disagree with that as a sentiment. We feel that the provisions of the Bill set a fairly low standard in this area. The previous draft exposure had much more stringent requirements for diligence and care by directors. In fact, it imposed a stricter test and involved a certain amount of subjectivity. The draft stated that the care, diligence and skill required was to be not less than what a reasonably prudent person would exercise in relation to his own business or affairs in comparable circumstances. Unfortunately, the Confederation of Australian Industry, as well as other heavy lobby groups, has seen to it that the teeth have been taken out of the legislation which is now before us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We believe the standard of skill which is appropriate to directors and other officers should be made explicitly objective-that is, assessed according to the standards of a reasonable person, at least in relation to the directors on the board of a quoted company. The subjective criteria established in the present law let incompetent directors off far too lightly. I think that is a view that is universally accepted by many people, not only of the Opposition, but in the commercial area. The directors that we are talking about are only assessed according to the degree of confidence which persons of their background, experience and qualifications might be expected to have. Surely that leaves a great deal of value judgment to somebody who is adjudicating in this area. Whilst this approach is probably legitimate for directors of small backyard companies or perhaps the corner service station, it makes no sense to directors of large quoted companies, because these people certainly are quasi professionals, being paid large sums to take care of shareholders' funds and also the money of creditors. To a great extent they are responsible for the tenure of employment of the workers. We feel that like other professionals, such as doctors or lawyers, their performance should be assessed on the objective standards. </PARA>
<PARA> The companies Acts in Europe and particularly in the United Kingdom are more stringent in this area than is this Bill. We would hope that the Minister would make a more serious attempt to strengthen the supervision of directors in quoted companies as well as all other companies. Following on from the suggestions made to the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Moore) by the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi), perhaps the Minister might look at the provisions contained in the Swedish Bill. Perhaps those provisions might be able to be altered for or implemented in the Australian scene. We would hope so anyhow. </PARA>

<PARA> In relation to the matters put forward by the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown), I can only say that the company directors are the owner's representatives. Those are the facts of life. The board of directors represents the owners. The managing director is the management. I can understand that some sensitivities exist when one looks at the Australian Labor Party in Queensland in relation to its broadcasting station. Some considerable difficulties and problems are being experienced in recognising who represents the owners of the ALP radio station. I can understand the particular interest in the subject. Nevertheless the competence, care and skill of those gentlemen is now being tested in the Supreme Court of Queensland. That will make remarkable reading. I am sure the honourable member had that matter in mind. </PARA>
<PARA> The appointment of directors is of considerable significance. The directors represent the proprietors of the corporation. In my view people are sometimes appointed as directors because they are friends within friends rather than people with straightout management competence for appointment to directorships. I understand the points that have been brought forward. The members of boards should recognise that they represent proprietary interests. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise again the matter of shareholders' rights. Those rights have been neglected by the provisions of the Bill. In relation to members' petitions, I suggest that clause 247 ought to be amended by replacing the words 'and (unless the company otherwise resolves) at the expense of those members' with the words 'at the expense of the company'. Under clause 247 (5) a company has the power to apply to the court to prevent the right specified in clause 247 (1) from being abused. This clause ought to be amended to extend the rights to individual members. They ought to be able to insist on the company forwarding details of any resolution of the members at the same time as the notice of meeting is sent to all members. This is absent from the Bill. The expense ought to be borne by the company. It should also be possible for an individual shareholder to cause the company to circulate on his behalf a statement with respect to any business to be dealt with at the meeting. The circulation of these statements should arguably be at the shareholders' expense unless the company otherwise agrees. In any event, the expense could be minimised if the statement accompanied the notice of the meeting. This is yet another clear indication of the fact that little respect is shown to the shareholders in the provisions of the Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I raise one further matter which is not pertinent to the matter I have just mentioned. I have tried for a long time to get a provision in this respect included in the Bill. I refer to proxy shares. It has nothing to do with this section of the Bill, but I ask the Minister to think about this matter. I believe that proxy shares are an important part of shareholders' rights. A shareholder should have the right not only to appoint a proxy but also to instruct a proxy in certain specific and important areas, such as the appointment or dismissal of a director or an auditor. The shareholder is neglected in this respect in the provisions of this Bill. </PARA>

Under sub-clause (5) a company has the right to disclose on request the beneficial owners of its shares. It is not obliged to do so. Sub-clause (4) states that once this ownership is disclosed by a company it is listed on a separate share register which sets out the beneficial owners. Sub-clause (5) states that separate parts of the register are open for inspection only by a member of the company or persons authorised so to do by the Corporate Affairs Commission. Sub-clause (9) gives the Corporate Affairs Commission power to exempt disclosure. I trust that I am reading accurately the provisions of the Bill on those four points.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am grateful to the honourable member. A very interesting letter by Bertram Cox in the Adelaide Advertiser of August of last year puts this matter far more succinctly than I can. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The law imposes restrictions on who may hold shares in an Australian company and also prescribes the maximum percentage they may acquire in any particular enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA> Foreign investment in Australian companies is controlled, particularly in extractive industries takeover procedures are invoked when more than a certain percentage is held, multiple ownership of television stations is prevented and 'insider' trading by directors and others can be traced. All sound and acceptable policies. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet these controls can be vitiated at will by the use of nominee companies, a trend that is growing in this country. Any person or company can buy as many shares as they desire, record them in XYZ Nominees Ltd and their ownership will remain as secret as a Swiss bank account. </PARA>
<PARA> How wrong this is. It completely vitiates the intention of the legislation. The share registers of companies are open to inspection by the public, yet major shareholdings through this 'cloak and dagger' method remain concealed from view. </PARA>
<PARA> If nominee companies are permitted to continue-and I remain unconvinced of their necessity or desirability-legislation should be introduced to require nominee companies-usually banks-to supply to companies a monthly list of the owners of shares held by them as nominees in those companies. This information would then become available, and rightly so, to the general public on a search of the companies' registers. </PARA>
<PARA> Where is the justification for secrecy in what should be and otherwise is, a matter open to the public?</PARA>
<PARA>Insofar as overseas companies Acts are concerned, whether they be in the European Economic Community, encompassing France, West Germany and the United Kingdom or in Canada and the United States, perhaps they are equally as defective as these Bills in relation to nominee shareholdings. I think this is regrettable and scandalous. I put a series of questions on the Notice Paper which highlight the utter deficiency of this piece of legislation. I asked the Treasurer (Mr Howard) the following question:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Can he say what proportion of shares in each of the following companies:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) BHP</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) Peko-Wallsend</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) Western Mining Corporation</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) North Broken Hill</PARA>
<PARA> (v) Pancontinental Mining</PARA>
<PARA> (vi) CSR</PARA>
<PARA> (vii) MIM Holdings</PARA>
<PARA>is held by bank or other nominee companies. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. Further, can he say what proportion of the nominee shareholding in each of these companies is in turn foreign owned, and if not, why not. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. Is it a fact that nominee shareholding of major Australian mining companies has increased steadily over the past few years. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. If so, is the Treasurer and the FIRB concerned by this development. </PARA>
<PARA> 5. Is it also a fact that the Treasurer has powers under Sectin 36 (1) of the Foreign Takeovers Act to require disclosure of the persons or corporations on whose behalf the interest is held by nominee companies. </PARA>
<PARA> 6. If so, has he used his powers to discover what foreign interests are involved in nominee companies which have significant shares in the mining companies above. </PARA>
<PARA>The answer is obviously no. </PARA>
<PARA> 7. If he has not used these powers, why not, and will he do so with urgency. </PARA>
<PARA> 8. Will the Government allow Australian equity in the above companies to continue to decline, or does it propose any action to limit foreign ownership through nominee companies. </PARA>
<PARA> 9. What proportion of shares in each of the following banks is held by that bank's own nominee companies:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) ANZ</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Bank of NSW</PARA>
<PARA> (c) National</PARA>
<PARA> (d) CBC</PARA>
<PARA> 10. What is the rank, in terms of the number of shares held, that each nominee has in its parent bank. </PARA>
<PARA> 11. Is it a fact that where a bank nominee company holds shares in its holding company, even if this is on behalf of a third party, that the bank is enabled to act in the same fashion as if it were dealing in its own shares, by virtue of the power granted by the beneficial owner. </PARA>
<PARA> 12. If so, will he discuss with the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs-</PARA>
<PARA>I hope he has done so already-</PARA>
<PARA>the need to include appropriate provisions in the proposed National Companies Securities legislation to rectify this gap, and if not, why not. </PARA>
<PARA>Let me just pass one simple observation. The provisions in the Bill are not sufficient. They are not good enough. They are defective. They are ineffective. The only way to protect Australian equity and the resources that this country wants to develop is to force disclosure of nominee shareholdings. I will be delighted to get answers to those extensive questions. I doubt whether I will get them within the next month. I sincerely ask the Minister to note that this is one area which, in this country's interests, ought to be re-raised with the Ministerial Council to ensure that there are adequate provisions in this legislation providing for the forced disclosure of nominee shareholdings. </PARA>

I think that anybody who was listening to him could only be impressed with his sincerity on this subject and his innate knowledge of the problems of this sort of shareholding. I repeat that we demand that the Companies Bill be amended to allow full disclosure to the public of the beneficial ownership of all shares in companies. Public accountability and the philosophy of disclosure demand that the information be open not only to the company but also to the public. Clause 261 (9) referring to the discretion of the National Companies and Securities Commission to exempt a person from the provision of the Bill is something which rather terrifies and horrifies us. I repeat our strong desire that the Bill be amended in this area and that the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities will see that full disclosure is available to everybody, so that anybody trading with a company will know with whom he is trading.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also wish to compliment the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi) on his certain depth of knowledge of these matters. Clause 261 enables the company concerned to inquire of shareholders as to who the beneficial holders are. Having acquired that information it will then be registered in a special register which will be available to the National Companies and Securities Commission and to members of the company.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I just give a brief outline as to why we have a nominee company. It is one of those things which mystique has also built up as a bogy. It is used for very valid commercial reasons, besides the matter of privacy. The commercial reasons are that, in a sense as a broker, one almost invariably runs one's own nominee company, because there are an enormous number of occasions when one has to accumulate shares or register shares to protect oneself against dividends or rights in an issue and that could not be done in one's name. Under the requirements of the Stock Exchange this has to be done through a nominee company. Exactly the same provision applies, therefore, to the banking nominee companies. These companies are very heavily used in certain personal cases and certainly in the cases of overseas investments in Australia. This is done through banking corporations, through nominee companies for the very precise reasons that one has to clear one's currency. Therefore, one is apt to use and register shares that are bought in London or New York and nominate those through a nominee company while one is clearing currency. The banks will not release the script until a person pays, or in the reverse, where a person happens to be selling he registers it with the bank nominee company and declares those shares to the purchasers in New York, London or wherever on receipt of money. It is very obvious that nominee companies are heavily used in those situations for registration of overseas payments. Those are two valid reasons that brokers use them. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the takeover code it is necessary, once a level of 20 per cent is reached under the new threshold agreement which will be applicable as a legislative base, I hope from 1 July, to declare one's hand. That in itself is a threshold means. I am aware, as well as anybody, that nominee companies have been used for a number of warehousing and other techniques. I am well aware of that. I do not wish to let the other side of the coin be shown. These companies are a very useful commercial device. I would support their use. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; We are now dealing with Division 2, accounts. I thought that the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi) was going to rise to speak to a previous clause which we did not debate. One point that I would like to make, Mr Deputy Chairman, if I have your indulgence-I think the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs would probably agree with me-is that we are insisting that companies should have more frequent accounts, at least for quoted companies. The reason that we particularly want to question the Companies Bill in that area is that there is a perfectly good example in the Associated Securities Ltd collapse a couple of years ago where people were still devoting their savings to a body which was at risk. If accounts had been published more frequently then perhaps these people may not have done just that because the previous years' accounts were no guide to the investors in that area. I am glad that I have had your indulgence, Mr Deputy Chairman, to make that remark.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I get back to the area of accounts we are debating. In the exposure draft of the Companies Bill certain provisions were inserted as Part 6aa in relation to companies acting as trustees of trading trusts. In essence these provisions required the company to indicate on all its business documents that it was carrying on business as a trustee and to name the trust. They required the directors in their report, forming part of the annual accounts, to specify the business or businesses that were carried on by the company as trustees of a trading trust and to state whether the assets of the trust were sufficient to discharge the liabilities of the company as trustee. The Opposition welcomed those proposed provisions as being, firstly, an important protection to persons dealing with companies acting as trustees of trading trusts, alerting them that the company was not trading in its own right, and secondly, we found that it was a disincentive to the use of trading trusts as a vehicle for tax avoidance by requiring the trustee capacity of the company to be publicly disclosed. Perhaps-I might say this cynically-predictably these proposals brought a storm of protest from the corporate sector. Regrettably the Government succumbed and removed these provisions from the Bill in its second draft. We find that rather regrettable. </PARA>
<PARA> We urge that legislation be prepared forthwith incorporating as a minimum the provisions of the original Part 6aa of the exposure draft. We bring this to the Minister's attention most forcefully. We find one of the real weaknesses of this Bill to be that those provisions that were so much of a reform nature in the exposure draft have been deleted from the Bill that we are now debating. I hope that will be another area in which the Minister might be able to use his good offices and no doubt his forceful arguments to prevail upon the Ministers of the Ministerial Council to see that that original draft be incorporated as an amendment in this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I reinforce the comments made by the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown) in regard to this clause which deals with accounts and auditing. The Opposition has moved that the Bill be amended. I know that it cannot be amended at this stage because of problems with the States, but I think this is something that should be dealt with fairly quickly once the Act is proclaimed. We feel that the Bill is inadequate. I have three specific points to outline. Firstly, I know that in particular the existing legislation in New South Wales requires the principal accounting officers of the companies to state whether, to the best of their knowledge and belief, the accounts give a true and fair view of matters. That requirement does not appear anywhere in this Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has been deleted. The requirements in the Bill for the keeping of accounts and the submitting of those accounts to a corporation or the Corporate Affairs Commission is pointless really if somebody does not take responsibility for them. This does not happen in this legislation. I feel that that is a major omission. Clause 270 (7) which deals with directors' reports does not require such reports to state the emoluments of directors to be included in the aggregate amount of emoluments shown in the accounts or the fixed salary of a director who is a full time employee. The latter is covered by an exemption which also is not contained in the existing legislation. I feel that it is a matter that should be covered and I think the Minister should take that on board.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would just like to mention the matter which the honourable member for Parramatta raised regarding more frequent accounts being submitted rather than yearly accounts. I have mentioned that nobody takes responsibility for submitting more frequent accounts. Even if somebody took responsibility for the matter, we consider that the accounts should be submitted more frequently than once a year so that a trend is available not only to creditors but also to those people who are prepared to invest in such companies. As I mentioned earlier in the debate, this should apply particularly to companies of a high risk character. I think that the amendments outlined by the Opposition are sane amendments and that they should be proceeded with by the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot accept the Opposition's amendments, for a couple of reasons which I shall outline. The honourable member for Banks (Mr Mountford) should know that accounts of all public companies are submitted half-yearly. That is a requirement of listing on the stock exchange and it has been so for some considerable time. If one is in a risk area-the term the honourable member used, and I presume that relates to mining-accounts are required to be produced on a quarterly basis. The companies come forward with quarterly production figures. On top of that, accounts are put out and signed by the executives of the company and also by one of the directors. The auditor is required to certify as to the accuracy of those accounts; so there is no point in saying that the accounts go out without verification or without the responsibility of the company.

The accounts that show too little would cause one to glance at them briefly because of their inadequacy. Directors' pay and emoluments are shown in the accounts; they are not shown as gross amounts. The accounts will signify the amount paid to executive and non-executive directors.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; We are now discussing Part IX of the Bill which deals with the conduct of affairs of a company in an oppressive or unjust manner. In the best of all worlds, I guest that that type of behaviour might not happen, but humans being humans and companies being companies, it does happen; so this is a very important Part. In our amendment we ask:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (b) adequate remedies for oppressive conduct, including extension of the concept of oppression to single and anticipated acts unfairly prejudicial to a shareholder; and provision of further means such as a 'shareholders' Tribunal' to protect the interests of minority shareholders,</PARA>
<PARA>Clause 320 constitutes a limited advance on the present section 186 relating to the oppression of shareholders. Clause 320 (1) (a) and clause 320 (2) are new clauses entitling a member of a company to apply for the winding up of the company if he believes:</PARA>
<PARA>that directors have acted in their own interests and not in the interests of the members as a whole or in any other manner whatsoever that is unfair or unjust to one or more of the members</PARA>
<PARA>We cannot altogether disagree with that. This innovation, however, merely restates in a different part of the Bill the right of a member which is already contained in clause 364 (1) (f). </PARA>
<PARA> The remedy of oppression has been seriously restricted in its application by the courts. The Opposition believes that the concept of oppression should be replaced by the concept of unfair prejudice which is referred to in the section of the English Bill to which the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi) referred. That section was recommended by the Jenkins Committee in the United Kingdom in 1962. Only by lowering the threshold will this become a meaningful remedy for oppressed minorities. In addition the tendency of the courts to require a course of conduct before finding oppression should be replaced by a provision that single acts of prejudice are sufficient to attract the remedy. The Opposition believes further that the concept of a shareholders' tribunal warrants closer scrutiny as a further means to shareholder protection. It is to be lamented that, when so much attention in the Companies (Acquisition of Shares) Bill has been devoted to the protection of shareholders, this urgent reform has been overlooked in the Companies Bill. I recommend that the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Moore) have a look at that section which the honourable member for Hawker has incorporated in Hansard. I think it is a much more advanced concept with regard to oppression of shareholders than is contained within this Bill. I hope that that would be one other area to which some urgent reform could be made. Perhaps the Minister could start the ball rolling in that area on the Ministerial Council. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; These clauses of the Bill are headed 'Part XII-Winding Up'. I guess that is relevant as we are getting to the winding up stage of this epic saga with the Companies Bill. Our complaint about Part XII, to a great extent, relates to its huge extent because the provisions relating to winding up cover some 117 clauses of the Bill. Part XII extends from clause 358 to clause 474. A quick perusal of the structure of the clauses in the index to the Bill shows the complex nature of the provisions relating to the different forms of winding up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Unfortunately, in Australia, there has never been a full examination of the procedures and requirements relating to corporate insolvency, although the legislative provisions relating to individual bankruptcies receive close scrutiny. I suggest that, in view of the enormous number of bankruptcies that are occurring around Australia and that have occurred since this Government came to office, it is high time that a first class look was given to the whole area of insolvency. The Australian Law Reform Commission has requested a reference from the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) on the whole question of insolvency. To date, the Government has indicated that it does not intend giving such a reference to the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> We feel that the Law Reform Commission has done excellent work in such areas and that, since it has requested such a brief from the Government, it is almost sinful that the Government has not made an attempt to give it that brief. Simplification of the winding up provisions and the consideration of the vastly divergent interests of secured and unsecured creditors are two important reasons to justify such a reference. We feel very strongly on this point that the part of the Bill that requires 117 clauses to examine the whole subject of winding up of companies is mute testimony to the fact that the whole process is far too involved. We ask that the Minister urgently heed the request by the Law Reform Commission and give it a brief to look at this whole area of winding up. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I draw the attention of the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Moore) to clause 441 which relates to priority payments. I understand that these payments are also mentioned in the Crown Debts (Priority) Bill. Sub-clause (e) states that the fifth payment in priority to all other unsecured debts is the wages in respect of services rendered to the company by employees before the relevant date, but not exceeding $2,000 in respect of any one of the employees. We were disappointed to find that the Government did not accept the recommendation of the Senate Select Committee that the Crown priority would be abrogated and that the secured debts would come first and then the employees would come after. My colleague, the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown) will move an amendment to the Crown Debts (Priority) Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Clause 360 deals with the liabilities of contributors of present or past members. In dealing with corporate malfeasance I am reminded of that old dictum my old father used to tell me. He said: 'As you go through life, lad, you will find plenty Sheriffs of Nottingham and very few Robin Hoods. To the former they give knighthoods and the latter they hang'. I note that the Minister agrees with that. Section 391 of the South Australian Companies Act provides that any transfer of shares made within a period of two years before the commencement of the winding up of the company to any person known by the transferor to be unable to pay the liability on those shares shall not relieve the transferor of that liability. It was considered that section 391 was sound in principle and should be retained in future legislation. That provision was subsequently incorporated in the South Australian Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister may recall the headline 'Garretty group creditors meet again today'. This head line referred to one of the most disgraceful episodes in Australian corporate history, and there have been enough of them. This episode concerned the Garretty group of companies and in particular the mutual trust Dividend Fund Inc. In this case not only did a group of mainly small investors lose the value of their shares but also they were personally liable for a $125,000 deficiency in the company. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unlike the Garrettys. Much of the fund's money was lent to other companies in the group of Garretty companies. In most Western countries this would not have been allowed. It could not happen under the South Australian Act. However, Dividend Fund was inhibited only by its articles of association, which were no inhibition whatsoever. It is essential that a provision such as section 391 of the South Australian Companies Act dealing with transfers to avoid liability be inserted into the national Act. There ought to be proper regulation of mutual funds. It is an indictment of the Government that there is an absence of such a provision in this legislation. There is no excuse for this. To add insult to injury, the Victorian Government was obliged to bail out a number of elderly people each to the tune of $4,500. These pensioners had put their life savings into this shonky group. I regret to say it, but it is true, that under this Government equality before the law means the right to rich men to sleep under bridges.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I sincerely ask the Minister to take section 391 of the South Australian Act to the Ministerial Council as a means of ensuring that no more shonky deals like the Garretty situation are allowed to take place. Unless this provision is put in the federal legislation this situation will occur again. I will read to the Committee section 391 of the South Australian Act, which is concerned with transfer to avoid liability. Sub-section (1) is not pertinent to this legislation, but I will read it nonetheless. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> Any transfer of a share in any company to an infant for the purpose of avoiding or evading liability with regard to such share, shall not relieve the transferor of any such liability. </PARA>
<PARA>I will now read sub-section (2), which is relevant to the legislation before the Committee. Sub-section (2) states:</PARA>
<PARA> No transfer of a share in any company made for the purpose of avoiding or evading liability with regard to such share shall relieve the transferor of any such liability, if the transfer is made to any person for a nominal consideration, or for no consideration, or for valuable consideration expressed, but not paid to the transferor, or for a consideration paid to the transferee, or with a trust or reservation expressed, or implied, for the benefit of the transferor, or to a person know to the transferor to be unable to pay the liability on such share, unless such transfer has been made and registered two years before the company is wound up. </PARA>
<PARA>It is appalling that there is a complete absence of such a provision from this Bill. This is an indictment of the Federal Government's advisers. Unless that loophole is plugged the same position will be exploited ad infinitum. I ask the Minister to insert in the national Companies Bill the provision in the South Australian Companies Act. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to refer briefly to clauses 440 and 441. Clause 440 provides that all debts will rank equally unless otherwise provided in the legislation. This obviously refers to debenture holders and other secured creditors, who would obviously rank above the creditors mentioned in clause 441. So far as paragraphs (e), (f) and (g) of clause 441 are concerned, I think that wages, compensation for injuries to employees, long service leave and so forth should rank above even secured creditors. In the normal course of events, if a company is going along quite satisfactorily the wages, salaries, long service leave entitlements and so forth are payable when they fall due, either weekly or when a person takes leave. A company which is going bad does not always keep the payment of wages to employees up to date. It puts off the payment of wages because it thinks that they are probably one of the last things that need to be paid. In many instances it is a subsidiary company which is being wound up and the holding company will escape scot free. It wants to maintain some credibility with its largest creditors who are trading with the holding company. Of course, the people it can get rid of are the employees and the small creditors. Therefore I hope the Minister will be able to convince his colleagues in the other States that all of the wages and emoluments of employees should rank above even secured creditors in clause 440 and should not be relegated to the fifth, sixth and seventh positions in clause 441.</PARA></TALK.START>

I think it is probably worth while at this point to make some reference to the winding up of a significant company. Opposition members seem to think that there is some conspiratorial atmosphere surrounding subsidiary companies.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EI4">Mr MOORE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of that. I am also aware of what some other people say about the priorities and credibility of people in corporate life. They are not necessarily correct, just as Adam Smith's observations on economics were not necessarily correct. Therefore, I will get back to the question of liquidation of receiverships because they are important. Rather than start from the position that the honourable member for Henty (Mrs Child) did, I would point to some of the facts which I think are relevant. It concerns me that these days, when a receivership gets under way and moves along to the inevitable liquidation, in the initial stages an evaluation of assets is made. On the basis of this valuation the receivers accounts are paid-they are substantial-so that at the end of the road the return to shareholders, secured creditors and other receivers under the plan sometimes are a good deal more than they were in the first case. This brings about the position where debentures or unsecured notes are sold on the market at substantial discounts to their real worth because the assessment in the first place is made, in no small way, by the receiver or the liquidator on a valuation which he puts in the newspapers and which everyone takes for granted. When the receiver gets to a position that is sometimes considerably more than was first set out. The Patrick Partners corporation liquidation is one such example. Every honourable member seems to remember that case. Because of that I think we all ought to look at provisions to ensure, in the first place, that the write-down on assets is not as significant or as excessive as it would be under real market forces which makes the receiver look a particularly smart performer, and also that people do not act because they are not fully informed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think the honourable member for Henty used the words 'investors are secured'. Shareholders are not secured, but rank at the bottom of the list. They come after unsecured creditors who are right down at the bottom. The only secure investors are those who have a registered mortgage against assets. Those distinctions should be known. The other point is that mutual funds have had a fairly disastrous history. I put that down in no small way to the thing called the management company which is implanted into a lot of the mutual funds developed in Australia in the 1960s and the 1970s. In future those funds will have to be looked at in terms of what is allowable for the management company within the structure. I have a particular desire to see Australians invest, in a direct sense, in Australia. That would require that these funds are not put in the position of having management companies built into their super structures which is enormously expensive and therefore impedes their performance rather than helps it. Those are matters which will have to be looked at. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; We are now dealing with clause 565, dividends payable from profits only. This clause causes the Opposition some worry. In fact, the Opposition included this clause in our second reading amendment. The clause now only provides that no dividends shall be payable to the shareholder of any company except out of profits. Whilst the clause gives an inclusive definition of dividends it does not give any definition of profit. Sub-clause (2) assumes that the concept of profit is clearly defined and understood for this sub-clause makes it an offence for a director or executive officer of a company wilfully to pay dividends out of what he knows is not profits. For that reason alone a definition of profits is totally desirable. In the view of the Opposition, more importantly, in failing to define profits the Bill leaves the way open for a liberal interpretation of the concept and for the strictures of this clause to be avoided.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the exposure draft of the Companies Bill clause 376 defined profits, for the purpose of payment of dividends, as being the sum of:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) The aggregate of its revenue profits so far as not previously applied (whether by distribution, capitalisation or otherwise); and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The amount, if any, by which the aggregate of its realised capital profits so far as not so previously applied exceeds the aggregate of revenue losses and realised capital losses so far as not previously written off. </PARA>
<PARA>The proposed clause contained further strictures relating to the inclusion of capital profits in the profits against which dividends could be debited. There was some criticism of these provisions from an accounting point of view. Probably some of the criticisms were justified. However, it is a great pity that the Government got cold feet in this area. </PARA>

What was a most important step towards reform has been abandoned and the interpretation of the concept of profit left entirely to the directors of the company. While we may share some of the views of the Minister that not all directors are thieves, cheats or brigands, I think the Minister would also agree that there are quite a number of directors, in and out of gaol, who perhaps would not qualify for that description. The Opposition is quite concerned that the definition of profits is almost left to the value judgment of a director. The Opposition regrets that instead of persisting with a worthwhile reform and endeavouring to get it right the Government has succumbed to unreasonable pressure from accountants and other lobbyists and that good reform in the exposure draft, like a lot of other good reforms, has disappeared from the Companies Bill. We regret that that is what has happened. This is another one of the many amendments which we think need to be made to the Companies Bill to make it the Bill that we all want, given the fact that it is a co-operative scheme rather than a uniform scheme. Even with that fact in mind if this amendment were cleared up perhaps there might be more protection.</PARA></TALK.START>

I suggest that we replace this provision with sections 39 and 40 of the United Kingdom Companies Act. I will read from these sections so that they will be recorded in Hansard. The preceding Australian Companies Acts as well as this Bill, regrettably, do not define the word profits. That is precisely the argument and is the sort of argument which the Minister used when talking on the last provision of the Bill. It is ironic, as I said last night, that the United Kingdom has adopted a more stringent definition than we have done. I will briefly read from the two United Kingdom sections. Section 39 states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) A company shall not make a distribution . . . except out of profits available for the purpose . . . </PARA>
<PARA> (2) For the purpose of this part . . . a company's profit available for distribution, are its accumulated realised profits, so far as not previously utilised by distribution or capitalisation, less its accumulative or realised losses, so far as not previously written off in a reduction or re-organisation of capital duly made. </PARA>
<PARA>Section 40 states:</PARA>

<PARA> (a) if at that time the amount of its net assets is not less than the aggregate of the companies called up share capital and its undistributable reserves; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) if, and to the extent that, the distribution does not reduce the amount of those assets to less than that aggregate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The concept of profit is a very interesting one and one which I think we should all look at. Firstly, it is not only a question of, for example, a revenue profit or a capital profit which brings certain applications to accounting as we know them today but also concerns the problems relating to current cost accounting which has a very dramatic effect on the profitability of corporations. Very few companies these days, if they apply current cost accounting directly to their operations, would come out with a profit because of the inflationary effect and because of the provision which comes out of that. In certain areas they would but without any doubt that would not be the case in the general manufacturing area. On top of that, as an accounting principle one has to have some realisation of what profit is when there are substantial unrealised losses in the accounts. This applies particularly in certain companies which are carrying forward depreciated assets when those companies decide for one reason or another not to take their loss in that particular year but to carry it forward. That has a significant impact on profit within the declared year. That can be an adjustment of the stock figure in the normal trading company or it can relate to assets which have been disposed of or which have become redundant for which the loss has not been taken into account.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In terms of determining profit one should look also at the taxation aspects. A corporation or a proprietary company can apply to pay a dividend which represents more than gross earnings for the year. That meets the requirements of the 60 per cent payout and gives substantial tax credits into the future. Once again profits, under those circumstances, are in a different situation. When we talk of profit, we really have a moving feast and one has to understand the criteria on which we should rely. I can appreciate the honourable member's need for definition of profit; all I am saying is that in arriving at that position first of all we must determine our accounting standard. I am referring to historical, current cost accounting. Having accepted the basis of that, one has to move from that position to the valuation of stock on hand and, after having made that assessment, one must then look at the taxation implications. Having made those three judgments, one might get three totally different views of what profit is. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to raise with the Minister the question of Schedule 9 which now, in effect, goes into the legislation by way of regulation to complete the Bill. The Minister and I have had a lengthy exchange on the need for an accounting standards review board. In his recent answer to my question on notice No. 418, he stated:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> (a) the question of the establishment of the Companies and Securities Law Review Committee; and</PARA>

<PARA>The Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities has received and is still considering a preliminary paper that was prepared for it by the National Companies and Securities Commission of the Accounting Standards Review Board. </PARA>
<PARA>I agree with the Minister's preceding remarks; it is crucial, for a variety of reasons, to get an accounting standards review committee. As the Minister knows, the current Schedule 9, which is going into the legislation by way of regulations-with which we on this side of the House certainly agree-is much less effective than the charter set down by the respective accounting bodies. We both agree on that. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to raise two issues relating to Schedule 9, particularly in regard to clause 2L. I suggest that the Schedule is inadequate in a number of important aspects. I trust that my repeated requests for an accounting standards review board finally will be heeded by the Ministerial Council. Perhaps the Minister might give me some indication at this stage of just how far the Ministerial Council has got in regard to that. In my view, two sub-clauses should be added to clause 2L of Schedule 9. There are a couple of reasons for that. Firstly, turnover sales ought to be disclosed. They are not at the moment. Secondly, total wage and salary costs ought to be disclosed. There is no provision in Schedule 9 for that at the moment. Why is that? One cannot possibly calculate the efficiency of a firm without sales figures. The legislation is defective in that regard. It does not give shareholders the right to make a balanced evaluation for analysis of a company's liquidity. A second point on the matter of wages is that disclosure involves a socially significant payment to the community, to both shareholders and to the public. Obviously it is important for a number of other reasons. It is quite unfortunate that this provision has never appeared in Schedule 9. The other important factor is that employers can gauge distribution to employees, governments and shareholders. This provision is equally important-I can understand the corporate sector not wanting this-in order to determine the wages component in the price structure. I hope the Ministerial Council, whatever it does and whatever guidelines and criteria it fixes, ranks those two matters as important. </PARA>
<PARA> It is appalling that such information is not disclosed-not made public-to enable proper evaluation. I go back to what the Minister said before. I have a different point of view. The situation to which I refer occurs in insurance companies in particular. Britain has found it to be much needed and long overdue to have more adequate information in balance sheets, whether they are quarterly, half-yearly or annual balance sheets. We tend to overlook the fact that 15 per cent of company shareholders cannot understand a balance sheet. Of those remaining-the real watchdogs-only 4 per cent or 5 per cent, excluding directors, can understand balance sheets. The failure to provide for appropriate disclosures on balance sheets is one of the real difficulties in effecting the early detection of liquidity problems. In regard to proper accountancy procedures, I want to raise with the Minister a matter that I consider to be critically important. It is one that I hope he takes to the Ministerial Council. In my view it should rank extremely highly amongst the criteria fixed ultimately by the review board. It is an issue that ought to be given priority. I ask the Minister to take a brief and refer it to the National Companies and Securities Commission for urgent consideration. Perhaps the Minister will understand and grasp that concept more than most others. I am dealing now with winding up, liquidation, and things such as that. The brief is this: The Companies Act must give some guidance in determining the criteria which should be used for changing from going concern values to liquidation values. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The latter point raised by the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi) was the point to which I was referring when I responded previously. I have very grave reservations about the practice of making valuations, announcing valuations, on which people hold securities. They can then sell them and come out subsequently, some years later, with a far better result. Certainly the amounts returned by the receiver are substantial.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the question of accounting procedures and accounting reviews, there is no doubt at all that standards vary enormously. However, I do not accept that the way to do something in this life is to adopt the view: When in doubt, regulate. There is a great old bureaucratic practice which says: 'We do not know anything about it. We will regulate it'. I have seen governments in Queensland and in other places do this. The most appropriate course would be for the National Securities Commission to determine the minimum acceptable to it-not the maximum but the minimum. From that base, discussions could be held with the Institute of Chartered Accountants or the Society of Accountants in which they could recognise what should become the minimum acceptable. By doing that we could save ourselves yet another government body, board or regulatory authority. At the same time, it is hoped that we would see accountants reach those standards. If they do not reach those standards, we will have to consider the opposite situation. I hope that common sense, commercial practice and a sense of professionalism will be such as to carry through these things. </PARA>

<PARA> That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA> 'whilst not opposing the Bill, the House:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) expresses its concern that Crown Priorities in relation to tax instalment deductions and witholding tax on dividends and interest remitted overseas, and the priority of the Crown in right of the States, have been preserved, and</PARA>
<PARA> (2) calls upon the Government to-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) abolish all remaining Crown Priorities in right of the Commonwealth and to seek the abolition of all remaining Crown Priorities in the State sphere, and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) ensure that all wages and compensation payments to employees are given priority over all creditors'. </PARA>
<PARA>In June 1978 the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs tabled in the Senate its report entitled 'Priority of Crown Debts'. The report was in response to a reference to the Standing Committee from the Senate on 21 April 1977 to review the right of priority of the Crown over other creditors in matters of bankruptcy, corporate liquidations, and other cases of impecunious persons or corporations. In that report the Senate Standing Committee recommended the complete abrogation of all Crown priorities in insolvency administration. The Federal Government-this Government-went some way along the line. The then Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, the present Minister for Education (Mr Fife), in a statement to the House of Representatives on 13 September 1979 said that the Government had examined the report and, whilst it was fully in agreement with the main thrust of the Committee's argument, it was not willing to abrogate its total rights to Crown priority. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government therefore went to the States with the view that the Crown should retain priority in the areas of tax instalment deductions, withholding tax on undistributed dividends, and interest remitted overseas. When it came time for the Ministerial Council to look at this proposition, the States were unwilling to forgo their rights. Because the Commonwealth was not prepared to forgo all its rights, the States were likewise inclined. We now have the situation mentioned by the honourable member for Henty (Mrs Child) and the honourable member for Banks (Mr Mountford) in the debate on clause 441 of the Companies Bill, under which employees' rights come way down the line. The Opposition finds this an unacceptable and most reprehensible state of affairs. Firstly, in the case of a failed company, secured creditors get their slice. They are followed by the Commonwealth, then the State, and finally, way down the line, in paragraphs (e), (f) and (g), the employees have an opportunity to get something from what is left of the wreck. We cannot accept that as being a moral state of affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> As the honourable member for Henty pointed out, and it has been pointed out in this debate by other speakers, the people who work for companies in fact are investing their labour in the fortunes of that company with just as much sincerity as a shareholder is investing his money. However, the particular characteristic of an employee's efforts is that in almost every case the only chance an employee of a company has of getting anything back is what he gains in wages from that company. The Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Moore) suggested some while back that shareholders come even further down the line than employees. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps that might be a case of regret also. It may well be that a case is made out for them to have priority over the Crown. I think that the pertinent point to be remembered here is that most people who are investing in companies, particularly large public companies, do not have all their eggs in one basket. It is a very rare investor who puts all his money into one company. So it is possible that, if a company fails and an investor loses his or her investment in that company, he or she does have some other form of living; but with an employee that is not the case. We are not prepared to accept that salary earners, when accepting their share of what is left, are placed right at the bottom of the priority list. I put it very firmly to the Minister that the Crown Debts (Priority) Bill and section 441 of the Companies Bill should be looked at to see that our view, which was the view of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, is accepted and that employees rights are put right at the top of the list of priorities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Commonwealth can hardly say that it has no other way of obtaining revenue. With all the avenues which are open to government, should it think that it is entitled to have a share above the wages which are due to employees in a failed company or of compensation payments due to employees? In fact, due to their downgraded position right at the bottom of the priorities list, the total possible payment to any one employee under these circumstances is $2,000. Mr Deputy Speaker, I hope that both you and the Minister believe that the Opposition is very sincere in its endeavours in relation to this Bill. We believe we have a right, as I think the government has a right, to protect the workers of Australia. In the case of failed companies, it is usually not the workers fault that the company fails. Other people might put forward a countervailing argument, but in almost every case of company failure in Australia it could never be that the guilt would be sheeted to the employees. Almost always it has been the fault of the management or perhaps the economy generally that a company has failed, but certainly not the fault of the employees. How in heaven's name could anyone suggest that when a company does fail and employees are put out of work they cannot receive wages owing to them unless they are placed right at the bottom of the priorities list? I hope that the Minister would heed those remarks. I hope that, when the Ministerial Council discusses this Bill, the Opposition's amendment will be listened to and invoked. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I second the amendment. I do so very strongly. I think that the plight of the employee when the firm by which he is employed goes broke is pretty deplorable. Recently several firms in Melbourne, particularly manufacturing firms, have collapsed and a receiver has been appointed. In each case several hundred employees were immediately out of work, and with little warning. I will return to that aspect later. However, their plight is even worse than that of persons who are sacked or rendered redundant because in those cases people at least receive payment for the weeks they have worked, plus a week's notice with pay. Those men and women who have given their services and fulfilled their contracts with the firm concerned not only did not receive the pay that they were waiting for, which was probably needed to pay the rent and buy groceries, but also did not receive a week's notice pay, long service leave pro rata payments and holiday pay. The employees are way down the line as regards the priorities list.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What happens when a firm goes broke, firstly, is that the secured creditors receive first call on the available finance followed closely by the Taxation Office, which we all seem to have a bogy about. It collects the accumulated pay-as-you-earn instalments. In the cases which I outlined this amounted to thousands of dollars. Another matter that I would like to know is why does the Taxation Office allow firms that are getting a bit rocky to owe it such tremendous amounts of money? In fact, in their final gasp, those firms are trying to float on employees' deductions. Then the companies go broke, that money goes too. The Taxation Office takes another bite in claiming tax on the undistributed dividends and then a third bite on tax on interest remitted overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> Then the unsecured creditors are entitled to receive their share. We still have not reached the employees because nine categories of unsecured creditors come first. The workers run fifth. I find it quite unacceptable that unsecured creditors are placed ahead of employees on the list because unsecured creditors become involved after the winding up of a company. The employee was owed the money before the receiver came in. These debts were incurred after the winding up and the receiver was brought in, but the unsecured creditors still get paid before the debtors with whom the firm incurred liability before it became insolvent. If it were a horse race the workers certainly would run unplaced. </PARA>
<PARA> The Crown must abrogate all Crown priorities in insolvency cases in line with the amendment which has been moved by the Opposition. As my colleague the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown) has pointed out, the Taxation Office certainly has plenty of other ways in which it can recoup its money. The employee cannot. I take the point which was made about the registered mortgage being applied against assets, but I again point out that the worker has invested his or her labour and I believe that his or her security is of prime importance no matter what is happening within the firm. If a person works for money it has become his or her money. Most firms know that they are going bankrupt while the employees are still working for them. It is quite immoral for firms to keep employees working when the management knows that they will not be paid at the end of that month, fortnight, or whenever the final crash comes. The rights of the worker in regard to payment for services given should receive the first protection. All wages and compensation payments to employees must be given priority over all other creditors. Maybe we need to have a reclassification of employees to place them in the first group, which is the secured creditors. I think that is where the employees belong. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot say too strongly that the Opposition believes that we have a moral and legal right to protect the wages of those who work. We were disappointed that the Government accepted the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs in regard to Crown priorities. The Government did not go into a huddle with the States to get the States to agree that the Taxation Office should get out of the way and let the secured creditors and the workers take their bites before it received its share. In one of the cases which I referred to, something like $170,000 is owing to the Taxation Office. I think that the Department will have to waive that money because it should never have let the debt get to that extraordinary amount. It is important to realise that the employee has no other recourse for reimbursement. If he cannot get paid out of the funds, that is it. He cannot go to the man to whom he owes the rent or the person to whom he is paying the mortgage on his house and say: 'I worked for a month but I did not get paid'. Nobody will let him off the hook for what he owes. I urge the Government to accept this amendment which is on behalf of the workers. The Government and the Opposition in this place represent the people of Australia who are the workers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Listening to the comments which have been made on the Crown Debts (Priority) Bill, one would think that the Commonwealth had done nothing towards it. In fact, that is far from the case. The report of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs did not say that secured creditors should come first on the priority list and then employees. It simply said that by abolishing Crown priorities the position of employees was improved because so much more money was left in the pool. By making that contribution, completely without the agreement of the States, we have made a contribution towards the general list of creditors on the scale. I think that this form of legislation has made a contribution. In the eyes of some, it may not have gone far enough, but certainly it has made a contribution along the right path.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Earlier I took issue with the honourable member for Henty (Mrs Child) in relation to certain creditors. On this occasion I have to take issue with the honourable member on the question of the costs incurred after the appointment. Quite naturally costs will be incurred as part of the ongoing operation after the receiver takes up his position. It is quite natural for those costs to be charged to the operation. The receiver would not accept the job if he did not receive a salary. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning to the question of taxation collections, the Income Tax Assessment Act states that the employer has a responsibility to pay employees as soon as the deductions have been made and I know that there are certain penalties for those employers who do not. The responsibility for non-collection and for not following up lies with certain people. I support the priorities set down in this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; On behalf of the Opposition, I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That Part III, comprising clauses 10 and 11, be omitted. </PARA>
<PARA>These clauses remove the prohibitions on crossings by brokers acting for an offeror either on or off market. The Government indicates in its explanatory memorandum on this Bill, although the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Moore) made no mention of the matter in his second reading speech, the following:</PARA>
<PARA> Part III of the Bill will not be proclaimed to come into operation until the Ministerial Council agrees unanimously to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> Before deciding to proclaim Part III, the Ministerial Council will consider:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) reports on whether stock exchange business rules need changes to deal adequately with conflicts of interest during crossings; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) draft changes to the securities industry code relating to the enforcement of the relevant stock exchange business rules and appropriate disciplinary procedures for dealers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition objects to these amendments on two grounds. Firstly, as I mentioned in my speech on the motion that the Companies Bill be read a second time, what the Government is asking this Parliament to do is to pass into law provisions that we do not yet know are desirable or feasible. The Government is asking us to abrogate our responsibility and to hand over the decision to a body which is accountable to no one parliament. We consider this to be a breach of parliamentary processes which are all too often treated with contempt by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Our second objection relates to the fact that we have no confidence that the business rules of the stock exchanges or, indeed, the policing capacity of these exchanges is adequate to deal with conflicts of interest during crossings. For example, we observe that the exchange in Sydney as reported in the Press on 8 May saw fit to fine an unnamed stockbroker $10,000 last week for malfeasance in dealing with a parcel of the dreaded Negri River Corporation Ltd shares. Strangely enough the broker's name has not been revealed. </PARA>
<PARA> We figure this to be a weakness in the Companies Bill whereby the stock exchange can take unto itself the regulation of the activities and the behaviour of the brokers within that exchange. A person can be dealing, as this gentleman obviously had, dishonestly with a parcel of shares, can be fined $10,000 by that stock exchange and his name not be revealed to the Press. This gentleman, being a peer of the establishment, a pillar of society or whatever, is nothing more than a common criminal. There is something inherently wrong in this Bill where the stock exchange does not have the capacity, the right or, indeed, the intention of revealing this man's name in public. If he had been a shoplifter pinching a seven and sixpenny toy from Woolworths his name would have been revealed to the Press. But it appears that there is one law for the unwary and one law for the rich. </PARA>
<PARA> We consider that Part III of this Bill which we would like omitted is a very weak arrangement. I know that the Minister has varying views from the Opposition on the subject of crossings. Perhaps he will give us the benefit of his wisdom in a moment or two. He cannot deny the inherent weakness of this Bill, in that the self-regulating policies of the stock exchange are like the self-regulating policies of anything else-nobody is competent to judge himself fairly and objectively. I suggest to the Minister that we hope that Part III of this Bill will be eliminated from the total Bill because we consider that it points up inherent weaknesses in the Bill. We consider that this whole area needs redrafting. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I conclude, since this is the last time that I will be speaking for the Opposition on this total great package of Bills, I think it would be reasonable to pay some sort of tribute to the Minister's staff sitting up there in the wings. They have been particularly helpful to the Opposition. The Minister has fully made them available to us. That fact is appreciated by us. We thank them for their co-operation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would also like to thank those who participated in this debate, particularly the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown) and the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi) who very obviously have made a considerable study of what has been in the Bills and have gone out of their way to inform themselves on a matter which does not really entice a lot of people to take much notice of. I commend them for the effort they have put into it and certainly for the knowledge that they have imparted during the debate tonight. It is a very helpful contribution to what I hope will be a fairly memorable occasion insofar as it is the first time in Australia's history that we have had a national companies Bill passed by the national Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In relation to crossings, I hate to inform the honourable member for Parramatta that the man not named by the Stock Exchange was not involved in a crossings problem. Nevertheless, this case does bear out some of the migivings that people have with the Stock Exchange as a whole. What people really need to do is to brush up on their public relations and to see far more of their public responsibilities. I will say something about crossings because this is one of those areas where very few people have an idea of what it is all about. There is plenty of recrimination and plenty of saying: 'It's all wrong'. But there is no great background of understanding what it is about. </PARA>
<PARA> The term 'crossing' simply means a sale within a broker's office, that is, broker to broker and from client to client. In those circumstances a relationship develops between a client and a broker in exactly the same way as between a patient and a doctor. The most important thing to anyone, after health, is a person's shares or money. I think everyone in this place and some of those who have gone will probably recognise that. Because of that the relationships between a broker and his client are particularly close. </PARA>
<PARA> I go on to the next stage because most of the problems appear to be in the area of crossings associated with an offer. An offer is made for a company and is well publicised in the Press. Notice of the offer is posted on the boards of the stock exchange. Those brokers who are dealing in a stock not only are presumed to have read the newspapers but also are presumed to have read the notices on the boards within the stock exchange. So, on two counts they are adjudged to know of the offer. Under those circumstances a client who is a client of the broker acting for the offeror who wishes to sell his shares then approaches his broker with that order to sell. He is offering his shares for sale in the knowledge of the offer because it is advised in the newspapers. The broker knows about it because he has read about it in the newspapers. If he has not, that notice is on the board on the floor of the Stock Exchange where the deal must take place and, as a consequence, he is informed. Therefore, in my view a crossing within the full knowledge of both the buyer and the seller is quite within the bounds of commercial activity and quite within the rules of the stock exchange. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EI4">Mr MOORE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Parramatta has raised a point. I think I told him about this in the corridor. That problem can only really take place where a broker is building up a holding on behalf of an offeror prior to the offer being made. Under the circumstances of the new Bill dealing with the National Companies and Securities Commission that relates to shares prior to the 20 per cent threshold. Under those circumstances a broker acting for an offeror accumulating up to the 20 per cent mark on a rising market will, of course, be buying shares at a varying price. A client of that broker offering to sell on those price patterns needs to know of these activities or have complete trust in that broker. It is only within that context that I see a problem within the prospect of crossings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I take the view that most brokers are honest. I take the view that most clients trust the activities of their broker. As I have said before, we are dealing with a person's most precious commodity-his money. Therefore, I say that it would be a very silly broker who acted not with the best interests of his client at heart despite the fact that he could be acting for an offeror. I can only say that in a position like that the broker is more likely to say to his client: 'Hold on, there is something coming', and to advise him quietly that there is something better coming and that he ought to hold on on that occasion. I do not hold these enormous fears for crossings. I think there is a lot in the relationship between the individual client and his broker. Within the game of the financial world there is an enormous amount of personal trust and integrity which undoubtedly prevails in the very marked majority of cases throughout Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have referred very briefly in the past to the issue of gun clubs. I wish to return to this issue tonight. The gun lobby is made up of many different gun clubs in the country and the firearms traders. I reiterate that I am in no way opposed to gun clubs or to the legitimate training and practice in the correct use of firearms. But the problem of noise cause by the gun club activities in residential areas is a serious one in my electorate. I want to refer to the Lysterfield Range which affects my constituents in the Belgrave Heights area. Because of extensive change in land use patterns in this area since 1970 when the lease was signed, the gun club now poses severe nuisance value in the area. The number of houses has increased to such an extent that the gun club is now in a residential area. Noise from this range is so bad, and occurs on both weekdays and for many hours at the weekend, that residents frequently have to leave their homes and go out for the day. Residents have taken local action themselves to try to solve this problem, but have been totally unsuccessful. In fact, with the increasing membership of the club, there is now more noise, from more shoots, and the gun club plans to extend even further.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A local residents action group committed itself to $2,000 worth of sound readings taken by one of Melbourne's most reputable firms. On four occasions in the past few months the readings showed excessive noise at seven different properties throughout the area. Some readings have been taken inside the living rooms of homes and noise levels are such that, under the Australian Standard Specification, there would be immediate community and personal reaction. An expert report to the Shire of Sherbrooke from the Environmental Protection Authority and professional sound consultants last October, stated that: 'from the results of the survey, it is clear that, at present, the Range is imposing an intolerable burden on nearby residents, and we do not believe this should continue.'</PARA>
<PARA> There can be no doubt that such noise levels are having a detrimental effect on land values in the area. The local Sherbrooke Shire Council has requested that the gun club take action to lower noise levels, but has found no improvement in noise levels and frequency eminating from the range. It has now resorted to supreme court action on the matter, which involves considerable time, effort and expense from a local council to be involved in. The action has been deemed essential because no relief has been possible through government channels. This is a very real problem to local residents, and is causing severe distress and costing them many thousands of dollars as their home investment is devalued. While I appreciate the need for gun clubs, this particular problem shows that there is a vital need for such organisations to keep in touch with the realities of residential life. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that an inquiry into the location and nature of gun clubs in the whole of Australia would reveal similar problems in other parts of the country. There is a need to establish a uniform set of standards for the zoning and positioning of these ranges and to remove them from proximity to residential areas. The other aspect of the use of firearms which concerns me is the increased use of such weapons for political and criminal terrorism, as illustrated in the recent assassination of John Lennon in New York and the attempted assassination of President Reagan. Whilst we have not yet reached the stage in this country where our political and other leaders are threatened and killed, and where 200 million guns are in private hands with little or any control over them, as in the United States, the Australian situation is rapidly moving in this direction. </PARA>
<PARA> According to Professor Richard Harding, whose book Firearms and Violence in Australian Life has just been published, we are well on the way to reaching the American situation. He describes the domestic gun scene in Australia as 'destructive, volatile, self perpetuating and intractable'. Our political leaders, when asked to comment on events such as the Reagan assassination attempt, claimed smugly that our laws are much tighter here. This may be so. However, the eight Australian police commissioners have pointed out that, through a loophole in regulations, the Israeli Uzi machine pistols and the Russian Kalashnikov assault rifles can be readily imported into this country. This type of weapon is used by terrorists and armed criminals throughout the world. It is favoured by private armies in many countries. </PARA>
<PARA> In the context of the increasing dangers to society from all types of firearms, no tightening of regulations would be too severe. The Federal Government must act to ensure that what has happened in the United States of America cannot happen here. Uniform and stringent federal regulations on the use and possession of firearms by individuals and organisations is vitally necessary. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It will be interesting to consider and comment on the speech which has been made in view of the advice that is often given by honourable members on the other side of the House. In the circumstances which have been mentioned it is a wonder that the constituents were not advised to go and stand in front of the guns. However, I rise on a different matter tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In his statement to the House on the Review of Commonwealth Functions, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) announced the intention to sell certain commercially-oriented assets. I applaud this announcement. The Opposition denounces it and, in fact, declares it will repurchase any assets sold. I presume it will arbitrarily resume such property purely on the grounds that it was once the property of the Commonwealth. Let us hope this socialistic principle is not to be applied to all other property owners in the Australian Capital Territory. The Opposition further sees this suggestion as being a move to benefit big business in allowing it the opportunity of financial returns on what were government initiatives. This need not be so. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the properties concerned is the Belconnen Mall. If honourable members think it is peculiar for a Western Australian to speak on this issue, I think that the silence from the honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly) and the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Fry) warrants some comments in this House. The Belconnen Mall has a total lettable area of 520,000 square feet. The Mall has 172 separate shops. These vary in size from the Myer Canberra store which is 220,000 square feet to a store of 100 square feet. The four major stores-Myer, G. J. Coles and Co. Ltd, K Mart (Australia) Ltd and Woolworths Ltd-collectively occupy 360,000 square feet while a typical small trader occupies 800 square feet. The tenants of these shops pay rent to the Commonwealth based on their turnover. In other words, all charges to their customers must include this figure. There can be no economy of scale reflected in lower prices. </PARA>
<PARA> The tenants have their own association. It met last week to discuss a proposal for the strata titling of the mall. Of the 172 tenants, 118 were represented. They voted unanimously to approach the Government to arrange a strata titles deal and to offer the various shops to the tenants in the first instance. I support this concept entirely. If I need support from the Government, might I quote from the Prime Minister's statement. On page one of his statement, he referred to 'increased opportunities for all'. On page 2, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> And we must not forget that it is people, their knowledge and their talents, their enterprise and determination, their belief that they can succeed, who have built Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>I support the concept of small government. I equally support the concept of small business. I have ample experience to say that it achieves efficiencies far in excess of big business and creates an enthusiasm to succeed impossible in the impartial corridors of big business. The Government now has a tremendous opportunity to demonstrate its principles of support for private enterprise and support for the individual by sale of the Belconnen Mall to its tenants. Some will say the administrative difficulties make it impossible. I remind them that Columbia has orbitted the earth and returned unscathed. </PARA>
<PARA> Some will say the large tenants policy is not to purchase freehold and that certain small tenants will be unable to finance purchase of their section. This could certainly occur. However, it is no deterrent to strata titling. Such areas as are not purchased by their occupiers can be made available to other investors small and large. If we consider the range of areas and consequently variation in purchase prices that will be on offer, it is obvious the type of investors interested in lease back will be considerable. What will the new owner-operator and his customers gain? With fixed capital charges, the tenant will naturally address himself to maximising the turnover of his area. Increased turnover will improve the capital value of his property and reduce the effect of capital charges on his mark-up. The resulting reduced prices will benefit his customers and presumably increase his turnover further. That is Liberal philosophy at work. At the successful completion of this project, a similar approach should be considered at our airport terminals. The 'owner-driver' whatever his actual business activity-he might be a contract carpenter, a truck driver or a small shop owner-is the backbone of the Australian economy. I request the Government to take up the challenge at Belconnen and to support this principle. When the sales are completed to those sturdy traders, I challenge the Opposition to try to take them back. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A short time ago, I made reference to the decreasing real value of the total grants that have been made available to the States since this Government first came to office in 1975-76. I indicated on that occasion that I would take the opportunity to pursue the matter further and to explain the developments that have taken place, not only in relation to the total grants being made available to the States, but also, more particularly, to the effect that the States have experienced as a result of the policies of this Government in relation to their general purpose capital grants and their specific purpose grants. On that previous occasion I referred to the fact that during the current year in real terms the total States grants are deficient to the extent of $1,418m compared with the amount the States received in total in 1975-76. I also referred to a statement made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch), at the Liberal Party's New South Wales council meeting in Maitland in March this year. At that conference the Minister also said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The States can expect little joy from Commonwealth decisions in the short months ahead. </PARA>
<PARA>It is becoming increasingly apparent exactly what that statement means. The most recent spectacle was the States' being denied the $70m that both the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Treasurer (Mr Howard) had been authorised by Cabinet to allow to them. Following that, we saw the public humiliation of the States throughout the whole of the Commonwealth. We saw a very serious reaction from the States when they realised the extent to which they had been conned, the reasons they had been conned and the way in which both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer paraded themselves before the media to show how strong and clever they had been, not only at the expense of the State Premiers and State governments, but also at the expense of the residents in the States. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to develop further the points I made previously in relation to grants. First of all, I will deal specifically with the general purpose capital funds allocated to the States. In 1975-76 general purpose capital funds to the States totalled $1,291m. In the current financial year, 1980-81, general purpose capital funds to the States total $1,307m. That represents an increase during those five years of only 1.2 per cent. In order to maintain their real value in terms of what has happened to costs and prices during that period, they should have increased by 63.4 per cent or $818m. The actual increase that has taken place in those capital funds has not been anything like the $818m necessary in order to retain their real value. They have increased by only $16m during those five years. That means that in this year alone general purpose capital funds to the States are deficient in real terms to the extent of $802m. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation in relation to specific purpose payments is essentially the same. In 1975-76 the allocations to the States were $4,152m. In the current year they are $5,227m. In other words, they have increased by 26 per cent. During that period prices have increased by 63.4 per cent. If specific purpose payments to the States had maintained their real value, they would have increased by $2,632m. In fact, the actual increase was $1,075m. Therefore, in this year alone, specific purpose payments to the States are deficient in real terms to the extent of $1,567m. The substance and the import of the statements made by the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Minister for Trade and Resources (Mr Anthony) are becoming increasingly apparent to the States. There has been a very well orchestrated campaign on the part of the Government to squeeze the States and to put them into a position of being seriously disadvantaged. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am quite sure that every honourable member in this House recognises that the provision of adequate and suitable housing is a crucial element in the successful development of our communities. In the electorate of Mallee, over the last three or four years, we have seen very significant growth in both economic activity and the creation of additional population. In the city of Mildura, which without doubt is one of the finest provincial cities in Australia, this has been indicated by a 28 per cent increase in the issue of housing permits for private dwellings over the last two years. I believe this is an indication of the Government's success in stimulating real growth and creating real opportunities for long term employment. Of course, it has developed a real confidence in the future viability of our rural and provincial cities. However, I believe it is recognised that housing is a limiting factor in the development of population growth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Without doubt, in every community in my electorate-this would be so in almost every electorate throughout Australia-housing is a limiting factor. Almost every area needs additional skilled tradesmen. Small communities are unable to obtain skilled tradesmen if housing is not available. Seasonal employment opportunities throughout the north-west part of Victoria attract hundreds of people every year to that region. Of course, because of the friendly nature of the people and the opportunities for work, they stay. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Barker correctly stated, they stay also because of the friendly nature of their local member. If we are to house these people successfully and to keep them in our rural communities, large appropriations of funds to the housing area are needed. I am, therefore, very pleased to hear of the importance this Government attaches-I am sure all Opposition members would agree-to efficiency in our administration. We now live in an age of superior technology. The silicon chip and computers have become a necessary part of any efficient cost effective organisation. The recent findings of the Review of Commonwealth Functions have shown us that departments have to move towards cost efficiency. In his statement to the House, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) announced that every effort will be made to eliminate non-efficient services, to combine common service areas, to make more efficient use of automatic data processing and to decentralise and deregulate management decisions to individual departments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Department of Housing and Construction is moving in this direction by acquiring a computer network to ensure efficient delegation of activities. This network requires a central computer with facilities in each region. It will be a link between the central and regional operations. This is a crucial part in the efficient operation of the network. It was one of the main determinants of the Government's decision to acquire the network from IBM Australia Ltd. Criticism of the Government's decision fails to recognise this crucial element. I believe it demonstrates a complete failure by the Opposition to appreciate the importance of ensuring the best equipment for the job. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was interested to hear the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) who apparently has become an instant expert on the Belconnen Mall. I wonder whether that is true or whether he was merely reading a speech prepared for him by the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman). It should be known that the Belconnen shopping mall is an outstanding project. It is unique in that it is the only publicly owned shopping mall. It has been very successful. It was about to divert its profits to provide recreational facilities for the people of Belconnen who have been neglected by the Government. Whilst my favoured proposal is that the mall should remain public property, I would certainly prefer it to be sold under strata title than to one of the friends of the Government. Time will tell.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to speak briefly tonight about the letter which, I think, all honourable members received from the National President of the Returned Services League of Australia in which he made accusations against an organisation called Women Against Rape. The letter stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The RSL learned of their plans which were as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. to bring to Canberra as many members of their group as possible to participate. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. to march no matter what and carry placards representing the various groups forming part of the women marching, for example, 'Wimmin Against Rape' and 'Women Against Nuclear Energy'. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. to effectively 'reduce the militarism of the march' by slashing the drums of the bands participating, by damaging their instruments, and by spraying the bandsmen with paint. They planned to make the bands in the march their major target. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. to obstruct the march by laying down in front of marching veterans so that the veterans would have to walk over them symbolising 'rape'. </PARA>
<PARA> 5. to deface the Australian War Memorial. It should be noted that last year the Memorial was defaced by 'persons unknown' but this year the War Memorial in Perth was desecrated. </PARA>
<PARA>These are the hysterical accusations which the RSL and the Minister have made against this women's organisation in Canberra. I just want to read out the response which the organisation has sent to honourable members. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> This letter is in response to accusations made against Women Against Rape by the R.S.L., the Minister for the Capital Territory, Mr Hodgman, and the Australian Federal Police. </PARA>
<PARA> Women Against Rape would like to make it known, yet one more time, that it categorically denies all allegations levelled against it that the group had at any time intended to disrupt the ANZAC Day march last month. </PARA>
<PARA> We at no time even discussed the activities suggested (drum slashing, symbolically being walked over by the veterans etc. etc) even in jest, let alone decide to adopt them as tactics on ANZAC Day. From the first five minutes of the first meeting of the organising collective in January, there was a commitment to non-violence. </PARA>
<PARA> We went to great lengths to prepare ourselves to respond non-violently if we were confronted by violence from the police or spectators. All our meetings were open to any woman who wished to attend; all our decisions were made public through leaflets, letters, media releases and word-of-mouth. Workshops, open to any woman wishing to attend were publicized and run. In these, role playing and discussion were used to help women to prepare themselves to respond non-violently. We are happy to make available to you minutes of all our meetings and all documents relating to our collective. </PARA>
<PARA> On ANZAC morning we gathered as planned, marching off silently and in an orderly fashion (after yet again stressing our commitment to non-violence) to join the end of the official march without disruption. The rest of the story is well known. We were stopped and arrests resulted, police using the amended traffic ordinance gazetted for the occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> There was no disruption to the official ANZAC parade and it should be noted that the six busloads of interstate women we were supposedly importing for the occasion were nowhere to be seen. Only one-tenth of the sixty one women arrested were from interstate. Neither did any of the women arrested have spray cans of paint, implements with which to slash drums, or anything else, with which to create a disturbance, on their persons. </PARA>
<PARA> The RSL, the Minister and the police based their hysterical stand to disallow us marching on what they say was the evidence of an informant. As we know that no such incriminating discussions ever took place we must believe that, either this informant never existed and that the Minister and the RSL are lying, or that if she did exist she lied to them. If the latter is the case, the RSL, the Minister and the police must take responsibility for refusing over three hundred women their rights of free expression on the spurious evidence of one, as yet, unidentified woman. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, it is not mentioned that it may have been a man dressed in drag. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Women Against Rape is at present looking into our legal position in relation to the slanderous and libelous comments made by the Minister and the RSL. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to draw the attention of the House to the grievance of an organisation which is based in my electorate but which speaks for the broken families of Poles and in particular of Polish refugees who have settled in Australia. This is the Committee for Family Reunions, whose address is Post Office Box 104, Woollahra. I am sure that the House is aware that in the last year or two some 2,000 to 3,000 Polish refugees have come to Australia, joining the 120,000 or so Poles who settled here in earlier years. At least 400 of these Poles are husbands who are separated from their wives and children and who have sought unsuccessfully over months and years to get permission for their wives and children who are living in Poland to join them in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> They are obviously being punished by the Polish Government for having left Poland because Poland does not recognise the right of emigration. But worse than that, they are being harassed in Australia and their families are being harassed in Poland. It has been reported by this Committee that some of those who are living in Australia are encouraged or asked to become snoopers on other Polish refugees and to report their activities to the Polish Consulate. Others are ridiculed on the grounds that their wives do not want to join them, despite all the evidence to the contrary. Mr Boniecki, who is a spokesman for the Australian Committee for Human Rights in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> We have the case of one man whose wife and three-year-old son were refused permission to leave Poland three times. When this man approached the Polish Consul in Sydney at a public function, the Consul laughed off the man's grievance and publicly declared that everyone knew that his wife did not want to join him. </PARA>
<PARA> Consequently, to prove the falsity of the statement, the man has obtained a statutory declaration certified by a Polish court that his wife wants to leave the country. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, there has been no change in the attitude of the Polish Consul or of the Warsaw Government. These men are being punished for having left Poland, despite the fact that Poland signed the Helsinki Agreement on Human Rights in 1975, not to mention the Universal Declaration on Human Rights of the United Nations. It has refused to issue passports. It has refused this fundamental right. </PARA>
<PARA> Some delay in the processing of these matters is understandable. It would not be surprising if it took some weeks or in certain cases some months, but this has taken many months and is going on into years. Late last year the Australian Committee for Human Rights in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe sent a telegram to the Conference on European Security and Co-operation in Madrid. The telegram stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Attention of the Conference is drawn to the specific situation of spouses and children of hundreds of Polish refugees recently settled in Australia. These families still in Poland are repeatedly refused passports so that they can leave Poland and be reunited with their families in Australia. Please press the Polish authorities to respect these basic human rights in the spirit of the Helsinki Agreements and to allow these families to leave immediately. </PARA>
<PARA>There has been no response from Poland. There has certainly been a response in Australia. There have been hunger strikes. There is a fear that there will be more serious responses by these people in Australia who have been unable to bring their wives and children-in some cases very young children-from Poland. We know that the Polish Government is divided. We know that there are hard liners who want the Soviet Union to occupy the country in the manner of Czechoslovakia in the 1960s. We also know that there are others who take a more progressive line. There are some in Australia who would say that we should not be embarrassing the Polish Government in the present situation, but it seems to me that it is so simple a matter for the progressive element in the Polish Government to agree to give passports to those families that we should be pressing them. The Polish Government could do one simple thing to earn the sympathy of Australians and that is allow these families to be reunited. The Polish Government is seeking credit from the Australian Government as it is seeking credit from other governments throughout the world. The least that the Australian Government can do is support these settlers, who will in due course become citizens of this country, and ask the Polish Government to cease punishing them and allow the families to be reunited in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to draw attention briefly to a petition which I presented yesterday on behalf of a co-operative group in the north-west of Tasmania known as TARGA. That group collected 2,500 signatures concerning the issue of plant breeders' rights. The group holds very strong views about the subject. It is concerned about the proposed legislation, which will restrict free growing and the exchange and sale of non-chemically treated seeds, and believes that a decline in the genetic diversity of plants was evidenced in Europe following the implementation of such legislation. The group believes that it is important that this issue be canvassed in full scale public debate. I believe that the group would argue that there are several reasons why the plant breeders' rights legislation ought to be opposed. It would argue, firstly, that seeds are a public resource; secondly, that seed patenting effectively allows large corporations to control seed production and sales; and, thirdly, that germ plasm, the basic seed used in breeding programs, is hoarded by these corporations and exchanges of seed and scientific information slow down. I believe that this point of view that this group is seeking to disseminate is important. I think it is unfortunate that sometimes all the work that goes into collecting signatures for petitions is given such brief attention in the House. I just wanted to place on record in the time available the fact that this group had done the work and that there were so many signatures on the petition and to draw attention to the substance of the petition.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I wish to speak on comments made during the adjournment debate by the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Fisher) who highlighted the need for computer technology as a tool for efficient government administration. At the outset I want to say that I wholeheartedly endorse his sentiments. I thank him very much indeed for a thoughtful contribution to the adjournment debate. It is always good when someone raises his thought to matters of national importance rather than parish pump activities. My Department of course has immense communication and administration requirements which have made its computer purchase essential. I agree with the honourable member that criticism of computers fails to appreciate the tremendously important role they play and the importance of the link between the central and regional facilities in any computer network.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In regard to my own Department the Government decided on the successful tenderer for the supply of its equipment after the Department's own very thorough evaluation process had been reviewed by an expert interdepartmental committee on the technical and procurement aspects of the purchase and later on by an independent assessor, Professor C. H. Brookes. These studies confirmed the original finding that the substantially higher technical risks associated with alternative solutions could not be accepted, The Government is satisfied that the expert reviews carried out have ensured the best possible solution to meet the needs of the Department of Housing and Construction. </PARA>
<PARA> Assertions have been made that the Government had changed its tendering criteria and my colleague the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman) has previously refuted this allegation and commented on procurement principles. Perhaps the most extensive refutation of these allegations comes from the Australian General Manager of Sperry Univac-an unsuccessful tender. The Melbourne branch manager of that company was quoted as being critical of the tendering process. The Australian General Manager of that company inserted an advertisement at his company's expense the following week completely refuting those claims. The Australian General Manager has said he is the only person who can authorise official media releases for the company. The official media release includes the statement:</PARA>
<PARA> Over the past few months views have been expressed in reports by the media concerning a tender for the data processing requirements for the Department of Housing and Construction, Canberra, culminating in comments and statements made in a report on page 1 of the Pacific Computer Weekly of 23-29 January 1981. All official media releases for my company are authorised from the General Manager's Office at Sperry Univac. As the abovementioned comments that were published were not authorised by me, I must refute the opinons and statements so published on this subject. Sperry Univac's association with governments, both Federal and State, is conducted on a professional basis, with the supply of equipment and services to them being of the highest possible standard. At all times Sperry Univac has received the respected assistance, courtesy and advice from all government departments. We have always found the actions of various government members to be of the highest professional standard. </PARA>
<PARA> As honourable members will be aware, there have been many attempts to criticise my Department's computer purchase. Attempts were made on 8 September 1980 at the House of Representatives Committee on Expenditure; in this chamber on three occasions during September 1980; and in the Pacific Computer Weekly of 23-29 January 1981. I regret to say that in this chamber today yet another attempt was made to criticise that purchase and to criticise and question the integrity of the Public Service and the tendering processes which were followed in the computer procurement. I hope that this restatement of the facts will put these unfounded allegations to rest once and for all. I resent the aspersions cast on the integrity of officers of my Department who are men of outstanding ability, honesty and sincerity of purpose. These aspersions were cast earlier today by the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren). </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZS7">Mr Thomson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Financial assistance was first provided under the Assistance to Inventors Scheme in 1975-76. To 31 December 1980 a total of 50 inventors grants had been made under the scheme amounting in aggregate to $225,776. A review of the progress of the individual grant-assisted inventions revealed:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Eight of the inventions are currently in production with aggregate sales in 1980-81 estimated to amount to $500,000;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Ten of the inventions have been advanced to the stage where they are considered ready for commercial production and the involvement of appropriate manufacturers is actively being sought;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Twenty-seven of the inventions are still under development with a view to their eventual commercial production; and</PARA>
<PARA> (d) Five of the inventions have been found not to be viable and their further development abandoned.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Assistance to Inventors Scheme provides for grant assistance to enable the development of worthy patentable inventions to the stage where the technical feasibility can be established and the potential usefulness demonstrated in practice. This primarily involves assistance to finance the construction and testing of a demonstration prototype.</PARA>
<PARA> The basic rationale underlying the Scheme is that at this stage the inventor should be in a position to both lodge a complete patent specification and to pursue commercialisation of the invention by, say, entering into an arrangement with an appropriate manufacturer. No direct assistance is provided under the Scheme in respect of the subsequent stages involved in obtaining commercial results from grant-assisted inventions.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government does however recognise the need for sound and responsible policies to promote the commercialisation of Australian invention. It has implemented a number of pilot innovation programs which, together with the Assistance to Inventors Scheme, will provide a base of practical experience on which to evaluate longer term policy options for the realisation of the full industrial and employment benefits of Australian inventiveness.</PARA>
<PARA> Assistance is made available under the pilot innovation programs for the following measures directed at facilitating the realisation of commerical results from developed inventions:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Establishment, in conjunction with State Chambers of Manufactures, of 'Innovation Centres' to promote greater interaction between private inventors and manufacturers;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Organisation, in conjunction with interested Australian companies and academic institutions, of 'Adventure Workshops in Innovation and Entrepreneurship' designed to provide the opportunity for selected Australian graduates to develop the entrepreneurial skills required to progress an invention to the market; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Investigation, under the 'Pilot Enterprise Development Program', of practical means for providing access by private inventors to the full spectrum of expertise required to develop and implement strategies for the creation of new technology-based firms.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The commercial results arising from grant-assisted inventions, as indicated in (1) above, are considered to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of funds which have been made available for the Assistance to Inventors Scheme. To this extent the Government is satisfied with the results that have flowed from the Scheme. The Government is however concerned to ensure the improved administrative effectiveness of the Scheme. In this respect, the following measures were set out in the schedule of decisions arising from the Review of Commonwealth Functions tabled by the Prime Minister on 30 April 1981:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Administration of the Scheme to be streamlined;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Abolition of the Australian Inventions Advisory Committee; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Review of the Scheme by persons from the private sector.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am informed by my Department that-</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of the Capital Territory has consulted with officers of the Capital Territory Health Commission and the ACT Schools Authority and advises in respect to question (1) that there are no grants, loans or concessions made on the basis of matching allocations from other Departments by the Department of the Capital Territory, the Commission or the Authority for the purposes listed.</PARA>
<PARA> Consequently there can be no answer to question (2).</PARA>
<PARA> There are however arrangements in the ACT whereby community organisations seek and obtain assistance along comparable lines to assistance provided to such organisations by governments in the States.</PARA>
<PARA> It is generally the practice for community organisations to apply for assistance direct to the Commonwealth Government Department or Authority responsible for that particular matter. There are nine such Departments and Authorities which make grants to ACT community organisations for a wide range of activities.</PARA>
<PARA> The grants made by these Departments and Authorities over the last five financial years were provided in answer to question No. 4541 in 1979. Since then and following consultations with other Ministers, the Department of the Capital Territory has established an Interdepartmental Committee to act as a clearing house. This Committee provides the opportunity for the exchange of information and expertise on applications for grants which are being considered by these Departments and Authorities. These arrangements should facilitate co-ordination and rationalisation of grants to ACT organisations.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZS7">Mr Thomson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Veterans' Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. Prior to the decision to close the Rosemount Repatriation Hospital being taken and announced, a number of discussions took place between senior officers of my department, ex-service and employee organisations and others. Apart from some concern about a few points, there was general acceptance that transfer of the functions to the Repatriation General Hospital, Greenslopes, would be for the benefit of patients.</PARA>
<PARA> Since the closure was announced, discussions have taken place with a wider range of organisations, particularly the ex-service organisations and the Queensland Branch of the Hospital Employees' Federation, as well as patients and their relatives. The proposed closure has been widely publicised and all interested parties have had the opportunity to present their views to my Department or direct to myself.</PARA>
<PARA> Many different issues have been raised in the discussions about the closure of Rosemount Repatriation Hospital and have ranged across such topics as the placement of individual patients and the future use of the property and its facilities. These discussions are continuing and many of the issues will not be decided until the transfer of the functions of Rosemount Repatriation Hospital to the Repatriation General Hospital, Greenslopes, is about to, or has taken place. On present indications this will be in late May 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Currently, the Rosemount Repatriation Hospital has some 60 beds available for use. When this hospital is closed, two wards, each of 32 beds, will be opened at Repatriation General Hospital, Greenslopes. These beds will be available as promptly and in the same way as beds have been available at Rosemount.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The functions and staff ceiling resources of Rosemount Repatriation Hospital will be transferred to the Repatriation General Hospital, Greenslopes. The treatment provided to patients will be improved as a direct result of the clinical supervision and services available at an acute-care general hospital and there will be no diminution of attention to individual patients and their families.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Government is pursuing policies for manufacturing industry which will encourage and enable firms to take advantage of opportunities presented by the upsurge in Australia's resource development.</PARA>
<PARA> It is not for the Government to take steps to guarantee that the local mining equipment industry plays a greater part in the expansion of the coal industry, or for that matter any other mining industry, but rather to ensure the existence of an environment in which the manufacturers of mining equipment may themselves seize opportunities of the kind alluded to in the Board's report.</PARA>
<PARA> Central to this approach are the Government's policies to encourage the development of competitive manufacturing industries involving specialisation in particular skills and products and use of advanced technology.</PARA>
<PARA> In the case of the mining equipment industry, assistance is available via the tariff. In addition a number of generally available measures such as the investment allowance and the Industrial Research and Development Incentives Scheme can be of help to manufacturers seeking to improve their production processes and keep pace with technological advances to maintain international competitiveness.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BU4">Mr Anthony</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for National Development and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The issues identified in NEAC Report No. 9 Liquid Fuels: Longer Term Needs, Prospects and Issues were further developed, as they relate to alternative liquid fuels, in NEAC Report No. 12 Alternative Liquid Fuels. This report, which was released on 2 February 1981, recommends that the Government should vigorously encourage the development of alternative liquid fuels, but that commercial criteria should be applied to any decision to produce these fuels on a significant scale. The Government's fundamental responsibility in the development of alternative liquid fuels is seen as being to ensure an investment climate conducive to the commercial development of such fuels by the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has already introduced policies which are consistent with this approach. These policies include the following elements:</PARA>
<PARA> Pricing-The Government has a policy of pricing indigenous conventional crude oil to refiners at the import parity price, which is ased on the official price of Saudi Arabian Light Crude oil. As a consequence of this policy, the products of synthetic fuel plants will be competing against conventional petroleum products whose prices are based on the import parity price for crude oil.</PARA>
<PARA> Tax-Synfuels industries would be eligible for existing tax concessions, which include the following (rates shown are those proposed in the Prime Minister's Parliamentary Statement of 30 April 1981):</PARA>
<PARA> the general 18 per cent investment allowance;</PARA>
<PARA> the 18 per cent loading on depreciation allowances on eligible plant ordered after 19 August 1980; and</PARA>
<PARA> concessions to mining industries for exploration and development insofar as applicable to exploration and development of coal, oil shale, natural gas or other minerals used as feedstocks for synfuel processes.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the Government has removed excise from ethanol and LPG used for transport fuel.</PARA>
<PARA> Foreign Investment-The Commonwealth has a well established and clearly stated foreign investment policy which welcomes foreign investment in Australia because of the contribution it makes to the development of Australia's industries and resources. The policy seeks to encourage foreign investment on a basis that recognises the needs and aspirations of Australians. The Government considers that Australians should have opportunities, wherever practicable, to participate with foreign investors in major projects.</PARA>
<PARA> Loan Council/Infrastructure Finance-In June 1978, the Australian Loan Council introduced a special category of loan programs for semi-government authorities to facilitate the planning and implementation of major projects of importance for development, with financing requirements which could not be accommodated within normal programs.</PARA>
<PARA> Environment-The Commonwealth has well established and clear requirements for assessing environmental impacts of proposals which involve the application of Commonwealth powers. This permits early identification and resolution of the environmental problems of any major development, including alternative liquid fuels projects.</PARA>
<PARA> Research and Development-The Government funds a wide variety of investigations into various alternative fuels under NERDDC. So far, over $15 million have been committed to synfuels research under this program.</PARA>

<PARA> How many small businesses went bankrupt or were liquidated in each of the financial years from 1972-1973 to 1979-1980 inclusive.</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2367" SPEAKER="Moore The Hon J.C." NAMEID="EI4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="MACQUARIE">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EI4">Mr Moore</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Neither the bankruptcy legislation nor the companies legislation contains any definition of a small business. The existing statistical information available in relation to individual and corporate insolvencies has not been collected in a way which would enable the presentation of statistics on the basis of any meaningful distinction based on the size of the business.</PARA>
<PARA> The annual report on the operation of the Bankruptcy Act now contains statistics on the number of business bankruptcies, which are defined as 'bankruptcies of employers and persons engaged in a trade, business or profession on their own account' (the remaining bankruptcies are treated as non-business bankruptcies).</PARA>
<PARA> The statistics of business bankruptcies as defined in these annual reports for the relevant period are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> 1972-73-n.a.</PARA>
<PARA> 1973-74-n.a.</PARA>
<PARA> 1974-75-1,252</PARA>

<PARA> 1976-77-1,270</PARA>
<PARA> 1977-78-1,752</PARA>
<PARA> 1978-79-1,986</PARA>
<PARA> 1979-80-2,530</PARA>
<PARA> In considering these statistics the following points should be borne in mine:</PARA>
<PARA> Statistics for 1972-73 and 1973-74 are not available in a form which would enable reliable infomation to be given.</PARA>
<PARA> The term 'bankruptcy' is used to refer to a matter that has been the subject of a separate debtor's petition or creditor's petition. It is possible to present a single petition covering two or more partners or joint debtors. For example, in the ACT, New South Wales and Victoria for the period of 1 January to 30 June 1979 there were 941 bankruptcies and 1,136 bankrupts.</PARA>
<PARA> The figures in this table refer to petitions under Part IV of the Bankruptcy Act. They do not cover Part X or Part XI matters.</PARA>
<PARA> Most liquidations of bodies corporate are carried out under the winding up provisions of the companies legislation of each State and Territory. Liquidations commenced under the ACT Companies Ordinance during the financial years 1972-73 to 1979-80 were as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Financial</PARA>
<PARA>Members' Creditor's year</PARA>
<PARA>voluntary voluntary Court</PARA>
<PARA>1972-73  n.a. 2 6 1973-74  n.a. 6 14 1974-75  n.a. 22 11 1975-76  76 14 10 1976-77  98 14 14 1977-78  192 26 20 1978-79  133 25 19 1979-80  208 25 18</PARA>
<PARA> In interpreting these figures the following points may be of assistance to the honourable member:</PARA>
<PARA> As is obvious the majority of liquidations are categorised as 'members' voluntary'. All liquidations so categorised relate to companies that are solvent. Some are indicative of group rationalisations rather than company failures.</PARA>
<PARA> The other two categories of liquidations normally relate to companies that are unable to pay their debts as they become due.</PARA>
<PARA> These figures do not indicate the liquidations of 'foreign companies' operating in the ACT.</PARA>
<PARA> Particulars of these liquidations would be held in the home jurisdiction of the body corporate concerned and would be the responsibility of the appropriate State Minister.</PARA>
<PARA> The figures do not distinguish between ACT incorporate companies operating within the ACT and those operating elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA> It is estimated that a substantial number of ACT incorporated companies do not operate in the Territory.</PARA>
<PARA> The figures do not distinguish between companies that conduct a small business, companies that conduct a large business, or companies that do not conduct any business at all. For example, some companies are investment companies.</PARA>
<PARA> Many company failures are not represented by liquidations but by companies struck off the register of companies by the Registrar pursuant to section 308 of the Companies Ordinance.</PARA>
<PARA> These companies have ceased to operate or to carry on business. Normally they have lost all of their assets and frequently have substantial liabilities. There are generally no parties interested in instigating liquidation proceedings as there are no assets which could be realised for the purpose of paying a dividend.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5E4">Mr Sinclair</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) There are some 400,000 subscribers in Western Australia connected to automatic exchanges from which STD is available. While precise figures are not kept, around 12,000 have elected to have their services barred from STD. There is a charge of $3 per annum involved.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Telecom Australia provides the international subscribers dialling service only to those subscribers who apply to be connected to such a service.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Advances in technology are enabling Telecom to introduce a system known as Call Charge Record (CCR) which will automatically record details of subscriber dialled international calls. That is, Telecom will be in a position to provide customers with the same degree of accountability on ISD calls that is currently provided with operator connected trunk or international calls. In other words, Telecom is automating an already existing facility.</PARA>
<PARA> Should any subscriber wish to take less than full advantage of the telephone service, there is a standard fee of $3 per annum which will ensure that access from the service is restricted in a prescribed way. The provision of access barring facilities involves clerical costs in processing the application, the equipment installation itself and continuing maintenance checks to ensure the correct operation of the facility. Telecom advises that the fee of $3 per annum does not cover these costs.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GH4">Mr Hunt</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The private housing rent component of the Consumer Price Index increased by 71 per cent between the December quarters of 1974 and 1980 and the government housing component by 198 per cent. However, on average, government rents are still much lower than private rents, as shown by the recently published Australian Bureau of Statistics Survey of Housing Occupancy and Costs, Australia, August 1980, which estimated that, at the survey date, the average weekly rent of houses in State capital cities was $32.43 in the case of government landlords and $56.17 in the case of private landlords (other than the individual's employer).</PARA>
<PARA> (2) These rent levels are determined by the Queensland Housing Commission. Recent policy is that they be market-related. It is my understanding that the rents quoted by the honourable member are broadly correct and reflect rents charged by the Commission for three-bedroom houses.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The level of supplementary assistance is determined in relation to other priorities in the Budget context. Although changes in rent levels are a factor to be considered in assessing the levels of this supplement for rent paying pensioners with little or no private income, it should be noted that pensioners and beneficiaries who are tenants of State-Housing Commissions may avail themselves of the assistance provided by those authorities by way of rental rebates or rent reductions.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) I am advised by my Department that action has been taken by the ACT Advisory Committee for IYDP to encourage the involvement of all parts of our community in assisting disabled persons and is already well advanced. This has included, with the co-operation of the Confederation of ACT Industry, fostering of awareness and support of IYDP by way of an employer education programme directed to some 1,400 outlets. On an even broader plane through the Advisory Committee's Newsletter 'Delta', organisations and individuals are being encouraged to develop projects designed to assist disabled persons and to seek advice and assistance where that is needed.</PARA>
<PARA> The Assistance to Inventors Scheme administered by my colleague the Minister for Science and Technology, serves as an excellent means of encouraging individual initiative and provides for financial assistance, by way of a grant, of up to $10,000 for development of any one project including the support and testing of prototypes of inventions. Aids to assist disabled persons are covered by this scheme.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) A number of requests have been received by the Advisory Committee Secretariat in recent months for funding to assist the development of innovative projects aimed at assisting disabled persons in the ACT community-surveillance devices to safeguard autistic children, alarms to assist blind and visually impaired people crossing traffic intersections and a wheelchair with special features, for the physically disabled. A grant of $700 has already been paid to the autistic Children's Association of the ACT under a Special Childrens' Services Programme allocation to mark IYDP, to assist the development of various items of prototype equipment. A number of other inventions are being examined by the Advisory Committee for possible funding.</PARA>

<PARA> The increase in prices paid for northside land reflects the market demand for an increasingly scarce commodity as the number of sites that could be offered for lease decreased. On the other hand the fluctuation in prices for southside land has occurred when less attractive sites with lower reserve prices have been offered for sale.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) On present indications it is expected that about 2,000 standard residential leases will be offered for sale during 1980-81. Apart from about sixty blocks on the northside of Canberra, this land is all located on the southside of Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Reserve prices are fixed to recover overall the cost of providing serviced sites. Since no major contracts for residential land servicing have been let since 1976, it is difficult to predict trends in costs, but because of inflation it must be expected that the reserve prices placed on sites will move upwards for both northside and southside land.</PARA>

<PARA> I am informed by my Department that the price of petroleum products was subject to price control in the Australian Capital Territory as at both 30 June 1975 and 30 June 1976. The prescribed maximum retail prices for premium grade petrol at those dates were as follows:</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BU4">Mr Anthony</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) and (3) The generally accepted view among aluminium indusry experts is that the United States aluminium market has a considerable influence on the fortunes of the aluminium industry throughout the world, including the international alumina market. However, it would be misleading to attribute the decision by Alcoa of Australia directly to a short-term downturn in United States demand for aluminium. According to a spokesman from Alcoa of Australia the decision was due to a softening of the international alumina market.</PARA>
<PARA> Commodity markets are normally subject to cyclical influences on demand. In 1979 there was a marked world shortage of aluminium which resulted in a rapid run down of producers' stocks. Throughout 1980 stocks were replenished to normal levels. These influences resulted in aluminium producers running smelters at high capacity and alumina producers streamlining production facilities to produce additional tonnage. The current alumina over-supply, which is likely to persist into 1982 is partly a result of the above chain of events and partly a result of failure of the metal market to sustain growth projections in the short term.</PARA>
<PARA> Alcoa's decision is the result of the company's commercial judgement. According to the company's thinking, there would be little point in hastening such a project to completion before the market has returned to optimum conditions.</PARA>
<PARA> I am not aware of other projects which may be delayed because of market factors. Taking both demand and supply factors into account, it is confidently predicted that the outlook for Australia's alumina and aluminium remains quite favourable and that any delays in completion of projects will be temporary. It is interesting to reflect that the construction of the Alcoa Pinjarra refinery was also undertaken in a situation of market downturn, but subsequent recovery in demand fully accommodated the tonnage produced.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Current indications are that both the U.S. and Japanese aluminium demand are expected to grow at about 5 per cent per annum over the coming decade although yearly variations are almost certain.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) I am informed that alumina spot prices are substantially below levels of 12 months ago. However, the spot market comprises only a small proportion of the total trade: by far the greater part of our alumina production is sold under long term contracts and here increased price levels have been evident. Aluminium prices on the free market are currently about 90 per cent of the world producer price, but again the proportion of aluminium sold on free markets is small. In the medium term, aluminium prices are expected to increase at above general inflation rates.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) My Department receives a representative selection of aluminium trade literature. In addition, my Department is able to supplement this information through bilateral trade relations and Australian membership of the International Bauxite Association, through the network of Departmental representatives overseas and through frequent contact with the Australian aluminium industry.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Veterans' Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) A veteran responsible for the care of orphaned grandchildren cannot claim the dependant's pension for such children. Repatriation legislation provides that only the children or adopted children of an incapacitated veteran are eligible to be granted children's dependant's pension.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) There are three basic rates of disability pension payable to veterans under the Repatriation Act 1920: The General Rate, the Intermediate Rate, and the Special (T. &amp; P.I.) Rate. The maximum dependant's pension of $4.05 per week for a wife and $1.35 for a child is payable at a level commensurate with the incapacity of a eteran. The 10 per cent assessment means that incapacity has been assessed at 10 per cent of the maximum 100 per cent General Rate. The allowance of 14 cents per child per week is 10 per cent of the maximum rate payable to a child for a veteran.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) (b) Applicants for emergency housing fall into two separate categories. The true emergency group comprise of applicants who demonstrate an inability to accommodate themselves that night in any way whatsoever, eg. because their home has been destroyed by fire. These few genuine emergency applicants can be accommodated on the same day. Other successful applicants for what is called emergency housing are those who can demonstrate that their circumstances are such that they would suffer undue hardship if required to wait out their time on the normal housing waiting period and therefore that an advance allocation ahead of all others on the normal waiting list is justified. These applicants, who are really applicants for priority housing, are generally housed within a period of four to six weeks.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Apart from a general requirement that applicants for emergency housing must meet the eligibility criteria for entry to the normal waiting list for government rental housing, there are no set criteria which emergency housing applicants necessarily must meet.

Principal recommendations are that local industry undertake the design, development, manufacture, sale and support of a basic trainer, and that for the advanced trainer, now required in a later time frame, discussions continue with selected overseas companies on the various possibilities for collaboration. The project definition phase of the basic trainer project commenced in July 1980 and subject to satisfactory progress and further Government approvals the aircraft should enter production.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr Howard</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Finance has provided the following answer to the honourable member's questions:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The original 1980-81 appropriations made for my department for Division 304-Administrative, and for Divisions for other departments, were those presented to the Parliament in Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1980-81. The proposals, while in broad terms based on estimates submitted by departments, followed Government consideration of those estimates in the light of its policies in respect of particular areas of expenditure and of general financial and economic objectives.</PARA>
<PARA> The general principles applied to the preparation of estimates by departments and authorities are set out in the Directions issued by the Secretary of the Department of Finance under the authority of the Audit Act 1901. These Directions are long standing and have been endorsed by successive Governments. The relevant general principles are set out in Finance Direction 6.3 and provide in essence that:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) Estimates shall represent a realistic assessment of the sums expected to be spent and shall be based on current or known costs. Items of a recurring nature may be estimated on the basis of experience.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) Estimates shall not include amounts in respect of proposals which are so far from firm that it is not possible to form any real estimate of what payment, if any, will be made.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Department of Finance Information Paper, 'Statement of Savings Expected in Annual Appropriations made by Acts Nos 141 and 142-Appropriation Acts (Nos 1 and 2) 1980-81', sets out amounts by which departments estimated, at the time of preparation of the Appropriation Bills (Nos 3 and 4) 1980-81, expenditure under the appropriation items concerned would at 30 June 1981 fall short of the appropriation originally made. What actual underspending will occur in respect of those or other items cannot be stated with certainty at this stage. The estimated savings would reflect for the most part the following circumstances:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) current expectation that events would not occur by 30 June 1981, in cases where financial provisions had been made in the Appropriation Acts (Nos 1 and 2) 1980-81 in the then expectation that they would occur by that date;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) compliance with Government policy that, as far as practicable, savings be offered as offsets to additional funds sought in the Appropriation Bills (Nos 3 and 4) 1980-81; and</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) the results of efforts by departmental management to improve efficiency and thereby reduce costs.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I have seen reports that the Administration is seeking to repeal the 1976 Clark Amendment which bans aid for the purpose of conducting military and para-military operations to groups or individuals in Angola except under certain precise conditions. The Administration has said that it seeks repeal on principle because the amendment is a restriction on executive authority.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) I have seen reports to this effect.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) and (4) The United States Administration has said that its policy towards South Africa is under review. President Reagan's nominee for the position of Under Secretary of State for African Affairs, Mr Chester Crocker, has recently visited a number of countries in Europe and Africa, including Angola, for discussions as part of that review. Until the results of the review have been announced, it is not possible to judge what effects any new United States policy might have, but the Government notes that in testimony to the United States Senate Foreign Relations Committee Mr Crocker said the United States Government did not intend to 'destabilize' the Government of Angola. The Australian Government recognises the MPLA as the Government of Angola. We have consistently deplored South African military intervention in Angola. South Africa's continued illegal occupation of Namibia has contributed dramatically to the heightening of tension along the border between Angola and Namibia. South Africa has mounted a number of raids into Angola allegedly against SWAPO positions which have caused direct contact between Angolan and South African armed forces. South African actions in Angola have been condemned by the United Nations Security Council which in June 1980 passed Resolution 465 (180) dealing with this question.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government regrets the suffering and loss of life which resulted from South African incursions. It considers the raids to be a violation of the principle of the mutual respect for the territorial integrity of all states. The Government also believes that the raids have contributed to the difficulties confronting the negotiations on the UN/Western plan for a peaceful settlement to the issue of independence for Namibia.</PARA>

Prior to November 1976 a means test applied which took into account income and a notional value of property. Between October 1972 and November 1976 the limit of income and notional value of property for the payment of a maximum rate of invalid pension was $20.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) If the figure of $20 was increased by the movement in seasonally adjusted average weekly earnings between the December quarter 1972 and the December quarter 1980 (the latest available), the new figure would be $56.50.</PARA>

This incorporated the UK Hazchem Code system which provides for a placard display externally on all vehicles carrying dangerous goods, giving information to emergency services on the immediate actions to be taken in the event of a mishap.</PARA>
<PARA> State and Commonwealth Governments have agreed to implement the new Code on a uniform basis throughout Australia as a matter of priority and each Government has the responsibility for bringing this about in the manner it considers appropriate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Internationally, marine turtles are considered to be threatened with extinction largely as a result of past uncontrolled commercial exploitation. Australian territorial waters contain some of the largest populations of marine turtles remaining in the world and the Government acknowledges its responsibility for ensuring these endangered species are adequately protected and managed in such a manner that will assure their long-term conservation.</PARA>
<PARA> The Third Meeting of Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) held recently in New Delhi, considered and adopted Australian proposals to include two Australian species of marine turtle on Appendix I to the Convention. This has resulted in all marine turtles being listed on Appendix I to the Convention thereby prohibiting international commercial trade in products derived from them.</PARA>
<PARA> Torres Strait Islanders have traditionally hunted marine turtles for food and subsistence. The Torres Strait between Australia and Papua New Guinea, while protecting the traditional way of life, including traditional fishing, also allows for the adoption of conservation measures in respect of endangered or threatened wildlife. The Government is concerned to ensure that its obligations under this Treaty and CITES are honoured.</PARA>
<PARA> Following the closure of turtle farming activities in Torres Strait by Applied Ecology Pty Ltd, the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service engaged the Queensland National Parks and Wildlife Service to undertake a pilot study. The objectives of this study are:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 30 April 1981 (Hansard, page 1807) Mr Cunningham asked me a question, without notice, concerning hospital insurance cover for confinements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Health funds generally have waiting periods not exceeding two months before basic medical and basic hospital benefits are paid to a new contributor. Basic medical benefits currently cover at least 75% of the Schedule medical fees with a maximum patient contribution of $10 where the Schedule fee is charged. From 1 September 1981 the basic table will cover 85% of the Schedule fees (with $10 maximum patient contribution). Basic hospital benefits provide full cover to the equivalent of the cost of shared ward accommodation in a public hospital (currently $50 a day). From 1 September, while the charges may increase, full cover for shared ward accommodation will remain.</PARA>
<PARA> Other exclusions from benefits such as for pre-existing conditions are not permitted for basic levels of benefits. This means that persons joining a health fund now, including obstetric cases, would be entitled to basic benefits after two months.</PARA>
<PARA> Because of the new arrangements to be introduced from 1 September 1981, and the changed circumstances that will apply to many people, health funds will be required to waive the waiting period for basic benefits for new members joining between 1 September and 31 October 1981. This is to allow people adequate time to make insurance arrangements so as not to be disadvantaged because of waiting periods that would otherwise apply.</PARA>
<PARA> People seeking higher insurance cover e.g. 100% medical and higher levels of hospital accommodation, generally are subject to further exclusions on the additional benefits (nine months waiting periods for obstetric cases, exclusions for pre-existing conditions, maximum benefits etc).</PARA>

<PARA> The following is in answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA>
<PARA> In accordance with the offshore petroleum legislation, royalties are assessed on the wellhead value which is determined by deducting from the selling price certain costs involved in the processing and transportation of the oil from the offshore platform to the selling point. Payments of crude oil excise are also deducted. Where crude oil excise is not payable, the wellhead value will be higher and royalty payments accordingly greater. The legislation provides for basic royalties to be shared 40 per cent to the Commonwealth and 60 per cent to the States.</PARA>
<PARA> The current arrangments for determining wellhead value in regard to Bass Strait production were agreed by the Commonwealth and Victoria. This joint approach will continue under the revised offshore petroleum arrangements when they become effective under the offshore constitutional settlement, but in the event of any irreconcilable difference the Commonwealth will have the final say.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) (a) During the period 1977-78, 1978-79 no specific sum was appropriated for coastal surveillance. Funds were included in appropriations to cover the total operations of my Department. In 1979-80 an amount of $1.5m was appropriated under Division 655/2/21 to finance the cost of evaluating Nomad aircraft for a role in coastal surveillance. No other funds were specifically appropriated.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The amounts actually spent on coastal surveillance are reflected in various items of Divisions 655/1 and 655/2 e.g. salaries, overtime, communications, etc. No expenditure was incurred under Division 655/2/21.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Except for Division 655/2/21 expenditure under each item attributable to coastal surveillance has not been determined because of the relatively minor nature of the coastal surveillance program compared with other Departmental activities. However an assessment of costs is being undertaken as part of the Government review of the coastal surveillance program.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 3 March 1981:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Has his attention been drawn to a State Emergency Service report on the damage resulting from a severe hailstorm which struck the North Brisbane bayside suburbs of Brighton and Sandgate on 16 December 1980.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) If so, did the report describe the storm as Queensland's worst natural disaster to that date since the formation of the State Emergency Service in 1975.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Was any request received by him from the Queensland Premier for assistance from the Commonwealth Government for relief aid following that hailstorm.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Was it necessary for the Queensland Premier to declare the area adversely affected by the storm a disaster area, before the Commonwealth Government would provide special assistance.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) With respect to the Commonwealth Government's undertaking to meet on a dollar for dollar basis State expenditures on standard measures for the immediate relief of personal hardship and distress, as referred to on page 79 of Budget Paper No. 7, 1980-81, (a) what are regarded as standard measures, (b) must the State Government request assistance before it is given, (c) has assistance been provided to the Queensland State Government for (i) the Brighton hailstorm relief, (ii) North Queensland flood relief and (iii) Dalby flood relief.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) How many declared natural disasters have occurred in each State and Territory in each year since 1940, and in each case what sum has the Commonwealth contributed by way of disaster relief assistance.</PARA>

<PARA> (9) Has his attention been drawn to the report in the Courier Mail, 16 February 1981, in which the Queensland Premier is quoted as saying that the present disaster relief arrangements with the Federal Government do not cover disasters like the Brighton storm; if so, is there any substance to this claim.</PARA>
<PARA> (10) Is it a fact that once a State Government passes its prescribed base expenditure for natural disasters before the end of a financial year, the Commonwealth Government is obliged to contribute toward the total cost of disaster relief.</PARA>
<PARA> (11) Is it also a fact that when a State Government expends in relief aid on any one disaster in excess of one tenth of its prescribed base expenditure for natural disasters, the Commonwealth is obliged to contribute towards relief measures on a $3 for $1 basis.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2393" SPEAKER="Fraser The Rt Hon J.M." NAMEID="QS4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="LILLEY">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QS4">Mr Malcolm Fraser</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) In the days immediately following the storm, the Commonwealth received, through the Natural Disasters Organisation, regular situation reports from the Queensland State Emergency Service on the damage and the emergency relief operations, along with requests for Defence Force equipment and personnel to assist in the relief operations. Defence Force assistance was provided as requested. Other State Emergency Service reports are prepared for and used by the State and are not necessarily forwarded to the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Yes. Commonwealth assistance was, in any case, available to the State under existing natural disaster relief arrangements for a range of measures. Those applicable to the Brighton hailstorm and other similar occurrances were for relief of personal hardship and distress and for the restoration of public assets and emergency protection and repair work by State, local and semi-government authorities. The Queensland Premier advised the Commonwealth on 22 December 1980 of the implementation of these measures and sought agreement, for the purpose of determining Commonwealth assistance to the State under the arrangements, to variation of limits applicable in individual cases to certain of the measures for relief of personal hardship and distress. I replied in January 1981 indicating the Commonwealth's agreement to the new limits proposed.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The declaration of an area as a disaster area is solely a matter for the State Government. Commonwealth assistance for natural disaster relief is not contingent on a State making such a declaration.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) (a) Standard measures for the relief of personal hardship and distress under the natural disaster relief arrangements comprise:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) provision of emergency food</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) provision of emergency clothing</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) provision of emergency accommodation</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) essential repairs to houses to make them habitable and secure</PARA>
<PARA> (v) repair and replacement of essential items of furniture and personal effects</PARA>
<PARA>These measures are restricted to people in needy circumstances as a result of a disaster.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) (b) Not in respect of the standard measures.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) (c) (i), (ii) and (iii) Assistance has been provided in respect of claims made by the State Government in relation to these and other disasters.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) The natural disaster relief arrangements are not designed to provide assistance to a State on a disaster-by-disaster basis, but rather to assist a State in meeting the cost of natural disaster relief assistance provided during a year when it goes beyond the amount originally set to reflect the State's financial capacity. Accordingly, information in the form sought is not readily available. Details of Commonwealth assistance to individual States under the natural disaster relief arrangements are available in 1980-81 Budget Paper No. 7 (pp 79-80, 139-141) and in earlier issues of this Budget Paper.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) It is not possible to assess from the information available to the Commonwealth whether Queensland suffers more from natural disasters than any other State. Such an assessment would depend not only on the frequency of disasters but also on the extent of damage, both to property and individuals, caused by disasters, not all of which would attract Commonwealth assistance.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) When the present arrangements were established in 1978, provision was made for regular reviews. On 4 March 1981 I announced that I had written to all State Premiers and the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory proposing that officials consult on a review of the current arrangements to enable consideration at the June 1981 Premiers' Conference. Prior to the announcement of the review, several Premiers, including Mr Bjelke-Petersen, had written to me indicating dissatisfaction with aspects of the arrangements as they affected their States.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) As indicated in (5) above, the Brighton hailstorm has already attracted Commonwealth assistance in respect of the immediate relief of personal hardship and distress. Expenditure by Queensland on longer-term relief and restoration measures that is in accord with the terms and conditions of the natural disaster relief arrangements would be eligible to attract Commonwealth assistance. Additionally, as was indicated in (1) and (2) above, Defence Force assistance was provided immediately following the storm to meet urgent State requests for manpower and equipment for the emergency relief and restoration operations.</PARA>
<PARA> (10) and (11) The Commonwealth contributes, on a $3 for $1 basis, to the cost of State expenditures on approved relief and restoration measures (including measures for the relief of personal hardship and distress) in excess of the State's base amount where such expenditures are in respect of a 'major' disaster, A 'major' disaster is, for this purpose, defined as a disaster in respect of which State expenditure on approved measures exceeds one-tenth of the State's base amount. Where a disaster is not a 'major' disaster and/or the State has not exceeded its base amount, State expenditures on approved measures for the relief of personal hardship and distress attract Commonwealth assistance on a $ for $ basis. Further information can be found in 1980-81 Budget Paper No. 7 (pages 79-80).</PARA>
<PARA> (12) The conditions under which Commonwealth assistance in respect of a State's expenditure on the relief of personal hardship and distress is provided, are described in (5) and (11) above. The States are required to submit audited statements to certify expenditure in accordance with agreed measures of assistance for natural disaster relief and restoration.</PARA>
